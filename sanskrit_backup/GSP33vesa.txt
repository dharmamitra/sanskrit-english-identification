THE Vedāntasara is an easy and concise commentary
on the Brahmasūtra-s of Bādarāyaṇa who is believed
to be identical with Vyāsa, the famous author of the
Mahabharata. The Vedāntasāra was written by Bhagavad
Rāmānuja (A.D. 1017-1137) in accordance with the
views of the Visiṣṭādvaita school of Vedanta. Śrī
Rāmānuja was born at Sriperumbudur near Kanchi-
puram as the son of Keśavasomayājin and Bhūdevi.
He was a pupil of Mahāpūrṇa and a younger con-
temporary of Sri Yamunācārya of Srirangam. His
other works are: Śrībhāṣya, Bhagavadgitābhāṣya, Vedārtha-
samgraha, Vedantadipa, Gadyatraya and Nityagrantha.
Regarding the complete biography of Sri Ramanuja,
the attention of the readers is drawn to the Rāmānuja-
campū of Rāmānujācārya, published as No. 6 in the
Madras Govt. Oriental MSS. Series. His doctrine and
teaching have been fully dealt with by Prof. P. N.
Srinivasacharya in his book entitled The Philosophy of
Visiṣṭādvaita published as No. 39 in the Adyar Library
Series. This system was first expounded by Śrī
Nathamuni, developed to a great extent by Sri Yamunā-
cārya in his works and perfected by Sri Rāmānuja
in his works like the Sribhäsya, and the Vedarthasamgraha,
after refuting the contrary views of the opponents.vi
Perhaps this edition of the Vedāntasāra with English
translation is unique in its kind and I believe it will
render great and valuable service to research scholars
in their comparative and critical study of the Vedānta
philosophy.

V. KRISHNAMACHARYAINTRODUCTION
AFTER completing the course of study of the Veda-s, the
student should perform the rituals mentioned therein.
There are rules prescribed for their proper performance.
But in the Veda-s proper, these rules are not mentioned
at all. Therefore the student has to go to other works
for them. Consequently certain subsidiary works on
the rules of interpretation were composed by the sages
and the earliest of these works was the Mīmāmsāsūtrā-s
of Jaimini.
But these sutra-s were very short statements and
they could be interpreted in different ways; consequently
a number of commentators arose. They interpreted
these sutra-s differently. The performance of the rituals
mentioned therein grants only limited and transitory
results. Hence these Vedic scholars went in search
of other systems that could give unlimited and ever-
lasting results.
Bādarāyaṇa is the author of the Brahmasutra-s. He
has stated therein, on the authority of the Upanişad-s,
that the knowledge of Brahman leads to everlasting
benefits. Badarāyaṇa mentions the names
Asmarathya, Auḍulomi,
of
Bādari and Kāśakṛtsna to
show that they also were writers on the subject before
him.X
Certain occidental writers have placed the Sūtra
period in the second century B.C. Their one object
seems to have been to show to the world that the Indians
copied everything from Greek literature. But the Indian
writers have not mentioned the date of their composition
in any of their works. Hence it is not possible to
determine exactly when these sutra-s were composed.
But the general impression is that Bādarāyaṇa, who
is no other than Vyāsa, lived about 3101 в.c. i.e. the
beginning of the Kali age.
These sūtra-s, as already stated, are short and
cryptic statements. They can be interpreted in any
way the commentators liked. Hence they had a
number of commentators, Sri Samkara, Rāmānuja,
Pūrṇaprajña, Bhāskara, Nimbārka, Vallabha and
others. Each of these commentators interpreted the
sūtra-s in his own way differing from the others. At
times, a sūtra was split into two by certain commenta-
tors or some of the sutra-s were missing in certain
commentaries.
Śrī Rāmānuja has contributed nine works in
Sanskrit on the Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy. None of his
Tamil works is available so far. The Sanskrit works are
(1) Vedāntasāra, (2) Vedantadipa, (3) Sribhāṣya, 1(4) Gita-
bhāṣya, (5) Vedārthasamgraha, (6) Saraṇāgatigadya, (7)
Vaikunthagadya, (8) Srirangagadya and (9) Nityagrantha.
Of these, the Sribhasya is an elaborate commentary on
the Brahmasutra-s of Bādarāyaṇa. Vedāntasāra is a
very concise commentary on the same and Vedāntadipa
is a commentary in between these two.xi
In the introduction to his Vedāntadīpa, Śrī Rāmānuja
summarises the teachings of Vedānta to the following
effect: Of the three ultimate entities known to
philosophy, the intelligent individual soul is essentially
different from the non-intellgent matter and the
supreme Brahman. The essential differences thus exist-
ing between matter, soul and Brahman are intrinsic
and natural. God, who is the same as the supreme
Brahman, is the material and efficient cause of the
universe; and the universe, which is made up of matter
and soul, is the effect produced by Him. Matter and
souls form the body of God, and this body is capable of
existing in a subtle, as well as in a gross condition.
God with his subtle body constitutes the universe in
His causal condition; and with His gross body, He
forms the created universe itself. The individual souls
enter into matter and thereby make it live. Similarly
God enters into matter and soul and gives them their
powers and their specific characters. The universe
without God is exactly analogous to matter without
soul and in the world, as we know it, all things are
what they are, because God has penetrated into them
and rules and guides them all from within, so much
so that all things are representatives of Him and all
words denote Him in the main.
Śrī Rāmānuja has based his commentaries on the
following works: (1) Divyaprabandha of Sri Sathakopa;
(2) Siddhitraya (3) Agamaprāmanya and (4) Stotraratna
of Sri Yāmuna; and (5) Nyāyataltva and (6) Yogarahasya
of Śrī Nāthamuni. Of these the Divyaprabandha isxii
written in Tamil and the rest are all written in Sanskrit.
Further Śrī Nathamuni's works are not available now.
Certain special features can be noted in Śrī Rāmā-
nuja's works. Of all the Sanskrit commentators of the
Brahmasūtra-s, Rāmānuja is unique in one respect namely
he proved that the relation between Brahman on one
side and the souls and matter on the other, is that
between soul and body (śarīra-śarīribhāva) so that all the
scriptural texts on the bheda and abheda between them,
could be sensibly interpreted. In support of this view
he mentions Bodhāyana, Dramiḍa, Guha and Tanka
and others, who had lived before him and who had
written treatises on the Brahmasutra-s. He also states
in the Śrībhāsya that he has followed their teachings
in this work.
Śrī Rāmānuja' has held that the twelve chapters
of Pūrvamīmāmsā, four chapters of Samkarşakanda and
the four chapters of the Brahmasutra-s constitute one
system of philosophy. In support of this view, he has
quoted a passage from Bodhāyana thus : saṃhitametacchārīrakaṃ
jaiminīyena ṣoḍaśalakṣaṇeneti śāstraikatvasiddhi | The authors of these
three works are different persons, but these constitute
one main work, as they deal with one subject. Jaimini
begins his work with atha (then). The Brahmasutra-s also
begin with atha. By this, it is not correct to hold that
they are different works. Even in Jaimini's Mīmāmsā-
sutra-s different chapters begin with the word atha.
According to Sri Rāmānuja, bhaktiyoga is the
means for the realization of the Self and the attain-
ment of moksa which constitutes eternal Bliss. It isxiii
synonymous with upāsanā (meditation). That bhakti
(devotion) results wholly from viveka (discrimination),
vimoka (freedom), abhyasa (practice), kriyā (work), kalyāṇa
(auspiciousness), anavasāda (absence of weakness), and
anuddharşa (absence of excessive merriment); because
it is only so possible, and because also there is scriptural
authority to that effect.
Who then is this Brahman? Śrī Rāmānuja defines
Him thus: 'By the word brahman is denoted the Highest
Person who is, by nature, devoid of all evils and is
possessed of a host of auspicious qualities, which are
innumerable and unsurpassable in excellence. For,
everywhere in the contexts the word brahman is seen
to have been derived from the association of bṛhattva
(greatness) and whatever greatness is, by nature as
well as by qualities, unsurpassable in excellence, that
is its primary and natural meaning. And He, who
possesses such greatness, is alone the Lord of all. Hence
the word Brahman is primarily used to signify Him
alone. In cases where, on account of the association
of a modicum of that quality, other things than the
Lord are meant by the word Brahman, it must have been
used in a secondary sense; because it is improper to
postulate a variety of meanings for it, as it is improper
in the case also of the word, bhagavat. He is the supreme
Self known as Nārāyaṇa whose abode is Śrī Vaikuṇṭha
and whose consort is Śrī or Mahālakṣmi.
The Brahmasutra-s consist of four Adhyāya-s
(chapters) and each of the four chapters consists of
four pada-s (parts). The first chapter is called thexiv
Samanvayādhyāya and it determines that Brahman is
the cause of creation, sustenance and destruction of
the universe. The second chapter is called the
Avirodhādhyāya and it removes any inconsistency that
may arise for such determination. It establishes
firmly what the first chapter has done. The third
chapter is called Sadhanadhyāya and it mentions the
means for attaining Brahman. The last chapter is
called Phalādhyāya and it treats of the results obtained
by that means. In the scheme of things, the first two
chapters are quite distinct from the last two chapters.
The Vedāntasära begins with this benedictory verse:
'I bow unto Vișnu who has for his body all the
sentient and the nonsentient beings, who is the Self of
all objects, who is associated with the Goddess, Śrī;
who is the Ocean of Bliss untainted with impurity'.
By this we learn that the supreme Being according
to Śrī Rāmānuja is Vișņu who has for his body all
sentient and non-sentient beings. It is also clear that
the sentient beings, the non-sentient things and the
Lord are distinct from each other and that the Lord is
possessed of a host of auspicious qualities bereft of all
evils. The Lord could only be approached through
bhakti or prapatti which is only a form of bhakti.
I Adhyāya. The first four sūtra-s establish in a
short compass the system of philosophy and religion
as enunciated by Rāmānuja, thus:
That the Vedānta-s establish Brahman, who is
blameless and possessed of good qualities, who is the
cause of the universe and who has the nature ofXV
unsurpassed bliss. Brahman then is the object of the
highest pursuit and He is both the instrumental and
material cause of the universe.
Sūtra-s 5 to 12 refute the theory of Samkhya that
the pradhana or prakrti causes the world.
Sūtra-s 13 to 22 advance another argument, namely:
the Self mentioned for meditation in the text, 'Different
from this which consists of kowledge, is the still Inner
Self, the anandamaya' (Tait. II. 1. 1), etc. can only be
the highest Self and not the individual self.
The next two sūtra-s (23-4) determine that the
supreme Being is denoted by the word ākāśa and
prāṇa; because there are the scriptural texts—'All
these beings are, indeed, born out of ākāśa (Chand.
Up. 1. 9. 11), etc.
Sūtra-s 25 to 28 raise another point, namely: The
word jyotis (or light) occurring in the scriptural text,
Now that Light, which shines beyond this highest
Heaven, etc.' (Chand. 1II. 13. 7) cannot be the digestive
heat in the stomach, because in the same context,
there occurs a reference to the highest Person who is
denoted by the word jyotis. Further there is nothing
wrong if jyotis is taken as the digestive heat; because
the teaching here is a commendation enjoining the
continued meditation of that highest Person in the
form of that digestive heat for the purpose of attaining
the fruition of a desired result.
The last four sūtra-s (29 to 32) state that the word
Indra, used to denote Indra as identified with prāṇa,
refers to the highest Person, whose body is Indra.xvi
The remaining parts 2 to 4 also deal with certain
scriptural texts and clearly state that the universal
Cause is the highest Self and not the individual selves.
(Vide Sri Vedāntadeśika's Adhikaraṇasārāvalī, verse 18
'tatrādye'tyantagūḍhāviśadaviśadasuspaṣṭajīvādivācaḥ'.
II Adhyāya. The first two sutra-s of the first part
of the second chapter deal with the topic: Kapila is a
great sage, who composed the Samkhyasūtra-s and he
states that pradhana is the cause of creation, etc. of the
universe. As such his system has to be accepted. If
an argument of this type could be accepted it will lead
to the result, namely, that Manusmrti and other works
will have no place and have to be discarded as useless.
The Vedānta texts are in need of supplementary texts
to establish their meaning. The other Smrti writers
have contradicted the meaning of the Vedānta texts.
It is only Manu and others that have supported their
meaning. Hence Manu and others and not Kapila,
have to be accepted as the authors of the supple-
mentary texts.
The next sūtra (3) determines this point, namely:
The Yogasutra-s were composed by a great person like
Hiranyagarbha. Hence it has to be accepted as a
supplementary text. Here the argumentators have
missed one important point. Hiranyagarbha is after
all the four-faced Brahmã, who is tainted with the
qualities of rajas and tamas, and he has composed these
sutra-s. Therefore it has to be assumed that these
Yogasutra-s are contaminated with the qualities of
rajas and tamas. Hence they have to be rejected.xvii
The next nine sutra-s (4-12) raise an important
point: The universe is a non-sentient being and
Brahman is a sentient being. A sentient being cannot
be the material cause of a non-sentient being. This
is so seen in the world. Hence Brahman could not be
the cause of the universe. This is not correct. We
find in the world that sentient beings are born out of
non-sentient ones. Therefore it is also appropriate to
state that Brahman is the cause of the world.
The next sūtra (13) states thus: ‘Kaņāda, Akṣapāda
and the Buddha have accepted the atoms to be the
cause of the world. Therefore their theory has to be
accepted. This is not correct; because they have
established their system on reasoning discarding the
scriptural texts'.
The next sūtra (14) states thus: 'Brahman has for his
body all the sentient and the non-sentient beings.
Therefore he has to experience all pleasure and pain
like any other individual self. This is not correct;
because the pleasure and pain are subject to karman
and Brahman is free from all karman-s'.
The next six sūtra-s(15-20) state thus: 'The world
which is effected by Brahman is not different from
Brahman, because the effects such as pot, etc. are
perceived to be not different from their causes, the
clod of clay, etc.'
The next three sūtra-s (21-3) raise an important
point. Suppose the universe becomes identically one
with Brahman. Then Brahman becomes tainted with
the flaw, namely that He is the creator of the universe
Bxviii
that is not beneficial to Himself. This is not so; He
is distinct from the universe in His essential nature
as stated in the scriptural text, 'Remaining within the
self', etc. Hence the faults of the world do not touch
Him.
The first nine sutra-s of the second part of the
second chapter state thus: The pradhana of the Sam-
khya-s cannot produce the universe; because the
pradhana, which is nonsentient cannot produce the effect
without the association of a sentient agent'.
Then Bādarāyaṇa refutes the views of the Sautrān-
tika and Vaibhaṣika schools of Buddhism thus: 'The
Bauddha-s have accepted that the aggregates of earth,
etc. are nothing but the atoms. But their argument
falls to the ground; because they have accepted the
momentariness of all objects including the atoms that
form the aggregate and are destroyed in the second
moment of their existence'.
The next three sūtra-s (27-9) refute the views of the
Yogācāra-s thus: 'The views held by the school, that
establish the negation of objects other than cognition,
are not correct'. What is apprehended in the sentence,
I know the pot' is the object that is used in the
objective case. It is not possible to say that its negation
is apprehended. The forms of cognition do produce
in men the ideas of particular objects and not the
objects themselves.
The next sūtra (30) criticises the view of the
Madhyamika school. "The view of universal voidness
is not correct, because when the proposition is to bexix
proved it should refer to the object of existence and
not of nothingness'.
After refuting different views held by the opponents,
Bādarayaṇa comes to the Pāñcarātra school. This
adhikaraṇa is called Utpattyasambhavādhikaraņa or the
Pāñcarātrādhikarana (p. 187). He raises the objection
against this school in the first two sūtra-s and answers it
in the last two sutra-s. According to him the Pāñca-
rātra system is entirely correct and it does not contradict
the view of Vedānta. Samkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna
and Aniruddha are different incarnations of Lord
Vasudeva. The caturvyūhopāsanā is one of the brahma-
vidyā-s like the sadvidyā, daharavidyā, etc.
In the third part of the second chapter, the author
determines that ākāśa (space) is a product as there are
scriptural statements to prove this. The same could be
said of vayu, etc.
Then he explains that the individual self is not
pure consciousness as held by opponents. But he is a
knower; and he is inseparably connected with another
substance known as knowledge. With the help of this
knowledge he is able to find out everything. This
knowledge bears to the self the relationship of the rays
to the object that emanates those rays.
The next seven sūtra-s (33-9) state thus: The selfis
the doer and not the three qualities, namely sattva,
rajas and tamas; the next two sutra-s state thus: The
actions of the individual self are all dependent upon
the highest Self. But it should not be said that the
highest Self is responsible for all man's actions, because
6XX
man alone should choose the first action and the subse-
quent actions arise as a corollary to his first action.'
8
The first three sutra-s of the fourth part of the second
chapter state thus: The sense organs are all products
in the same way as ākāśa, etc. because there is the
scriptural statement'. Sat, alone, my dear, was in the
beginning!
The next two sūtra-s (4-5) state thus: The sense-
organs are eleven in number and they move with
the self'.
Then the topic of the prāṇa is elaborately dealt
with in this part.
III Adhyāya. The first seven sutra-s of the first
part of the third chapter determine this point: 'The
individual self when he moves from one body to another,
goes enveloped by the rudiments of the elements'.
The next four sūtra-s (8-11) state thus: On the
exhaustion (p. 243) of the karman-s the individual self
returns to the world with a remainder of the karman-s,
whose fruit he has not enjoyed '.
The next ten sütra-s (12-21) state thus: Those who
have done punya-karman-s, (meritorious works) reach the
moon. But those who have done papa-karman-s (non-
meritorious works) do not go to the moon'.
The next sutra states thus: The individual self on
his return journey from the moon passes through the
ether, the wind, the smoke and the cloud in an order.
Then he comes to the earth in the form of rain.'
(
The first six sūtra-s of the second part of the third
chapter state thus: 'The objects seen in the dreams arexxi
real and not created by the individual selves: but they
are the creations of the highest Self'.
C
The next two sūtra-s (7-8) state thus: 'In the deep
state of sleep, it is stated that the individual selves
sleep in the nāḍī-s and also in pericardium. When they
awake they do not know that they have slept in
Brahman'. The next sūtra states thus: The same
person, (who was in a state of deep sleep) rises from
sleep; because there are the works for which the person
of defective knowledge has to undergo retribution;
because also there is the remembrance'.
The next fifieen sūtra-s (9-23) state thus: 'No
mistake arises in the highest Brahman, even if He
remains as an immanent Self in all the four states,
such as the waking state, etc. In the scriptures and in
the Smṛti-s it is stated that the highest Brahman possesses
a twofold characteristic, namely, the absence of inaus-
picious qualities and the presence of all auspicious
ones. Sins do cling to the individual selves. The
individual selves and the highest Self are encased in a
body; yet their differential characteristics are stated.
in the scriptures'.
The third and fourth parts of the third chapter
deal with various brahmavidya-s which lead men to
mokṣa and other goals according to their wishes.
IV Adhyāya. The first two sūtra-s of the first part
of the fourth chapter states thus: The knowing that is
useful for the attainment of the final release, has to be
repeated more than once'. Bhagavan Sri Kṛṣṇa
states thus: Worship Me with devotion, directed
6xxii
to nothing else. Whose minds are fixed on Me I lift
them before long, etc.' (Bhag. Gi. 12.7). The next
sutra states thus: The meditation should be on the
highest Self who is the Self of the individual
selves. The next sutra states thus: The highest
Self should not be apprehended in the symbol of the
mind, etc.'
6
He then states thus: Meditation has to be made
every day till death; because the scriptures say so'.
The next sūtra (13) states thus: When the meditation
on Brahman is begun the earlier sins do not cling to
him; because those meditations have that power'. The
next sūtra states thus: 'As regards the wise, the ordinary
good deeds obstruct the attainment of final release.
But as they grant undesired fruits, they either do
nothing to the selves or become destroyed. After death
they do not yield any results'. The next sūtra states
thus: The good and evil deeds performed before the
acquisition of knowledge become destroyed without
granting any fruits. The texts say that they last till
death'.
C
The next three sūtra-s (16-18) state: Agnihotra, etc.
are the works to be performed by the aśramin. The
life of an asramin is only intended for the acquisition of
knowledge. The good and bad deeds do not cling to a
person, who has obtained the knowledge of Brahman.
Further the works done with knowledge cause obstruc-
tion to the grant of the fruits after death'. The last
sūtra (19) states thus: 'Having destroyed by enjoyment
the two kinds of deeds, the self reaches Brahman'.
8xxiii
The first two sūtra-s of the second part statė thus:
The organ of speech and other sense-organs stop
working at the time of death. Hence it is right to say
that the sense-organs combine with the mind at death'.
The next sutra (3) states: 'At death the mind is
combined with the (prana) breath and the präna with
the self'.
6
Then it is stated thus: The wise and the unwise
follow the same path till they reach the path of light,
etc. Brahman could be reached only by traversing
the path of light. A subtle body persists even after
death.
Then the sutra-s state thus: 'The highest Person
remains within the heart of the individual selves.
Through His grace the door of the heart becomes
illuminated. Then he leaves the body through the
suşumnā nāḍī from his head'.
The next sutra (17) states thus: The wise go up-
wards through the rays. These rays remain at night
also. In the winter season they are covered with
snow. The next sutra states thus: 'Even those, who
die at night, reach Brahman. The man must perform
his duty, as long as he is encased in the body. The
works, which have begun to produce the results, die
with the body. They do not stand in the way of
attainment of Brahman'.
6
The next two sutra-s (18-19) state thus: The wise
reach Brahman even if they die during the southward
progress of the sun. The Yogin-s remember both the
paths and they will not be deluded by doubt'.
6xxiv
The third part begins: 'The wise traverse by the
path of light, etc '.
6
The next two sūtra-s (4-5) state thus: The presiding
deities of light, etc. who are directed by the highest
Person are conductors of the wise. After lightning,
the self reaches Brahman'. The next ten sūtra-s (6-15)
state thus: Bādari thinks that those who meditate on
the effected Brahman i.e. Hiranyagarbha traverse the
path of light, etc. Because the self that reaches Hiran-
yagarbha does not come back to the world; and
when the world of Hiranyagarbha passes away, then
the selves go with their ruler to the Highest. Jaimini
thinks that the Highest alone should be meditated upon
always. Bādarayaṇa states that those who meditate upon
Brahman traverse the path of light, etc. Some meditate
upon Brahman as the Self of their selves. While others
meditate on their selves as having Brahman for the Self.
The first three sutra-s of the fourth part state thus:
"The self reveals itself in all his glory when he reaches
the Highest'. The next sutra (4) states thus: 'The
released self experiences the Highest, who is his Self,
as one with him'.
The next three sutra-s (5-7) state thus: 'Jaimini
thinks that the nature like that of Brahman, free from
sin, manifests itself in the individual Self. Auḍulomi
thinks that his very nature is intelligence. But
Bādarāyaṇa opines that he possesses both of them
mentioned above'.
The next two sūtra-s (8-9) state thus: The highest
Person, while in a sportive mood, is born as the son
6XXV
of Vasudeva and Daśaratha by His mere will. In the
same manner the released soul, who is included in the
sportive activity of the highest Brahman, can have
father, etc. in the world through his will. But the
released Self is not subject to karman at any time.
The next seven sutra-s (10-16) state thus: 'Badari
holds that released Self does not possess a body and the
sense-organs. Jaimini opines that he becomes manifold
with the help of the body and sense-organs. But
Bādarāyana thinks that he possesses both these charac-
teristics. The released Self does not possess bodies,
that are his own creation. He enjoys the sport, created
by the highest Person. The Self enjoys everything by
entering all as in the case of the lamp. The Self
remains in one place. But he experiences everything
through knowledge that acts as his light'.
The next five sūtra-s (17-12) state thus: 'The released
self possesses the character of the highest Person except
creation, sustenance, and destruction of the world'.
The last sūtra (22) states thus: The released self
does not come back again to the world?.
Śrī Rāmānuja postulates a personal God. He
defines Brahman thus: By the word brahman is
denoted the highest Person, who is, by nature, devoid
of all evil, and is possessed of hosts of auspicious qualities,
which are innumerable and unsurpassable in excellence.'
He accepts a world that is real, that is opposed to the
world of illusion of the Advaitins. Of the means of
attainment he accepts the bhakti and prapatti wherein
the Lord is considered both as a means and the object
Cxxvi
of attainment. Only he attains the Lord whom He
elects with grace.
This is the truth of this system.
In concluding I wish to offer my heartfelt thanks
to Rao Bahadur K. V. Rangaswami Ayyangar, at
whose instance I translated into English the text of the
Vedāntasara and to Vaidyaratna G. Srinivasa Murti,
Director, Adyar Library, for undertaking to publish
this work in the Adyar Library Series. My special
thanks are also due to Pandit V. Krishnamacharya
of the Adyar Library for revising the translation and
editing it with the text. He also has added some
necessary notes and a valuable introduction in Sanskrit.
I request the general public to pardon me for any short-
comings that they may find in the work.

1. Athāto Brahma-jijnasa.
Then therefore the inquiry into the Brahman.
Here the word, then is used in the sense of coming there-
after; because it is followed by the word therefore. The
word, therefore, is used in the sense of causation of that which
has been concluded previously. What has been concluded pre-
viously, is understood to be the knowledge of ritualistic works;
because the inquiry into the Brahman, which is desired to be
commenced here, happens to be a portion of the inquiry into
the meaning of the Vedās. Indeed, for the person, who has
completed his study of the Vedās, the first duty is to make an
inquiry into the ritualistic works, as the Vedās commence to
deal with them in the beginning. Hence it is stated "Then
therefore the inquiry into the Dharma" (Mim. 1. 1. 1). Taking
the topic of Dharma separately, it is determined in the series
of Sūtras ending with "2 The priestly function must be common
for all the castes as all are able to do it " ( Mim. 12-4-40) that

the rituals of Prakrti and Vikrti kinds are only the means to
attain the three-fold object of human pursuit viz. Dharma.
(i.e. ritualistic works), Artha (i.e. wealth) and Kāma (i.e.
gratification of desire).
The Vedās naturally imply their meaning. The ritualistic
works are their meaning. It is also determined that these mere
works can grant only the three-fold object of human pursuit
stated above. It is roughly realised in Vedānta, which is a
portion of the Vedās, that the ritualistic works give only small and
transitory results and the Brahman-realization only can produce
infinite and eternal results. Then, in the person, who wants

that words can denote even the objects that have been already
in existence, the desire to know the Brahman springs up.
Therefore, it is stated in the Sūtra, “Then therefore the inquiry
into the Brahman " (Br. S. I-1-1) that after the inquiry of
Karman, by the very same reason the inquiry into the Brah -
man is to be made.

Here is the scriptural statement thus
—— Having
examined the worlds obtained by works, let a Brāhmana
acquire distaste on ritualistic works, as the object which is not
in the scope of being effected could not be gained by action ;
to know that object let him approach with sacred fuel in hand.
necessarily a preceptor, who is learned in the Vedās and has a
steady footing in the Brahman. To him (i.e. to such a pupil)
who with tranquil mind and restrained senses has thus
approached, that wise person (the guru) should speak of the
knowledge about the Brahman by which he (the pupil) can
know the ever-existing and indestructible Purusa ( person ) '
(Mund. 1-2-12 & 13 ). Here the Brāhmana is one, who is en-
gaged in the study of the Vedās. The word Karmacitān means
gained through the works'. The word worlds (lokān) means
to imply ‘ those worlds that are destructible by nature as the1]

deities worshipped are destructible'. He should determine
thus on inquiry into Karman-The Highest Person wbo is
eternal can not be attainable by works'. He (i.e. the pupil)
then acquires distaste in all worldly objects. To know That
(Brahman) he should approach the preceptor alone with
fuel in hand. The word 'srotriya' means, one who is
learned in the Vedās up to the end'. The words 'who has a
steady footing in the Brahman' mean 'One who has appre-
hended the true nature of the Highest Person'. Then
he (the preceptor) should speak of the knowledge of the
Brahman to him (the pupil) who approached him properly,
with which knowledge the pupil can know the Eternal
Highest Person. The perfect tense in the word Provāca
should be taken to mean the injunction, because of the
construction – The pupil should approach the preceptor alone
and the learned preceptor should teach him . More over, the
teaching by the preceptor is not known ordained otherwise.
The perfect tense is ordained in the sense of injunction by
the rule—— In Veda, the aorist, imperfect and perfect tenses
are used in other senses also '. (Pāņ. 3-4-6).[adhi.

(The Brahman is He) from whom (proceed) the
creation, etc. of this Universe.
The scriptural text is this – From whom all these
beings are born ; by whom, when born, they are all preserved
and to whom they go back when they perish — do you
desire to know that well, that is the Brahman'. (Tait.
III-1-1). The meaning of the Sūtra is thus - The Vedic text
declares that it is the Brahman, from whom proceed the
creation, the sustenance and the destruction of the world—
this world is a mixture of various sentient and non-
sentient beings whose enjoyment of the pleasure and
pain, has been settled. In this Sūtra, the word, ‘ from
whom ' is used in the ablative case to mean the causality in
general; because it is applied in common to the creation,
sustenance, and destruction ( of the universe). His causal-
ity in production includes his being the efficient cause
as well as the material cause. It is so, because the
Vedic statement ' From whom etc.' is common to both.

To the question - how is it? the reply is this — There is a
clear reference to Him as being the cause of the creation,
etc. (of the world ) in the expression ' from whom etc.' as if
He were a well-known celebrated Being. His celebrity in
cludes the twofold causation said above. (Consider) the
6
6
text — Existence alone, my dear boy, this was in the
beginning one only, without a second.... It thought May
I become many and be born '. It created Tejas' (Chānd.
VI-2-1 & 3). Here the expression Existence alone this was
in the begnning one only' proves that He is the material cause
(of the Universe). The expression without a second' refutes a
different substratum. Hence it becomes known that the Brah-
man, who is denoted by the word ' existence' is both the
efficient cause and the material cause ( of the Universe). It is
known also from the scriptual text " It thought' May I become
many and be born" that He did resolve to assume many
variegated forms of sentient and non-sentient beings and then
He did create (the Universe ). Therefore the expression
6
' from whom' is used in the scripture with the ablative

In this text (Brahmasūtra) itself the fact that the Brahman
is both the material cause and the efficient cause ( of the
Universe) has been objected on the ground of logical con-
tradiction and of the specific statement in the Vedic text, viz.
The magician created the Universe from this " (Svet.
IV-1-9) and subsequently maintained after refuting the
objection in the Sūtras I-4-23 to 26.
How then does the Brahman-who is omniscient and
omnipotent, who wills the truth and who has discarded all
things unworthy to be of human pursuit as He himself being
not tainted with evil-create the Universe, which is a mixture
of various wonderful sentient and non-sentient beings ? The
author of the Sūtras himself will raise this objection and
answer it. He raises the objection in Sūtras II-1-8 and
II-1-21 and answers it in Sūtras II-1-9 and II-1-22.
The individual self is declared to be distinct from the
Brahman in the series of scriptural texts and smrti passages
stated below :---

The destructible is the Avidyā or action. The immortal
is the Vidyā or knowledge. He ( the Brahman ), who com-
mands the Vidyā and the Avidyā is distinct from the soul.'
(S've. 5-1 ).

He is the cause. He is the lord of the lord of the
senses fi.e. of the Jiva or the individual self). He has neither
progenitor nor master ' (S've. VI-9).

• The destructible is the Pradhāna or Prakrti; the
immortal and the indestructible is the Hara (i.e. the individual
self) and the Lord alone rules over the destructible Prakrti
and the individual self' (S've. I-10).
The enjoying soul is said Hara because he takes the non-
sentient things for his enjoyment.
6
• These are two Purusas in the world, the destruc-
tible and the indestructible. The destructible represents all
beings, while the indestructible is said to be the unchanging
one' (Bh. Gītā XV-16 ). But other than these, is the
Highest Purusa called the Supreme Soul, who as the
eternal Lord, supports the three worlds, having entered them.
(Bh. Gītā XV-17).10

Because I transcend the destructible beings and am
also higher than the indestructible Jiva, am I celebrated
in the world and in the Veda as the Supreme Person
(Bh. Gitā XV-18 ).
The Brahman is Superior than and distinct from
the individual self, who experiences distress and sorrow
which are not fit to be the scope of human pursuit. The
Brahman has for His body the individual selves and He
is their Self. This fact has been established by hundreds of
scriptural passages such as (a) "Remaining in the self + has
the self as His body" (Mādhy-) and (b) "He is the inner self
of all beings ; He is devoid of all pains; He is the Divine Lord ;
He is the only one God Nārāyaņa (Sub. VII ). Though
the embodied soul assumes the state of an effect, yet he is not
tainted with evils of the effect, because the good and bad attri-
butes are restricted in each case. There are illustrative exam-
ples for this. Therefore the Brahman is not tainted with evils.
Hence there is no absurdity in the passages of Vedānta. This
has been asserted in Sūtra 2-1-9. The illustrative example is2]

this : — The self, that has a body, is denoted by various words,
such as god, man etc. It assumes the various states of
child-hood, youth, old age, etc. Yet the child-hood,
youth, old age etc. are the faults that are attached to the body.
They do not touch the self. In the same way the pleasure
etc. that are closely attached to the self, do not touch the body.
Therefore, the Brahman, both in the states of effect and cause,
has the individual souls as His body and is the Self of those
individual souls. Therefore the Brahman is denoted by the word,
denoting the individual soul. Then it is right to state that
the word, soul applies to the Brahman, because the Brahman
and the individual selves co-exist in the same grammatical equa-
tion. In order to reason this fact, two other schools that have
to be refuted have been stated in Sūtras I-4-20 and 21 and the
Siddhānta views of reasoning are advanced in sūtra I-4-22.

non-sentient beings.' (Tait. II-6-1), it is seen that He remains.
in the position of the Self to all individual selves. Hence, the
Brahman is denoted by the word, denoting the individual
soul. It is also stated that He is mentioned as being co-
extensive in the same grammatical equation with the individual
soul. The inequalities in creation as god, men, etc. are
caused by the Karmans done by the individual selves. This is
asserted in Sūtra, II-1-34. The individual souls and the
stream of Karmans that is attached to them, have not
a beginning. This is asserted in Sūtra 2-1-35. That they have
not a beginning has been established in the following scriptural
texts, “ The Eternal among eternals, the Intelligent among the
intelligents " (S've. VI-13). “ The two, namely, the Intelligent
and non-intelligent' (S've. I-9). Though they have not a
beginning, yet at the time of the deluge i.e. Pralaya, the
sentient and the non-sentient beings, that assume the form of
the enjoyer and the enjoyed can not be distinguished by the
distinct names and forms. The Sūtrakāra has himself stated
that the stress of oneness of the Brahman is reasonable. The
scriptural text quoted here is this —" Indeed the Self alone was
in the beginning and nothing else " (Ait. 1. I-1).prathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥ

That the self is eternal and not produced has been proved
in Sūtra II-3-18. That knowledge is the essential character-
istic of the self has been proved in Sūtra I1-3-19. That the
self is atomic in size has been proved in Sūtra II-3-20. The
self, who is the knower, has been mentioned by the term knowl-
edge ; because he has knowledge, as his essential attribute
and because also he has to be defined and investigated by the
means of the attribute, knowledge. This has been stated in
Sūtras 11-3-29 & 30. In the Sūtra II-3-32 are stated the
defects that arise in the schools that accept knowledge as
the self, that accept the knowledge produced by other
means as the self and that accept the self as being present
everywhere. That the self is the doer of good and bad works
and not Prakrti has been stated in Sūtras II-3-33 to 39.

(6) — The Brahman are the fishermen, the Brahman are
the slaves, the Brahman are these gamblers' (Brahmasūkta).
Therefore, it is to be granted that the self is a portion
of the Brahman, so that the two statements mentioned
above will not contradict each other.
This is not established by reasoning alone. The fact
that the individual souls are part of the Brahman has been
proved by the following scriptural texts and Smrti passages :-
1. — His one fourth part constitutes all the worlds'
(Puru. Sū. 3-22).
2. — In the word of life, the eternal soul is indeed a
portion of mine' (Bha. Gi. XV-8).
The objection-a portion of an object means a part
of a single unit. Therefore logically there is no possibility
of any distinction between these two-is set aside in
Sutra 11. 3. 45.
The luminosity, the species, the attribute and the body
belong to the fire, the substance, the attributed thing and the
soul which are distinct from them. Yet they form a
portion of the fire etc. In this way the individual souls

become a portion of the Brahman, who has them as His
body. The individual souls which are portions of the
Brahman, have their own inherent characteristics; but the
Brahman, of whom the individuals souls are portions, does
not possess those characteristics because the things and their
attributes are always found to be distinct from each other
in regard to their natural state and inherent characteristics.
Thus no contradiction arises in what is stated in Sutras
II-3-33 and 40. That the individual souls are portions of the
Brahman in the same way as luminosity, etc. is stated
by Parāsara and others
(1) 'The fire remains in one place; but its light spreads
all round. In this way, all the worlds are the manifestations
of the power of the Brahman (Visnu I-22-56).
(2) Oh!

for its generation by an agent, it forms the body of Hari'

Otherwise, if it is viewed that the individual souls
become a portion of the Brahman due to a certain limiting
conditions, that are either of a true or of untrue nature
all the faults, intended to be set aside by the Vedānta texts
do attach themselves to the Brahman. This has been stated
in Sūtra II-3-49. and so on.
Therefore, the Brahman has always as his body all the sen-
tient and non-sentient beings and is the Self of all those beings.
The Brahman is in the state of cause at that time, when His
body constitutes the sentient and non-sentient beings without
distinct names and froms. He is in the state of effect at that
time, when His body constitutes the sentient and non-sentient
beings with distinct names and forms. Though the sentient
and the non-sentient beings are the body of the Brahman; yet
the sentient and the non-sentient beings, who form the body
of the Brahman, do undergo changes and are the seat of
the evils. Even then, the Brahman who is the Self of
these objects, is the ocean of auspicious qualities, such as
knowledge, bliss, etc. which are innumerable, unsurpassable27.

a second. It thought may I become many and be born '

beings as the body has been proved by the following
scriptural texts-
,
(1) He, whose body is the self (Mādh. Brāhmana).
(2) 'He, whose body is the indestructible one, He,
whose body is the earth, He, whose hody is the Avyakta,
He is the inner Self of all beings; He is devoid of sins,
He is the Divine Lord. He is the One Nārāyaņa (Sub.

a distinct name and form. It in the beginning i.e. at the
time of the deluge, remained only one having as Its body all
the sentient and non-sentient beings in a subtle form, and
did not manifest Itself as having a distinct name and form.
The Brahman Himself who is omniscient and omnipotent,
remained without a second, not requiring any other effficient
cause.

The meaning of the scriptural text, ' It thought-May
I become many and be born (Chānd. VI-2-1 ) is this----
The Brahman remained only one having as His body, all
the sentient and non-sentient beings, that had neither name
nor form in their subtle state. It thought of becoming many
by assuming a gross form, that has a distinct name and form.
The words, May. become' and ' Be born ' indicate respectively
the distributive and aggregate forms of creation. All Vedāntins
accept this doctrine viz-At the time of deluge, the intelligent
and the non-intelligent beings do assume a subtle and indes-
cribable difference from the Highest Person. Other Vedāntins
also accept the difference between them produced by ignorance
or limiting conditions as beginningless. Here the peculiarity
is this: In the other schools the Brahman becomes ignorant
and is associated with limiting conditions. This is opposed22

(That the Brahman is the cause of the creation
etc. follows altogether from the scripture ), because the
scripture alone forms the source (of the knowledge
related to Him).
The Brahman, who has as His body all the sentient and
non-sentient beings, is the material cause and also the
efficient cause of the Universe. This fact could not be
apprehended by reasoning; but could be proved by scriptures
alone. Therefore it is established that the scriptural text

That (viz. the fact that the scriptures form alto-
gether the source of the knowledge relating to the
Brahman) results, however, from (His constituting) the
true purport ( of the scripture).
His constituting the true purport of the scripture is the
same as His being the object of human pursuit. Though the
function of the proof, known as scripture, ends in determining
the object of human pursuit ; Yet the Brahman, who is experi-
enced equally by Himself and others in His natural state,
in His peculiar characteristics and in His great splendour,
is of unsurpassed bliss and this is intended to be denoted by
the S'āstra. Therefore it is quite right that Brahman could
be proved by the S'astra. Thus there is no any defect.
ĪKSATYADHIKARANA 5
It has been previously stated that the Vedāntas establish
the Brahman, as the sole cause of the entire universe. He24

time He is in the form of the universe, as He is its material.
cause also. This fact has to be determined by the Sāstras
only as the inferential reasoning is incapable of proving it.
He is the highest object of human pursuit; because
His essential characteristic constitutes the unsurpassable bliss.
Therefore the Vedāntas surely teach about Him. This fact
has been firmly established before. Then in the rest of this
Pāda it is stated that as the Prakrti and the individual selves
are not fit to be mentioned as the cause of the world. The
Vedāntas teach about the Brahman only, who is omniscient,
who possesses a true will, who is hostile to all evils such as
ignorance etc. and who is the ocean of innumerable noble
qualities.
Of these, the author first states that the Prakrti could
not be mentioned in the Vedānta as the cause of the world.

Because the predicative root, Iks is used (in
connection with the activity of what constitutes the
cause of the world) that which is not in the scope

to the cause of the world).prathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥ

That which is not capable of being revealed by the

mānika that which is established by the process of logical
inference, i.e. the Pradhāna. The meaning is that the Pra-
dhāna, is not apprehended by the Vedānta. Why ? Because
the root Iks ( to see, i.e. to think ) is used. That is because
the root, Iks is used in the scriptural passage It thought
May I become manifold and be born' (Chānd. VI-2-3) to
denote the activity of the universal cause; closely related.

If it be said that it (viz. the root Iks), is used here

In the scriptural statement That fire thought' (Chānd.
VI-2 - 3 ) the root Iks is used in conection with the action
of the non-intelligent substance also. The root apparently is
there used in a figurative sense.
Likewise in the case
of the Pradhāna also, the root Iks is used in a figurative

the import of the word Sat, the word Atman denoting the
intelligent one is used. In the subsequent portion there is
the passage — — He is the Self.' That thou art, Oh!
'S'vetaketu' (Chănd. VI-8-7).
In fact as regards fire etc. also the power of seeing is
not to be explained in a figurative sense, because the words
fire etc. denote the Brahman only who has them as His
body. All these objects are distinguishable as having a name
and form; because the Brahman has entered them, through the
individual souls which constitute His body. It is because there
is the statement, ' Indeed entering in the form of the individual
self, I evolve the differentiation of names and forms (Chānd.
VI-3-2). The intelligent and the non-intelligent substances are
separately stated in the text 'Having created it, He entered
the same; Having entered it, He became Sat and Tyat
( intelligent and non-intelligent ), describable and not describ
able, the support and supported, the animate and inanimate,
the truth and untruth. Yet he remained truth' (Tait. II-6).

Because it is taught that he, who is firmly devoted
to that (viz. the Sat) obtains final release.
By the following reason also, the cause of the world
mentioned by the term Sat is othet than the Pradhāna or
Prakrti. It is taught in the context that he, who is
firmly devoted to the Truth meant by the term Sat obtains
final release. It is taught in the scriptural text, 'For him
so long there is delay, as long as he is not freed from the
body ; then he will reach the Brahman. (Chānd. VI-14-2)
that he, who is firmly devoted to Him, obtains final release.
Consider the school that accepts Pradhāna to be the cause of
the creation etc. of the world. Even they belonging to that
school do not accept the fact, - that he, who is firmly devoted
to Pradhāna, obtains final release.

Because also it is not declared that it (viz. what is
denoted by the word sat or existence ) deserves to be
discarded.
If the Pradhāna were meant as the cause of the creation
etc. then it would have been taught that what is denoted
by the word Sat or existence deserves to be discarded. This
has not been done. In the passage 'That thou art, Oh !
S'vetaketu (Chand. VI-8-7) it is stated that he should be firmly
devoted to that viz., Sat, as the means of final release.
9. Pratijnāvirodhat.
Because also there would then be the contradiction

From the following reason also the Pradhāna is
not the cause of the creation etc ; because it contradicts
the proposition of cognition of all things from the cognition
of a single thing. From the scriptural text, ' From which the

proposition that the knowledge of that entity, which is denoted
by the word Sat, produces the knowledge of all the sentient
and non-sentient beings as they are its effect. Then there
is contradiction in the school that accepts the Praāhāna as
the cause of the world; because Pradhāna cannot produce the
sentient being. Consider the school that accepts Brahman,
who is different from the Pradhāna, to be the cause of the
world. Then the Brahman, having as his body all the
sentient and non-sentient beings, with distinct names and
forns is the effect and without distinct names and forms is
the cause. Hence it is correct to say that by the knowledge
of the Brahman the knowledge of everything is produced.
10. Svāpyayat.
Because also, there is ( mentioned in the context)

is ; when any person is known to be asleep, he is then in
union with the Sat. He withdraws into his Self. There -
fore they say, he sleeps; because he is absorbed into His
Self (i.e. into the Brahman)' (Chānd. VI-8-1) - declares
that the individual self, who is asleep and is in union with
the Sat, has withdrawn himself to his Self. Hence it is
known that what is denoted by the word Sat, is an object
other than the Pradhāna. The expression, Has withdrawn
himself to his Self' means becomes merged or absorbed
into his Self.
It is declared in the scriptural passage relating to the
differentiation of names and forms, that the Brahman Himself,
who has the intelligent and non-intellegent beings for His
body and forms their selves, is denoted by the word self
which ordinarily means the individual self. By means of
the statement, He is then in union with the Sat : He with-

draws into his Self' (Chand. VI-8-1), it is taught that
the Brahman, who is denoted by the word mentioning
jiva, is free from any association with names and forms at
the time of deep sleep also, as He is at the time of universal

dissolution and He is hence to be denoted merely by the

To the same effect, it is stated in a similar context
elsewhere that, owing to his (i.e. the individual self) not
being associated with names and forms, he is embraced
by Him who is omniscient; and consequently it is said
that, when he is embraced by the omniscient Self, he
does not know anything that is external or internal '
(Brh. IV-3-21 ). Indeed till his final release the individual
soul is associated with names and forms; and it is,
therefore, there is born in him the knowledge of objects other
than himself. At the time of deep sleep he certainly
gives up names and forms, and is embraced by the Sat (i.e.
by the Brahman) ; and again in waking state, he becomes
associated with names and forms and becomes possessed
with various names and forms. This is clearly stated in
other scriptural passages, namely,' When he (i.e. the individual
self) is deeply asleep, he sees no dreams whatsoever, and he be
comes one wholly with the Prāņa (Brahman) . ' ( Kaus. II. 30 ).
From that Self, the Prāṇās (i.e. Jīvas) proceed towards
their own places' (Kaus. II-34 ). To the same effect is the

ANANDAMAYADHIKARANA 6
13. Anandamayobhyasat
That, which is denoted by the term Anandamaya
( is the Brahman); because there is (in the context),
the repetition of various grades ( of bliss which
culminate in the Anandamaya or the Highest Bliss ).
No doubt the individual self, that possesses intelligence and
that is different from the Pradhāna, has the power of seeing ;
yet the individual self, neither in the state of bondage nor in
the state of final release, can be the cause of the universe.
The scriptural text beginning with 'From the same self,
the spatial ether came into existence' and ending with
'Different from this Vijñānamaya,³ is the Inner-Self Ananda-
maya ' (Tait. II-1-1) declares that the Anandamaya men-
tioned as the cause of the universe, is the all-knowing Highest

Vijñanamaya is the individual soul whose essential characteristic is

Self, who is other than the individual soul. Why ? Because of
the repetition. Because there is repetition of the bliss in
various grades which culminates in the Anandamaya and
which (bliss) forms the summits of unsurpassable condition,
This Anandamaya of the unsurpassable condition is repeat-
edly mentioned in the text, for meditation The hundred-
fold of the bliss of Prajāpati is equal to the single
bliss of the Brahman (Tait. II-8.4), — Wherefrom speeches
together with the mind return not having reached it. He who
knows the Brahman's bliss fears not from anything' (Tait.
II-3-8).
14. Vikarasabdanneti cenna prācuryat
It may be said that owing to there being the affix
(Maya) significant of modification, (the Anandamaya
is) not (the Brahman); but it is not ( right to say) so
because that (affix Maya) signifies abundance.
The affix Mayat means modification in the context

Anandamaya is not the Highest Self, that does not undergo
modification. It is not so. Because there is contradiction of
the purport, the affix Mayat is understood to mean here
' abundance '. The scriptural text From that ery same
Self, the spatial ether came into existence' (Tait. II-1-1)
refers to the Self, that does not undergo modification. The
notion that the affix Mayat denotes modification, has been given
up already in the case of Prāņamaya. Following this argu.
ment, it should be accepted that the Anandamaya is only the
Highest person; because there is an abundance of bliss in Him.

Because also this Anandamaya is declared (in the
contex) to be the cause of that (which forms the bliss
of the individual selves).
• For, He Himself causes the bliss' (Tait. II-7- 1 ). In this
passage it is declared that Anandamaya causes the bliss of

Because also that the same Being, who is denoted

That same Brahman, who is described by the words of

in the scriptural text, ' He enjoys all desires and the intelligent

thought, may I become many' (Chānd. VI-2-1 & 3), that the
intelligence (Vipascittva) is only in the form of the will of the
lord in assuming many forms of wonderful things including
movable and immovable beings. Though the liberated soul,
is all-knowing, yet he cannot create the world. Hence he
cannot have such Vipascittva (intelligence) of the type stated
above.
18. Bhedavyapades'acca
Because also there is (in the context ) the declara-

Brahman).
That the Anandamaya is distinct from the individual

be doubted that the term Vijñānamaya means mere intellect
on the ground that the Vijñānamaya is mentioned as mere
intellect in the text ‘ Vijñāna (intellect) performs the sacrifice'
(Tait. II-5-1). The Sūtrakāra himself will clear this doubt
in Sūtra II-3-35. In the seriptural text — The intellect per-
forms the sacrifice (Tait. II-5-1), the word intellect denotes the
individual self who is the agent of the sacrifice. If the word,
Vijñāna means intellect alone and not the individual self,
then the reading of the text would be in a different way ;
because intellect is only an instrument of action.
19. Kamācca nānumānapeksa
Because also His will ( is in itself the cause of
creation) the Pradhana is not needed (by Him in the
act of creation).
That the creation of the world is effected by His will
alone is stated in the scriptural statement, ' He desired may I

the individual soul requires the Pradhāna for the production of
something. The Pradhāna is Anumāna because it is proved
by the inferential reasoning.

Because also the scripture declares that the indi-
vidual self's acquisition of the bliss takes place when
he is in association with this (ānandamaya).
The scriptural text declares that this individual soul gets
bliss on reaching Him. The scriptural text is this 'Bliss,
indeed, is He. Having obtained that very same Bliss, he (i.e.
the individual self) becomes blissful (Tait. II-7-1 ). There -
fore Anandamaya is the all-knowing Highest Person, who is
the cause of the world and who is other than the individual
self.

It should not be doubted that the Anandamaya, who is
the cause of the world, omniscient and blissful is understood to
be an individual self endowed with extraordinary merits and
not the Supreme Self, because he is said to have a body.
It refers to the Supreme Person and the Highest Self, that is
denoted by the word, Person, occurring in the scriptural
statement — The Person, who is seen within the sun, He is
brilliant like gold etc.' (Chānd. I.6-6). Why ? Because
His attributes are declared in the context. The attributes of
the Highest Person, who is other than the individual self, are
(a) His unlimited Lordship over all the worlds and all the
desires (b) His not being under the influence of Karman. The
scriptural authorities are - He is the lord of all the worldsvedāntasāra:

and also of all desires ‘‘ His name is ‘ High'. This same person
is risen above all sins ' (Chānd. I-6-7).
The scriptural text, ' I know this Great Person of sun-like
lustre, who is altogether beyond darkness' (Tait. Ar. III-13-1 )
states that He has an immaterial form, that is peculiar
to Him and that could not be included among the modifica-
tions of the Prakrti of Triguna (i.e. Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas)
in the same way as the quality of knowledge. That knowledge,
etc. are His attributes is clearly seen in the scriptural texts
( 1 ) ' The Brahman is the Reality, Knowledge' (Tait. II-1-1),
(2) 'He, who knows all and understands all' (Mund. I-1-9).
( 3 ) His supreme power is declared, as varied and natural
as weli as His activity with knowledge and strength,'
(S'vet. VI-8). That He has a divine form peculiar to Him-
self has been stated in the scriptural text, 'He is of sun-like
lustre and altogether beyond darkness' (Tait. Ar. III-13-1).
Hence He is known to be of that form.

The Vākyakāra also states thus The passage The
Golden Person is beheld (Chānd. I-6-6) refers to the Wise
and Inner One, because He is described as the Lord of the
world and the Lord of desires and also as raised high above evils'.
Then in the next sentence 'His form is artificial and is assumed
to bless His devotees because He displays His sovereign power'
he (the Vākyakāra) introduces for refutation the view that His
form must be a phase of effect or it must be illusory. Then (he
himself) replies thus-'His form is indeed beyond the reach
of the sense-organs; because it is mentioned to be perceived
by Antahkarana (or inner sense.' Dramidācārya has com
mented upon it thus — The form of the creator of the universe
is not illusory; it is real and natural. It cannot be apprehended
by the eye; but could be apprehended through the mind, which
must be free from impurity, by one, who has resorted to a
different means of attaining Him'. The scriptural text is this-
' He is not apprehended by the eye, nor by speech'; ' but can be
known only by a pure mind' (Munda. III-1-8). It is not taught
that gods, who have no real form, have a form ; because the

scripture describes things as they are. This is also because
in a different context, it is stated about the Universal witness.
thus - The form of this person is like a saffron coloured robe '
(Br. II-3-6) 'I know this great Person of sun-like lustre"
(Tait - ār. III-12-7 ). This passage also is found in the work
Vākya. The phrase He is the Golden Person is to be
explained on the similarity of colour of both, like in the case
of the expression moon-face'. Dramida himself, has com-
mented upon the passage thus — The affix, mayat, is not used
in the sense of modification; because the Self is not pro-
duced '. Thus the Vedānta texts determine the Brahman,
who is other than the Pradhāna and the individual self. He
has unlimited omniscience (Vipascittva), whose natural
characteristic is unsurpassed bliss, who possesses a divine
form that is peculiar to Him, and not made of matter He is
the Highest Person and the cause of the world. Thus there
is not any defect.

The scriptural text, ' He who dwelling in the sun, is
within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body is
the sun, who internally rules the sun-He is thy Self, internal
ruler and immortal,' (Mādh. Brh. III-7-9) proves that He is
greater than the gods. That He is above the individual self
is stated in the scriptural text, 'He who dwelling in the
individual self etc.' That, He is above the world, is stated in
the scriptural text, 'He, who dwelling within all the worlds,
etc.' The scriptural text, 'He, who dwelling within all
beings' proves that He is greater than all beings. That He
is above all the Vedās is stated in the scriptural text, ' He,
who dwelling within all the Vedās, etc.' That He is above all
sacrifices is stated in the text, — He, who dwelling within all
the sacrifices.' All these texts are found in Antaryāmi-

is moving within the earth' and proceeding ‘ who is moving
within Ayakta, who is moving within Aksara (imperish-

Consider the texts, 'All these beings are, indeed, born
out of the ākāsa ; they go unto the ākāsa at the end '.
(Chānd. I-9-1 ). All these beings, indeed, enter into the
Prāņa and are evolved out of the Prāņa (Chānd. I-11-5).
The doubt, that arises here, is this : - These passages
distinctly specify with the terms ākāsa and Prāņa,, the
universal cause mentioned in the text 'Existence alone,
my dear boy, was in the beginning with general term
Sat. Here the terms ākāsa and Prāņa denote the popular
ether (one of the five elements) and Jiva functioning with
co-operation of vital breath of air. The doubt is cleared
thus —In the texts quoted above the words Ha vai ( indeed)
point out that the reason for accepting the object as the
universal cause is well-known. Therefore the cause denoted
by the terms Akāsa and Prāņa must be the Highest Person
who is distinct from the popular ether and vital air. Here
what is well known is this — The Highest Person is the cause
of the world. He became many as a result of His will.
He possesses unsurpassed bliss. He grants bliss to the self.

Him. His eyes resemble the lotus, that blossoms forth,

the things, on the backs of everything, in the highest worlds
than which there is no higher, that is that same as this light,
indeed, which is here within the Person ( Chānd. III-13-7).
Here the following doubt arises — The word, Jyotis (light),
is to be taken as the cause of the creation, etc. of the world ;
because it is denoted as Higher than all objects. It is also
taught to be the same as digestive heat in the stomach.
In this passage nothing is seen to prove contradiction
with the supposition. Therefore, the popular Jyotis (light),
alone is to be taken as the cause of the creation, etc. of
the world.
If it be so doubted, the reply is this — It is true that in
this passage nothing is seen to prove contradiction with
the supposition. Yet, in the same context, the passage – All
beings make up His one foot ; His three feet represent
the immortal beings in the Highest Heaven' (Chānd.
III-12-6) occurs wherein all beings are declared to form
the foot of this Highest Person who is in relation to the

Hence the word, Jyotis, refers to Him, as the cause of the
creation, etc. of the world and as higher than all objects. And,
in the teaching that this Jyotis is one with the digestive heat
of the stomach, there is nothing wrong ; because the oneness
is enjoined for the purpose of meditation for attaining the
desired result. The Highest Person is the only cause of the
world. He possesses an extraordinary devine colour, that is
peculiar to Him and not a modification of the Prakrti. He
possesses a divine form. He is beyond darkness (i.e. Prākṛta
world). He has unsurpassed lustre. Hence it is right to say that
He who is denoted by the word Jyotis, lives on the back of all
the worlds, on the back of everything and also in all the
higher worlds than which there is no higher.

If it be said that on account of the metre (Gayatri)
being mentioned ( in the context, the light or Jyotis
mentioned above is ) not the Brahman; it is not
right to say so; because the teaching here relates
to the concentration of the mind on the Brahman
conceived as that same Gayatri; indeed the scripture
declares it accordingly.

In a former passage in the same context, the metre
known as the Gāyatri is mentioned in the statement The
Gāyatrī,3 indeed, is all this' (Chānd. III-12-1 ). Therefore
the Highest Person should not be taken to have been
meant in the passages quoted above. To this question
we say – This is not so. It is taught there that the
—
Highest Person is to be meditated upon as similar to
Gāyatri. The conclusion is that it is impossible for that which
is merely a metre to be in the form of all beings. Elsewhere,
also a word, which ordinarily denotes a metre, is used to
denote other thing in consequence of its similarity with
it. Vide the passage beginning with-'Now these five and
the other five' and ending with — this same is virāj' (Chānd.
IV-3-8).

The declaration that it has four feet namely the beings,

relation to the Highest Person who is here denoted by the

alone is right.
28. Upades'abhedanneti cennobhayasminnapyavirodhat
If it be said that, on account of there being a
difference between the teachings (given in the context,
what is denoted by the word Jyotis) is not the Brahman;
it cannot be right to say so; because even in both
those teachings there is nothing that is contradictory
of each other.

In a former passage in the same context, namely, 'His
three immortal feet are in the Highest Heaven' (Chānd.
III-12-6), the Highest Person has been pointed out clearly.
Here in the scriptural text, That jyotis which is beyond
the Highest Heaven' (Chānd. III-13-7), what is denoted by
the oblative case is the light that is related to the Highest
Heaven. Hence what is described in the former passage
cannot be recognised in this subsequent passage. It is not so ;

That which is denoted by the word Prana (is the
Brahman); because it is undetstood in the context.
-
The scriptural text is this : - Indeed, I am the Prāna
and the omniscient self; worship and meditate on me as life
and immortality" (Kaus. III-2). The doubt that arises
here is this-The above mentioned text teaches that Indra.
who is known as Jiva ( individual soul), is the object of
man's meditation which would give him the Moksa, most
beneficial one. He (Indra) alone is the cause of the world;
because the meditation on universal cause alone is the means
of Mokşa. The scriptural text in support of this is this-

To this doubt, the reply is this - This Being, who is

equation with the word Prāņa is the Highest Self characterised
above and other than the individual Self. Why ? Because it
is so understood in the sequal. The particular character-
istics of the Highest Self, such as Ananda (bliss), Ajara
(undecaying) and Amrta (immortal) are found in the Being,
who is denoted by the words, Indra and Prāņa. This is

In the beginning of the topic there is the statement,
Know me alone' (Kaus. III-1 ). Here Indra is denoted
as an individual self; because there are statements of
attributes such as killing Vrtra, etc.' The conclusion should
also be in consonance with this statement. This is not
so ; because there is in the context the mention of a
multitude of attributes belonging to the Self. The phrase
the attributes belonging to the self' means the attributes of
the Highest Self'. From the beginning to the end of the
sentence, it is seen that he who is denoted by the word, Indra,
possesses many attributes belonging to the Highest self.
The scriptural statements made in the outset, namely, 'You
yourself choose for me that boon, which you think most
beneficial to man' (Kaus. III-1 ) starts with the worship, that
is most beneficial to man. That this worship is of the
Highest Self is proved in the text, ' Thus knowing Him one
becomes immortal here. There is no other path " (Purusa
Sūkta 20 ). Similarly, the Supreme Self is the impeller of all
activities, in accordance with the passage He Himself
induces him to do good work whom He wishes to lead beyond
these worlds, etc." ( Kaus. III-8). So also He is the support

And the teaching in the context is, in accordance
with the view found in the scripture, as in the case of
Vamadeva.
All the words denote the Highest Self; because the
scriptures state that He transforms Himself into a gross being
having name and form. In order to make one remember
this, the Highest Self is mentioned here by the word,
Indra. Vāmadeva and others whe realised this truth of the
scriptures state accordingly. Vide 'After seeing this, the sage

If it be said, that on account of the characteristics
of the individual self and of the principal vital air being
mentioned in the context, there is no reference to the
Brahman here at all, it is replied that it cannot be
(right to say) so; because the worship of the Brahman
has a three-fold nature; because this three-fold nature
of His worship is taken for granted ; and because
here (i.e. in the present context also ) that (same kind
of worship ) may be appropriately referred to.
The characteristics of the individual self are mentioned
in the scriptural texts -' I killed the three-headed Tvāstra.'
(Kaus. III-1 ). In the same text are given the characteristics
of the vital wind As long as the Prāņa dwells in this body,
'
so long surely there is life ( Kaus. III-2 ). Therefore
it is presumed that the Brahman is not meant here.
It is not so. The words referring to the individual
self and Prāna denote the Highest Self; because the worship
of the Brahman has a three-fold nature. In another
context also it is meant to serve the object of teaching ofvedāntasāra:

the three kinds of meditation in relation to the Highest Self,
-namely, the meditation of the Highest Self in His own
essential nature, in His having the enjoyers or the individual
selves for His bo dy and having the enjoyable things and the
auxiliary things of enjoyment for His body. In the following
passage, namely, 'The Brahman is True, Knowledge and
Infinite' (Tait. II-1 ), the meditation of the Brahman in His
own essential nature is taken for granted. In the following
passages, — Having entered it, He became the Sat and the
tyat ' and ‘ while being the unchangeable one (Satya) and the
changeable one, He has nevertheless remained true to His
own nature' (Tait. II-6 ) , the meditation of the Highest
Self as having the enjoyers for His body and also as having
the enjoyable things and the auxiliaries of enjoyment for His
body is taken for granted. In the present context also, this
three-fold meditation of the Highest Se!f is mentioned as it is
appropriate. In the Sūtra I-1-2, the cause of the world, that
is denoted by the words, Existence, Brahman and the Self
is proved to be the Person other than the individual selves
and Prakrti. In the Sūtra I-1-25, the cause of the world
has been specifically determined to be the Highest Person11]

merges and by Him it lives.' (Chānd. III-14-1). What is

same passage He is said to be like ether.
The scriptural text, 'He is my Self within the heart
and smaller than a grain of rice' (Chand. III-14-3) declares the
being as dwelling within the minute abode. He is also de-
signated as having a minute size. Hence he is not the

(4) But who has understanding for his charioteer,
and holds the reins of the mind, he reaches the destination
of his journey that highest place of Visnu (Katha. I-3-9 ).
The scriptural texts, ' His three immortal feet are in the
Highest Heaven' (Chand. III-12-6) and Now that Light,
which shines beyond this Highest Heaven, beyond all the
things in the universe, beyond the whole universe, in the
highest world than which there are no higher worlds,' (Chānd.
III-13-7) state that the aspirant of Mukti (i.e. final release )
desires to reach the place of Visnu, which is higher than this
world of Prakrti and which is beyond the reach of the path
leading to Samsāra 2 This has been established in all the
Upanishads thus—

Visnu' (Tait. Sam. I-3-6).

• The person, who is seen in the eye, is the Self, said he.

characterised by Pleasure. Hence this must be the Highest
Self.
16. Ata eva ca sa Brahma
For that very reason that (ether ) is the Brahman.
Here Upakosala being afraid of Samsāra, made the
inquiry about the Brahman. Then he was taught that the
Pleasure was the Brahman and the Ether was the Brahman.

He is not the two others (ie. the Pradhana and
the individual self) ; on account of (the mention of )
particular attribute and the statement of difference.
He is not the Pradhāna, because of the particularisation
of the character, namely the attainment of the knowledge of
all through the knowledge of one. He is not the individual self,
because of the difference mentioned in the text 'He is different
from him (Jiva) who is different from Aksara' (Mund. II-1-2).
Here the word Aksara means the Pradhāna. The individual
self is different from the Pradhāna. The Brahman is different
from the individual self. Or the scriptural text quoted above
may be interpreted thus, taking the two words viz. Akṣarāt
and Parata in grammatical equation (Sāmānādhikaranya)-
The Lord is different from the Akşara, the 25th entity i.e. the
individual self who is altogether distinct from the Pradhāna
and its modifications.

The word, Vaisvānara, occurring in the scriptural text,
,
● Now you meditate that Vaisvānara Self (Chānd. V-11-6)
refers to the Highest Self. The word, Vaisvānara, applies
generally to the fire in the stomach etc. also ; but in this
context it refers to the Highest Self; because there is the
mention of the peculiar characteristics of the Highest Self,

is Agni Vaisvānara' (Pras. I-7), the word, Agni is used
in the same grammatical equation with the word Vaisvānara,
he is the abode of the Prānāhuti (oblation to prāna. i.e.
vital air) and there is the scriptural text, ' Abiding within the
person'. (S'ata. Br. 10-6-1-11) Hence he is not the Highest
Self. To this objection, this is answer. It is not so ; because
it is taught that He has to be meditated upon as having the
fire of the stomach, as His body. Moreover the fire in the
stomach cannot have the three worlds, as its body. The scrip-
tural text of the Vājasaneyins, This is the Agni Vaisvānara
same as the Puruşa (S'ata. Br. 10-6-1-11) teaches that the
Vaisvānara is the Person. The word, Person, without
any limiting conditions attached to it, applies only to the
Lord Nārāyana, the Highest Self. This is said clearly in the
text, beginning with The thousand-headed God' and

ending with, ‘ All this universe is the Person,' (Tait. II-II-1).

Jaimini
opines that there is no inconsistency
(because the word, Agni) directly (denotes the Highest
Self).
It is not necessary to hold that the word Agni' is
used here in the same grammatical equation with a view to
teach that the Brahman should be meditated having the fire as
His body. The word 'Agni directly refers to the Highest Self,
as He takes the foremost part among gods. Therefore,
Acārya Jaimini opines that nothing is contradicted here.

the sacrificial altar etc. So that the Prānāhuti (oblation to
Prāņa) which forms a helpful part of the Vidyā (medi-
tation) may serve the purpose of Agnihotra. This is the
opinion of Jaimini. The scriptural text in support of this view
is this :-‘ He who offers the Agnihotra knowing it thus
(Chānd. V-24-2). These views are acceptable. The names
of ācāryas are mentioned as a mark of respect.

Moreover, they record Him in this.
They recite the following scriptural text, Viz. The
brightly shining heaven is the head of the Self' (Chand.

in the body of the devotee at the time of Prānāhuti (the
offering of the oblation to Prāna). The conclusion is that the
head etc. of the devotee is the head etc. of the Highest Self.

The abode of heaven, earth etc. (is the Highest
Self), on account of (the use of ) the term that refers to
Him.
6
In the Scriptural text — 'In whom the heaven, the earth
and the sky are woven' (Mund. II-2-5), it is stated that He
is the abode or support of heaven, etc. Here the Highest Self
is so meant, because in the same text the word, ātman (Self)
is used via —' Know Him alone as the one Self (Mund. II-2-5).
The aspect of being the Self without any condition, has to be
applied only to the Highest-Person. This fact has been
supported by the scriptural text He is the Setu ( bridge) to

Immortality' (Mund. II-2-5 ). The scriptural text, ' Becoming
many' (Mund. II-2-6 ) does not exclude Him as possessing
the characteristics of the Highest Self. The S'ruti passage
‘ Though unborn, He is born as many' (Tait. Ar. III-13-1)
teaches that He is not born due to His past actions; but He
is born as and when He desires, on account of the love that
He bears towards His dependants.
2. Muktopasrpyavyapadesacca
And on account of His being declared that to
Him the released souls have to resort.
‘ Then, the knower shaking off good and evil and free from
stains, attains the highest equality(Mund. III-1-3). ‘ So the
knower being freed from name and form, goes to the Heavenly
Person, who is higher than the high' (Mund. III-2-8). Here
it is declared that He is to be attained by those, who are freed
from good and evil as well as name and form. Hence the
Highest Person is to be taken as referred to here.

also this is not the bearer of the Pranas (i.e. the individual

When he sees the other, the Lord, pleased well and His
greatness then becomes relieved from grief,' (Mund. III-1-2 ) .

the fruits of his actions, and the other shines in splendour
without eating. Hence, the Highest Self is referred to
in the context.

thus — Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, knows
nothing else, that is the Bhūman' (Chānd. VI1-24 ). That is
called Bhūman, while experiencing which pleasure one does not
see anything else as pleasure, does not hear anything else as
pleasure and does not know anything else as pleasure; because
there is the scriptural text, — But where one sees something
else, hears something else, knows something else, that is the
little (Chānd. VII-24 ). In the Mahā- Bhāratait is stated thus
—— The celestial heavenly chariots moving unrestrained, halls,
the pleasure grove of various kinds and the lotus-pools of
crystal water — All these, Oh dear, are hells when compared
with that abode of the Highest Self' (S'ä. 196-4). But he is
Ativādān who makes a supreme declaration by the means
of the Truth' (Chānd.III-16). The fact that he is Ativadin

could be reasonably maintained only on the acceptance of this
fact. The Ativādin (i.e. one, who speaks on High ) is one, who
is the object of his devotion, speaks of it as highly beneficial to
man. The word Bhiman, that is the counter term of the
‘little' speaks of the abundance of pleasure, possessed by
Him as stated above. What is denoted by the word
Bhūman, is the Highest Self; because the Bhūman is
said greater than the individual self. The word, Sam
prasāda occuring in the Sūtra means the individual
self. The scriptural text is this—— Then this is the
(Samprasāda) individual self' (Chānd. VIII-3-4 ). Consider
the text, ‘ But he is an Ativādin, who makes a supreme
declaration by means of the Truth (Chānd. III-16). What is
taught here is the Person, who is different from and higher
than the individual self, who is denoted by the word Prāņa.

• Oh Blessed Sir, In whom does He rest ? He rests in

mentioned and other scriptures, the attributes, such as
(1) resting in His own greatness ( 2 ) being the cause of the
creation, etc. of the universe and ( 3 ) being the Self of all
objects, are ascertained as belonging to the Highest Person.
Hence the word Bhūman, refers to the Highest Person.
AKSARADHIKARANA 3
9. Aksaramambarantadhrteh
The Indestructible ( is the Brahman ), on account
of His supporting that which is the end of Ambara
(ether).
The scriptural text says thus — 'O Gārgi, Brāhmanas
call that Indestructible (Aksara ). It is not gross, not of
atomic size' (Brh. 3-8-8). Here what is denoted by the term
' Indestructible' is the Highest Brahman, because He is said
to be the support of that which is the end (or the place of
merging) of ether. The scriptural passage beginning with
'O Gārgi, which is above the sky (Brh. 3-8-7) mentions the

ākāsa as the support of all changable things. It is again
questioned In whome is this ākāsa woven crosswise and
lengthwise ? ' ( Brh. 3-8-7). In answering the above question
the text — This is the Indestructible (Aksara ) ' ( Brh. 3-8-8)
says that the Aksara is the support of that which is the end
of Ambara (ether ) contained with wind. The purport of the
whole topic is this. The ākāsa which is said to be the
support of all changable things is identical with the Pradhāna
or Avyakta, the primitive cause and merging place of Ambara
(the ether) pregnant with wind. The Aksara (Indestructible
one) which is said to be the support of the Pradhāna is the
Supreme Brahman.
10. Sa ca pras'asanat
And this (supporting springs ) from command.
Such kind of support is said to have sprung from the
supreme command, in the text, ' Oh ! Gärgi ! In the supreme
command of the Indestructible, etc.' (Brh. 3-8-9). Hence
this Indestructible cannot be the individual self as well.90

the Highest Self, on account of the special attributes subse-
quently mentioned. In the subsequent passage, the subtle
ether is said to be the support of all the worlds and hence
to be of huge size. It is also subsequently said that the
city mentioned above is identical with the Brahman who is
Truth and that in the subtle ether which is Brahman-city
there are several desires (desirable attributes ). Then there are
inquiries as to what is this subtle ether and what are those
desirable attributes. Then the following passage in answer
begins with That is the Self, free from evil' and ends with
'whose wishes and purposes come true' (Chand. 8-1-5).
Here the subtle ether is the Highest Self. The desirable
attributes are His freedom from evil etc.
In the passage
,
'Within that is a small space. What is within that, should
be searched for' (Chānd. 8-1-1) the subtle ether and the
contents thereof are clearly mentioned to be searched for. This
fact has been clearly indicated. in the scriptural text 'Those
who reach the Highest Place by meditating upon Him and

On account of the movement above and of the
word (i.e. the scriptural statements); for thus it is
seen; and there is an inferential sign.
' Just so, all these people go to this Brahman-world
everyday, but they do not know Him' (Chānd. VIII-3-2).
This scriptural text says that every day all the people
not knowing Him, move above the subtle ether i.e. they
rest on Him. The word, Brahma-loka is used in the same
grammatical equation with the āhāsa of the subtle form.
The above mentioned_two facts help in determining
that the subtle ether mentioned here, refers to the Highest
Brahman. In the following scriptural statements also it
is seen that all people take rest on the Highest Self. 'All
these worlds take rest on Him' (Kath. II-6-1). The people
•
take rest on the Highest Indestructible' (Tait. II-1-3). The
word — Brahma-loka' is used to mean the Highest Person in the
scriptural passage This is Brahma-loka' (Brh. IV-3-33). We
need not go for any other external reference to prove this fact;

And on account of the fact that the qualities

That He is the support of the world is proved in
scriptural text, 'Now, He, who is the Self, is the bank, a
limitiary support' (Chānd. VIII-4-1). In this ākāsa of a
subtle form, are perceived the qualities that determine the
greatness of the Highest Self, the support of the world.
The qualities that determine the greatness of the Highest
Self, are stated in the scriptural text, 'He is the bank and

The word, Akāsa, has been determined to mean the

Therefore the word ākāsa is more familiar in denoting the
Highest Self endowed with the qualites such as true will etc.
than the ether.

self) (Chānd. VIII-3-4) and hence, this word ākāsa, refers

In a subsequent passage, occurs the statement, ‘ This

to the indivudal self. Hence, impossibility of any kind does
not here arise. Certainly, what is referred to in the context
is the individual self, as he undergoes the states of wake.
fulness, dream, and deep sleep etc. It is not so. The state..
ment_relates to the individual self of whom the true nature
has become manifest. The qualities, such as ' freedom from
evil, etc.' are concealed by the association of the bodies, that
are the products of Karman ( past actions ). When subse-
quently they (i.e. the released souls) reach the Highest Light,
then, their true nature manifest themselves and they
possess the qualities, such as, 'freedom from evil etc.' Such
an individual self is mentioned in the text mentioned
above. But the ākāsa of the subtle form is mentioned as
an ocean of many auspicious qualities, that could not be
ever hidden. Hence, the word, ākāsa, does not refer to
the individual self.

the purpose of explaining the power of the Highest Self in
granting the individual self his essential nature.

If it be said that the scriptures declare that He is

This is not the Highest Self, because the scriptures state
that He occupies a small place and that by nature He is very
small. Here the reply has been given already —— Because
the Brahman has to be meditated upon in that manner, and
because in the same passage the Brahman is said to be

The illustrious Bādarāyaņa thinks thus — Even the
gods, who are above men, meditate upon that Brahman,
because they also are regarded as suppliants. Such a thing
is possible for them, as they do not lose the memory of the
knowledge, that they have acquired formerly. In the Mantras
and Arthavādas of the Veda, the deities are praised as possess-
ed with body. In order to justify the same, the existence of
the body of gods should be accepted on the authority of the
same Vedic passages.
26. Virodhay karmanīti cennānekapratipatterdars anat
If it be said that it is opposed with reference to
the ritual performances; we deny this, on account of the
observation of the assumption of several bodies.
Suppose the gods have bodies. Then the individual god
cannot be present at the same time in all places. Hence,
there arises the contradiction as regards the ritual works.
It is not so ; because it is seen that Saubhari and others have
assumed several bodies at the same time.

If it be said ( that a contradiction will occur) with
regard to the words (i.e. scriptural statements); we say
no, since beings originate from them (as appears) from
perception and inference.
A contradiction will occur in the scriptural statements.
Because the bodies of Indra and other gods are effected with
several parts, they are not permanent. The Vedic words denot-
ing Indra, etc. are totally devoid of meaning during the periods,
which preceed the origination of Indra etc. or follow on their
destruction. And also the Veda itself will be non-eternal. It is
not so. The gods Indra etc. are created by the creator with
the guidance given by the Vedic words Indra etc. The words,
Indra, etc. do not mean any particular individual. But, as in
the case of the words cow etc., they represent a class and
species that bear the same form. Suppose the previous Indra
is destroyed, then the four-faced Brahman remembers the
particular form of Indra, etc. of former time and then

known ? (Reply) - Such a thing is known from the statements
found in Vedic scriptures and Smrtis. The Vedic scriptural
authority is this - The creator created the Sat and Asat (the
existent and non-existent things) by the guidance of Veda' (Tait.
By. II-6-2.) ' He said Bhatk. Then he created the earth
(Tait. By. II-2-4). The Smrti text is this-'In the beginning,
he assigned the several names, actions and conditions, to all
beings taking them from the words of the Veda' (Manu
Smrti I, 21) and so on.
,
28. Ata eva ca nityatvam
And for the same reason, the eternity of the Vedas
is established.

The creator Brahman recollects the meaning of the
words used in the Vedas. Then he creates the world.
Visvāmitra and other sages are the composers of the Mantras
as stated in the scriptural texts, 'He gratifies the composers
of the Mantras', and 'This is the hymn of Visvämitra'7]

(Tait. Sam. 5-2-3). Yet the Vedas, which are full of Mantras,
etc. retain their eternity. He the creator remembers with the
help of the words of the Vedās Visvāmitra and others of
the former time, who are capable of repeating the Mantras
without teaching. Then he creates the persons having the
same name and ability, who could recite the same Mantras
assigned to them. This happens after the Naimittika Pralaya.
These persons reveal the very Mantras etc. without any
fault. Thus it is established that the Vedas are eternal
and that the various persons mentioned therein are the authors
of the various Mantras.
How could then the eternity of the Vedās be established,
when the Vedās and the creator are destroyed in the material
deluge (i.e. Prākrta Pralaya ) ? The Sūtrakāra answers this
question thus :
29. Samananamarupatvaccavṛttavapyavirodho

And on account of the sameness of the names and
forms (in each creation of the world), no contradiction
arises even in the subsequent creation ; as it appears
from S'ruti and Smrti texts.vedāntasāraḥ

The world, that is going to be created, will have the
same name and form as it had formely. Hence, no
contradiction arises, even if the material deluge does take
place frequently. The Highest Person, who is the first
creator of the world, recollects the form of the world, as it
was before the deluge. Then He creates the world of the
same form. Then He hands over to the creator the
Vedas, which he remembers in the same order as it was
before. It is known from S'ruti and Smrti passages that
the first creator created the world in the same form as it
was before. The S'ruti passages are these-' The creator
Brahman created the sun and the moon as they were
before' (Tait. II-1-38 ). He who created the creator
in olden time and gave the Vedas to Him ' (S'vet. VI-18).

The Smrti passage is this : ' As in each rotation, the
various signs of the seasons are seen very same, so also is the
case with various things in each Yuga' 1, etc. (Visņu I-5-65).
•
1 Yuga means the age of the world. They are four- Krta, Treta,
Doapara, and Kali ; the duration of each is said to be respectively, 1,728,000,
1,296,000, 864,000, and 432,000 years of men. They together constitute a
Mahayuga.[8]

30. Madhvādişvasambhavadanadhikaram Gaiminih
Jaimini maintains that Vasu and other divine
beings are not entitled to practise Madhu and other
meditations (Vidyās) on account of the impossibility.
In the Madhu and other meditations, Vasu and other
gods are to be meditated and they have to be attained, by
resorting to those meditations. These gods cannot practise
these meditations; because they cannot play at the same time
the role of the agent and the object of the same meditation.
More over Vasus cannot be the object of desire; because they
are Vasus already. Therefore Jaimini maintains that, as they
have not the necessary qualifications, they cannot resort to
Madhuvidyā etc.

refers to the Highest Brahman. This passage refers to the
meditation on the Highest Light by the gods. The medita-
tion is already known as common to the gods and men. Yet
this special reference indicates that the gods are entitled to do
this particular meditation only and not other meditations
involving Vasu and other gods as the object.
32. Bhavam tu Badarāyaņostihi
Badarāyana opines that (these qualifications) exist;
for there is possibility (of such a contingency).
The blessed Bādarāyaṇa opines that Vasu and other
gods possess the necessary qualifications for resorting to
Madhu and other similar Vidyās. Vasu and others can

meditate upon the Brahman in their own form so that

their being Vasu. That the sun is the cause of the
creation, etc. of the world is stated in the scriptural text, 'He
stands in the middle alone' (Chānd. III-11-1 ). That the
Madhuvidyā represents the knowledge of the Brahman is stated
in the same context of the scriptural text, ' He, who knows thus
this Brahmopanişad' (Chānd. III-11-3). Therefore, what is to
be meditated upon there, is the Brahman in both the states of
cause and effect. Thus no contradiction arises; because in a
future age, they enjoy the position of Vasu, etc. and at the
close of their office they attain the Brahman.

The preceptor calls the disciple as ' Sūdra' at the time of
imparting the knowledge of the Brahman as seen in the scrip-
tural text, 'You have brought these, Oh Sūdra (Chānd. IV-2-
5). It is here indicated that grief arose in the disciple, as he
did not possess the knowledge of the Brahman. The word,
*S'adra' etymologically means, one who grieves'. It does
not mean him who belongs to the S'üdra caste. Why? It is
because of hearing a disrespectful speech. The phrase,
" on hearing a disrespectful speech about himself' means-
on account of hearing a disrespectful speech about himself,
who did not possess the knowledge of the Brahman. In
consequence of that, he approached the preceptor. The word,
&
$
' hi' used here refers to the cause that led Jānasruti to
approach the preceptor. He was called S'udra, not on account
his being born in that community. Therefore, it becomes
clear that those, who are born in S'ūdra caste, are not entitled
to practise the Brahmavidyā.
34. Kşatriyatvagatesca
And on account of Janasruti's Kşatriya-hood being
recognised.9]

Because the disciple was recognized to be a Ksatriya, he
was not addressed as a member of the S'ūdra community. In
the beginning of the scriptural text, it is stated that he was
the donor of many valuable things. Thus it becomes clear
that he was a Ksatriya ; because he made gift of many things,
plentiful cooked rice and many villages.
35. Uttaratra caitrarathena lingat
And on account of the inferential sign (occurring
in the subsequent passage ), namely, along with
Caitraratha'.
Regarding this Samvargavidyā in a later passage it
is seen that this Vidyā should be resorted to by Brāh-
maņas and Kşatriyas only. The scriptural text is this, 'Then
Suunaka Kāpeya and Abhipratārin etc.' (Chānd. IV-
3.5). Now Abhipratārin is Caitraratha and a Kşatriya.
That Abhipratārin was Caitraratha and also a Ksatriya
is made known by that word being placed in juxtaposi-
tion with Kāpeya. In a different context, the characteristics

of Caitraratha and also of a Ksatriya are found in a
person, who was associated with Kāpeya. The scriptural
texts run as follow – The Kāpeyas made Caitraratha perform
the sacrifice' (Tānd. By. II-12-5 ). ‘ From him there was
born the Caitraratha of Kṣatriya caste'. (S'at. Br. II-5-3-13.)
Therefore this disciple does not belong to the fourth caste.
36. Samskaraparamarsat tadabhavabhilapacca
On account of the reference to the ceremonial
purifications and on account of the declaration of
their absence.
In the beginning of the Samvargavidyā, it is stated thus,
'I will initiate you' (Chand. IV-4-5). Here the ceremony of
initiation called Upanayana is referred to. S'udra is not
entitled to practise the Brahmavidyā or meditation on the
Brahman, as there is declared the prohibition of such cere.
mony in his case. That he is excluded from the initiation of
such ceremony is stated in Manu X-126 thus, In S'udra
there is not any sin, and he is not fit for any ceremony '.

On account of the procedure, on determination of
its absence.
The scriptural text-' A non-Brāhmana pupil would not
be able to tell this' (Chand. IV-4-5) determines that the
desciple was not a S'üdra. The teacher also proceeded to
impart the Vidyā to him only on determination of this fact.
Hence S'ūdras do not possess the necessary qualifications.
38. Sravaņadhyayanarthapratisedhat
And on account of the prohibition of hearing,
studying, and learning the meaning of the Vedās.
In the case of S'üdra, hearing, studying etc. of the
Vedās are prohibited under the rule - Therefore the Vedās
must not be studied in the presence of S'udras' The
prohibition of hearing implies the prohibition of study also
in the case of S'udras.

Having concluded the intervening topic, the Sūtrakāra
continues the topic on hand -
40. Kampanāt
On account of trembling.
In the middle of the section dealing with the Person of
the stze of the thumb, it is stated - 'whatever there is,
the whole world, when gone forth, trembles from the Breath '10]

(Kath. II-3-2). The whole world including Agni, Vāyu, Sūrya,
Indra and so on, trembles from great fear of Him, who
is of the size of the thumb and who is denoted by the word,
Prāņa, as if the weapon Vajra is raised against it. There-
fore the Person of the size of the thumb is determined to be
the Highest Person.
41. Jyotirdars'anat
On account of the brilliance being seen (used in
the text).
&

The same context begins with, “ The sun does not shine
there' and ends with, By his brilliance all this shines '.
(Kath. II-2-15 ). Here what is denoted by the word, brilliance
is the unsurpassable Light. Hence, the Person of the size of
the thumb is the Highest Self.

• The Ether is the evolver of names and forms. He who

VIII.14-1). This āhāsa is the Highest Person, who is other
than the pure self mentioned in the context, by the scriptural
text, • Having shaken off the body,' (Chānd. VIII-13-1)
It is because He is designated as the evolver of names and
forms and unconnected with them. He is also mentioned as
endowed with the above-said attributes and immortality.
.

There is the teaching, That thou art (Chānd. VI-8-7).
Hence the individual self is not different from the Highest
Self. This doubt is removed thus-
43. Susuptyutkrantyorbhedena
On account of differences in deep sleep and
departing.
‘ Embraced by the intelligent Self, he knows nothing
that is without or within' (Brh. IV-3-21). Mounted by
the intelligent Self' (Brh. IV-3-35). Thus it is seen that

self is ignorant of the external and internal world. But here
the distinction manifests itself because the Highest Self is
said to be intelligent. Hence this Highest Self is different
from the individual self.
44. Patyadisabdebhyalk
And on account of the use of the words, ' Lord'
and so on.
The embracing intelligent Self is designated upon by
the terms, Lord, etc. Hence He is other than the indi-
vidual self. Subsequently this scriptural text occurs, 'He is
the Lord of all, the overlord of all and the Ruler of all',
(Brħh. IV-4-22). The doubt about the identity of the individual
self with the Brahman will be set aside in the Sūtra
I-4-22 explaining the oneness due to the fact that He is the
Self of these individual selves that are His body.

In the scriptural text belonging to some of the Vedic

tions in a metaphorical sense, the various means of meditation
as the chariot-rider, chariot etc. in order to teach their control.
There the body which is mentioned as chariot should be taken
as meant by the word Avyakta. Consider the text, 'Higher
than the senses are their objects etc.' (Kath. I-3-10). Here
the objects are mentioned as higher in the matter of control.
The subsequent passage, viz. ' The intelligent should supprss
his speech and mind' (Kath. I-3-13) teaches the same thing.
2. Suksnan tu tadarhatvat
But the subtle is the body ; on account of its
capacity.
The Avyakta (i.e. the unevolved Prakrti), that is of
subtle state, assumes the state of the body, and is capable of
entering into activities. Therefore the word, Avyakta, denotes
the body.
If the things that are mentioned metaphorically are
meant here, then why is it stated thus, Higher than the
Avyakta is the Person (Kath. I-3-11 ) ? The Sūtrakāra says
in reply thus-

Matter in its subtle state subserves an end, on
account of its dependence on Him (viz. the Supreme
Person ).
The individual selves and the body etc. are dependent on
the Highest Person. Hence they serve the purpose of helping
for the perfection of the meditation. Indeed the Highest
Person, being Inner Ruler, directs all the individual selves,
etc. for the meditation. Hence He is one of the means of the
meditation and occupies the foremost place of those that must
be brought under influence. He is also reachable by the
meditators. The scripture states thus, 'He occupies the
highest place. He is the Highest course' (Kath. I-3-11).
4. Jneyatvavacanacca
And on account of the absence of statement of its
being an object of knowledge.
There are no statements to prove that the Avyakta (i.e.
unevolved Prakrti ) is an object of knowledge. Hence it
cannot be the Avyakta of Kapila's School.

Should it be said that the text declares it to be

If it be said that the scriptural text beginning with 'It
is without sound, without touch' and ending with knowing
it.’ (Kath. 1-3-15) declares that Avyakta is the object of
knowledge, it is not so. The intelligent Self is referred to
in the scriptural text Knowing Him' who is read in the
context of the passage That Highest place of Visnu (Kath.
I-3-9 ). This Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine

The scriptural text 'The unborn one, red, white and

state that the Prakrti of the Sāmkhyas is the cause of the
creation, etc. of the world. It cannot be said, that on conside.
ration of the derivative meaning, viz. the absence of birth, the
Prakrti alone is understood here, because in this context,
the word Ajā has not been used in any particular sense, as in
the case of the word Camasa used in the text, 'The Camasa
with downward mouth' (Brh. II-2-3). Here the word
Camasa, is used in a special sense. The scriptural text in
support of this is this — — It is the head' (Brh. I1-2-3). The
apprehension of a particular thing by a derivative word is
due to the mention of its qualifying attributes.
9. Jyotirupakramā tu tathahyadhāyata eke

and ends with, ' From Him the seas and the mountains

from the Brahman and has the Brahman for its self. In
the context of the elucidation of this truth they read the
text The unborn one etc.' (Tait. II-10-5 ). Therefore it is

being produced by the Brahman. The non-sentient beings,
at the time of the deluge, give up name and form and remain
as the body of the Brahman. They are called unborn in
that stage. At the time of creation they take name and form
and hence they are caused by the Brahman. Consider the
following example - In the Madhuvidyā it is stated that the
sun, at the time of creation, assumes the state of honey'
and also the state of effect, as he becomes the seat of
those objects, that are pleasing to the taste of Vasu, etc. At
the time of deluge, he assumes a subtle form, that cannot be
indicated as honey' and he does not assume the state of
effect. The scriptural texts in support of this are

(a) — Verily the Sun, is the honey of the gods' (Chānd,
III-1-1).

remains alone in the middle' (Chand. III-11-1).

'He, on whom the five Five-things etc.' (Brh. IV-4-17).
Here it may be argued that the Prakrti is meant, because
there is a reference to its modification into twenty-five kinds;
however the Prakrti is not meant here. The words, 'On
Him indicate that He is the support of that Prakrti and is
different from that Prakrti. He belongs to a different category
over and above the twenty-five categories. The objects denoted
by the words, ‘ He' and ' ākāsa' are different from the twenty-
five varieties of Prakrti. The word even used in ' from the
mention of the number even indicates that the number
twenty-five is not meant here. The word ' Pañcajana' denotes
a class of things known by the name of Pañcajana. Pānini
states - The words denoting direction and number are
compounded with nouns provided the compound-word denotes
the name of a thing' (Pāņini, II-1-50 ). This is similar to

In the text of the Kānvās, the words, food of the food

gods worship as the light of the lights' (Brh. IV-4-16).
Here the word, light' used in the context along with the
five five-things refers to the sense-organs. The words
• The light of lights' mean the Brahman who is the Illumi.
uator of illuminators. Then the words, the five five-things'

understand the five organs.

Here the special character-
istics of the cause are not apprehended. But the special
characteristics of the cause are apprehended in the scriptural
text, The Self alone was in the beginning.' It thought,
may I creat the worlds' (Ait. I-1 ). Hence it does not arise

Should it be said that this is not so, on account of

before.
In the scriptural texts, 'He enjoys with the individual
selves' (Kaus. III-44) and Then with this Prāņa alone, he
becomes one' (Kaus. III-39), the Highest is not referred to ;
because there are stated only the distinguishing characteristics
of the individual selves and Prāņa. This objection has
already been answered in the chapter dealing with the
Pratardanavidyā. In consideration of the context, it has

That the individual selves are other than the body has
been stated in the scriptural text, ' They two, approached the

intended to teach that the Highest Self is other than the
individual selves. This fact has been proved by the question
and answer found in other scriptural text. The question
is this—— WWhere, O Bālāki, did this person sleep ? (Kaus.

view because after stating the views of the two schools mentioned
above, he introduced this view in refutation of those views. More-

The Brahman is the material cause also on account

under discussion and the illustrative example.
The Highest Brahman is also the material cause of the
world. He is not the instrumental cause alone. The scriptural
text says thus—— You are proud. Did you ever ask about the
Ruler (i.e. ādesa) by hearing whom theunheard becomes heard ?'
(Chānd. VI-1-3). It means ' By the knowledge of Him, who is

tive example here is the clay. The above mentioned truth
should be accepted so that the said proposition and the example
may not be contradicted. The word Ades'a used in the text
denotes the Ruler; because it means Him by whom the world
is ruled over. Thus the word, Adesa, means the Ruling
Person. The scriptural text in support of this is thus — — O
Gārgi, at the command of that imperishable etc.' (Brh. III-8-9).

transformd Himself into the form of the world, consisting of
various sentient and non-sentient beings through His will.
Hence, it is known that He is the material cause also of the
world.

that the Highest Self is known to be both the instrumental cause

The stainlessness and the true will are known to be
characteristics of the Highest Self. He is again said
to have created Himself into the form of the world,
which is the seat of endless evils that are opposed to the
above-mentioned characteristics and unfit to be the ambitions
of men. How can this contradiction be averted ? The author
of the Sūtras answers this question thus-
27. Parinamat
It is so owing to the modification.
No contradiction arises, as the scriptural text here
teaches the modification. The Highest Person in the causal
state has as His body the sentient and non-sentient beings in
a subtle state, that cannot be distinguished with distinct name
and form. He wills then that the sentient and non-sentient
beings, that are His body, should have distinct names and
forms. Then He separates from Himself all the sentient and
non-sentient beings, that constitute His body in a subtle state.
The scriptural authority is this He desired 'May I become
many' (Tait. I-2-6-2) ' He created all this' (Tait. I-2-6-2). He
entered the sentient and non-sentient beings that constitute His

body in the subtle state also and that are different from Him.
This is stated thus-Having created it, He entered it'.
(Tait. I-2-6-2). Then the scriptural text teaches that He has
transformed Himself into many forms ' He became Sat and
Tyat, defined and undefined, based and non-based, conscious
and unconscious, real and unreal; yet He remained as
real' (Tait. I-2-6-1). The above-mentioned texts teach that
He took the modification into many forms. Therefore no
contradiction arises. Even in the state of non-distinction
the individual selves and their actions are in a subtle state.
So states Brahina-sūtra II-1-35.
28. Yonisca hi giyate
He is sung as constituting the source also.
He is also called the source in the text — The wise perceive
Him as the source of beings' (Mund. I-1-6). Therefore He
is the material cause also.

If it be said that there would result the fault of

because there would result the fault of want of room
for other Smrtis.
There is the desire to look into other texts for support
in order to determine the meaning of the Vedānta passages.
Accordingly Vedānta passages, by the support of the Kapila-
Smrti, must determine the Prakrti to be the cause of the

Kapila-Smrti cannot be a supporting text. Hence, there can
be no any purpose of that particular Smrti text. It is not so;
because it results there being no room for other Smrtis, Manu-
Smrti, etc., that are not opposed to the Vedānta. It is true
that the Vedic texts require Smrti works for support ; however
when there are many other Smrti works agreeable to the
Vedic texts, the Smti that is opposed to the Veda, cannot
be considered as the work for support.

But Kapila, the greatest of the sages, does not accept
that doctrine of the other Smrtis. How then is it right to
say that other Smrtis are the works of support? The answer
is this-

be explained that the functions were of the presiding

On account of similar consequences in absorption,
the Vedanta texts would be inappropriate.
As the Brahman and the world constitute one substance,
it happens, that the Brahman, like the world, must undergo
modification during the absorption of the world in Him.
Therefore all the Vedāntic texts become inappropriate.
9. Na tu, drstantabhavat
Not so; as there are parallel instances.
It is not so. That the Brahman has, as his body, all the
sentient and non-sentient beings has been proved in the
scriptural texts, ‘ To whom the self is the body' (Brk. V-7-22
Mādhya) — To whom the Avyakta (the unevolved matter) is
he body' (Sub. 7). There are instances to show that good.
and bad qualities exclusively belong to Him and His body, while
He remains in the state of both the cause and the effect.
The illustrative example is this : - The man, in whose body

are the characteristics of the body. The pleasure, knowledge,
etc. stick on to the self alone. In the same way the ignorance,
different modifications etc. belong to the sentient and non-
sentient beings, that constitute His body. The Brahman,
who is the self of these sentient and non-sentient beings, is
faultless and all-knowing. He does not undergo changes and
possesses true will.
10. Svapaksadosacca
And on account of objections to one's own view,
(i.e. of the Sankhya system).
The Vedāntic view alone has to be accepted, as there are
faults in the Sānkhya view that accepts the Pradhāna as
the cause of the creation etc. of the world. In the school,
that accepts Pradhāna to be the cause of the creation, etc. of
the world, it is stated thus - The Pradhāna undergoes
changes in the presence of the Purusa, who always remain
immutable'. Hence, it is not possible to explain the
superimposition of the attributes of one object upon the

And in consequence of the unfoundedness of the
reasoning (i.e. the reasoning advanced by the Sankhyas).
The argument, namely, 'The Pradhāna is the cause of

Hence, the Pradhāna should not be held as the cause of the

If it is desired that the Brahman should be the corporeal
Self, because all the sentient and the non-sentient beings
constitute His body, then it happens that the Brahman
enjoys pleasure and pain, just as the individual self; and
because He has a body, there should not be any distinction
between the individual self and the Highest Self. It is not
so. The Brahman is surely distinct from the individual self,
as He possesses a host of auspicious qualities bereft of in-
auspicious ones. The experience of unliked things is not
due to the connection with the body; but it is due to the fact
of being dependant on others. In the world it is seen that the
ruler, who is independent, has a body, but does not enjoy the
fruits of the violation of his orders as his dependants are
compelled to undergo the punishment.

ARAMBHANADHIKARANA 6

The non-difference of the world from that Brah-
man follows from the scriptural statement that begins
with the word, Arambana.

The world which is caused by the Brahman is not
different from its cause Brahman. This has been understood
by the scriptural text dealing with His assumption of
various modifications and having different names for the
sake of worldly transactions through the verbal references.
The scriptural texts quoted as authority here are — ' A clod of
clay undergoes changes by assuming different names for the
worldly activities through the verbal references; Yet clod of
clay only is true' (Chānd. VI-1-4. ) ' Existence alone, my dear,
was in the beginning one only without a second.'
thought, ‘ may I become many (Chānd. VI-2-1). · All things
that exist have Him as the Self ; ' and That thou art, Oh
S'vetaketu ',' (Chānd. VI-8-7).

And on accont of the existence of the other (i.e.
the effect).
The effect exists in the cause. Hence, it is not different
from the cause. That the pot or plate had at a former
moment the shape of a clod of clay is generally experienced.
Therefore pot, etc. are apprehended to be the modifications of
a clod of clay.

If it be said, ‘not so, on account of the designation
of the effect as non-existent, (i.e. Asat)', we reply, not
so; on account of such designation being due to another
attribute, as appears from the supplementary passage,
from reasoning and from another verbal testimony.
The effect has been designated as a non-existent being at
that time, in the scriptural text, ' In the beginning, truly, there6]

was not anything whatever' (Tait. Br. II-2-8). Therefore the
effect does not exist in the cause. If such an objection
arises, we say-It is not so. The designation as a non-
existent being is due to the fact that the thing was with
different attribute, namely, with a subtle state which is
opposed to a gross state.' Why ? It is so apprehended
from the supplementary text, That Non-existent one
formed the resolve, may I be' (Tait. Br. II-28). Indeed
the resolve can be made by that, which is extant. The
reasoning also proves that the designation as non-existent is
due to the association with a different attribute'. Indeed
the substance, namely, 'The clod of clay', that is known to
have an existence always, is designated a non-existent being
etc. The illustrative example is this — The pot undergoes the
changes and assumes the positive states, such as a clod of
clay, the pot and the pieces of pot, that are mutually opposed
to each other. By this reason it is generally said that 'This
pot was in existence in a former time; it exists in the present
time and it shall exist in a future time'. Other scriptural
texts in support of this view are, 'Verily this was then un-
differentiated' (Brh. I-4-7) etc.

It is said in the scriptural text 'That thou art' (Chand.

Should it be said that it is not so, because it is

cause of the world. It is not so The Brahman becomes tlte

It follows as a logical sequel that the entire
Brahman enters into the effect or the text teaching
about His being devoid of parts wiil be contradicted.
It is stated that the Brahman, who has all the sentient
and non-sentient beings as His body, assumes the states of
the cause and the effect. Here the Brahman, who is thus
embodied has been held as ' not having any parts'. Here it
happens that the Brahman, taken as a whole, is transformed
into the effect. In the school that accepts that a portion of the

Brahman assumes the state of effect, the scriptural state-
ment, namely 'The Brahman has no parts' becomes
furious i.e. contradicted. Therefore the Brahman is not the
cause of the creation, etc. of the world.
This view has been refuted thus-
27. Srutestu Sabdamulatvat
But on account of the scriptureal authority it is
not so; because the Brahman's nature could be appre--
hended only by the verbal testimony.
This objection does not happen as scriptures have been
accepted to be the proofs. The nature of the Brahman can
be proved only by the means of scriptures. The Brahman is
distinct from other objects that could be established by
other proofs. Therefore no contradiction arises, if the
Brahman is possessed with powers unseen in other objects.
Therefore the result is this : - The Brahman is full in every
way of all qualities both in the causal state and in the state
of effect.' This is just as the Jāti ( class) of those who accept
it as a separate category, is full in each of the cows with
broken horn or hornless.

In the part of the Brahman there is neither the
inequality nor the cruelty; on account of the conside-
ration of something; for so the scriptures declare.
While creating the gods and others of different status in
life, He is neither partial nor cruel by temperament. The
inequality in creation by the Highest Self is due to the
Karmans or deeds of the individual selves. This is seen in
the scriptural text thus - He, who does good work,
becomes good; he, who does evil work, becomes evil'

If it be said, there are no deeds, because of the non-

One-ness is apprehended in the scriptural text, 'Existence
alone, my dear, was in the beginning ; One only' (Chānd..
VI-2-1). At that time, the individual selves were not extant.
Hence the Karmans or deeds do not attach themselves to
the individual selves. It is not so ; as the individual selves
have not a beginning, the stream of their deeds also have
not a beginning. This is reasonable. The individual selves
have not a beginning ; yet the scriptural text that states
the non-difference, only establishes the non-distinction due
to the absence of the name and form. The text is this

The Anumana (Pradhana) is not the cause of the
creation, etc. of the world, on account of the impossi.
bility of construction and on account of activity.
The construction of chariots, mansions, etc. cannot
be accomplished by the non-sentient beings, such as wood
etc. without being employed by a person, who knows how to
do them. And they could be made when they are employed
by the person, who knows how to do them. Hence the
Pradhāna, that is non-sentient being, that could be proved by
the inference only and that is not guided by an intelligent
person cannot be the cause of the creation, etc. of the world.

creation, etc. of the world in the same way as grass, etc. are
capable of being modified as the milk when they are eaten by
the cows; because in the case of bulls, etc., such a transfor
mation is not seen. Therefore the moditication of the grass etc.
into the milk etc. also is guided by an intelligent agent.

And if it is said as in the case of the person and the
stone; thus also the Pradhana cannot be the cause of
the creation, etc. of the world.
The self, by his presence, directs the Pradhāna to
create the world. This is similar to the case of a blind man
guided by a lame one. Another instance is the case of a
magnetic stone towards which the iron moves. Therefore the

Pradhāna need not be guided by an intelligent self. It is not

And on account of the impossibility of the
prominence with relationship as prominent and sub.

The origination of the world results from a certain
relation between the three Gunas as principal and subordinate
which depends upon the relative inferiority and superiority.
But, as in the Pralaya state, the three Gunas are in a state of
equipoise, none of them is superior or inferior to the
others. Hence, the creation, of the world would not take
place.

The expression, ' Being destitute of the power of know-

Suppose Pradhāna is inferred by some reasoning different
from the one so far refuted by us, even then, as it is devoid
of the power of knowing the difficulties such as the impossi-

The word Asamañjasa (untenable ) is brought here from
the previous Sütra. The word, Va (i.e. or) is used in the
sense of Ca (i.e. and). Completely unintelligible are the
views of that school, which hold the doctrine that the Tryanuka
which is big and long is formed from the Dvyanukas ( shorts )
and Paramānus ( atoms ).5 As a rule the parts, that possess
six sides, begin the formation of a bigger object in combination.
The atoms have no parts. Hence, they cannot have sides.
Things such as atoms, that are brought together without any
regard to their sides cannot produce a big object.

It is impossible to accept that first motion can originate
in the atoms. Therefore the conjunction of two or more atoms
is impossible to accept. Though there may be required the
maturity of the Adysta (ie the unseen principle ) in the indivi
dual selves, even then, the oceasional motion, that is caused
by the Adrsta, cannot have its origin in the atoms Suppose the
maturity is not required, then the motion should have been pro-
duced in the atoms even before. In fact, maturity is not newly
produced as a certain attribute in Adrsta. When regarded as
commandments, particular actions yield particular results.
Then at that particular time the individual selves attain that
fruit. This is called as a maturation. When no particular
time is fixed for such fruits, the maturation is the state of
being not obstructed by more powerful deeds. Adrsta has
the nature of granting the results, that are dependant upon
the nature of the actions. Hence, maturity does not find a
fixed place in all the individual selves at the same time;
because the various actions grant various results at various
times. The Lord can not be proved by the inference.

Suppose the atoms have no colour, because otherwise

the pot', is the thing ( pot) that is an object of the knowledge

31. Naikasminnasambhavat
Not so, on account of the impossibility in one.
The views of the Arhat or Jina, are not tenable, because
it is not possible for an object to assume simultaneously the
states of existence and non-existence, permanence and non-
permanence, and separateness and non-separateness. It is
also impossible to accept that a substance undergoes different
states ( Paryāyas) simultaneously, because the states such as
lumpness, potness, and the state of broken pieces etc. which
are said to be the objects of the cognition of existence
and non-existence, are mutually contradictory. The earth,
etc. undergo the states of pot, plate, etc. in different parts. It
is not possible to apprehend in the same substance, imperman-
ence and its opposing nature namely, permanence, because

And thus the non-entireness of the self.
Suppose the self is of the size of the body. When he
enters from a big body to the body of a small one, it happens
that he does not enter it with his full size but only partly.
Then it will happen that the soul is not complete in the small
body.

Nor it can be said that the contradiction does not arise,
as the self assumes a different condition through contraction
and dilatation; because this would imply that the soul is the
subject to change, like the pot, etc.

• The final size' means 'the size that exists in the state
of release'. The self then remains with the same size always
which is his natural size. Therefore the self and his size
must both be eternal and the soul must be of the same size
even in his former stages. Hence it will happen that if the
soul is of the size of the various bodies, then he must be
imperfect in those bodies.

And on account of the impossibility of agency.
Indeed, in the school that proves the existence of the Lord
by inference, it is stated that the Lord is only the agent. This
statement is not acceptable. If it were so, it happens that a
bodiless Lord cannot be the agent of the Pradhāna. But
suppose the Lord has a body ; it is nowhere indicated, that
His body is generated. Suppose He has limbs, and yet is
eternal; then no contradiction arises in accepting the earth,

If it is said that He is the agent as in the case of

The bodiless Lord is the agent of the Pradhāna as in the
case of the individual self that rules the sense-organs and the
body. It is not so. The activity of the individual selves
with the rulership over the organs and body is due to the
effect of their past good and bad deeds and is for the sake of
enjoyment of pleasure and pain. The samething will happen

And there is not the origination of the instrument

The agent is the individual self. The instrument is the

this – From Him, is produced the breath, the mind and all

Vāsudeva takes the incarnation on His own will, is said in the
scriptural text. He is unborn ; Yet is born as many' (Tait.

VIYADADHIKARANA 1
1. Na viyadasruteh
The spatial ether is not produced on account of
the non-hearing of its production.
The spatial ether is not generated, because there are not
heard the scriptural statements on its production. It is not
possible to hear from the scriptures the origination of it which
has no parts, just as in the case of the self.
2. Asti tu
But there is hearing about the production of the
spatial ether.vedāntasāraḥ

It is heard that the spatial ether is a product. Indeed,
the very same scriptural text, which treats of the objects, that
are beyond the congnizance of the sense-organs declares
that the spatial ether is a product – The Spatial ether
is produced from the self (Tait. II-1-2) But the individual
self is known not produced because the scriptural statement
'He is not born' (Kath. I-2-18).

The scriptural text here, has a secondary mean-
ing, on account of the impossibility and of the verbal
authority.

Fire is mentioned as the first product in the text, ' It
sent forth fire' (Chānd. VI-2-3). Hence, the text, The
spatial ether is produced' (Tait. II-1-2), is to be taken in the
secondary sense. It is so also because there is the text, ' The
wind and the spatial ether. This is Immortal' (Brh. II-3-3).

4. Syaccaikasya Brahmasabdavat
A word may be used in different senses, as in the
case of the word, Brahman.
The word, Sambhūta is used in a secondary sense with
reference to the spatial ether, and in its original sense with
reference to other objects. This discrimination is quite
possible when the same word is referred to in a further text,
just as in the case of the word which is actually uttered in
other place. Consider the following for instance — The word,
Brahman, is used in the secondary sense in the text, ' From
Him is born this Brahman, name, form and food' (Mund. I-10).
Here the word Brahman denotes the Prakrti in the secondary
sense. But in other text it is used in the primary sense ; vide
• The Brahman swells on His thought' (Mund. I-9).
This view is refuted thus-

The proposition, mentioned in the scriptural text, ' By

are the effects produced by the Brahman and they are not
different from Him.

This follows from other texts.

The scriptural text, namely, “ The ether is produced '
makes one understand that the spatial ether is created. This
statement cannot be over-ridden by the absense of the word
‘ ākāsa' in the text, ' He produced the fire', which declares
that the fire was the first among the creatures.

made as regards the creation of fire, etc. are intended to
include also the creation of all other creatures. In the popular
usage, some one has said first, ‘All these ten are the sons of
Devadatta'. Then he mentions some of them as born from
Devadatta.

TEJODHIKARANA 2
The effects that are said to have been produced with the
mediation of the ether etc. are produced directly by the
Brahman. To establish this truth, the Sūtrakāra raises the
following objections to answer -
10. Tejotastathahyaha
Fire is produced thence, for thus the scripture
declares.
The fire is originated from the wind alone and not
directly from the Braman, because the scriptural text states
thus—— From wind the fire is produced' (Tait. I-2-1-2).

world; because there are indicative marks namely His
contemplation.

There is the expression in the phrases, ‘The fire thought
(Chānd. VI-2-3 ) and The water, thought' (Chānd. VI-2-4)
which resemble more or less the other text That thought may
I become many' and furnish the token of the universal cause
i.e. Highest Self. This text proves that the Highest Self is the
direct cause of the creation, etc. of the world; because He has
fire etc. as His body and is denoted by the words fire etc.

The contrariety of the order of succession is

Him (the Brahman).
The order of succession in a different form is stated in
the scriptural text, From Him is produced the vital wind,
the spatial ether, wind, fire and water' (Kath. II-1-3). From
this statement it is clear that the creation proceeds direct
from the Brahman. Therefore it follows that the crea.

in the other S'ruti
passage. Therefore this text also
states the creation in certain order with mediation. It is
not so ; because the statement, ' From Him is produced
(Mund. II-1-3), is common in regard to the creation of the
substances beginning with the vital-wind and ending with the
earth. Therefore the Highest Self only is the direct cause of
fire, etc.

In the statements The fire thought, etc.' the words,
Fire, etc., refer to the well-known popular fire etc. They are
used in secondary sense in the case of the Brahman. To
this objection the reply is stated thus:-

But the terms which are connected with the
things movable and immovable, i.e. denoting those
things, are non-secondary (i.e. of primary denotative
power, with regard to the Brahman); since their
denotative power is effected by the being of that
Brahman.
;
Those terms which are connected with things movable and
immovable, i.e. the terms denoting those things, refer to the
Brahman in the non-secondary sense, i.e. in the primary
sense. According to the scriptural text 'Let me enter as
the soul and separate out name and form' (Chānd. VI.
3-2) the Brahman enters all the things as their soul and
gives them separate names and forms. But the people
ignorant of this, use the words in a portion of their full
meaning.

The self is not born; because he is thus heard from
the scriptural texts and on account of eternity, which
results from them.
JÑĀDHIKARANA 4
19. Jñota eva

The self is not born, because we hear Him unborn from
the scriptural statement, ' He is neither born nor dead' (Kath.
I-2-18 ). He is also apprehended to be eternal; because there
are the texts, ‘ Eternal among the eternals' (S'vet. VI.13) etc.
For the same reason, the individual self is in-
variably the knower.
The self, either in the state of bondage or in the state of
Mukti (i.e. final release), is invariably the knower. Thus he
is heard from the scriptural text, 'Now, he who knows, 'let
me smell this? ‘he is the self' (Chānd. VIII-12.4). Hedvitīyādhyāye tṛtīyaḥ pādaḥ

— The mind is his divine eye' (Chānd. VIII-12-5).

And on account of his going up, moving and
returning.
The individual selves are atomic in size; because the
scriptures state that they go up leaving the body, that they
move and that they return to the body.
21. Svatmana cottarayoḥ
And on account of the latter two being effected
through his very self.
The moving and the returning must be taken as effected
by the self himself. Hence the individual selves are deter-
mined to be atomic in size.

If it be said that the individual selves are not
atomic in size, on account of the scriptural statement
of what is not that ; we say no, on account of the other's
being in the topic.
The individual selves are not atomic in size; because
there is the scriptural text, 'Verily He is infinite, unborn
Self' (Brh. IV-4-22 ). This is not so, because the context
refers to the Highest Self. This is seen in the text, ' By whom
this Self is understood and meditated' (Brh. VI-4-13).
23. Svasabdonmanabhyam ca
And on account of the use of the word referring to
him and his measurement.
The word 'atomic' is used in the scriptural text, ' This
self of atomic size (Mund. III-1-9 ). In another text the
self is described thus - He is of the size of the point of a
goad or even subtler than it' (S've. V.9 ). Hence the self is
atomic in size.

The self, who is atomic in size, experiences the sensa
tions extending over the whole of the body. In this regard
the arguments advanced by other school of thought are
thus-
24. Avirodhascandanavat
There is no contradiction, taking the case of the
sandal-ointment for instance.
A drop of sandal-ointment, although applied to one spot
of the body, produces the refreshing sensation extending, all
over the body. Same is the case with the self also. Hence
no contradiction arises.
25. Avasthitivaisesyaditi cenna, abhyupagamaddhrdi hi
Should it be said that the case is different on
account of specialisation of abode; we say no, on
account of the acknowledgment (of a place for the self,
viz. the heart).

If it be said that the case is different, because the drop of
the sandal-ointment is in contact with a definite part of the
body ; we say-this is not so; because the self also abides in a
part of the body. It is an accepted fact that the self abides
in the heart. In support of this statement, there is the follow.

the Prāņas, the person of light consisting of knowledge
(Brh. IV. 3-7).
The author states his own view thus :-
26. Gunadvalokavat
Or through his quality, like the light.
The self experiences happiness by pervading the whole
of the body through knowledge, which is his attribute. This is
similar to a gem, etc. that enlighten all the space pervading
through their own light. Thus the scriptural text says

thus :

There is distinction as in the case of the smell;
thus scripture declares.
There is distinction between the knowledge and the self ;
because the knowledge is apprehended as the attribute of the
self, in the notion, 'I know'. This is similar to the smell,
which is known as a quality of the earth by the notion ' the
earth has the smell. The scriptural text, namely, This
person knows' also proves this,

The self is taught to be different from the knowledge in
the scriptural text, ' There is no cessation of the knowledge of

How then is it possible to explain the statement that the
self is only mere knowledge, as found in the scriptural text,
'He is the only knowledge' (Brh. IV-3-7).
It is replied thus :
29. Tadguņasāratvāt tu tadvyapadesah prajñavat
But the self is designated as the knowledge ;
because he has that knowledge for his essential quality ;
as in the case of the intelligent Highest Self (Prajna).
The self is designated as knowledge; because he has
knowledge as his essential quality. As regards the intelligent
Self (Brahman), it is so stated in the scriptural text, 'The
Brahman is the Truth, knowledge' (Tait. I-2-1).

No mistake arises in such designation, since the
quality of knowledge exists in the self, as long as the
self exists ; this is so observed in the scriptural text.
No mistake arises, when the self is designated as the
knowledge ; because that knowledge is seen through out as the
essential nature of the self. Indeed, it is seen that a cow with
broken horns is designated as cow, on account of its particular
characteristic appearing through out as its essential nature.
How could it be said that the knowledge is always
associated with the self as long as he exists, when it is absent
in him at the state of deep sleep (i.e. Suşupti) ?
In reply it is stated thus:-

The knowledge, that is in existense does not manifest

the youth though it was in existence even in the boyhood.

restriction. By following the same line of argument, the
non-consciousness also would always take place. When the
knowledge is apprehended, it cannot be prevented by other
reasons. The same mistakes arise in the school, that accepts
the self is identical with knowledge that arises occasionally
and is omnipresent. All the selves are extant everywhere.
What is common to all these selves is that the knowledge is
produced when they are brought in contact with the mind
(Manas) and so on. Nor it cannot be restricted by Adysta,
because it is produced in all the individual selves. If it is argued
that consciousness and non-consciousness are opposed to
each other and therefore it may cause consciousness or non-
consciousness only. In that case either consciousness or
non-consciousness only will necessarily take place.

The individual selves do an act or abstain from doing
it, out of their own will. Then the Highest Self taking
into account the individual soul's effort resulting the activity
and abstinence, aids the individual selves in their efferts
by granting his permission. This fact is known from the
non-meaninglessness of injunctions and prohibitions, punish-
ment and favour of the Lord. A weak person cannot carry a
heavy load of wood etc. himself. Yet he carries the same with
the help of a strong man and comes in the scope of the Vidhi

Brahman. Otherwise also that the Brahman is one with

individual selves in the text, ' Brahman are these fishermen
etc.' (Brahma-Sūkta) because He is pervading all the individual
selves. Both these statements (i.e, difference and non-differ-

Permission and prohibition result from the connec
tion with the body, as in the case of the fire etc.
Though all the individual selves form the part of the
Brahman, the permission and exclusion of some of them regard-
ing the study of the vedas etc., are possible; because they are
ordained in consideration of the connection of each individual
self with a distinct body of Brāhmana etc. This discrimination
is similar to the case of the fire in the S'rotriya's house or
in the cremation ground.
48. Asantatescāvyatikaralk
And on account of the separateness of each self in
each body, there is no confusion.
Each of the individual selves is separate in each body
and is atomic in size. More over in each body he is limited.
For this reason, there is no confusion in regard to the know-
ledge, happiness etc. This fact could not be maintained by

Should it be said that this is possible owing to the
difference of place ; we deny this on account of the
inclusion of all places in it.
Suppose it is stated that this is possible, as the Brahman's
particular place due to a limiting condition becomes the
individual self. It is not so ; when the limiting adjuncts move
about, all the places of the Brahman become the subject of
limitation.

Thus the Pranas (sense-organs) also are not
created.
The individual selves are not created; because there are
scriptural texts to prove that they are not produced and they
are eternal. Same is the case with the sense-organs also. It
is taught in the scriptures that, at the time of the Pralaya
(the deluge ) , the Prāņas did exist. The scriptural text is
this-—— The non-being ( Asat) alone was in the beginning.
Those sages in the beginning were, indeed, the A'sat (i.e.

It is not so.

The plural number is to be considered in a
secondary sense; because it cannot be in the primary
sense and since the Highest Self alone is declared to
have an existence before the creation.
There are scriptural texts to show that the Highest Self
alone was in existence before creation. The words 'sages' and
‘ Prāņas' refer to the Highest Self only. Because He cannot
be designated with a word in plural number, in the scriptural
statement the plural number is to be considered as used
instead of the singular number in a secondary sense.

But the hands, etc. are also the organs; since they
also assist the self when he abides in the body. There -
fore it is not so.
Hands, etc. are also organs; because they also assist
the self, when he abides in the body. Therefore the organs
are not seven only; but they are eleven. The scriptural
statement is this-' Ten are these organs in person and
Atman is the eleventh' (Brh. III-9-4). The organs are
ten and one' (Bhag. Gī. XIII-5). Buddhi, etc. are different
functions of the Manas (mind). The scriptures mention
the movement of the seven sense-organs and specify them.
This is due to the fact, that they are prominent among
the group.'

Prana is neither the mere wind nor its function;
on account of its being stated separately.

nor its mere functions; because it is taught separately in the

But it is like the eye, etc., on account of being
mentioned along with them and for other reasons.
The Prāņa is distinct from the mere wind ; but it is not
an element completely different from it, like fire, etc. The
wind itself has taken the form, that is useful in sustaining
the body and is helpful for the functions of the individual
selves, like the eye, etc.; because it is mentioned in the
scriptural text along with the eye, etc. It is also equally help-
ing the individual selves, like the eye etc. and is important
among them.

And no objection arises on account of the absense

defect arises on the presumption that it has no any action,
which may be helpful to the individual selves. Verily the
scriptural texts declare that it functions so that the body

It is designated as possessing five-fold function

The scriptural text, that states that the Prūna is created
different from the sense-organs is this-From Him
is originated Prāņa, mind and all the sense organs' (Mund.
II-1-3). It is also thus because the functions of the Prāņa do
not stop, even when the sense-organs cease to function. Hence
the sense organs and the Prāņa possess distinct characteristics,232

But the assignment of the names and forms be-
longs to Him, who does Trivrtharaņa (combining the
three elements) ; on account of the scriptural teaching.
The assignment of the names and forms such as gods etc.
belongs to the Highest Self alone, who has for His body the
four-faced god ( the creator ) ; and not to the four-faced god
himself. This is so because the scriptural text teaches that
the assignment of the names and forms was made by the same
who did the Triortkarana (combining the three elements ).
The scriptural text is this-'Let me differentiate names and
forms and let me make each of them as combination of the
three elements (Chānd. VI-3-2). But the four-faced god
cannot do himself the Trivrtkarana. First is created the egg-
shaped universe out of fire, water, and food combined together.
Subsequently the four-faced god is created. The Smrti
text is this —— That egg-shaped universe of golden colour

mode of modification of the food etc. taken by men living in
the egg-shaped universe, the modification being different from
the Trivrtkarana Otherwise the flesh and the mind ( Manas)
which are smaller in size than the excavated matters, must have
the character of fire and water. If it were so, it contradicts
the statements, Food taken is formed into three (Chand.
VI-5-1) ; because the earth alone is said to become into the three

respect of the three-fold modification of the other two, namely,
fire and water. Therefore it is stated thus - The flesh, etc.
are of earthy nature. In the case of the other two, it has to be
considered according to the text.' Indeed it is stated here
that the flesh and mind, have an earthy nature, like the

the same way the marrow and speech are of fiery nature, as

And on account of the going out of the Pranas
( with the individual selves).
• When the Prāna (the self) departs from (the body)
all the Prānas pass away following him' (Brh. IV-4-2)
The sense-organs pass out the body along with the individual
self. It is, therefore, apprehended that the sense organs depart
from the body along with the subtle form of the body
which is the seat of them.
4. Agnyadigatisruteriti cenna, bhaktatvat
If it be said that it is not so on account of scriptural
statement as to their going to Agni (fire) etc ; we say
no ; on account of the secondary nature of the
statement.

As the texts, ‘ when the speech of the dead goes into fire '
(Byh. III. 2-13) etc. declare that when a person dies, his organs
go into fire, etc. Hence they do not accompany the individual
selves. This question is not correct. Here the words, speech
etc., have the secondary meaning, namely the divinities
(Agni etc.) who preside over them; because the text continues
to say — The hairs of the body enter into the herbs '. (Brh.
III. 2-13). The hairs do not enter with the visible form into
the herbs.
5. Prathamesravanāditi cenna, tā eva hyupapattely
Should it be said, on account of the absence of
mention of the water in the first instance the waters do
not go ; we say no; for just that is meant, on the ground
of appropriateness.
6
The waters do not go with the individual selves, because
the scriptural texts do not mention waters in the first instance
( in the fire of heavens ). In the scriptural text, ' Into that fire,
the Devas (senses) offer S'raddha as oblation' (Chand. V. 4-2)

so. Only water is meant by the word, S'raddhā, because
to the question relating to the water, the reply must be on the
water itsef. This reply is sensible only if the water is meant
by the word S'raddha. There is scriptural text also' S'raddhā,
indeed, is water' (Tait. Brāh. III. 2-4-1 ).
6. Asrutatvāditi cenna, istadikarinam pratitek
If it be said that the self is not stated in the scrip-
ture ; way say ' it is not so '; because those, who perform
sacrifice etc, have been understood there.
If it is said that water alone is understood by the question
and answer in this context and not the individual selves, that
are embraced by the subtle rudimentary elements ; we say it
is not so ; because in a subsequent passage of the text is men
tioned the route taken by those selves who perform the sacrifices
etc. The text is this — — But those who in the village perform
sacrifices, dig wells, etc. and grant gifts' (Chānd. V. 10-3).
There is another scriptural text 'By that oblation he becomes
King Soma' (Chānd. V. 4-2). Here that, who is denoted by the
word 'water' connected with the fire of Dyuloka (the heavens),

is mentioned as becoming the King Soma. The same that
has assumed the state of King Soma is recognised in the
scriptural text 'King Soma' (Chand. V. 10-4). Therefore
by the word, water, is meant the individual self, who is
embraced with the water and has it for his body. This is

idea is that he becomes the means of enjoyment of the
gods ; because he is other than the realizer of the Self. Accord-
ingly it has been stated in the text — He is like an animal for
the gods,' (Brh. 1-4-10 ). This statement reveals that he
is the means of enjoyment of the gods. The following1, 2]

Smrti text also says that the realizers of the Self and the non-

Person and of the gods respectively —— Those, who worship
the gods go unto the gods and those, who worship Me, go unto

On the exhaustion of the Karmans, the selves
descend with a remainder of Karman, according to the
Vedic texts and Smrtis. The descent is by the same
route of the ascent and also not so.
It is understood by the scriptures and the Smrtis that on
the exhaustion of Karmans, the self returns to this world with
a remainder of the Karman whose fruits he has not enjoyed.
The scriptural text is this-Those, whose deeds are good,
are born in good families' (Chānd. V. 10-7 ). The Smrti texts244

are these —— Afterwards when a man returns to this world, he
obtains, by virtue of a remainder of Karman, birth, form
(Apa. Dha. Sūtra II. 1, 2, 3) and so on. The descent takes
place partly through the route of ascent and partly by
a different route.
9. Caraņaditi cenna, tadwpalaksanartheti Karsnajinik
Should it be said that it is not so on account
of the term Caraņa ; not so, since Caraņa connotes the
Karman also: thus Kargnājini thinks.
The word, Caraņa, occurring in the passage Those,
whose deeds are good' does not mean the remainder of
Karman, because it is generally used in the sense of Smārtācāra
(i.e., general conduct, described in the Smytis). Therefore
the self is not followed by the remainder of his Karman.
This is not so. In the scriptural text the term Carana
connotes the remainder of Karman also ; because the pleasure
and grief are the result of such Karnan only.

Should it be said that there is no purpose; it is
not so, on account of the dependence of Karman on
the conduct.
No purpose is served as there is no use of the conduct
mentioned in the Smrtis. It is not so; because all the good
works are dependent on the conduct. Because it is stated
thus—— He, who does not worship Sandhyā, is always impure,
and he is unfit for any religious work'. This is the view
of Kārsnājini.
11. Sukrtaduskrte eveti tu Badarik
But Badari thinks that the word Caraņa means
good and evil works only.
The word, Carana, occurring in the text ' Ramanīya-
caranāk and Kapūya-caraņāk' means good and evil actions
as evident from the usage 'he does the works of good nature.'
This has been opined by Bādari. Sūtrakāra accepts this view

As the rice etc., are already animated by other selves,

there is no mention of the cause of the birth as rice etc. just

While descending, the individual selves descend with
their impure actions; because when they performed sacrifices
in former generations, they committed injury to living beings,
that were offered in Agnisoma and other sacrifices. It is not
so. Slaughtering the animals in sacrifices is not of an
injurious kind. This is stated in the text, ' with a golden

the creator (Brh. IV. 3-10).

And some state that the individual self is the
creator and the objects of creation are the sons etc.
The followers of some S'akhā state, in their text, that
the individual self is the creator of the objects experienced
in dreams. The text is this-' He is the person, who is awake
among those that sleep and he is creating various Kāmas
(desired objects)', (Kath. II. 2-8). What are meant by the word
Kāmas here are the sons etc. that are desired; because in the
previous passage it is stated thus — Ask for all Kāmas
according to your wish. It is explained further thus' Choose
sons and grandsons living for hundred years' (Kath. I. 1-23).

person who is in dreams and the creation continues only as
long as the dream lasts. Hence it is wonderful and is
called Māyā. True will etc. are the natural characteristics
of the individual selves; however, these do not manifest
themselves completely when the men are under the influence
of Samsāra. Therefore the creation in dreams is not possible
for the selves by their true will. The scriptural texts' He is the
creator' (Brh. IV-3-10) and The person is creating' (Kath.
.II. 2-8), do not refer to the individual selves, because there is
the following scriptural text in the same context, 'On Him all
the worlds do rest and no one exceeds Him' (Kath. II-2-8).

And that is due to the connection with the body.
The concealment of the natural characteristics of the
selves at the time of the creation is due to their connection
with Acit (the non-sentient Prakrti), that has assumed the
form of the bodies of men, gods, etc. At the time of the
Pralaya (the deluge), the concealment is due to their con-
nection with Acit (Prakrti) that has assumed a subtle state
which cannot be distinguished in name and form.

Indeed, dreams indicate the future auspicious and

Not, even on account of residing, is there any im

described as having two-fold characteristics.
No imperfection arises in the Highest Self, even though
He remains as an inner Ruler in the selves during the four
states, such as the waking, etc. In the scriptures and in
the Smrtis it is heard that the Highest Self possesses the two
fold characteristics, namely, the total absence of all the im
perfections and the possession of all good qualities. The texts
are — He is free from evil and possesses true will (Chānd.
VIII-1-5) ‘ Without any stain' (S'vet. 6-19 ). 'He, who under-
stands all and knows all' (Mund. I-1-9 ). 'He, in nature, is full
of all the auspicious qualities' (Visn. Pu. VI-5-84). Where
all evils, sufferings etc. do not exist' (Visn. Pu. VI-5-85).

Should it be said on account of different states,
• the imperfections cling to Him ; it is not so, because
with reference to each of the states, the texts say that
the evils are not in Him.
The imperfections do cling to the individual selves, though
they are in nature devoid of those imperfections; because the
selves are connected with different bodies. In the same way
the imperfections cling to the Highest Self also, as He is
connected with bodies as stated in the text, 'whose body is the
earth' (Brh. V-7-3) and soon. It is not so. As regards the state-
ment, ‘ whose body is the earth', there is the counter-statement,

• He is Your Self, the inner controller and the immortal ' (Brh.
III-7-3). This statement reveals that He is devoid of
imperfections.

The auti. 'tative scriptural text is thus — He is responsible
for the name and Form; yet He remains aloof between them,
(Chānd. VIII-14 ). He remains aloof between them ' means
'He is not connected with the name and form.'

The Brahman is of these characteristics like the

The scriptural text, ' Truth, knowledge, etc.' (Tait.

by nature. So also Brahman possesses the two-fold charac

of good qualities ' ; because the following countless scriptural
texts are not devoid of meaning-He is devoid of evils'

The word 'not' is supplied from the last Sutra. It is not so.
The Highest Self dwells within the earth, etc. as an immanent
ruler. The illustrative example only denies the increase and de
crease on His part due to such dwelling. This is understood in
this way, because then only the two illustrative examples in the
context could be reconciled. The spatial ether actually remains
in the pot etc. on the other hand the sun does not actually
remain in the water. This fact is stated in the scriptural text

' Indeed, as one and the same spatial ether' (Yājn. Smr. Prā.
144). The purpose of these two examples is to show that
just as the object actually not present is not stained by
imperfections, so also the object actually present is not
stained by imperfections for want of reasons. The examples
are meant to teach this fact alone. Consider the illustrative
example — The boy is like a lion '. This brings to our mind
the similarity, only in regard to some of the attributes meant

Or the word 'Dars'anat' may be interpreted in different
way as recorded in the scriptural text. Like the horse that
gives up its hair by shaking the body, he gives up the
sins (Pāpa)' (Chānd. VIII, 13 ). The horse by shaking
the body gives up some of the solid substances i.e. hairs
that are natural to it and constitute part of its body. But
the self once did evil works which though perished in a
moment, created displeasure to the Lord. The Lord began
to give him pains that were effected by His displeasure. But
these pains could be got rid of through His grace produced by
affection caused by the meditation. Hence non-attachment of
evils is what is thought of here.

Here the following objection arises - The Brahman does
not possess the two-fold characteristics; because His having
attributes has been denied in the scriptural text, ' Then this is

For, the text denies His limitedness supposed
to be apprehended in the context and it declares also
more than that.
It has been taught in the scriptural text beginning with
• There are two-fold forms of the Brahman' (Brh. II. 3-1),
that the whole world is the form of the Brahman, as this truth
was not known previously by other means. Therefore this
truth cannot be denied immedaitely by the subsequent passage
of the same text. Therefore the statement, 'Not that, not
that' denies the so-muchness of the Brahman to purport
that the Brahman's attributes are not only those mentioned
in previous passage; but there are more also. Then the
text also states the host of His qualities not stated above, in
the passages-There is none Great' except the Brahman,
who is denoted by the words, 'not that' (Brh. II. 3-6 ). Then
there is the text, 'Then He has the name Real of the Real'
(Brk. II. 3-6). Then its explanation given is this — Prānas

are real because they are not created like the ether etc.
Than these selves, the Highest Self is the Greater Truth ;
because His knowledge has no shrinking and other changes.
Hence the Brahman is said to possess the two-fold
characteristics, because His so-muchness only has been denied
in the scriptural text.
By the proof of perception is apprehended the Brahman
only, who is merely sat ( existence ). All the rest are illusory.
This is the meaning of the statement, of denial 'Not that,
not that '. (Brh. II. 3-6 ). To this objection the reply is this—
22. Tadavyaktamāha hi
That (Brahman) is unmanifested; for, so the
scripture declares.
The essential nature of the Brahman cannot be mani-
fested by any of the proofs. The scriptural texts state thus

And in perfect endearment the intuition of Brah
man takes place, according to scriptures and Smrti
texts.
There must be the uninterrupted meditation, which gives
the extreme happiness to the worshipper and by which the
Brahman becomes pleased. Then will be apprehended the
essential nature of the Brahman. The scriptural text is this-
'This Self is not reached by instruction' (Kath. I-2-23). The
Smrti text is this — Nor can I be seen by the study of the
vedas, etc.' (Bhag. Gi. XI.53 ).

in respect of their being apprehended. The apprehen-

As regards the perfect endearment, the practice of
meditation_must be repeated. Then in the devotee is
produced the apprehension of the essential nature of the
Brahman. Then what are apprehended here are all the
attributes of Brahman, such as knowledge, bliss and the wealth
of the world, without any discrimination. This has been
stated thus : ‘I have become Manu and the Sun' ( Brh,

In the Brahman are established the endless auspicious
qualities taught in the scriptural text, 'There are two-fold

the Brahman invariably possesses the two-fold characteristics.

Or in the manner stated above.
The word, ' Or' is used in the sense of discarding the
two alternative views mentioned above. It has been stated in
a previous occasion that the individual selves are the parts of
the Brahman, who is inseparably connected with them. The
individual selves are of the nature of adjectives to the Brahman.
like the light, class, quality and body are to the respective
objects. Same is the case with the non-sentient beings also ;
because the sentient and the non-sentient beings nre regarded
to be one with the Brahman by the use of a common term in
the text, ‘ Verily the Self is this whole world (Chānd. VII.
25-2). As regards the other two alternatives, it is not possible
to set aside the faults, that happen to be in the Brahman.
It has been proved in the scriptural texts, that the sentient
and the non-sentient beings have the character of adjectives;
because they are considered as the body of the Brahman

In the Sūtras 1-1-2 to III-2-29, the Supreme Brahman
is stated to be the primeval cause of the universe. Now a

is some thing higher than this Brahman. This doubt has
been introduced in the Sūtia-

Highest except this Self that is mentioned in the words ' not
that' (Brh. II-3-6 ). The Highest Brahman is designated as
bridge on His resemblance with bridge: because as the ruler, He
prevents the admixture of the worlds. Accordingly the following
scripture says — — Now, the Self is the bridge and support, in
order to prevent confusion in these worlds' (Chānd. VIII-4-1).
The Brahman alone, who is the instrumental cause and the
material cause of the world is to be attained as the Highest
object. This is stated in the scriptural text beginning with :
— All this world is the Brahman. He is its creator, destroyer
and protector. He is thus to be meditated upon with a calm
mind' (Chānd. III-14-1) and ending with — I shall reach Him
after departing hence (Chānd. III-14-4). The expression
'He has to be crossed' means' He has to be reached'.

Owing to the Brahman being associated with par-

by connecting Him with particular places. The light and
the spatial ether, etc. can be apprehended as that which
passes through the window and that which is encased within
the pot respectively.

And on account of its possibility.
It is possible to hold that the Highest Self, who is to be

can be reached' (Mund. III. 2-3 ) .

Except Him there is no other Highest Person, because there is
the denial of a highest person other than Him in the scriptural
text, — Except whom there is nothing highest and excedpt
whom there is nothing smallest or largest' (S'vet. III-9-7).
But there is another text, Tato yaduttarataram' (S'vet.
III-10-7). The meaning of this text is this — There is none
Higest except the Puruşatattva (the Reality of the Supreme
Person). Therefore the same Reality that is referred to in
the beginning of the context, is described in the concluding
portion of the context thus 'He is without form and without
evil. Those, who know Him, become Immortal. The others
suffer pain' ( S/vet. III-10 ). Thus has been concluded
with reason. The proposition that was made in the beginning
is this, — Having known Him thus, the self reaches something
beyond death. There is no other path' (S'vet. III-8). Other-
wise there will be contradiction to what is stated in the beginning.

The scriptural statements are the injunctions that ordain men

selves grant the rewards through what is called Apūrva.

But Bhadarayana holds the former view, on
account of the designation as the cause.
The revered Bhādarāyāņa thinks that the Supreme
Person alone grants the rewards as stated before. 'Let
him, who is desirous of getting prosperity, offer a white
animal to the deity Väyu (wind)' (Tait. Sam. II-1-1). 'He
alone leads him to prosperity' (Tait. Sam. II-1-1). These
scriptural texts themselves in ordaining certain rituals teach
that the deity Vāyu and so on, grant the rewards to men,
because they have the Lord as their Self. There is an established284

What is understood from all Vedanta texts is one,
on account of there being no difference in injunc.
tions, etc.
Each of the Upāsanas (meditations ) Dahara etc., though
taught in different texts, is one and the same; because the
injunctions, such as should know, should meditate', the
results, the forms and the names are common. This is similar
to the case of the works ordained in Vedic texts.

If it be said that the Vidyās are not one on
account of different mentioning ; we deny this, since
it is even in one.
The Vidyās are not one; because the same matter
repeated in the texts without difference, proves the object of
injunction to be different. It is not so. No difference is
apprehended in the object of injunctions; because the same
Vidyā could be repeated in different S' ākhās for the benefit of
different cognising agents.
3. Svadhyayasya ; tathatvehi samacaredhikaracca

Indeed, S'irovrata is a part of the mode of the
study of the veda; because then only its unavoidability
could be maintained; moreover this is so mentioned
in the work called Samacara. The rule laid down for
it, is similar to that in the case of the Sava homa.

The compulsory rule as regards those, who resort to
S'irovrata (i.e., vow of the head) has been given in the Atharva-
Veda thus-'To him alone the knowledge of the Brahman
must be revealed'. That S'irovrata forms a part of the mode
of the study of the Vedas, is revealed by the scriptural
text that connects it with the study of the Vedas, 'This
should not be studied by one, who has broken the vow'.
In the work called, Samācāra it has been stated thus-
This has been commented upon by the Vedavrata' (i.e., the
vow of the study of Vedas ). The word, Brahman, used in the
expression Brahmavidya, refers to the Vedas. S'irovrata
belongs to them only (ātharvanikas, ) just as the Savahoma.
Hence there is nothing to indicate that they are different
Vidyās.

The scriptural statements, themselves reveal the oneness
of the Vidyās. In the Daharavidyā of Chāndogayopanisad,
eight qualities of the Brahman are mentioned. But in the
Taittiriyopanisad they are merely referred to thus:—— That
which is within the Brahman'. (Tait. II-10-23).

Meditations 'thus being one and the same, there
is combination of qualities; on account of non-
difference of the purpose as in the case of what subserves
injunction.
Thus the Vidyās with the same titles being the same, the
qualities mentioned in one text are to be combined with those
mentioned in another, on account of non-difference of purpose.
This is as in the case of those which subserve the object of a

The meditation on the Udgītha viewed as Prāņa, is
ordained in the text of the Brhadāranyaka and Chāndogya
Upanisads resulting in the defeat of the enemy. Having re-
tained in the heart, the view namely, The Udgithavidyās men -
tioned in the two Upanisads are one and the same, the Pūrva-
paksin (the objector) puts forth his view as if held by the
Sidhāntin. The meditation on the Uāgītha viewed as Prāņa
in the Brhadāranyakopanisad has as its object that which is the
agent in the act of singing it out. In another text (i.e., Chando-
gyopanisad), it has as its object, that which is the object of
singing. This has been so understood in the following scriptu-
ral texts, Then they spoke to Prāņa of the mouth- Please sing
that for us. Saying ' So be it' this Prāņa sang loudly.' (Brh.
I-3-7). The statement in the Brhadāranyakopanisad shows
that the Udgīthavidyā has as its object that which is the agent

* They meditated upon Udgitha, that is viewed as Prāņa of the
mouth (Chānd. I-2-7). Thus it is stated in the objection
that the Vidyās mentioned in the two Upanisads are quite
different from each other. The answer is-It is not so.;
because they have a common beginning. In one text it is
stated thus' Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices by
means of the Udgitha' (Brh. 1-3-1 ). In another text also this
line occurs — The gods took the Udgītha, thinking they
would, with that, overcome the Asuras (Chānd. I-2-1 ).

the Udgitha is said to be the object of the meditation in the
text—— Let him meditate on the syllable Om' as Udgītha
(Chānd. I-1-1). Byhadāranyakopanisad begins with the
passage, ‘ Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifice by means
of the Udgitha (Brh. I-3-1 ). Here the meditation refers to
the whole of the Uāgītha as the object. Hence these Vidyās
are considered to be different from each other due the difference
in their forms. As regards the meditation on the Udgitha, in
the text of the same Sākhā, the Highest Self is viewed as of
golden colour and He is also viewed differently as possessing
the attributes of being higher than the high.
8. Sanjnatascet taduktamasti tu tadapi
If it be said so on account of the common term;
that also is there.
If the Vidyās mentioned in the two texts are held only
one, as they possess the common term of Udgitha, the common
term persists, even where the object of injunction differs.
Take for instance the term 'Agnihotra', which applies to

the Prāņavidyās taught in all the three texts, because the
Prāņa is said to possess the quality of being the oldest in all

The Highest Self is referred to by the term ātman

By the word, ‘Self' is apprehended the Highest Self.
This is understood in this way, because there are subsequent
passages, such as, It thought. Let me become many' (Tait.
I, II-6-2) that reveal the Lord's will to become many. It is
like in the case of the word Atman (Self) found in the text
‘ This world was before, only one ātman' (Self).
17. Anvyaditi cet syādavadharanat
If it be said, the word, Atman ( Self ) is used in
connection with other objects also, we say, it is deter-
mined that He alone is referred to in other contexts also.
The word, ātman (Self) used in the preceding occasions,
refers to Prāņamaya. How then can it be determined that
He is meant there, with the help of the subsequent passage ?

To this objection the answer is this. It has been ascertained
from the scriptural text, 'From the Highest Self originates
the spatial ether' (Tait. 1-2-1-2) that Prānamaya refers to
the Highest Self. Thus the Highest Self alone is determined
to have been meant here.

constitutes a dress for Prāņa. The Acamana (sipping of
water) has been stated thus – Therefore, having known this in
this manner, one should sip water before and after the meals.
This makes Prāņa not naked '. Here it is right to hold that

it is already established by good custom; but it is mentioned

19. Samana evam cabhedat
When some thing is common, there is no difference
in other qualities also.
In the Agnirahasya, and the Brhadāranyakopanisad
there are statements on the Sāndilyavidyā. In one text it
is stated thus-He should meditate on the Self, who is con-
ceivable in mind, who is in the form of Prāņa and light, who
has a true will and who is in the form of the spatial ether' (Vaja.
S'at. P. Br. 10-4-6-2). In the other text (Brhadaranyako:
panişad) it is stated thus — — This person who is conceivable in
the mind is in the form of light and truth, shines forth in the

interior of the heart, like the grain of rice and the grain of

the texts, He is mentioned as Manomaya (conceivable in
mind). Hence the statement of His controllership, does not
contradict the statement of His possession of true will
which is the expansion of the former. Therefore the S'andilya-
vidyā of the two texts is one and the same, as there is no
difference in their characteristics.
SAMBANDHĀDHIKARANA 7

On account of the connection (of the same
in both) the qualities are common to both.
The passage begins with, 'This person, who is seen
inside the orb of the sun and also within the right eye' (Brh.
V-5-2). Then the passage states that the true Brahman is
to be meditated upon as present in the orb of the sun and in
the right eye. Then two secret names of the Brahinan are
mentioned in the scriptural texts, 'His secret name is Ahar,

Therefore the two texts mention the same Vidyā and both
the names have to be meditated upon.

This is not so ; on account of the difference.
This is not correct. The Vidyās are different; because
there is difference in the places with which the Brahman
is said to be connected, the places being the orb of the sun
and the right eye. Therefore each name is restricted in regard
to each place.

And for the same reason the two virtues namely

spatial ether, do not apply to all Vidyas.
'Gathered together are these greatest powers, in the
Brahman. The Greatest Brahman in the beginning pervaded
the sky (Tait. Br. II-4-7-10). In the Greatest Brahman are
seen together all these powers. The Brahman pervaded the
sky. These attributes are not stated with reference to any
special meditation. However they cannot be included in
all meditations. Therefore the quality of pervading the
sky is connected with such meditation in which the place
other than small is mentioned. In this text His holding of the
powers is mentioned along with the pervasion of the spatial
ether. Hence this quality also is applicable only in that
case.vedāntasāra:

There is difference among the Purusavidyas also ;
because what is stated in one, is not stated in the
other.
The Purusavidyās described in the Taittiriyaka and the
Chāndogya Upanisads are different from each other. In one
of them are stated the agent of the sacrifice and his wife
as the limbs of the sacrifice and the three libations.
These have not been recorded in the other text. There is
also difference in respect of the fruits. In the Taittiriyaka
text the self of the meditator is mentioned as Yajamāna (the
agent of the sacrifice). The evenings, mornings and middays
are mentioned as the three Savanas (libations). The fruit
is the attainment of the greatness of the Brahman. In this

The hunger etc. are Diksā (consecration). The life divided

The statement of getting rid of something has
another supplementary statement regarding its reaching
another, as in the case of Kus'as, metres, praise and
singing. This has been stated.
In one Sākhā it is stated that the wise, who attain
the Brahman, get rid of the Punya and Pāpa. This
is said to be meditated upon. In another Sākhā are
mentioned the places of entry of them. The Punyakarmans
attach themselves to his friends and Pāpakarmans enter his
enemies. In one S'ākhā are mentioned both the release
from them and the places of entry of them. All these are

getting rid of them means both the getting rid of them
and also their reaching other places. The word, getting
rid of means 'leaving' and the word, 'reaching' means

' entry'. It is right to hold that when the leaving alone
or the entry alone is mentioned, both of them are
intended. It is not right to hold the alternative course of
them. The statement of the entry is only supplement to
what is stated in the words 'getting rid of '. This is because
it declares the places to which the good and evil works, got
rid of by the wise, are transferred. Hence it follows that one
should be the supplement to the other. In one place this
statement occurs-'The Kusas relating to the tree'. This is
supplemented by another statement occurring in a different
place, namely, 'The Kus'is relating to the Udambara tree '.
The statement, — The metres of the gods and Asuras ' has
the supplementary text, The metres of the gods are prior. '

should be meditated upon only at the time of death. After
the separation from the body, the self ought not to enjoy
pleasure or pain, without attaining the Brahman. Accordingly
in another Sākhā it is stated that the self reaches the Brahman
immediately after the death. The relevant passage is this —
• For him there is delay only so long as he is not freed from
the body ; then he will reach the Brahman (Chānd. VI-14-2),

As it is desired; on account of there being no
contradiction of either.
There are scriptural statements to prove that the good
and evil deeds leave the self at the time of death. There are
also statements to show that the Brahman ought to be attained
immediately after death. There should be no contradiction
between these two statements. Therefore the scriptural
statement, 'He gives up good and evil deeds' (Kauş. I-37) has

There is a meaning in the soul's going, only on the
two-fold hypothesis; for otherwise there is contradic-
tion.
The scriptural text referring to the journey through the
path of gods, will be sensible only when the leaving of the deeds
is accepted to take place on two different occasions. Otherwise
if it is considered to take place at the time of death, then all
his deeds must perish at that time. Then as he has no body,
he cannot proceed by any path. Hence there will be contradic.
tion regarding the journey, as stated in the scriptural texts.

That assumption is justified; on account of per-

is as in ordinary experience.
At the time of the separation from the body, all his
deeds become destroyed. Yet it is possible for him to
proceed through the path ; because those, who meditate
upon the Brahman, can achieve their objects even without
deeds, as stated in the scriptural text. 'He becomes a
self-ruler, he moves about in all worlds according to his
will' (Chānd. VII-25-2). This is just as in the world, those,
who serve the kings obtain all their desires, that could not be
got by other persons.

But there is no restriction that those alone who meditate upon

attain the Brahman, and go by that path. Then only the
contradiction between the teachings of the
the Smrtis can be averted. The scriptural text mentioned
in the Pañcāgnividyā (i.e., the meditation on the five fires )
is this —— Those who in the forest meditate on faith and
truth, they reach the path of light'. (Brh. VI-2-15). Smrti

The scriptural texts begin with, ' This is indeed Imperi:
shable' (Brh. III-8-8), 'Then the higher knowledge is that
whereby that Imperishable is apprehended' (Mund. I-1-5) and
end respectively with, It is neither gross nor minute, neither
short nor long, it is not red (Brh. III-8-8), ' That which is not
visible and not knowable' (Mund. I-1-6), Here in the
Paravidyās (the higher meditations ) all the attributes of the
Imperishable Brahman ( such as ), neither gross nor visible etc.
have to be included; because the Brahman, the possessor of
these attributes, is apprehended to be a single object. And
because without these attributes, it is not possible to meditate
upon Him, as distinct from all other objects. The characteris-
tics that distinguish the Brahman from the individual souls, are
the bliss etc. that do not tolerate the connection with evils. In-
deed it is natural that the Guņas (subordinates) are in harmony
with the Pradhāna (principal). Consider the following for in-

The question put by Usasta about the self (in Brh. III-
4-1 ) refers to the individual seif to whom the aggregate form of
material things belongs. Otherwise the object mentioned in the
reply — The self is he, who breathes through the vital wind (i.e.,
Prāņa ) ' could not be differentiated from the one, mentioned in
the reply given to the question of Kahola, as freed from hunger
thirst etc. It is not so. In both the places the questions are in
only one form, namely, 'The Self, who is the inner self of all'
(Brh.III-4-1). Hence in both the places the Highest Self is
referred to. Causing the breath and the absence of thirst
and hunger mentioned in the reply could be justified only in the
Highest self. That the Highest self is the cause of breathing,
has been mentioned in the text, ' who could breathe and live if
there were not this blissful ākāsa (Brahman ) ?' (Tait. I-2-7).
As in the case of the Sadvidyā, the repeated questions and
answers refer to the same object (Brahman).15]

questions. The combination should be thus — Uşasta should
know Him, also as free from hunger and thirst; Kahola also
should bear the idea, that He causes the breath etc. because these
two statements distinguish the Highest self. The same is the

All these worlds are one with the Brahman, as they are
the production of him. The statement, namely, — There

things separately without having the Brahman as their Self.
The clause, 'not so, not so' declares that the Brahman is
not of material nature.

when he likes as stated in the text, — He moves about there
eating, playing and enjoying' (Chānd. VIII-12-2). This is
the fruit of his attainment of the final release. It is not
the fruit connected with Samsāra. Therefore the Vidya
covering His qualities is also the Paravidyā.

It is not necessary that the meditation on the Udgitha
should be adopted in the sacrifices, as in the case of the

not meditate on this both perform the sacrifices' (Chand.

the sacrifice. The vigorous effect' means 'the power of
granting the fruits without delay, as no obstruction is caused
by other more powerful deeds'. Therefore the meditation
on the Udgitha gives fruit, other than that which is obtained
by the performance of sacrifice and hence there is no insis-
tence on the meditation in this case.
PRADĀNĀDHIKARANA 18
42. Pradanavadeva taduktam
Just as in the case of the offerings. This has been
explained.
In the Daharavidyā, there is the mention of the medita-
tion on the Brahman, as possessed of attributes, such as being
devoid of evil, etc.' There will be the repetition of the medita-
tions on the Brahman when He is viewed to possess various
qualities one after another; because in each case He is con-
sidered to be varied on account of the connection with each of
the qualities. This case is analogous to that of the sacrifical
offerings. There is the text, — He is to offer a Purodāsa
to Indra the ruler, etc.' (Tait. Sam. II-3-6 ). The essential
nature of Indra changes, as his attributes are mentioned one

because that proof is stronger. This is so stated
elsewhere.

The word, Nārāyaņa, occurs in the text, The thousand-
headed God etc.' (Tait. II-11-1). This is not a specification
of the object of the meditation of the Daharavidyā alone
mentioned therein. It has to be taken as a specification of
the objects of all the Vidyās mentioned in different texts ;
because there are many statements containing particular
significances in favour of this decision. Indeed, these state-
ments while referring the objects of the meditations with the
words Akşara, S'ambhu, S'iva, Supreme Brahman etc. specify
that these objects are nothing but Nārāyana. The sentences,

44. Parvavikalpak prakaraņat syat kriya manasavat
There is option with regard to what precedes, on
account of the context; and hence it is an action, as
in the case of the Manasagraha.
In the text, 'Built of mind, built of speech, built of
Prāņa” ³(Agnirahasya of Vājasaneyins), are mentioned the
metaphorical representations of the fire. These have to
be connected with the sacrifices, which are of the nature

³ Agnirahasya is represented by the 10-th chapter of the Satapatha-

(Printed and published by Dr. A. Weber, Berlin 1855 ). The Agnirahas-
yopanişad printed and published in Grantha character with Raigarāmānuja's
commentary at Kumbakonam, is a summary of the 4 th section of the 10th
chapter said above.20]

of the principal ones having the fire in the alter built with
bricks as a subordinate ; which fire is referred to in the text,
'Or non-existent (Asat) alone was in the beginning'. Here
the doubt is that these are alternative ones to the fire seated
in the altar made of bricks. This is similar to the case of the
Soma cup imagined by mind in the sacrifice of 12 days.
No contradiction arises; because they may conveniently be
auxiliary elements in sacrificial performances though they are
imagined by mind.
45. Atidesacca
And on account of the transfer.
The text — Of these each one is as great as the previous one'
(Mādh. S'. Br. 10-4-1-3) transfers the power of the fire seated
in the altar of bricks, to the fire of mind. Therefore the fire of
mind, etc. become auxiliaries to the sacrificial performances.

These fires of the mind etc. belong to the class of
meditation only. The meaning is that these fires are auxili-
aries to the sacrifices of meditation. They are determined to
be of meditation, as there is in them the metaphorical
representation of fires as stated in the text ' Indeed, they are
verily made of thought' (Mādh. S. Br. 10-4-1-12). They
have been determined in that way in order to reveal that they
belong to the class of meditation, as they are connected with
the sacrifice of meditation. Here it is seen that there are
scriptural texts to prove that the sacrifices could be of the
mind. By the mind, the cups were taken' (Mādh. S'. Br.
10-4-1-3) and so on.

And there cannot be annulment, on account of

that is weaker. Because this fact is understood by the statements

The statement of the things connected with the sacrifice
is seen in the text, ' By the mind the sacrificial cups have been
taken' (Madh. S'. Br. 10-4-1-3). There are also scriptural
texts to show that there are sacrifices of meditation-
• By thought alone are they made' (Mādh. S'. B. 10-4.

is ordained in the above mentioned texts. This is known

Not so. The transfer is only in respect of some
common attributas; as in the case of God of death.
It does not mean that the person reaches the region of
the god of death.
The text ' Each of these fires has the same effect as seen
in that' (Mādh. S. Br. 10-4-1-3) says that whatever fruit is
obtained by the means of the fire of the brick-made altar,
the same can be obtained by the means of them. It means
whatever fruit the fire of brick-made altar can give through
the sacrificial action, the same fruit can be got by the
means of each of these fires through the sacrifice of the
meditation. It does not mean that each of them occupies the20]

place of the fire of the brick-altar; because the transfer is
apprehended in regard to some common fact. Take for
example the passage 'The person in the orb is the God
of death, indeed' (Madh. S'. Br. 10-3-6-23). Here it is
meant that the person causes death to all objects and not
that he occupies the world of God of death.

And by the subsequent text is proved that the
word is used in such a meaning. But on account of
plurality of the auxiliaries it is found in that context.
The subsequent Brāhmaņa text also proves that the
passages relating to the fire of mind, etc., refer to the sacrifice
of the meditation only. The text reads thus, 'This fire
is this world and the water around it is the sea (Mādh.
S'. Br. 10.4-2-1 ). From this, it appears that what is enjoined
here is the meditation with a special result of its own.
In the Agnirahasya, under the section of 'sacrificial rites ',
is included the portion dealing with the fires of mind, etc., as
many auxiliaries have to be applied to them from that context,

[adhi.
Some state that He has to be meditated upon as the
Self of the meditator in his meditating stage, on account
of the existence of the meditating soul within the body.
When meditating, the self remains within the body
and has the character of being the doer and the enjoyer.
Therefore some think that in all the meditations upon the
Highest, the Highest Self has to be meditated upon as being
the self of those embodied souls.
52. Vyatirekastadbhāvabhavitvānnatnpalabdhivat
It is not so ; but rather the difference; since it is
of the being of that state; as in the case of intuition.
It is not correct to hold that the meditatior should
meditate upon the Highest as the Self of him in the present
state comprising the worldly action etc, But in medita-
ting the Highest as his Self, he should realize his state

of virtues comprising the freedom from evils etc., which
virtues become manifest themselves when he is released from

true nature, has for its object the apprehension of the essential
nature of the Brahman. Same is the case with the individual
self also. The scriptural text is this — According to the

In the Vaisvānaravidyā it is stated that there should
be the meditation of Him, who has three worlds as His body.
All the worlds beginning from the heavens and ending with
the earth, constitute His limbs, from the head to the legs etc.

Brahman as stated in the text, 'He, who meditates upon Him,
Immeasurable, the leader of all men (Vaisvānara), as con-
nected with these places, eats (enjoys) the food (namely the
Brahman) in all the worlds, etc.' (Chānd. V-18-1 ). Here is
mentioned the meditation on Him with the aggregate form with
the limbs, such as head etc. Suppose there is the rneditation
on Him with each of the limbs separately. Then there
will be only the limited enjoyment. Therefore in order to
have unlimited enjoyment, He should be meditated up on in the
aggregate form, because this course only is reasonable and the
enjoyment on the Brahman has been declared in that case
only. But the statement of the fruit on the meditation on
the limbs separately, is as in the case of the performance of
the sacrifices as stated in the text-'When a son is born, one
should offer on twelve potsherds to Vaisvānara, and again
a separate fruit is stated thus 'There is an offering on eight
potsherds,' (Tait. Sam. II-2-5). The scriptural text points out
the greatness of the meditation on the aggregate form of the
Brahman. The meditation on the limbs has been mentioned in
the text, ‘ Oh! King ! the possessor of the auspicious qualities
(the Bhagavan), I meditate upon Him as heavens' (Chānd.vedāntasāra:

SABDĀDIBHEDĀDHIKARANA 24
56. Nana sabdadibhedat
The meditations are different; because they are
called by different names etc.
In Sadvidyā, Bhūmavidyā, etc., the Brahman alone is to
be meditated upon and the fruit thereof is His attainment alone.
But these Vidyās are different from each other; because the
modes of the chief object (Brahman) of meditations are
distinct from each other. That the modes are different has
been determined by their denotation by different words etc.
This topic was once dealt with in the Pūrvakānda of the
Mimāmsā with reference to the sacrifices, yet it is dealt with
again here to dispel the mistaken idea of certain groups of
philosophers namely, that the Vedānta texts do not enjoin the
knowledge (meditation).

There is option as regards the meditation, that is to

in the fruits, namely, the experience of the Brahman in the
form of Bliss, without least diminution.

But meditations aiming other objects of desires,
may, according to one's desire, be cumulated or not;
on account of the absence of the former reason.
The meditations on objects other than the Brahman, grant
only limited fruits. They are cumulated, as there is the
desire to acquire greater fruits. Hence the meditations are
either to be cumulated or left to the option of such meditators.

• Meditate on the Udgitha' (Chānd. I-1-1 ). Here the
meditations upon the Udgitha etc. that constitute the limbs of
the sacrifices, form the part of the sacrifices; because different

And on account of there being the scriptural texts,
in which the secondary thing is stated to be common

'With Om induces, with Om recites, with Om sings

the cases. Therefore the Upāsana also must continue in all
the cases invariably. Therefore it is not proper to hold that
there is no necessity to connect the meditation with the
sacrifices as state above.

It is not that; because the text does not declare
their going together.
This is not so; because there are no texts to show that
they constitute the limbs. Indeed the term 'going-together',
means being the limbs'. From the following text it is
understood that the meditation has a separate fruit- What.[adhi. 26]

meditation should be on Udgitha.

• The Brahman-priest, who knows this, saves the sacri-
fice, the sacrificer, and all the officiating priests (Chānd. IV-

knowledge of the Brahman-priest-and that the knowledge on
the part of the priests Uāgātr etc. is not auxiliary of the
sacrifice. Therefore there is no necessity to connect the
meditations with the sacrifices.

PURUSĀRTHĀDHIKARANA 1
1. Purusārthotah sabdaditi Badarāyanan
The cardinal benefit of life starts from thence,
on account of the scriptural text: thus Badarayana
opined.
The illustrious Bādarāyaņa thinks that the cardinal
benefit of life results from knowledge. The scriptural
authorities are these: 'The knower of the Brahman reaches
the Highest' (Tait. I-2-1 ). ' He, who knows Him set down
in the secret abode, enjoys in the highest heaven, all desires
as well as the Brahman' (Tait. I-2-1 ).

2. Seşatvat purusārthavado yathanyesviti Jaiminily
On account of its being subordinate, the state-
ment of the benefit in its case is only Arthavada as in
other cases; so Jaimini thinks.
In the text, ‘ That thou art' (Chānd. VI-8-7) the agent
of the action is apprehended to be Brahman, on account of the
grammatical equation (Sāmānādhikarnya). The knowledge
on him is subservient to the works performed, so far as it
produces certain consecration in the agent. The texts, that
mention the fruits of the knowledge are only Arthavādās,
( exaggeration) as in the case of the sacrificial things, etc.
3. Acaradarsanāt
On account of such Acara (practice ) being seen.
Asvapati Kekaya, the knower of the Brahman, said,
‘Verily, O illustrious ones, I am about to perform a sacrifice'
(Chānd. V-11-5). Hence it is seen in this and other scriptural
texts that the conduct of those, who know the Brahman, is

4. Tacchruteh
It is so, on account of that being stated in the
scriptures.
★
The knowledge is an auxiliary part of the works as it
has to be utilised for the performance of works. This is
stated in the text, 'whatever one does, with knowledge (Chānd.
I-1-10). The meaning of this text is this — Whatever one
does, he does with knowledge. Or it means-That work,
which one does with knowledge, is more powerful.
5. Samanvārambhaņat
On account of taking hold together.
The knowledge is an auxiliary part of works; because both
are seen to go together in one person, as stated in the
text, — Then both knowledge and work take hold of him
(Brh. VI-4-4).

On account of injunctions for him who has it.
' He, having learnt the Veda from the house of teachers
and having come back, must set up himself in the family life'
(Chānd. VIII-15-1). Here the injunction is that the works
must be performed by him who has learnt the Vedas together
with meaning. The Study of the Vedas naturally includes
the knowledge of their meaning also.
7. Niyamacca
And on account of a definite rule.
The life of the self, who knows the Self, has to be
spent in doing the works. The relevant text is this: 'Verily
doing works here, let a man desire to live a hundred years'
(Isa. II).
8. Adhikopadesattu Badarayaņasyaivam taddarsanat
But, on the ground of the teaching about the
Highest One, Badarāyaņa stands firm in his view;
because this is seen in the scriptures.

The view of the Bādarāyana, is this — Knowledge is
not an auxiliary part of works, 'But the cardinal benefit of
life is the result produced by knowledge.' Because the
teaching is that the knowledge of One, who is other than
the individual self, is to be obtained. How could this
be ? Because in the following scriptural text, the Highest One
is mentioned to be known-'May I become many' (Chand.
VI-2-3.). ' He is the cause, He is the Lord of the lords of
the senses (i. e., the individual selves), (S've. I. 19).

the works, that are performed without any special desire,

Udgitha becomes more powerful.

Of him, who has made merely the verbal study of
the Veda.
The injunction is that works have to be performed by
those, who had studied the Vedas. Therefore the knowledge
is not an integral part of works. It is already stated that the
study of the Veda means injunction on the to refer to the
mere textual recitation. Or granting that the study of the
Vedas includes knowing the meaning also, the knowledge, that
is different from knowing the meaning of the Vedas, is
stated to be one of the meditations to be repeated again and
again.

Not so, on acconnt of non-specification.
The text, 'Necessarily doing works here' (Isa. 2) does
not mean that the wise should devote whole of his life in doing
independent works not being in the subordinate relation
with the knowledge, because there are no specific reasons
to hold that view. The context, 'All this is pervaded by
the Lord' (Isa. 1) also proves this. Therefore the works are
known to form an integral part of knowledge. Hence knowl-
edge is not an integral part of works.

If it be paid that they are mere glorification, on

The text, that mentions the meditation on the Udgitha, as
the best of the essences, cannot mean an injunction. This is
similar to the text, The ladle (Juhū) is the earth, the
Ahavaniya is the heavenly world'. Udgitha has been men-
tioned as a constituent element of works. Then to state
that as the best of essences is mere glorification on the
Udgitha and is not an injunction, as in the case of the text,
' The ladle, etc.' It is not so, because there is no injunc
tion of the Udgitha in the context as in the case of the
ladle. Hence the meditation as the best of essences is to be
taken an injunction as it is not establishad by any other proof.

The permission to take all kinds of food, is only in

Referring to the meditator on Prāņa (ive., the vital
wind) the scriptural text says 'Verily in the case of him
who knows thus, there is nothing that is not eatable' (Chand.
V-2-1). This does not mean that he may take all foods at all
times. But it is only when there is danger to life, because we
see that even the knowers of Brahman, who possessed ex-
traordinary powers, ate the impure food, when there was
danger to life.

Surā (i.e., intoxicating drink)' (Kath. Sam.) prevents a person
from doing things as he likes. Therefore all kinds of food
may be taken, only when there is danger to life.

The works are also attached to various Asramas
on account of these being enjoined.
The works, such as sacrifices, etc. have to be performed by
those, who had entered the stages of life (i.e., Asramās), though
they do not engage themselves in the meditation. The text
is this : ‘Agnihotra has to be performed all through the life '
(Apa. S'r. III-24-8).
33. Sahakaritvena ca
And also on account of their being helpful in
acquiring knowledge.
The works form an integral part of knowledge. This
is stated in the text, Brāhmanas desire to know Him by the
recitation of Vedas' (Br. IV-4-22). The works are helpful in
getting knowledge. Therefore the wise also should perform
the works.

The works sacrifices, etc. are the same even though they are
viewed either as duties or auxiliaries to knowledge because they
are recognized to be the same in both the cases. These works
are the same in their essential nature. Yet they are performed
with different views. Hence no contradiction arises.
35. Anabhibhavam ca darsayati
And scriptures declare knowledge not be over-
powered by works.
All evil works, that stand in the way of the rise of know-
ledge, are removed. This is stated in the text, ' By works of
sacred duty, he drives away evil deeds' (Tait. II-50). Thus
the text shows that the works have to be performed so that
the knowledge is not over-powered, by evil deeds.

Those, who are connected wilh the Asramas, such as the

to do the meditation. Because Raikva and others, who do
not follow any stage of āsrama life, were seen to have been
qualified for the meditation upon the Brahman.
37. Api smaryate
This is said in the Smrtis also.
The Smrti text, through the silent recitation also a man
becomes successful' (Manu. II-87) proves that the knowledge
of the Brāhman could be had through the silent recitation etc.
by one who is not within the Asrama life.
38. Visesanugrahasca
And the knowledge is benefited through some special
works.
The text, ' By penance, abstinence, faith, and knowledge,

connected with the Asramas alone.tṛtīyādhyāye caturthaḥ pādaḥ

But better than this is the other (i.e., the Asrama

The life of an Asramin is better than that of him, who

duties. The Smrti text says — A twice-born should not remain
without the Asrama life even for a minute.'

men are prohibited from discontinuing the special duties of
those Asramas after they have once entered on the condi.
tion of Naisthika, etc. The relevant scriptural texts are
Completely surrendering himself to the service in the house
of the teacher' (Chand. 2-23-1). He is to go to forest, and
should not return from thence'. ' Having renounced the fire
he should not return'. Hence the persons, who have lapsed
from those conditions are not qualified for the knowledge.
This is the opinion of Jaimini also.

Nor the expiatory ceremonies described in the

on account of the Smrtis referring to the apostasy.
The expiatory ceremonies, which are described in the
chapter treating of qualifications are not applicable in the case
of him, who is apostate by transgressing the rules of the
Naisthika etc. The relevant text is this — Like that, the

A minor offence : thus some think ; and the exis-

This has been explained.
Some think that there are expiatory ceremonies for them ;
as the offences are minor. This is similar to the case of
performing expiatory ceremonies when forbidden food, such as
honey etc. is consumed by them. Hence it has been stated
thus — This should be applied in the case of the others also
in so far as not opposed to their Asramas (Gau. Dh. I-3-4).

But as the Self; thus the wise approach Him
and the texts make them apprehend in that way.
In the Sūtras II-1-22 & III-4-8 is explained that the
Brahman, is other than the individual Self. Even then the
person, engaged in the meditation should meditate upon Him
as, 'I am the Brahman'. Because the wise of olden times ack-
nowledged thus—' Then I'am, indeed, thou, holy divinity and
thou art me '. Thus the devotees acknowledged Him as their
Self. The Brahman is no doubt other than the individual
selves, But the scriptures reveal Him as being the Selfvedāntasāra:

human body refers to the self and the thought arrived at
from the word finally takes the self as the object, because the
body is always an adjunct to the self. In a similar way the
word, ‘ I ' refers to the Highest self, and the thought arrived
at from the word, finally takes the Highest Self as the object
who has as His body the individual selves. Therefore the

Meditation has to be done till death; for there
also it is seen.
The meditation has to be done every day till death ;
because it is so seen in the text, ' He indeed, who lives thus
throughout his life' (Chand. VIII-15-1).

When the meditation on the Brahman is begun, the
past sins become destroyed and the future sins do not cling
to him ; because the meditations have such a power. The
texts that support this are these- Thus, indeed, all his sins
are burnt' (Chand. V-24-3). No evil deed clings to him who
knows this' (Chānd. IV-14-3).

Of the other also (i.e., the good deeds) there is the
non-clinging and destruction; but after death they do
not grant any results.
As regards the wise, the good deeds also are obstructive to
the attainment of Final Release and they grant undesir-
able fruits. They either do not cling to the selves or become
destroyed: The works that have to give the results of rain,
.food, life and health etc. for the help of Vidyā, do not yield
any result after death.

According to some, a class of good works, other
than these of both kinds.

Consider the texts — His sons get a share of properties '.
'His evil deeds cling to his enemy. His good-deeds attach
themselves to his friends'. Some good works, other than
the Agnihotra etc. are performed from time immemorial. They
are obstructed from granting fruits by other works of greater
strength. The strong works obstruct also the grant of fruits,
such as rain, food, life and health etc., of the subsequent
works. Hence the scriptural texts mentioned above refer to
these both kinds of deeds.

Van manasi darsanacchabdacca
Speech reaches the mind, on account of this being
seen and of scriptural statement.
6
The scriptural statement is this : O dear, when a man
departs from hence, his speech is combined with mind'
(Chānd; VI-8-6). Suppose a person departs from this world.
In his case the organ of speech stops working even before his
mind ceases to function. Hence it is right to say that speech
reaches the with mind.

(Chānd. VI-8.6 ) the word fire denotes the fire combined with
other elements. Therefore the Prāņa joins with elements.

Not with one element; for both statements declare

It is common before the beginning of the way; and
the immortality ( is that which is obtained) without
having burned.
Both the knower and the other follow the common
route till the path begins with light, etc. because the scripture
says that the knower reaches the Brahman by traversing
the path of light etc. When all desires, which once dwelt
in his heart are undone, then the mortal becomes immortal,
then he obtains the Brahman' (Kath. II-3-14). Here the
statements, such as the immortality and the attainment of
the Brahman refer to the starting of meditation without
breaking the connection, that the self bears to the body and
the sense organs.

It is so ; since upto the union with that Brahman
is stated the continuance of Samsara.
The self is connected with the body until he reaches the
Brahman by traversing the path of light, etc. Therefore the
statements on immortality etc. should be explained in the
way mentioned above.
9. Suksman pramāņatasca tathopalabdhek
And the subtle body persists, on account of it be
ing so observed in the scriptures.
A subtle body persists even after his departure from the
gross body; otherwise he cannot traverse by the path. A
subtle body is accepted not only by this reason but also because
the other proofs, are observed in the scriptures such as the
conversation with the moon etc. that establish the ex-
istence of a subtle body after departure. The scriptural textvedāntasāra:

Therefore not in the way of the destruction of

For the above reason, the statement of immortality,
such as 'Then he becomes immortal' ( Kath. II-3-14 ) does
not mean the destruction of the connection of the self with the
body.
11. Asyaiva copapatterusma
And to that very subtle body there belongs the
warmth, this only being reasonable.
There is reason to hold that the subtle body persists even
at the time of the departure of the self, as the warmth is
apprehended in certain part as the quality of the subtle body,

If it be said that it is not so on account of the
denial of his going up, we deny this for it is meant
there the departure of the breath from the soul.
This is olear according to some.
• He, who has no desire, his Prāņas do not pass forth'
(Brh. IV-4-6). That means the Prāņas do not leave the wise.
Hence the wise attain the Brahman here alone. This is not
so. The wise, that leave the gross body, pass through the
path of light, etc. and for that purpose the Prāņas do not
leave him. Hence it is stated thus His Prāņas do not pass
forth' (Brh, IV-4-6). This fact has been clearly stated in
the version of the Mādyandinas thus: But of him, who
has no desire, who is free from desire, whose desire is
satisfied, whose desire is the self only, the Prāņas do not pass
forth.' (Brh. IV.4.6).

sun' (Chānd. JV-15-5). In one text, the Devaloka (world of
the gods ) is mentioned between the year and the sun. In
another text Vayu (i.e., the wind) is introduced between the
year and the sun. The word Devaloka (the world of the gods)
refers to Vayu (i.e., the wind) without any specification.
The word Väyu (i.e., the wind) refers to the same with
specification. Therefore Väyu (i.e., the wind) alone is referred
to by the words, Devaloka ( the world of gods) and Vāyu '.
Therefore Vāyu is to be placed after the year and before
' the sun.'

VARUNĀDHIKARANA 3
3. Tatitodhi varunar sambhandhat
Beyond lightning, there is Varuna ; on account of
connection.
After lightning comes Varuna. The lightning is within
the clouds. Varuna is the presiding divinity of water contained

Indra and Prajapati occur in the order as stated in the
scripture. There are no other powerful special reasons for
changing this order.

4. Ativahikastallingat
They are conductors, this being indicated.
It is understood that the presiding deities of light, etc.,
are directed by the Highest Person, as the conductors of the
wise. There are indications to show that they direct the
selves to the Brahman because one of them is seen to be the
conductor as per the scriptural text. He takes them to the
Brahman' (Chānd. IV-15-5).

5. Vaidyutenaiva tatastacchruter
By lightning alone the wise conducted, because
the text states that.
The scripture states thus-'From moon they proceed to
lightning. That perscn is non-human. He takes them to the4, 5]

Indra and Prajāpati take part in the work so far only as they
may assist the person of lightning in his task.

They conduct him who meditates upon the effected
Brahman (i.e., Hiranyagarbha) ; thus Badari thinks,
because for him alone going is reasonable.
Him, who meditates upon the effected Brahman (i.e.,
Hiranyagarbha) lead the light, etc.; because in his case only
the journey is reasonable. The journey is not reasonable for
those who meditate on the Highest Brahman, because He is
everywhere.

No contradiction arises in the text that establishes the

When the world of Hiranyagarbha passes away, then the souls
with its ruler go to what is higher than that. 'After living in
the world of Brahman (Hiranyagarbha ), at the time of deluge
they reach the indestructible One and are released from the
bondage' (Tait II-10-22).

primary sense. The word, Brahmaloka refers to the Brahman
world, by considering it as a compound of Karmadārya

meditation on other than those said above. Bādarāyana thinks,
that the light etc., lead them who know the five-fold fires and
meditate upon the Highest Self following the latter class of
the meditations said above. The contradiction with the
statements made in all the Upanishadic passages arise, when
the object of meditation is taken to be the effected Brahman
or the Highest Self alone. If the object of meditation is taken
to be the effected Brahman then the scriptural texts, 'They
lead to the Brahman'. (Chānd. IV-15-6). and Having
reached the Highest Light' (Chānd. VIII-3-4) will oppose this
view. If the Highest Self alone is held to be the object of
meditation, then the text, 'Those, who know this (i.e., as stated
in the Pañcāgnividyā) and those too who in the forest medi-
tate with faith upon the Truth, go to light (Brh. VI-2-15) will
oppose the view. If the object of meditation is held to be the
effected Brahman then the law of Tatkratu will also be contra-
dicted. It is stated in the scriptures that those, who traverse
through the path of light, etc., reach the Brahman and do not
come back. The knowers of the five fires meditate on the self
bereft of the Prakrti, and having for his Self the Brahman as
stated in the text, 'He, who remains in the self' (Brh. III-7-22

is no contradiction with law of Tatkratu. Both of them
meditate upon the Brahman in different ways. Some meditate

meditate upon themselves having the Brahman for their Soul.

And scripture declares the difference.
The meditation on the effected Brahman grants fruits in
limited places and limited times, thas are different from the
attainment of the Brahman. This is stated in the text, ' He,

movement as he wishes as far as name extends' (Chānd.

• Thus that serene self, having risen from the body and

that the self has been already in possession of his essential

When he reaches the Highest Light, it manifests itself; because
thus has been stated in the scriptural text by the specific
words, With his own form '.

But this nature including 'unlimited knowledge' etc., manifests
itself only in Mukti because he is freed from bondage of Karman

concealment in the waking state etc. has been removed.

It is understood from the context that the scriptural text

from evil. The text mentioned above begins to describe thus

Jaimini thinks that a nature like that of the
Brahman, manifests itself on the self; on account of
the declaration etc.
A nature like that of the Brahman, consisting of the
qualities such as — Freedom from evils' manifests itself in the
individual self. These are the qualities of the Brahman; Yet
they belong to the individual self also. This has been under.
stood from the declaration found in the text, 'The self is free
from evils etc.' (Chānd. VIII-7-1). Same thing has been
stated in the text, ' He is eating, playing, rejoicing (Chānd.
VIII-12-3). This is the view of Jaimini.

Even it is thus; on account of the declaration of
the existence of former qualities, Badarayana holds
absence of contradiction.
It has been understood that the mass of knowledge is the
nature of the individual self. Yet the former qualities, such
as — Freedom from evils' etc. are apprehended in him. This is
stated in the text, 'The self is free from evils.' (Chānd. VIII.
7-1 ). The two groups of natures apprehended in the two texts
are not contradictory each other. Therefore of these two forms
one does not exclude the other. Therefore the illustrious Bāda-
rāyana thinks there is a collection of both the natures in
the self.

For the same reason, Badarāyaņa holds that he is
of both kinds; as in the case of the twelve-days'

There are texts to show that, as and when he desires, he
can have body or not. The analogous case is the twelve-days'
sacrifice, which according to the texts, belongs either to the

This is stated in the text, 'Then He creates chariots, horses,
roads' (Brh. IV-3-10).
14. Bhave jagradvat
When there is the body, he experiences as in the
state of waking.
Suppose he creates the instruments, such as body etc.
Then he enjoys the pleasures with them as one does in his
waking state.
15. Pradipavadaves astathahi darsayati
His entering is as in the case of a lamp; for thus
the scripture declares.
The self remains in one place. But it is proved that he
experiences everything through the pervasion of his knowledge,
that acts as his brilliance. The scriptures state thus : That
self is to be known as a portion of the hundredth part of a
point of a hair divided into hundred parts, and yet he is
capable of infinity' (S've. V-9).

— The self being embraced by the Intelligent Self does not

It is stated that this statement of non-experience refers to

either to the state of sound sleep or death.

knows nothing.

With the exception of the activity for the sake of

it is apprehended that the Highest Brahman alone possesses

man in His complete nature, possessed of unsurpassed bliss.
The creation etc., conducted by the Brahman are only

This is the teaching of the text : 'He moves through
these worlds, eating what he desires, and assuming any shape
what he desires' (Tait. I-10-5). Hence the Released self
creates the worlds. It is not so ; because they are the
pleasures of those who are in the region of Hiranyagarbha
etc., who are entrusted with special duties. Indeed the text
does not say that he controls those worlds.
19. Vikaravarti ca tathahi sthitimaha
The Released self experiences the Unchangeable
one; the scriptures state his condition thus.
His pleasure consists of only the enjoyment of the
Brahman in His real and entire nature, that does not undergo
any changes. His condition has been stated in the text thus :
— Bliss indeed is He; having obtained that Bliss, he becomes
blissful' (Tait. I-7-1).

And on account of the indication, narnely, 'equality

'He enjoys all desires and the omniscient Brahman'

is equal to the Highest Self, only in so far as enjoyment of the
true nature of the Brahman.

life through, reaches the world of the Brahman and he does
not return' (Chānd. VIII.15-1). The Released self becomes
free from all, that has concealed his true nature. The host
of qualities such as, 'Freedom from sin manifests themselves
in him. He experiences the Highest Brahman, who is
unsurpassable Bliss. He does not return again to this world.
This has been so determined. Thus the entire truth of the
doctrine is perfect and faultless.
