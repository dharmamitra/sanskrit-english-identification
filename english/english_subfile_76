And thats just what they didAnd they saw where the third herd of deer had their lair where they went to hide outAnd thats how the third herd failed to get free from the trappers powerSo then a fourth herd of deer thought up a planThe first and third herds of deer failed to get free of the trappers powerWhy dont we set up our lair somewhere the trapper and his companions cant go Then we can intrude on where the trapper has cast the bait and enjoy eating it without being reckless We wont become indulgent then we wont become negligent and then we wont be vulnerable to the trapper on account of that baitAnd thats just what they didSo the trapper and his companions thoughtWow this fourth herd of deer is so sneaky and devious they must be some kind of unnatural spirits with psychic powerFor they eat the bait weve cast without us knowing how they come and goWhy dont we surround the bait on all sides by staking out high nets Hopefully we might get to see their lair where they go to hide outAnd thats just what they didBut they couldnt see where the fourth herd of deer had their lair where they went to hide outSo the trapper and his companions thoughtIf we disturb this fourth herd of deer theyll disturb others who in turn will disturb even moreThen all of the deer will be free from this bait weve castWhy dont we just keep an eye on that fourth herdAnd thats just what they didAnd thats how the fourth herd of deer got free from the trappers powerIve made up this simile to make a pointAnd this is what it meansBait is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulationTrapper is a term for Māra the WickedTrappers companions is a term for Māras assemblyDeer is a term for ascetics and brahminsNow the first group of ascetics and brahmins intruded on where the bait and the material delights of the world were cast by Māra and recklessly enjoyed eating itThey became indulgent then they became negligent and then they were vulnerable to Māra on account of that bait and the material delights of the worldAnd thats how the first group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māras powerThis first group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the first herd of deer I saySo then a second group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a planThe first group of ascetics and brahmins became indulgent and failed to get free of Māras powerWhy dont we avoid eating the bait and the worlds material delights altogether Avoiding dangerous food we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live thereAnd thats just what they didThey ate herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survived on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruitBut when it came to the last month of summer the grass and water ran out Their bodies became much too thinand they lost their strength and energyBecause of this they lost their hearts releaseso they went back to that same place where Māra had cast the bait and the material delights of the worldIntruding on that place they recklessly enjoyed eating them And thats how the second group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māras powerThis second group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the second herd of deer I saySo then a third group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a planThe first and second groups of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free of Māras powerWhy dont we set up our lair close by the place where Māra has cast the bait and those material delights of the world Then we can intrude on it and enjoy eating without being reckless We wont become indulgent then we wont become negligent and then we wont be vulnerable to Māra on account of that bait and those material delights of the worldAnd thats just what they didStill they had such views as theseThe cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternalThe world is finite or The world is infiniteThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsor that after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt existAnd thats how the third group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māras powerThis third group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the third herd of deer I saySo then a fourth group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a planThe first and third groups of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free of Māras powerWhy dont we set up our lair somewhere Māra and his assembly cant goThen we can intrude on where Māra has cast the bait and those material delights of the world and enjoy eating without being reckless We wont become indulgent then we wont become negligent and then we wont be vulnerable to Māra on account of that bait and those material delights of the worldAnd thats just what they didAnd thats how the fourth group of ascetics and brahmins got free from Māras powerThis fourth group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the fourth herd of deer I sayAnd where is it that Māra and his assembly cant goIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra put out his eyes without a trace and gone

of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite spaceThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousnessThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingnessThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feelingAnd having seen with wisdom their defilements come to an endThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra put out his eyes without a trace and gone where the Wicked One cannot

why I said itThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith MāgaṇḍiyaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma on a grass mat in the fire chamber of a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clanThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kammāsadamma for almsHe wandered for alms in Kammāsadamma After the meal on his return from almsround he went to a certain forest grove for the days meditationHaving plunged deep into it he sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditationThen as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamberHe saw the grass mat spread out thereand asked the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clanMister Bhāradvāja who has this grass mat been spread out for It looks like an ascetics bedThere is the ascetic Gotama a Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedThis bed has been spread for that Master GotamaWell its a sad sight Mister Bhāradvājaa very sad sight indeedto see a bed for Master Gotama that lifedestroyerBe careful what you say Māgaṇḍiyabe careful what you sayMany astute aristocrats brahmins householders and ascetics are devoted to Master Gotama Theyve been guided by him in the noble method the skillful teachingEven if I was to see Master Gotama face to face Mister Bhāradvāja I would say to his faceThe ascetic Gotama is a lifedestroyerWhy is thatBecause thats what it implies in a discourse of oursIf you dont mind Ill tell the ascetic Gotama about thisDont worry Mister Bharadvāja You may tell him exactly what Ive saidWith clairaudience that is purified and superhuman the Buddha heard this discussion between the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer MāgaṇḍiyaComing out of retreat he went to the brahmins fire chamber and sat on the grass matThen the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to himBhāradvāja did you have a discussion with the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya about this grass matWhen he said this the brahmin said to the BuddhaI wanted to mention this very thing to Master Gotamabut you brought it up before I had a chanceBut this conversation between the Buddha and the brahmin was left unfinishedThen as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and the Buddha said to himMāgaṇḍiya the eye likes sights it loves them and enjoys themThats been tamed guarded protected and restrained by the Realized One and he teaches Dhamma for its restraintIs that what you were referring to when you called mea lifedestroyerThats exactly what I was referring toWhy is thatBecause thats what it implies in a discourse of oursThe ear likes sounds The nose likes smells The tongue likes tastes The body likes touches The mind likes thoughts it loves them and enjoys themThats been tamed guarded protected and restrained by the Realized One and he teaches Dhamma for its restraintIs that what you were referring to when you called mea lifedestroyerThats exactly what I was referring toWhy is thatBecause thats what it implies in a discourse of oursWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaTake someone who used to amuse themselves with sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing Some time laterhaving truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape of sights and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sightsthey would live rid of thirst their mind peaceful insideWhat would you have to say to them MāgaṇḍiyaNothing Master GotamaWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaTake someone who used to amuse themselves with sounds known by the ear smells known by the nose tastes known by the tongue touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSome time laterhaving truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape of touches and having given up craving and dispelled passion for touchesthey would live rid of thirst their mind peaceful insideWhat would you have to say to them MāgaṇḍiyaNothing Master GotamaWell when I was still a layperson I used to amuse myself supplied and provided with sights known by the eye  sounds known by the ear smells known by the nose tastes known by the tongue touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingI had three stilt longhousesone for the rainy season one for the winter and one for the summerI stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season where I was entertained by musiciansnone of them menSome time laterhaving truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape of sensual pleasures and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasuresI live rid of thirst my mind peaceful insideI see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures burning with passion for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasuresI dont envy them nor do I hope to enjoy thatWhy is thatBecause there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitieswhich even achieves the level of heavenly pleasureEnjoying that satisfaction I dont envy what is inferior nor do I hope to enjoy itSuppose there was a householder or a householders child who was rich affluent and wealthy And they would amuse themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation That is sights known by the eye touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingHaving practiced good conduct by way of body speech and mind when their body breaks up after death theyd be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThreeThere theyd amuse themselves in the Garden of Delight escorted by a band of nymphs supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulationThen theyd see a householder or a householders child amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat do you think Māgaṇḍiya Would that godamusing themselves in the Garden of Delight escorted by a band of nymphs supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulationenvy that householder or householders child their five kinds of human sensual stimulation or return to human sensual pleasuresNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasuresIn the same way Māgaṇḍiya when I was still a layperson I used to entertain myself with sights  sounds touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSome time laterhaving truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape of sensual pleasures and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasuresI live rid of thirst my mind peaceful insideI see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures burning with passion for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasures I dont envy them nor do I hope to enjoy thatWhy is thatBecause there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitieswhich even achieves the level of heavenly pleasureEnjoying that satisfaction I dont envy what is inferior nor do I hope to enjoy itSuppose there was a person affected by leprosy with sores and blisters on their limbs Being devoured by worms scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds theyd cauterize their body over a pit of glowing coalsTheir friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat themThe field surgeon would make medicine for themand by using that theyd be cured of leprosy Theyd be healthy happy autonomous master of themselves able to go where they wantedThen theyd see another person affected by leprosy with sores and blisters on their limbs being devoured by worms scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds cauterizing their body over a pit of glowing coalsWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaWould that person envy that other person affected by leprosy for their pit of glowing coals or for taking medicineNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause you need to take medicine only when theres a disease When theres no disease theres no need for medicineIn the same way Māgaṇḍiya when I was still a layperson I used to entertain myself with sights  sounds touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSome time laterhaving truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape of sensual pleasures and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasuresI live rid of thirst my mind peaceful insideI see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures burning with passion for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasuresI dont envy them nor do I hope to enjoy thatWhy is thatBecause there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitieswhich even achieves the level of heavenly pleasureEnjoying that satisfaction I dont envy what is inferior nor do I hope to enjoy itSuppose there was a person affected by leprosy with sores and blisters on their limbs Being devoured by worms scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds theyd cauterize their body over a pit of glowing coalsTheir friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat themThe field surgeon would make medicine for themand by using that theyd be cured of leprosy Theyd be healthy happy autonomous master of themselves able to go where they wantedThen two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coalsWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaWouldnt that person writhe and struggle to and froYes Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause that fire is really painful to touch fiercely burning and scorchingWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaIs it only now that the fire is really painful to touch fiercely burning and scorching or was it painful previously as wellThat fire is painful now and it was also painful previouslyThat person was affected by leprosy with sores and blisters on their limbs Being devoured by worms scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds their sense faculties were impaired So even though the fire was actually painful to touch they had a distorted perception that it was pleasantIn the same way sensual pleasures of the past future and present are painful to touch fiercely burning and scorchingThese sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasuresbeing consumed by craving for sensual pleasures burning with passion for sensual pleasureshave impaired sense faculties So even though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch they have a distorted perception that they are pleasantSuppose there was a person affected by leprosy with sores and blisters on their limbs Being devoured by worms scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds theyre cauterizing their body over a pit of glowing coalsThe more they scratch their wounds and cauterize their body the more their wounds become foul stinking and infected But still they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the itchiness of their woundsIn the same way I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures burning with passion for sensual pleasures indulging in sensual pleasuresThe more they indulge in sensual pleasures the more their craving for sensual pleasures grows and the more they burn with passion for sensual pleasures But still they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaHave you seen or heard of a king or a royal minister of the past future or present amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation whowithout giving up craving for sensual pleasures and dispelling passion for sensual pleasureslives rid of thirst their mind peaceful insideNo Master GotamaGood MāgaṇḍiyaNeither have IOn the contrary all the ascetics or brahmins of the past future or present who live rid of thirst their minds peaceful inside do so after truly understanding the origin ending gratification drawback and escape of sensual pleasures and after giving up craving and dispelling passion for sensual pleasuresThen on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentHealth is the ultimate blessingextinguishment the ultimate happinessOf paths the ultimate is eightfoldits safe and leads to the deathlessWhen he said this Māgaṇḍiya said to himIts incredible Master Gotama its amazingHow well said this was by Master GotamaHealth is the ultimate blessing extinguishment the ultimate happinessIve also heard that wanderers of the past the teachers of teachers saidHealth is the ultimate blessing extinguishment the ultimate happinessAnd it agrees Master GotamaBut Māgaṇḍiya when you heard that wanderers of the past said thiswhat is that health And what is that extinguishmentWhen he said this Māgaṇḍiya stroked his own limbs with his hands sayingThis is that health Master Gotama this is that extinguishmentFor I am now healthy and happy and have no afflictionsMāgaṇḍiya suppose a person was born blindThey couldnt see sights that are dark or bright or blue yellow red or magenta They couldnt see even and uneven ground or the stars or the moon and sunThey might hear a sighted person sayingWhite cloth is really nice its attractive stainless and cleanTheyd go in search of white clothBut someone would cheat them with a dirty soiled garment sayingSir here is a white cloth for you its attractive stainless and cleanTheyd take it and put it on expressing their gladnessWhite cloth is really nice its attractive stainless and cleanWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaDid that person blind from birth do this knowing and seeingor out of faith in the sighted personThey did so not knowing or seeingbut out of faith in the sighted personIn the same way the wanderers who follow other paths are blind and sightless Not knowing health and not seeing extinguishment they still recite this verseHealth is the ultimate blessing extinguishment the ultimate happinessFor this verse was recited by the perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas of the pastHealth is the ultimate blessingextinguishment the ultimate happinessOf paths the ultimate is eightfoldits safe and leads to the deathlessThese days it has gradually become a verse used by ordinary peopleBut Māgaṇḍiya this body is a disease an abscess a dart a misery an affliction Yet you say of this bodyThis is that health this is that extinguishmentMāgaṇḍiya you dont have the noble vision by which you might know health and see extinguishmentI am quite confident that Master Gotamais capable of teaching me so that I can know health and see extinguishmentMāgaṇḍiya suppose a person was born blindThey couldnt see sights that are dark or bright or blue yellow red or magenta They couldnt see even and uneven ground or the stars or the moon and sunTheir friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat themThe field surgeon would make medicine for thembut when they used it their eyes were not cured and they still could not see clearlyWhat do you think MāgaṇḍiyaWouldnt that doctor just get weary and frustratedYes Master GotamaIn the same way suppose I were to teach you the Dhamma sayingThis is that health this is that extinguishment But you might not know health or see extinguishmentwhich would be wearying and troublesome for meI am quite confident that Master Gotamais capable of teaching me so that I can know health and see extinguishmentMāgaṇḍiya suppose a person was born blindThey couldnt see sights that are dark or bright or blue yellow red or magenta They couldnt see even and uneven ground or the stars or the moon and sunThey might hear a sighted person sayingWhite cloth is really nice its attractive stainless and cleanTheyd go in search of white clothBut someone would cheat them with a dirty soiled garment sayingSir here is a white cloth for you its attractive stainless and cleanTheyd take it and put it onTheir friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat themThe field surgeon would make medicine for thememetics purgatives ointment counterointment or nasal treatmentAnd when they used it their eyes would be cured so that they could see clearlyAs soon as their eyes were cured theyd lose all desire for that dirty soiled garmentThen they would consider that person to be no friend but an enemy and might even think of murdering themFor such a long time Ive been cheated tricked and deceived by that person with this dirty soiled garment when he saidSir here is a white cloth for you its attractive stainless and cleanIn the same way Māgaṇḍiya suppose I were to teach you the Dhamma sayingThis is that health this is that extinguishmentYou might know health and see extinguishmentAnd as soon as your vision arises you might give up desire for the five grasping aggregatesAnd you might even thinkFor such a long time Ive been cheated tricked and deceived by this mindFor what I have been grasping is only form feeling perception choices and consciousnessMy grasping is a condition for continued existence Continued existence is a condition for rebirth Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to beThat is how this entire mass of suffering originatesI am quite confident that Master Gotamais capable of teaching me so that I can rise from this seat cured of blindnessWell then Māgaṇḍiya you should associate with good peopleWhen you associate with good people you will hear the true teachingWhen you hear the true teaching youll practice in line with the teachingWhen you practice in line with the teaching youll know and see for yourselfThese are diseases boils and dartsAnd here is where diseases boils and darts cease without anything left overWhen my grasping ceases continued existence ceases When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases When rebirth ceases old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress ceaseThat is how this entire mass of suffering ceasesWhen he said this Māgaṇḍiya said to himExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceMāgaṇḍiya if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probation When four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhoodHowever I have recognized individual differences in this matterSir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probation When four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhoodAnd the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after his ordination Venerable Māgaṇḍiya living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Māgaṇḍiya became one of the perfectedMiddle DiscoursesThe Analysis of the ElementsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the Magadhan lands when he arrived at RājagahaHe went to see Bhaggava the potter and saidBhaggava if it is no trouble Id like to spend a single night in your workshopIts no trouble sirBut theres a renunciate already staying thereIf he allows it sir you may stay as long as you likeNow at that time a gentleman named Pukkusāti had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in the BuddhaAnd it was he who had first taken up residence in the workshopThen the Buddha approached Venerable Pukkusāti and saidMendicant if it is no trouble Id like to spend a single night in the workshopThe potters workshop is spacious reverendPlease stay as long as you likeThen the Buddha entered the workshop and spread out a grass mat to one side He sat down crosslegged with his body straight and established mindfulness right thereHe spent most of the night sitting meditationand so did PukkusātiThen it occurred to the BuddhaThis gentlemans conduct is impressiveWhy dont I question himSo the Buddha said to PukkusātiIn whose name have you gone forth reverendWho is your TeacherWhose teaching do you believe inReverend there is the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedIve gone forth in his nameThat Blessed One is my Teacherand I believe in his teachingBut mendicant where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaIn the northern lands there is a city called SāvatthīThere the Blessed One is now staying the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaBut have you ever seen that BuddhaWould you recognize him if you saw himNo Ive never seen himand I wouldnt recognize him if I didThen it occurred to the BuddhaThis gentleman has gone forth in my nameWhy dont I teach him the DhammaSo the Buddha said to PukkusātiMendicant I shall teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attention I will speakYes reverend replied PukkusātiThe Buddha said thisThis person has six elements six fields of contact and eighteen mental preoccupationsThey have four foundations standing on which the streams of identification dont flow And when the streams of identification dont flow theyre called a sage at peaceDont neglect wisdom preserve truth foster generosity and train only for peaceThis is the recitation passage for the analysis of the elementsThis person has six elementsThats what I said but why did I say itThere are these six elementsthe elements of earth water fire air space and consciousnessThis person has six elementsThats what I said and this is why I said itThis person has six fields of contactThats what I said but why did I say itThe fields of contact of the eye ear nose tongue body and mindThis person has six fields of contactThats what I said and this is why I said itThis person has eighteen mental preoccupationsThats what I said but why did I say itSeeing a sight with the eye one is preoccupied with a sight thats a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimityHearing a sound with the ear Smelling an odor with the nose Tasting a flavor with the tongue Feeling a touch with the body Becoming conscious of a thought with the mind one is preoccupied with a thought thats a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimitySo there are six preoccupations with happiness six preoccupations with sadness and six preoccupations with equanimityThis person has eighteen mental preoccupationsThats what I said and this is why I said itThis person has four foundationsThats what I said but why did I say itThe foundations of wisdom truth generosity and peaceThis person has four foundationsThats what I said and this is why I said itDont neglect wisdom preserve truth foster generosity and train only for peaceThats what I said but why did I say itAnd how does one not neglect wisdomThere are these six elementsthe elements of earth water fire air space and consciousnessAnd what is the earth elementThe earth element may be interior or exteriorAnd what is the interior earth elementAnything hard solid and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includeshead hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces or anything else hard solid and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individualThis is called the interior earth elementThe interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth elementThis should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you reject the earth element detaching the mind from the earth elementAnd what is the water elementThe water element may be interior or exteriorAnd what is the interior water elementAnything thats water watery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includesbile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urine or anything else thats water watery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individualThis is called the interior water elementThe interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water elementThis should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you reject the water element detaching the mind from the water elementAnd what is the fire elementThe fire element may be interior or exteriorAnd what is the interior fire elementAnything thats fire fiery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includesthat which warms that which ages that which heats you up when feverish that which properly digests food and drink or anything else thats fire fiery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individualThis is called the interior fire elementThe interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the fire elementThis should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you reject the fire element detaching the mind from the fire elementAnd what is the air elementThe air element may be interior or exteriorAnd what is the interior air elementAnything thats air airy and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includeswinds that go up or down winds in the belly or the bowels winds that flow through the limbs inbreaths and outbreaths or anything else thats air airy and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individualThis is called the interior air elementThe interior air element and the exterior air element are just the air elementThis should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you reject the air element detaching the mind from the air elementAnd what is the space elementThe space element may be interior or exteriorAnd what is the interior space elementAnything thats space spacious and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includesthe ear canals nostrils and mouth and the space for swallowing what is eaten and drunk the space where it stays and the space for excreting it from the nether regionsThis is called the interior space elementThe interior space element and the exterior space element are just the space elementThis should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you reject the space element detaching the mind from the space elementThere remains only consciousness pure and brightAnd what does that consciousness knowIt knows pleasure and pain and neutralPleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasantWhen they feel a pleasant feeling they know I feel a pleasant feelingThey know With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stopsPainful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painfulWhen they feel a painful feeling they know I feel a painful feelingThey know With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stopsNeutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutralWhen they feel a neutral feeling they know I feel a neutral feelingThey know With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stopsWhen you rub two sticks together heat is generated and fire is produced But when you part the sticks and lay them aside any corresponding heat ceases and stopsIn the same way pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant They know With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stopsThere remains only equanimity pure bright pliable workable and radiantIts like when a goldsmith or a goldsmiths apprentice prepares a forge fires the crucible picks up some gold with tongs and puts it in the crucible From time to time they fan it from time to time they sprinkle water on it and from time to time they just watch over it That gold becomes pliable workable and radiant not brittle and is ready to be worked Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament they want whether a bracelet earrings a necklace or a golden garlandIn the same way there remains only equanimity pure bright pliable workable and radiantThey understandIf I were to apply this equanimity so pure and bright to the dimension of infinite space my mind would develop accordinglyAnd this equanimity of mine relying on that and grasping it would remain for a very long timeIf I were to apply this equanimity so pure and bright to the dimension of infinite consciousness my mind would develop accordinglyAnd this equanimity of mine relying on that and grasping it would remain for a very long timeIf I were to apply this equanimity so pure and bright to the dimension of nothingness my mind would develop accordinglyAnd this equanimity of mine relying on that and grasping it would remain for a very long timeIf I were to apply this equanimity so pure and bright to the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception my mind would develop accordinglyAnd this equanimity of mine relying on that and grasping it would remain for a very long timeThey understandIf I were to apply this equanimity so pure and bright to the dimension of infinite space my mind would develop accordinglyBut that is conditionedIf I were to apply this equanimity so pure and bright to the dimension of infinite consciousness nothingness neither perception nor nonperception my mind would develop accordinglyBut that is conditionedThey neither make a choice nor form an intention to continue existence or to end existenceBecause of this they dont grasp at anything in the worldNot grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguishedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceIf they feel a pleasant feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in itIf they feel a painful feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in itIf they feel a neutral feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in itIf they feel a pleasant feeling they feel it detachedIf they feel a painful feeling they feel it detachedIf they feel a neutral feeling they feel it detachedFeeling the end of the body approaching they understand I feel the end of the body approaching Feeling the end of life approaching they understand I feel the end of life approachingThey understand When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end everything thats felt since I no longer take pleasure in it will become cool right hereSuppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burnAs the oil and the wick are used up it would be extinguished due to lack of fuelIn the same way feeling the end of the body approaching they understand I feel the end of the body approaching Feeling the end of life approaching they understand I feel the end of life approachingThey understand When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end everything thats felt since I no longer take pleasure in it will become cool right hereTherefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of wisdomFor this is the ultimate noble wisdom namelythe knowledge of the ending of sufferingTheir freedom being founded on truth is unshakableFor that which is false has a deceptive nature while that which is true has an undeceptive natureextinguishmentTherefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of truthFor this is the ultimate noble truth namelythat which has an undeceptive natureextinguishmentIn their ignorance they used to acquire attachmentsThose have been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so they are unable to arise in the futureTherefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of generosityFor this is the ultimate noble generosity namelyletting go of all attachmentsIn their ignorance they used to be covetous full of desire and lustThat has been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so its unable to arise in the futureIn their ignorance they used to be contemptuous full of ill will and malevolenceThat has been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so its unable to arise in the futureIn their ignorance they used to be ignorant full of delusionThat has been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so its unable to arise in the futureTherefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of peaceFor this is the ultimate noble peace namelythe pacification of greed hate and delusionDont neglect wisdom preserve truth foster generosity and train only for peaceThats what I said and this is why I said itThey have four foundations standing on which the streams of identification dont flow And when the streams of identification dont flow theyre called a sage at peaceThats what I said but why did I say itThese are all forms of identifying I am I am this I will be I will not be I will have form I will be formless I will be percipient I will be nonpercipient I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipientIdentification is a disease a boil a dartHaving gone beyond all identification one is called a sage at peaceThe sage at peace is not reborn does not grow old and does not die They are not shaken and do not yearnFor they have nothing which would cause them to be reborn Not being reborn how could they grow old Not growing old how could they die Not dying how could they be shaken Not shaking for what could they yearnThey have four foundations standing on which the streams of identification dont flow And when the streams of identification dont flow theyre called a sage at peaceThats what I said and this is why I said itMendicant you should remember this brief analysis of the six elementsThen Venerable Pukkusāti thoughtIt seems the Teacher has come to me The Holy One has come to me The fully awakened Buddha has come to me He got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder bowed with his head to the Buddhas feet and saidI have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me to presume to address the Buddha as reverendPlease sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in futureIndeed mendicant you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you to act in that wayBut since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly I accept itFor it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is deal with it properly and commit to restraint in the futureSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceBut mendicant are your bowl and robes completeNo sir they are notThe Realized Ones do not ordain those whose bowl and robes are incompleteAnd then Venerable Pukkusāti approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingBut while he was wandering in search of a bowl and robes a stray cow took his lifeThen several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir the gentleman named Pukkusāti who was advised in brief by the Buddha has passed awayWhere has he been reborn in his next lifeMendicants Pukkusāti was astute He practiced in line with the teachings and did not trouble me about the teachingsWith the ending of the five lower fetters hes been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that worldThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith Vacchagotta on FireSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama is this your view The cosmos is eternal This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view The cosmos is not eternal This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view The world is finite This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view The world is infinite This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view The soul and the body are the same thing This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view The soul and the body are different things This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view A Realized One exists after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view A Realized One doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaThen is this your view A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats not my view VacchaMaster Gotama when asked these ten questions you say Thats not my viewSeeing what drawback do you avoid all these convictionsEach of these ten convictions is the thicket of views the desert of views the trick of views the evasiveness of views the fetter of views Theyre beset with anguish distress and fever They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentSeeing this drawback I avoid all these convictionsBut does Master Gotama have any convictions at allThe Realized One has done away with convictionsFor the Realized One has seenSuch is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of formSuch is feeling such is the origin of feeling such is the ending of feelingSuch is perception such is the origin of perception such is the ending of perceptionSuch are choices such is the origin of choices such is the ending of choicesSuch is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousnessThats why the Realized One is freed with the ending fading away cessation giving up and letting go of all identifying all worries and all ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit I sayBut Master Gotama when a mendicants mind is freed like this where are they rebornTheyre reborn doesnt apply VacchaWell then are they not rebornTheyre not reborn doesnt apply VacchaWell then are they both reborn and not rebornTheyre both reborn and not reborn doesnt apply VacchaWell then are they neither reborn nor not rebornTheyre neither reborn nor not reborn doesnt apply VacchaMaster Gotama when asked all these questions you say It doesnt applyI fail to understand this point Master Gotama Ive fallen into confusionAnd Ive now lost even the degree of clarity I had from previous discussions with Master GotamaNo wonder you dont understand Vaccha no wonder youre confusedFor this principle is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astuteIts hard for you to understand since you have a different view creed preference practice and traditionWell then Vaccha Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think VacchaSuppose a fire was burning in front of you Would you knowThis fire is burning in front of meYes I would Master GotamaBut Vaccha suppose they were to ask youThis fire burning in front of you what does it depend on to burn How would you answerI would answer like thisThis fire burning in front of me burns in dependence on grass and logs as fuelSuppose that fire burning in front of you was extinguished Would you knowThis fire in front of me is extinguishedYes I would Master GotamaBut Vaccha suppose they were to ask youThis fire in front of you that is extinguished in what direction did it goeast south west or north How would you answerIt doesnt apply Master Gotama The fire depended on grass and logs as fuel When that runs out and no more fuel is added the fire is reckoned to have become extinguished due to lack of fuelIn the same way Vaccha any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the futureA Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form Theyre deep immeasurable and hard to fathomlike the oceanTheyre reborn theyre not reborn theyre both reborn and not reborn theyre neither reborn nor not rebornnone of these applyAny feeling perception consciousness by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the futureA Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of consciousness Theyre deep immeasurable and hard to fathomlike the oceanTheyre reborn theyre not reborn theyre both reborn and not reborn theyre neither reborn nor not rebornnone of these applyWhen he said this the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama suppose there was a large sal tree not far from a town or villageAnd because its impermanent its branches and foliage bark and shoots and softwood would fall offAfter some time it would be rid of branches and foliage bark and shoots and softwood consisting purely of heartwoodIn the same way Master Gotamas dispensation is rid of branches and foliage bark and shoots and softwood consisting purely of heartwoodExcellent Master Gotama From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesAt SāmagāmaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans near the village of SāmaNow at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at PāvāWith his passing the Jain ascetics split dividing into two factions arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed wordsYou dont understand this teaching and trainingI understand this teaching and trainingWhat you understand this teaching and training Youre practicing wrongIm practicing rightI stay on topic you dontYou said last what you should have said firstYou said first what you should have said lastWhat youve thought so much about has been disproved Your doctrine is refuted Go on save your doctrine Youre trapped get yourself out of thisif you canYoud think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain asceticsAnd the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputtas whiteclothed lay disciples were disillusioned dismayed and disappointed in the Jain ascetics They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha with broken monument and without a refugeAnd then after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā the novice Cunda went to see Venerable nanda at Sāma villageHe bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenednanda said to himReverend Cunda we should see the Buddha about this matterCome lets go to the Buddha and inform him about thisYes sir replied CundaThen nanda and Cunda went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and nanda informed him of what Cunda had saidHe went on to saySir it occurs to meWhen the Buddha has passed away let no dispute arise in the SaṅghaFor such a dispute would be for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of gods and humansWhat do you think nandaDo you see even two mendicants who disagree regarding the things I have taught from my direct knowledge that isthe four kinds of mindfulness meditation the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven awakening factors and the noble eightfold pathNo sir I do notNevertheless there are some individuals who appear to live obedient to the Buddha but when the Buddha has passed away they might create a dispute in the Saṅgha regarding livelihood or the monastic codeSuch a dispute would be for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of gods and humansnanda dispute about livelihood or the monastic code is a minor matterBut should a dispute arise in the Saṅgha concerning the path or the practice that would be for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of gods and humansnanda there are these six roots of argumentsFirstly a mendicant is irritable and hostileSuch a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher the teaching and the Saṅgha and they dont fulfill the trainingThey create a dispute in the Saṅgha which is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of gods and humansIf you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others you should try to give up this bad thingIf you dont see it you should practice so that it doesnt come up in the futureThats how to give up this bad root of arguments so it doesnt come up in the futureFurthermore a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous Theyre jealous and stingy Theyre devious and deceitful They have wicked desires and wrong view Theyre attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let goSuch a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher the teaching and the Saṅgha and they dont fulfill the trainingThey create a dispute in the Saṅgha which is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of gods and humansIf you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others you should try to give up this bad thingIf you dont see it you should practice so that it doesnt come up in the futureThats how to give up this bad root of arguments so it doesnt come up in the futureThese are the six roots of argumentsThere are four kinds of disciplinary issuesWhat fourDisciplinary issues due to disputes accusations offenses or

the mendicants continually argue quarrel and fight doing and saying many things that are not proper for an asceticThose mendicants should all sit together in harmonyA competent mendicant of one party

the mendicants were not happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith AssalāyanaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Sāvatthī on some businessThen those brahmins thoughtThis ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classesWho is capable of having a dialogue with him about thisNow at that time the brahmin student Assalāyana was residing in Sāvatthī He was young newly tonsured he was sixteen years old He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manThen those brahmins thoughtThis Assalāyana is capable of having a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about thisSo they approached Assalāyana and said to himThis ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classesPlease Mister Assalāyana have a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about thisWhen they said this Assalāyana said to themThey say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principleBut speakers of principle are hard to have a dialogue withIm not capable of having a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about thisFor a second time those brahmins said to himThis ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classesPlease Mister Assalāyana have a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about thisFor you have lived as a wandererAnd for a second time Assalāyana refusedFor a third time those brahmins said to himThis ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classesPlease Mister Assalāyana have a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about thisFor you have lived as a wandererDont admit defeat before going into battleWhen they said this Assalāyana said to themClearly gentlemen Im not getting through to you when I sayThey say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principleBut speakers of principle are hard to have a dialogue withIm not capable of having a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about thisNevertheless I shall go at your biddingThen Assalāyana together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama the brahmins sayOnly brahmins are the highest caste other castes are inferiorOnly brahmins are the light caste other castes are darkOnly brahmins are purified not othersOnly brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of BrahmāWhat do you say about thisBut Assalāyana brahmin women are seen menstruating being pregnant giving birth and breastfeedingYet even though theyre born from a brahmin womb they sayOnly brahmins are the highest caste other castes are inferiorOnly brahmins are the light caste other castes are darkOnly brahmins are purified not othersOnly brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of BrahmāEven though you say this still the brahmins maintain their beliefWhat do you think AssalāyanaHave you heard that in Greece and Persia and other foreign lands there are only two classes masters and bonded servants and that masters may become servants and servants mastersYes I have heard thatThen what is the source of the brahmins selfconfidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claimEven though you say this still the brahmins maintain their beliefWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose an aristocrat were to kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct to use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and to be covetous malicious with wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyd be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell Would this happen only to an aristocrat and not to a brahminOr suppose a merchantor a worker were to act in the same way Would that result befall only a merchant or a worker and not to a brahminNo Master GotamaIf they acted the same way the same result would befall an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerFor if any of the four classes were to kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct to use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and to be covetous malicious with wrong view then when their body breaks up after death theyd be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThen what is the source of the brahmins selfconfidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claimEven though you say this still the brahmins maintain their beliefWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose a brahmin were to refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct from using speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and from covetousness malice and wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyd be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm Would this happen only to an brahmin and not to an aristocrat a merchant or a workerNo Master GotamaIf they acted the same way the same result would befall an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerFor if any of the four classes were to refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct from using speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and from covetousness malice and wrong view then when their body breaks up after death theyd be reborn in a good place a heavenly realmThen what is the source of the brahmins selfconfidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claimEven though you say this still the brahmins maintain their beliefWhat do you think AssalāyanaIs only a brahmin capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this region and not an aristocrat merchant or workerNo Master GotamaAristocrats brahmins merchants and workers can all do soFor all four classes are capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this regionThen what is the source of the brahmins selfconfidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claimEven though you say this still the brahmins maintain their beliefWhat do you think AssalāyanaIs only a brahmin capable of taking some bathing paste of powdered shell going to the river and washing off dust and dirt and not an aristocrat merchant or workerNo Master GotamaAll four classes are capable of doing thisThen what is the source of the brahmins selfconfidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claimEven though you say this still the brahmins maintain their beliefWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose an anointed aristocratic king were to gather a hundred people born in different castes and say to themPlease gentlemen let anyone here who was born in a family of aristocrats brahmins or chieftains take a drillstick made of teak sal frankincense wood sandalwood or cherry wood light a fire and produce heatAnd let anyone here who was born in a family of outcastes hunters bambooworkers chariotmakers or wastecollectors take a drillstick made from a dogs drinking trough a pigs trough a dustbin or castoroil wood light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think AssalāyanaWould only the fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood have flames color and radiance and be usable as fireand not the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality woodNo Master GotamaThe fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood would have flames color and radiance and be usable as fireand so would the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality woodFor all fire has flames color and radiance and is usable as fireThen what is the source of the brahmins selfconfidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claimEven though you say this still the brahmins maintain their beliefWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl and they had a childWould that child be called an aristocrat after the father or a brahmin after the motherThey could be called eitherWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose a brahmin boy was to sleep with an aristocrat girl and they had a childWould that child be called an aristocrat after the mother or a brahmin after the fatherThey could be called eitherWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose a mare were to mate with a donkey and she gave birth to a muleWould that mule be called a horse after the mother or a donkey after the fatherIts a mule as it is a crossbreedI see the difference in this casebut not in the previous casesWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers who had shared a womb One was educated a reciter while the other was uneducated and not a reciterWho would the brahmins feed first at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guestsTheyd first feed the student who was educated a reciterFor how could an offering to someone who is uneducated and not a reciter be very fruitfulWhat do you think AssalāyanaSuppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers who had shared a womb One was educated a reciter but was unethical of bad character while the other was uneducated and not a reciter but was ethical and of good characterWho would the brahmins feed firstTheyd first feed the student who was uneducated and not a reciter but was ethical and of good characterFor how could an offering to someone who is unethical and of bad character be very fruitfulFirstly you relied on birth Assalāyanathen you switched to educationthen you switched to abstemious behaviorNow youve come around to believing in purification for the four classes just as I advocateWhen he said this Assalāyana sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to sayKnowing this the Buddha said to himOnce upon a time Assalāyana seven brahmin hermits settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region They had the following harmful misconceptionOnly brahmins are the highest caste other castes are inferiorOnly brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of BrahmāThe hermit Devala the Dark heard about thisSo he did up his hair and beard dressed in magenta robes put on his boots grasped a golden staff and appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin hermitsThen he wandered about the yard sayingWhere oh where have those brahmin hermits goneWhere oh where have those brahmin hermits goneThen those brahmin hermits saidWhos this wandering about our courtyard like a cowpokeLets curse himSo they cursed Devala the DarkBe ashes lowlifeBe ashes lowlifeBut the more the hermits cursed him the more attractive goodlooking and lovely Devala the Dark becameThen those brahmin hermits saidOur austerities are in vain Our spiritual path is fruitlessFor when we used to curse someoneto become ashesashes they becameBut the more we curse this one the more attractive goodlooking and lovely he becomesGentlemen your austerities are not in vain your spiritual path is not fruitlessPlease let go of your malevolence towards meWe let go of our malevolence towards youBut who are you sirHave you heard ofthe hermit Devala the DarkYes sirI am he sirsThen they approached Devala and bowed to himDevala said to themI heard that when the seven brahmin hermits had settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region they had the following harmful misconceptionOnly brahmins are the highest caste other castes are inferiorOnly brahmins are the light caste other castes are darkOnly brahmins are purified not othersOnly brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of BrahmāThats right sirBut do you knowwhether your birth mother only had relations with a brahmin and not with a nonbrahminWe dont know thatBut do you knowwhether your birth mothers mothers back to the seventh generation only had relations with brahmins and not with nonbrahminsWe dont know thatBut do you knowwhether your birth father only had relations with a brahmin woman and not with a nonbrahminWe dont know thatBut do you knowwhether your birth fathers fathers back to the seventh generation only had relations with brahmins and not with nonbrahminsWe dont know thatBut do you knowhow an embryo is conceivedWe do know that sirAn embryo is conceived when these three things come togetherthe mother and father come together the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle and the spirit being reborn is presentBut do you knowfor sure whether that spirit is an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerWe dont know thatIn that case sirs dont you knowwhat you areIn that case sir we dont knowwhat we areSo even those seven brahmin hermits were stumped when pursued pressed and grilled by the seer Devala on their own doctrine of ancestrySo how could you succeed being grilled by me now on your own doctrine of ancestryyou who have not even mastered your own teachers doctrineWhen he had spoken Assalāyana said to himExcellent Master Gotama From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesThe Foolish and the AstuteSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisThese are the three characteristics signs and manifestations of a foolWhat threeA fool thinks poorly speaks poorly and acts poorlyIf a fool didnt think poorly speak poorly and act poorly then how would the astute know of themThis fellow is a fool a bad personBut since a fool does think poorly speak poorly and act poorly then the astute do know of themThis fellow is a fool a bad personA fool experiences three kinds of suffering and sadness in the present lifeSuppose a fool is sitting in a council hall a street or a crossroadwhere people are discussing what is proper and fittingAnd suppose that fool is someone who kills living creatures steals commits sexual misconduct lies and uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligenceThen that fool thinksThese people are discussing what is proper and fittingBut those things are found in me and I am seen in themThis is the first kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in the present lifeFurthermore a fool sees that the kings have arrested a bandit a criminal and subjected them to various punishmentswhipping caning and clubbing cutting off hands or feet or both cutting off ears or nose or both the porridge pot the shellshave the demons mouth the garland of fire the burning hand the grass blades the bark dress the antelope the meat hook the coins the caustic pickle the twisting bar the straw mat being splashed with hot oil being fed to the dogs being impaled alive and being beheadedThen that fool thinksThe kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishmentsthose things are found in me and I am seen in themIf the kings find out about me they will inflict the same kinds of punishments on meThis is the second kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in the present lifeFurthermore when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground their past bad deedsmisconduct of body speech and mindsettle down upon them rest down upon them and lay down upon themIt is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down rests down and lays down upon the earthIn the same way when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground their past bad deedsmisconduct of body speech and mindsettle down upon them rest down upon them and lay down upon themThen that fool thinksWell I havent done good and skillful things that keep me safeAnd I have done bad violent and depraved thingsWhen I depart Ill go to the place where people whove done such things goThey sorrow and wail and lament beating their breasts and falling into confusionThis is the third kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in the present lifeHaving done bad things by way of body speech and mind when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellAnd if theres anything of which it may be rightly said thatit is utterly unlikable undesirable and disagreeable it is of hell that this should be saidSo much so that its not easy to give a simile for how painful hell isWhen he said this one of the mendicants asked the BuddhaBut sir is it possible to give a simileIts possible said the BuddhaSuppose they arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to the king sayingYour Majesty this is a bandit a criminal Punish him as you willThe king would sayGo my men and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spearsThe kings men did as they were toldThen at midday the king would sayMy men how is that manHes still alive Your MajestyThe king would sayGo my men and strike this man in the midday with a hundred spearsThe kings men did as they were toldThen late in the afternoon the king would sayMy men how is that manHes still alive Your MajestyThe king would sayGo my men and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spearsThe kings men did as they were toldWhat do you think mendicantsWould that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spearsSir that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear let alone three hundred spearsThen the Buddha picking up a stone the size of his palm addressed the mendicantsWhat do you think mendicantsWhich is bigger the stone the size of my palm that Ive picked up or the Himalayas the king of mountainsSir the stone youve picked up is tiny Compared to the Himalayas it doesnt count its not worth a fraction theres no comparisonIn the same way compared to the suffering in hell the pain and distress experienced by that man due to being struck with three hundred spears doesnt count its not worth a fraction theres no comparisonThe wardens of hell punish them with the fivefold crucifixionThey drive redhot stakes through the hands and feet and another in the middle of the chestAnd there they feel painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminatedThe wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes They hang them upsidedown and hack them with hatchets They harness them to a chariot and drive them back and forth across burning ground blazing and glowing They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals blazing and glowing The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them into a redhot copper pot burning blazing and glowingThere theyre seared in boiling scum and theyre swept up and down and round and roundAnd there they feel painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminatedThe wardens of hell toss them in the Great HellNow about that Great HellFour are its corners four its doorsneatly divided in equal partsSurrounded by an iron wallof iron is its roofThe ground is even made of ironit burns with fierce fireThe heat forever radiatesa hundred leagues aroundI could tell you many different things about hellSo much so that its not easy to completely describe the suffering in hellThere are mendicants animals that feed on grassThey eat by cropping fresh or dried grass with their teethAnd what animals feed on grassElephants horses cattle donkeys goats deer and various othersA fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here when their body breaks up after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on grassThere are animals that feed on dungWhen they catch a whiff of dung they run to it thinkingThere well eat There well eatIts like when brahmins smell a burnt offering they run to it thinkingThere well eat There well eatIn the same way there are animals that feed on dungWhen they catch a whiff of dung they run to it thinkingThere well eat There well eatAnd what animals feed on dungChickens pigs dogs jackals and various othersA fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on dungThere are animals who are born live and die in darknessAnd what animals are born live and die in darknessMoths maggots earthworms and various othersA fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born live and die in darknessThere are animals who are born live and die in waterAnd what animals are born live and die in waterFish turtles crocodiles and various othersA fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born live and die in waterThere are animals who are born live and die in filthAnd what animals are born live and die in filthThose animals that are born live and die in a rotten fish a rotten corpserotten porridgeor a sewerA fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born live and die in filthI could tell you many different things about the animal realmSo much so that its not easy to completely describe the suffering in the animal realmMendicants suppose a person were to throw a yoke with a single hole into the oceanThe east wind wafts it west the west wind wafts it east the north wind wafts it south and the south wind wafts it northAnd there was a oneeyed turtle who popped up once every hundred yearsWhat do you think mendicantsWould that oneeyed turtle still poke its neck through the hole in that yokeOnly after a very long time sir if everThat oneeyed turtle would poke its neck through the hole in that yoke sooner than a fool who has fallen to the underworld would be reborn as a human being I sayWhy is thatBecause in that place theres no principled or moral conduct and no doing what is good and skillfulThere they just prey on each other preying on the weakAnd suppose that fool after a very long time returned to the human realmTheyd be reborn in a low class familya family of outcastes hunters bambooworkers chariotmakers or wastecollectorsSuch families are poor with little to eat or drink where life is tough and food and shelter are hard to findAnd theyd be ugly unsightly deformed chronically illoneeyed crippled lame or halfparalyzed They dont get to have food drink clothes and vehicles garlands perfumes and makeup or bed house and lightingAnd they do bad things by way of body speech and mindWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellSuppose a gambler on the first unlucky throw were to lose his wife and child all his property and then get thrown in jailBut such an unlucky throw is trivial compared tothe unlucky throw whereby a fool having done bad things by way of body speech and mind when their body breaks up after death is reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThis is the total fulfillment of the fools levelThere are these three characteristics signs and manifestations of an astute personWhat threeAn astute person thinks well speaks well and acts wellIf an astute person didnt think well speak well and act well then how would the astute know of themThis fellow is astute a good personBut since an astute person does think well speak well and act well then the astute do know of themThis fellow is astute a good personAn astute person experiences three kinds of pleasure and happiness in the present lifeSuppose an astute person is sitting in a council hall a street or a crossroadwhere people are discussing about what is proper and fittingAnd suppose that astute person is someone who refrains from killing living creatures stealing committing sexual misconduct lying and alcoholic drinks that cause negligenceThen that astute person thinksThese people are discussing what is proper and fittingAnd those things are found in me and I am seen in themThis is the first kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in the present lifeFurthermore an astute person sees that the kings have arrested a bandit a criminal and subjected them to various punishmentswhipping caning and clubbing cutting off hands or feet or both cutting off ears or nose or both the porridge pot the shellshave the demons mouth the garland of fire the burning hand the grass blades the bark dress the antelope the meat hook the coins the caustic pickle the twisting bar the straw mat being splashed with hot oil being fed to the dogs being impaled alive and being beheadedThen that astute person thinksThe kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishmentsthose things are not found in me and I am not seen in themThis is the second kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in the present lifeFurthermore when an astute person is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground their past good deedsgood conduct of body speech and mindsettle down upon them rest down upon them and lay down upon themIt is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down rests down and lays down upon the earthIn the same way when an astute person is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground their past good deedsgood conduct of body speech and mindsettle down upon them rest down upon them and lay down upon themThen that astute person thinksWell I havent done bad violent and depraved thingsAnd I have done good and skillful deeds that keep me safeWhen I pass away Ill go to the place where people whove done such things goSo they dont sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionThis is the third kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in the present lifeWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmAnd if theres anything of which it may be rightly said thatit is utterly likable desirable and agreeable it is of heaven that this should be saidSo much so that its not easy to give a simile for how pleasurable heaven isWhen he said this one of the mendicants asked the BuddhaBut sir is it possible to give a simileIts possible said the BuddhaSuppose there was a king a wheelturning monarch who possessed seven treasures and four blessings and experienced pleasure and happiness because of themWhat sevenIts when on the fifteenth day sabbath an anointed aristocratic king has bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath And the heavenly wheeltreasure appears to him with a thousand spokes with rim and hub complete in every detailSeeing this the king thinksI have heard that when the heavenly wheeltreasure appears to a king in this way he becomes a wheelturning monarchAm I then a wheelturning monarchThen the anointed aristocratic king taking a ceremonial vase in his left hand besprinkled the wheeltreasure with his right hand sayingRoll forth O wheeltreasure Triumph O wheeltreasureThen the wheeltreasure rolls towards the eastAnd the king follows it together with his army of four divisionsIn whatever place the wheeltreasure stands still there the king comes to stay together with his armyAnd any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter come to the wheelturning monarch and sayCome great king Welcome great king We are yours great king instruct usThe wheelturning monarch saysDo not kill living creatures Do not steal Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not lie Do not drink alcohol Maintain the current level of taxationAnd so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter become his vassalsThen the wheeltreasure having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again rolls towards the south Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again it rolls towards the west Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again it rolls towards the north followed by the king together with his army of four divisionsIn whatever place the wheeltreasure stands still there the king comes to stay together with his armyAnd any opposing rulers of the northern quarter come to the wheelturning monarch and sayCome great king Welcome great king We are yours great king instruct usThe wheelturning monarch saysDo not kill living creatures Do not steal Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not lie Do not drink alcohol Maintain the current level of taxationAnd so the rulers of the northern quarter become his vassalsAnd then the wheeltreasure having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean returns to the royal capital There it stands still at the gate to the royal compound as if fixed to an axle illuminating the royal compoundSuch is the wheeltreasure that appears to the wheelturning monarchNext the elephanttreasure appears to the wheelturning monarchIt was an allwhite skywalker with psychic power touching the ground in seven places a king of elephants named SabbathSeeing him the king was impressedThis would truly be a fine elephant vehicle if he would submit to tamingThen the elephanttreasure submitted to taming as if he were a fine thoroughbred elephant that had been tamed for a long timeOnce it so happened that the wheelturning monarch testing that same elephanttreasure mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfastSuch is the elephanttreasure that appears to the wheelturning monarchNext the horsetreasure appears to the wheelturning monarchIt was an allwhite skywalker with psychic power with head of black and mane like woven reeds a royal steed named ThundercloudSeeing him the king was impressedThis would truly be a fine horse vehicle if he would submit to tamingThen the horsetreasure submitted to taming as if he were a fine thoroughbred horse that had been tamed for a long timeOnce it so happened that the wheelturning monarch testing that same horsetreasure mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfastSuch is the horsetreasure that appears to the wheelturning monarchNext the jeweltreasure appears to the wheelturning monarchIt is a beryl gem thats naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworkedAnd the radiance of that jewel spreads allround for a leagueOnce it so happened that the wheelturning monarch testing that same jeweltreasure mobilized his army of four divisions and with the jewel hoisted on his banner set out in the dark of the nightThen the villagers around them set off to work thinking that it was daySuch is the jeweltreasure that appears to the wheelturning monarchNext the womantreasure appears to the wheelturning monarchShe is attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty Shes neither too tall nor too short neither too thin nor too fat neither too dark nor too light She outdoes human beauty without reaching divine beautyAnd her touch is like a tuft of cottonwool or kapokWhen its cool her limbs are warm and when its warm her limbs are coolThe fragrance of sandal floats from her body and lotus from her mouthShe gets up before the king and goes to bed after him and is obliging behaving nicely and speaking politelyThe womantreasure does not betray the wheelturning monarch even in thought still less in deedSuch is the womantreasure who appears to the wheelturning monarchNext the householdertreasure appears to the wheelturning monarchThe power of clairvoyance manifests in him as a result of past deeds by which he sees hidden treasure both owned and ownerlessHe approaches the wheelturning monarch and saysRelax sireI will take care of the treasuryOnce it so happened that the wheelturning monarch testing that same householdertreasure boarded a boat and sailed to the middle of the Ganges river Then he said to the householdertreasureHouseholder I need gold coins and bullionWell then great king draw the boat up to one shoreIts right here householder that I need gold coins and bullionThen that householdertreasure immersing both hands in the water pulled up a pot full of gold coin and bullion and said to the kingIs this sufficient great king Has enough been done great king enough offeredThe wheelturning monarch saidThat is sufficient householderEnough has been done enough offeredSuch is the householdertreasure that appears to the wheelturning monarchNext the counselortreasure appears to the wheelturning monarchHe is astute competent intelligent and capable of getting the king to appoint who should be appointed dismiss who should be dismissed and retain who should be retainedHe approaches the wheelturning monarch and saysRelax sireI shall issue instructionsSuch is the counselortreasure that appears to the wheelturning monarchThese are the seven treasures possessed by a wheelturning monarchAnd what are the four blessingsA wheelturning monarch is attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty more so than other peopleThis is the first blessingFurthermore he is longlived more so than other peopleThis is the second blessingFurthermore he is rarely ill or unwell and his stomach digests well being neither too hot nor too cold more so than other peopleThis is the third blessingFurthermore a wheelturning monarch is as dear and beloved to the brahmins and householdersas a father is to his childrenAnd the brahmins and householders are as dear to the wheelturning monarchas children are to their fatherOnce it so happened that a wheelturning monarch went with his army of four divisions to visit a parkThen the brahmins and householders went up to him and saidSlow down Your Majesty so we may see you longerAnd the king addressed his charioteerDrive slowly charioteer so I can see the brahmins and householders longerThis is the fourth blessingThese are the four blessings possessed by a wheelturning monarchWhat do you think mendicantsWould a wheelturning monarch who possessed these seven treasures and these four blessings experience pleasure and happiness because of themSir a wheelturning monarch who possessed even a single one of these treasures would experience pleasure and happiness because of that let alone all seven treasures and four blessingsThen the Buddha picking up a stone the size of his palm addressed the mendicantsWhat do you think mendicantsWhich is bigger the stone the size of my palm that Ive picked up or the Himalayas the king of mountainsSir the stone youve picked up is tiny Compared to the Himalayas it doesnt count its not worth a fraction theres no comparisonIn the same way compared to the happiness of heaven the pleasure and happiness experienced by a wheelturning monarch due to those seven treasures and those four blessings doesnt even count its not even a fraction theres no comparisonAnd suppose that astute person after a very long time returned to the human realmTheyd be reborn in a welltodo family of aristocrats brahmins or householdersrich affluent and wealthy with lots of gold and silver lots of property and assets and lots of money and grainAnd theyd be attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty Theyd get to have food drink clothes and vehicles garlands perfumes and makeup and a bed house and lightingAnd they do good things by way of body speech and mindWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmSuppose a gambler on the first lucky throw was to win a big pile of moneyBut such a lucky throw is trivial compared tothe lucky throw whereby an astute person when their body breaks up after death is reborn in a good place a heavenly realmThis is the total fulfillment of the astute persons levelThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Imported ClothSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsHe wandered for alms in Sāvatthī After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother for the days meditationNow at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala mounted the Single Lotus Elephant and drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the dayHe saw nanda coming off in the distanceand said to the minister SirivaḍḍhaMy dear Sirivaḍḍha isnt that Venerable nandaIndeed it is great kingThen King Pasenadi addressed a manPlease mister go to Venerable nanda and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to himSir King Pasenadi of Kosala bows with his head at your feetAnd then saySir if you have no urgent business please wait a moment out of compassionYes Your Majesty that man repliedHe did as the king askednanda consented in silenceThen King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached nanda on footHe bowed stood to one side and said to nandaSir if you have no urgent business it would be nice of you to go to the bank of the Aciravatī river out of compassionnanda consented in silenceHe went to the river bank and sat at the root of a certain tree on a seat spread outThen King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached nanda on footHe bowed stood to one side and said to nandaHere Venerable nanda sit on this elephant rugEnough great kingyou sit on itIm sitting on my own seatSo the king sat down on the seat spread outSir might the Buddha engage in the sort of behaviorby way of body speech or mindthat is faulted by ascetics and brahminsNo great king the Buddha would not engage in the sort of behavior that is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahminsIts incredible sir its amazingFor I couldnt fully express the question but nandas answer completed it for meI dont believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by incompetent fools without examining or scrutinizing is the most important thingRather I believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by competent and intelligent people after examining and scrutinizing is the most important thingBut sir what kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahminsUnskillful behaviorBut what kind of bodily behavior is unskillfulBlameworthy behaviorBut what kind of bodily behavior is blameworthyHurtful behaviorBut what kind of bodily behavior is hurtfulBehavior that results in sufferingBut what kind of bodily behavior results in sufferingBodily behavior that leads to

brahminsSir does the Buddha praise embracing all these skillful thingsGreat king the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful thingsIts incredible sir its amazingHow well this was said by Venerable nandaIm delighted and satisfied with what youve expressed so wellSo much so thatif an elephanttreasure was suitable for you I would give you oneIf a horsetreasure was suitable for you I would give you oneIf a prize village was suitable for you I would give you oneBut sir I know thatthese things are not suitable for youThis imported cloth was sent to me by King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha packed in a parasol case Its exactly sixteen measures long and eight wideMay Venerable nanda please accept it out of compassionEnough great king My three robes are completeSir we have both seen this river Aciravatīwhen it has rained heavily in the mountains and the river overflows both its banksIn the same way Venerable nanda can make a set of three robes for himself from this imported cloakAnd you can share your old robes with your fellow monksIn this way my religious donation will come to overflow it seems to mePlease accept the imported clothSo nanda accepted itThen King Pasenadi said to himWell now sir I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease great king go at your convenienceThen King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what nanda said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled nanda keeping him on his right before leavingSoon after he left nanda went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one sideand told him what had happenedHe presented the cloth to the BuddhaThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants King Pasenadi is lucky so very luckyto get to see nanda and pay homage to himThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith Prince BodhiSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill in the deer park at Bhesakaḷās WoodNow at that time a new stilt longhouse named Pink Lotus had recently been constructed for Prince Bodhi It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at allThen Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student SañjikāputtaPlease dear Sañjikāputta go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd then ask him whether hemight accept tomorrows meal from me together with the mendicant SaṅghaYes sir Sañjikāputta replied He did as Prince Bodhi asked andthe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Sañjikāputta got up from his seat went to Prince Bodhi and saidI gave the ascetic Gotama your messageand he acceptedAnd when the night had passed Prince Bodhi had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home He also had the Pink Lotus longhouse spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase Then he said to SañjikāputtaPlease dear Sañjikāputta go to the Buddha and announce the time sayingSir its time The meal is readyYes sir Sañjikāputta replied and he did as he was askedThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Prince Bodhis homeNow at that time Prince Bodhi was standing outside the gates waiting for the BuddhaSeeing the Buddha coming off in the distancehe went out to greet him After bowing and inviting the Buddha to go first he approached the Pink Lotus longhouseBut the Buddha stopped by the last step of the staircaseThen Prince Bodhi said to himSir let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth Let the Holy One ascend on the clothIt will be for my lasting welfare and happinessBut when he said this the Buddha kept silentFor a second time and a third time Prince Bodhi said to himSir let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth Let the Holy One ascend on the clothIt will be for my lasting welfare and happinessThen the Buddha glanced at Venerable nandaSo nanda said to Prince BodhiFold up the cloth PrinceThe Buddha will not step upon white clothThe Realized One has compassion for future generationsSo Prince Bodhi had the cloth folded up and the seats spread out upstairs in the longhouseThen the Buddha ascended the longhouse and sat on the seats spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicantsThen Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Prince Bodhi took a low seat sat to one sideand said to himSir this is what I thinkPleasure is not gained through pleasure pleasure is gained through painPrince before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI too thoughtPleasure is not gained through pleasure pleasure is gained through painSome time later while still blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of lifethough my mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful facesI shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingḷāra Kālāma repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teachers doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it occurred to meIt is not solely by mere faith that ḷāra Kālāma declares I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved itSurely he meditates knowing and seeing this teachingSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma to what extent do you say youve realized this teaching with your own insightWhen I said this he declared the dimension of nothingnessThen it occurred to meIts not just ḷāra Kālāma who has faithand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that ḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point and declare having achieved itI have reverendI too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved itWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsSo the teaching that Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved itThe teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved itSo the teaching that I know you know and the teaching you know I knowI am like you and you are like meCome now reverend We should both lead this community togetherAnd that is how my teacher ḷāra Kālāma placed me his student on the same position as him and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingnessRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingUddaka repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teachers doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it occurred to meIt is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved itSurely he meditated knowing and seeing this teachingSo I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend to what extent did Rāma say hed realized this teaching with his own insightWhen I said this Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen it occurred to meIts not just Rāma who had faithand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point and declared having achieved itHe had reverendI too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved itWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsSo the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved itThe teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved itSo the teaching that Rāma directly knew you know and the teaching you know Rāma directly knewRāma was like you and you are like RāmaCome now reverend You should lead this communityAnd that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a teacher and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands I arrived at Senanigama near UruvelāThere I saw a delightful park a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby was a village to go for almsThen it occurred to meThis park is truly delightful a lovely grove with a flowing river thats clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby theres a village to go for almsThis is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditationSo I sat down right there thinkingThis is good enough for meditationAnd then these three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to meSuppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying in waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think PrinceBy drilling the stick against that green sappy log lying in water could they light a fire and produce heatWhy is thatBecause its a green sappy log and its lying in the waterThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who dont live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures They havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings because of their efforts they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the first example that occurred to meThen a second example occurred to meSuppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying on dry land far from the waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think PrinceBy drilling the stick against that green sappy log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heatWhy is thatBecause its still a green sappy log despite the fact that its lying on dry land far from waterThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures But they havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings because of their efforts they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the second example that occurred to meThen a third example occurred to meSuppose there was a dried up withered log and it was lying on dry land far from the waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think PrinceBy drilling the stick against that dried up withered log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heatYes sirWhy is thatBecause its a dried up withered log and its lying on dry land far from waterIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures And they have internally given up and stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings because of their efforts they are capable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the third example that occurred to meThese are the three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past that occurred to meThen it occurred to meWhy dont I with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth squeeze squash and torture mind with mindSo thats what I diduntil sweat ran from my armpitsIt was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes squashes and tortures themIn the same way with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I squeezed squashed and tortured mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpitsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I practice the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and noseBut then winds came out my ears making a loud noiselike the puffing of a blacksmiths bellowsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then strong winds ground my headlike a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp pointMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then I got a severe headachelike a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my headMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then strong winds carved up my bellylike a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a meat cleaverMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then there was an intense burning in my bodylike two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coalsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen some deities saw me and saidThe ascetic Gotama is deadOthers saidHes not dead but hes dyingOthers saidHes not dead or dyingThe ascetic Gotama is a perfected one for that is how the perfected ones liveThen it occurred to meWhy dont I practice completely cutting off foodBut deities came to me and saidGood sir dont practice totally cutting off foodIf you do well infuse divine nectar into your pores and you will live on thatThen it occurred to meIf I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing divine nectar in my pores that would be a lie on my partSo I dismissed those deities saying Theres no needThen it occurred to meWhy dont I just take a little bit of food each time a cup of broth made from mung beans lentils chickpeas or green gramSo thats what I diduntil my body became extremely emaciatedDue to eating so little my limbs became like the joints of an eightyyearold or a corpsemy bottom became like a camels hoofmy vertebrae stuck out like beads on a stringand my ribs were as gaunt as the brokendown rafters on an old barnDue to eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets like the gleam of water sunk deep down a wellDue to eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bittergourd in the wind and sunDue to eating so little the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my bellyDue to eating so little when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right thereDue to eating so little when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell outThen some people saw me and said The ascetic Gotama is blackSome said Hes not black hes brownSome said Hes neither black nor brown The ascetic Gotama has tawny skinThats how far the pure bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little foodThen it occurred to meWhatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionwhether in the past future or presentthis is as far as it goes noone has done more than thisBut I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe gruelling workCould there be another path to awakeningThen it occurred to meI recall sitting in the cool shade of the roseapple tree while my father the Sakyan was off working Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedCould that be the path to awakeningStemming from that memory came the realizationThat is the path to awakeningThen it occurred to meWhy am I afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualitiesThen it occurred to meIm not afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualitiesThen it occurred to meI cant achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciatedWhy dont I eat some solid food some rice and porridgeSo I ate some solid foodNow at that time the five mendicants were attending on me thinkingThe ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizesBut when I ate some solid food they left disappointed in me sayingThe ascetic Gotama has become indulgent he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceAfter eating solid food and gathering my strength quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past livesI recollected many past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThis was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the night Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsI truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingI truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen it was freed I knew it was freedI understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteThen it occurred to meThis principle I have discovered is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astuteBut people like attachment they love it and enjoy itIts hard for them to see this thing that is specific conditionality dependent originationIts also hard for them to see this thing that is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishmentAnd if I were to teach the Dhamma others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for meAnd then these verses which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to meIve struggled hard to realize thisenough with trying to explain itThis teaching is not easily understoodby those mired in greed and hateThose caught up in greed cant seewhats subtle going against the streamdeep hard to see and very finefor theyre shrouded in a mass of darknessAnd as I reflected like this my mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahmā Sahampati knowing what I was thinking thoughtOh my goodness The world will be lost the world will perish For the mind of the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha inclines to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahmā Sahampati as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of meHe arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward me and saidSir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teachingThere will be those who understand the teachingThats what Brahmā Sahampati saidThen he went on to sayAmong the Magadhans there appeared in the pastan impure teaching thought up by those still stainedFling open the door to the deathlessLet them hear the teaching the immaculate one discoveredStanding high on a rocky mountainyou can see the people all aroundIn just the same way allseer wise onehaving ascended the Temple of Truthrid of sorrow look upon the peopleswamped with sorrow oppressed by rebirth and old ageRise hero Victor in battle leader of the caravanwander the world without obligationLet the Blessed One teach the DhammaThere will be those who understandThen understanding Brahmās invitation I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha because of my compassion for sentient beingsAnd I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did notIts like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the waters surface And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to themThen I replied in verse to Brahmā SahampatiFlung open are the doors to the deathlessLet those with ears to hear decide their faithThinking it would be troublesome Brahmā I did not teachthe sophisticated sublime Dhamma among humansThen Brahmā Sahampati knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted bowed and respectfully circled me keeping me on his right before vanishing right thereThen it occurred to meWho should I teach first of allWho will quickly understand the teachingThen it occurred to meThat ḷāra Kālāma is astute competent clever and has long had little dust in his eyesWhy dont I teach him first of allHell quickly understand the teachingBut a deity came to me and saidSir ḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days agoAnd knowledge and vision arose in meḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days agoThen it occurred to meThis is a great loss for ḷāra KālāmaIf he had heard the teaching he would have understood it quicklyThen it occurred to meWho should I teach first of allWho will quickly understand the teachingThen it occurred to meThat Uddaka son of Rāma is astute competent clever and has long had little dust in his eyesWhy dont I teach him first of allHell quickly understand the teachingBut a deity came to me and saidSir Uddaka son of Rāma passed away just last nightAnd knowledge and vision arose in meUddaka son of Rāma passed away just last nightThen it occurred to meThis is a great loss for UddakaIf he had heard the teaching he would have understood it quicklyThen it occurred to meWho should I teach first of allWho will quickly understand the teachingThen it occurred to meThe group of five mendicants were very helpful to me They looked after me during my time of resolute strivingWhy dont I teach them first of allThen it occurred to meWhere are the group of five mendicants staying these daysWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Benares in the deer park at IsipatanaSo when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I wished I set out for BenaresWhile I was traveling along the road between Gaya and Bodhgaya the jīvaka ascetic Upaka saw meReverend your faculties are so very clear and your complexion is pure and brightIn whose name have you gone forth reverendWho is your TeacherWhose teaching do you believe inI replied to Upaka in verseI am the champion the knower of allunsullied in the midst of all thingsIve given up all freed in the ending of cravingSince I know for myself whose follower should I beI have no teacherThere is noone like meIn the world with its godsI have no counterpartFor in this world I am the perfected oneI am the supreme TeacherI alone am fully awakenedcooled extinguishedI am going to the city of Kāsito roll forth the Wheel of DhammaIn this world that is so blindIll beat the deathless drumAccording to what you claim reverend you ought to be the Infinite VictorThe victors are those who like mehave reached the ending of defilementsI have conquered bad qualities Upakathats why Im a victorWhen I had spoken Upaka said If you say so reverend Shaking his head he took a wrong turn and leftTraveling stage by stage I arrived at Benares and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at IsipatanaThe group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distanceand stopped each other sayingHere comes the ascetic Gotama Hes so indulgent he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceWe shouldnt bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robeBut we can set out a seat he can sit if he likesYet as I drew closer the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreedSome came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe some spread out a seat while others set out water for washing my feetBut they still addressed me by name and as reverendSo I said to themMendicants dont address me by name and as reverendThe Realized One is Perfected a fully awakened BuddhaListen up mendicants I have achieved the Deathless I shall instruct you I will teach you the DhammaBy practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBut they said to meReverend Gotama even by that conduct that practice that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones How could you have achieved such a state now that youve become indulgent strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgenceSo I said to themThe Realized One has not become indulgent strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgenceThe Realized One is Perfected a fully awakened BuddhaListen up mendicants I have achieved the Deathless I shall instruct you I will teach you the DhammaBy practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBut for a second time they said to meReverend Gotama  youve fallen into indulgenceSo for a second time I said to themThe Realized One has not become indulgent But for a third time they said to meReverend Gotama  youve fallen into indulgenceSo I said to themMendicants have you ever known me to speak like this beforeNo sirThe Realized One is Perfected a fully awakened BuddhaListen up mendicants I have achieved the Deathless I shall instruct you I will teach you the DhammaBy practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessI was able to persuade the group of five mendicantsThen sometimes I advised two mendicants while the other three went for almsThen those three would feed all six of us with what they brought backSometimes I advised three mendicants while the other two went for almsThen those two would feed all six of us with what they brought backAs the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this they soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessWhen he had spoken Prince Bodhi said to the BuddhaSir when a mendicant has the Realized One as trainer how long would it take for them to realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very lifeWell then prince Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do

embracing skillful qualities Theyre strong staunchly vigorous not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualitiesTheyre wise They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble penetrative and leads to the complete ending of sufferingThese are the five factors that support meditationWhen a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer they couldrealize the supreme end of the spiritual path in seven yearsLet alone seven yearsthey couldrealize the supreme end of the spiritual path in six yearsor as little as one yearLet alone

could be instructed in the evening and achieve distinction in the morning or be instructed in the morning and achieve distinction in the eveningWhen he said this Sañjikāputta said to Prince BodhiThough Master Bodhi speaks like thisyou dont go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaDont say that dear Sañjikāputta dont say thatI have heard and learned this in the presence of the lady my motherThis one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas MonasteryThen my pregnant mother went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir the prince or princess in my womb goes for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember them as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAnother time the Buddha was staying here in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill in the deer park at Bhesakaḷās WoodThen my nurse carrying me on her hip went to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to himSir this Prince Bodhi goes for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember him as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeNow for a third time I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesMahākaccāna and One Fine NightSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs MonasteryThen Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to batheWhen he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himselfThen late at night a glorious deity lighting up the entire hot springs went up to Samiddhi stood to one side and said to SamiddhiMendicant do you remember the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine NightNo reverend I do notI also do notBut do you remember just the verses on One Fine NightI do notI also do notLearn the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night mendicantmemorize itand remember itIt is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual lifeThats what that deity saidbefore vanishing right thereThen when the night had passed Samiddhi went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedThen he addedSir please teach me the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine nightWell then mendicant listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Samiddhi repliedThe Buddha said thisDont run back to the pastdont hope for the futureWhats past is left behindthe future has not arrivedand phenomena in the presentare clearly seen in every caseKnowing this foster itunfaltering unshakableTodays the day to keenly

Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the BuddhaThen those mendicants thoughtThis Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companionsHe is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the BuddhaLets go to him and ask him about this matterThen those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one sideThey told him what had happened and saidMay Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain thisReverends suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But hed pass over the roots and trunk imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leavesSuch is the consequence for the venerables Though you were face to face with the Buddha you passed him by imagining that you should ask me about this matterFor he is the Buddha who knows and sees He is vision he is knowledge he is the truth he is supreme He is the teacher the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the bestower of the deathless the lord of truth the Realized OneThat was the time to approach the Buddha and ask

of that brief passage for recitation given by the BuddhaIf you wish you may go to the Buddha and ask him about thisYou should remember it in line with the Buddhas answerYes reverend said those mendicants approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna saidThen they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened addingMahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner with these words and phrasesMahākaccāna is astute mendicants he has great wisdomIf you came to me and asked this question I would answer it in exactly the same way as MahākaccānaThat is what it means and thats how you should remember itThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse on the Ending of CravingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras motherAnd then Sakka lord of gods went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to himSir how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving who has reached the ultimate end the ultimate sanctuary the ultimate spiritual life the ultimate goal and is best among gods and humansLord of Gods its when a mendicant has heardNothing is worth insisting onWhen a mendicant has heard thatnothing is worth insisting onthey directly know all things Directly knowing all things they completely understand all things Having completely understood all things when they experience any kind of feelingpleasant unpleasant or neutralthey meditate observing impermanence dispassion cessation and letting go in those feelingsMeditating in this way they dont grasp at anything in the worldNot grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguishedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThats how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving who has reached the ultimate end the ultimate sanctuary the ultimate spiritual life the ultimate goal and is best among gods and humansThen Sakka lord of gods having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right thereNow at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the BuddhaHe thoughtDid that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he agreed with him or notWhy dont I find outAnd then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Eastern Monastery and reappeared among the gods of the ThirtyThreeNow at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park supplied and provided with a divine orchestraSeeing Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distancehe dismissed the orchestra approached Mahāmoggallāna and saidCome my good Moggallāna Welcome good sirIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come hereSit my good Moggallāna this seat is for youMahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread outwhile Sakka took a low seat and sat to one sideMahāmoggallāna said to himKosiya how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of cravingPlease share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear itMy good Moggallāna I have many duties and much to donot only for myself but also for the Gods of the ThirtyThreeBesides I quickly forget even things Ive properly heard learned attended and memorizedOnce upon a time a battle was fought between the gods and the demonsIn that battle the gods won and the demons lostWhen I returned from that battle as a conqueror I created the Palace of VictoryThe Palace of Victory has a hundred towersEach tower has seven hundred chambersEach chamber has seven nymphsEach nymph has seven maidsWould you like to see the lovely Palace of VictoryMahāmoggallāna consented in silenceThen putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front Sakka lord of gods and Vessavaṇa the Great King went to the Palace of VictoryWhen they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance Sakkas maidsbeing prudent and discreet each went to her own bedroomThey were just like a daughterinlaw who is prudent and discreet when they see their fatherinlawThen Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace sayingSee in the palace my good Moggallāna this lovely thingAnd that lovely thingThat looks nice for Venerable Kosiya just like for someone who has made merit in the pastHumans when they see something lovely also sayIt looks nice enough for the Gods of the ThirtyThreeThat looks nice for Venerable Kosiya just like for someone who has made merit in the pastThen Moggallāna thoughtThis spirit lives much too negligentlyWhy dont I stir up a sense of urgency in himThen Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toeThen Sakka Vessavaṇa and the Gods of the ThirtyThree their minds full of wonder and amazement thoughtIts incredible its amazingThe ascetic has such power and might that he makes the gods home shake and rock and tremble with his big toeKnowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck Moggallāna said to himKosiya how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of cravingPlease share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear itMy dear Moggallāna I approached the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to himSir how do you briefly

from among the Gods of the ThirtyThree and reappeared in the Eastern MonasterySoon after Moggallāna left Sakkas maids said to himGood sir was that the Blessed One your TeacherNo it was notThat was my spiritual companion Venerable MahāmoggallānaYoure fortunate good sir so very fortunateto have a spiritual companion of such power and mightWe cant believe thats not the Blessed One your TeacherThen Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir do you recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to a certain wellknown and illustrious spiritI

sense fieldsListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisThe six interior sense fields should be understood The six exterior sense fields should be understood The six classes of consciousness should be understood The six classes of contact should be understood The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood The thirtysix positions of sentient beings should be understood Therein relying on this give up that The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group Of all meditation teachers it is he that is called the supreme guide for those who wish to trainThis is the recitation passage for the analysis of the six sense fieldsThe six interior sense fields should be understoodThats what I said but why did I say itThere are the sense fields of the eye ear nose tongue body and mindThe six interior sense fields should be understoodThats what I said and this is why I said itThe six exterior sense fields should be understoodThats what I said but why did I say itThere are the sense fields of sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughtsThe six exterior sense fields should be understoodThats what I said and this is why I said itThe six classes of consciousness should be understoodThats what I said but why did I say itThere are eye ear nose tongue body and mind consciousnessThe six classes of consciousness should be understoodThats what I said and this is why I said itThe six classes of contact should be understoodThats what I said but why did I say itThere is contact through the eye ear nose tongue body and mindThe six classes of contact should be understoodThats what I said and this is why I said itThe eighteen mental preoccupations should be understoodThats what I said but why did I say itSeeing a sight with the eye one is preoccupied with a sight thats a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimityHearing a sound with the ear Smelling an odor with the nose Tasting a flavor with the tongue Feeling a touch with the body Becoming conscious of a thought with the mind one is preoccupied with a thought thats a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimitySo there are six preoccupations with happiness six preoccupations with sadness and six preoccupations with equanimity The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understoodThats what I said and this is why I said itThe thirtysix positions of sentient beings should be understoodThats what I said but why did I say itThere are six kinds of lay happiness and six kinds of renunciate happiness There are six kinds of lay sadness and six kinds of renunciate sadness There are six kinds of lay equanimity and six kinds of renunciate equanimityAnd in this context what are the six kinds of lay happinessThere are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasing connected with the worlds material delights Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such sights or when you recollect sights you formerly obtained that have passed ceased and perishedSuch happiness is called lay happinessThere are sounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body Thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasing connected with the worlds material delights Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such thoughts or when you recollect thoughts you formerly obtained that have passed ceased and perishedSuch happiness is called lay happinessThese are the six kinds of lay happinessAnd in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate happinessWhen youve understood the impermanence of sightstheir perishing fading away and cessationhappiness arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent suffering and perishableSuch happiness is called renunciate happinessWhen youve understood the impermanence of sounds thoughtstheir perishing fading away and cessationhappiness arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those thoughts are impermanent suffering and perishableSuch happiness is called renunciate happinessThese are the six kinds of renunciate happinessAnd in this context what are the six kinds of lay sadnessThere are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasing connected with the worlds material delights Sadness arises when you regard it as a loss to lose such sights or when you recollect sights you formerly lost that have passed ceased and perishedThere are sounds known by the ear There are smells known by the nose There are tastes known by the tongue There are touches known by the body There are thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasing connected with the worlds material delights Sadness arises when you regard it as a loss to lose such thoughts or when you recollect thoughts you formerly lost that have passed ceased and perishedSuch sadness is called lay sadnessThese are the six kinds of lay sadnessAnd in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate sadnessWhen youve understood the impermanence of sightstheir perishing fading away and cessationyou truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent suffering and perishable Upon seeing this you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberationsOh when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today When you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations like this sadness arises because of the yearningSuch sadness is called renunciate sadnessWhen youve understood the impermanence of sounds thoughtstheir perishing fading away and cessationyou truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those thoughts are impermanent suffering and perishable Upon seeing this you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberationsOh when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today When you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations like this sadness arises because of the yearningSuch sadness is called renunciate sadnessThese are the six kinds of renunciate sadnessAnd in this context what are the six kinds of lay equanimityWhen seeing a sight with the eye equanimity arises for the uneducated ordinary persona foolish ordinary person who has not overcome their limitations and the results of deeds and is blind to the drawbacksSuch equanimity does not transcend the sightThats why its called lay equanimityWhen hearing a sound with the ear When smelling an odor with the nose When tasting a flavor with the tongue When feeling a touch with the body When knowing a thought with the mind equanimity arises for the uneducated ordinary persona foolish ordinary person who has not overcome their limitations and the results of deeds and is blind to the drawbacksSuch equanimity does not transcend the thoughtThats why its called lay equanimityThese are the six kinds of lay equanimityAnd in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate equanimityWhen youve understood the impermanence of sightstheir perishing fading away and cessationequanimity arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent suffering and perishableSuch equanimity transcends the sightThats why its called renunciate equanimityWhen youve understood the impermanence of sounds thoughtstheir perishing fading away and cessationequanimity arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those thoughts are impermanent suffering and perishableSuch equanimity transcends the thoughtThats why its called renunciate equanimityThese are the six kinds of renunciate equanimityThe thirtysix positions of sentient beings should be understoodThats what I said and this is why I said itTherein relying on this give up thatThats what I said but why did I say itTherein by relying and depending on the six kinds of renunciate happiness give up and go beyond the six kinds of lay happinessThats how they are given upTherein by relying on the six kinds of renunciate sadness give up the six kinds of lay sadnessThats how they are given upTherein by relying on the six kinds of renunciate equanimity give up the six kinds of lay equanimityThats how they are given upTherein by relying on the six kinds of renunciate happiness give up the six kinds of renunciate sadnessThats how they are given upTherein by relying on the six kinds of renunciate equanimity give up the six kinds of renunciate happinessThats how they are given upThere is equanimity that is diversified based on diversity and equanimity that is unified based on unityAnd what is equanimity based on diversityThere is equanimity towards sights sounds smells tastes and touchesThis is equanimity based on diversityAnd what is equanimity based on unityThere is equanimity based on the dimensions of infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness and neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is equanimity based on unityTherein relying on equanimity based on unity give up equanimity based on diversityThats how it is given upRelying on nonidentification give up equanimity based on unityThats how it is given upTherein relying on this give up thatThats what I said and this is why I said itThe Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a groupThats what I saidbut why did I say itThe first case is when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassionThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessBut their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the Teachers instructionIn this case the Realized One is not displeased he does not feel displeasure He remains unaffected mindful and awareThis is the first case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulnessThe next case is when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassionThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessAnd some of their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the Teachers instructionBut some of their disciples do want to listen They pay attention and apply their minds to understand They dont proceed having turned away from the Teachers instructionIn this case the Realized One is not displeasednor is he pleasedRejecting both displeasure and pleasure he remains equanimous mindful and awareThis is the second case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulnessThe next case is when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassionThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessAnd their disciples want to listen They pay attention and apply their minds to understand They dont proceed having turned away from the Teachers instructionIn this case the Realized One is not pleased he does not feel pleasure He remains unaffected mindful and awareThis is the third case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulnessThe Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to

Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Isigili MountainThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants do you see that Mount VebhāraYes

the Sakyans near the Sakyan town named MedeḷumpaNow at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Townsville on some businessThen he addressed Dīgha KārāyanaMy good Kārāyana harness the finest chariots We will go to a park and see the sceneryYes Your Majesty replied Dīgha Kārāyana He harnessed the chariots and informed the kingSire the finest chariots are harnessedPlease go at your convenienceThen King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out in full royal pomp from Townsvilleheading for the park groundsHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and entered the park on footAs he was going for a walk in the park he saw roots of trees that were impressive and inspiring quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreatThe sight reminded him right away of the BuddhaThese roots of trees so impressive and inspiring are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHe addressed Dīgha KārāyanaThese roots of trees so impressive and inspiring are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaMy good Kārāyana where is that Buddha at presentGreat king there is a Sakyan town named MedaḷumpaThats where the Buddha is now stayingBut how far away is that townNot far great kingits three leaguesWe can get there while its still lightWell then harness the chariots and we shall go to see the BuddhaYes Your Majesty replied Dīgha Kārāyana He harnessed the chariots and informed the kingSire the finest chariots are harnessedPlease go at your convenienceThen King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out from Townsville to MedaḷumpaHe reached the town while it was still lightand headed for the park groundsHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and entered the monastery on footAt that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open airKing Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and saidSirs where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I want to see himGreat king thats his dwelling with the door closedApproach it quietly without hurrying go onto the porch clear your throat and knock with the latchThe Buddha will open the doorThe king right away presented his sword and turban to Dīgha Kārāyanawho thoughtNow the king seeks privacy I should wait hereThen the king approached the Buddhas dwelling and knocked and the Buddha opened the doorKing Pasenadi entered the dwelling and bowed with his head to the Buddhas feet caressing them and covering them with kisses and pronounced his nameSir I am Pasenadi king of KosalaI am Pasenadi king of KosalaBut great king for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body conveying your manifest loveSir I infer about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellIt happens sir that I see some ascetics and brahmins leading the spiritual life only for a limited period ten twenty thirty or forty yearsSome time laternicely bathed and anointed with hair and beard dressedthey amuse themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulationBut here I see the mendicants leading the spiritual life entirely full and pure as long as they live to their last breathI dont see any other spiritual life elsewhere so full and pureThats why I infer this about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore kings fight with kings aristocrats fight with aristocrats brahmins fight with brahmins householders fight with householders A mother fights with her child child with mother father with child and child with father Brother fights with brother brother with sister sister with brother and friend fights with friendBut here I see the mendicants living in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyesI dont see any other assembly elsewhere so harmoniousSo I infer this about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore I have walked and wandered from monastery to monastery and from park to parkThere Ive seen some ascetics and brahmins who are thin haggard pale and veinyhardly a captivating sight youd thinkIt occurred to meClearly these venerables lead the spiritual life dissatisfied or theyre hiding some bad deed theyve doneThats why theyre thin haggard pale and veinyhardly a captivating sight youd thinkI went up to them and saidVenerables why are you so thin haggard pale and veinyhardly a captivating sight youd thinkWe have jaundice great kingBut here I see mendicants always smiling and joyful obviously happy with cheerful faces living relaxed unruffled surviving on charity their hearts free as a wild deerIt occurred to meClearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddhas instructions than they had beforeThats why these venerables are always smiling and joyful obviously happy with cheerful faces living relaxed unruffled surviving on charity their hearts free as a wild deerSo I infer this about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore as an anointed aristocratic kingI am able to execute fine or banish those who are guiltyYet when Im sitting in judgment they interrupt meAnd I cant get themto stop interrupting me and wait until Ive finished speakingBut here Ive seen the mendicantswhile the Buddha is teaching an assembly of many hundreds and there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throatsOnce it so happened that the Buddha was teaching an assembly of many hundredsThen one of his disciples cleared their throatAnd one of their spiritual companions nudged them with their knee to indicateHush venerable dont make a sound Our teacher the Blessed One is teachingIt occurred to meIts incredible its amazinghow an assembly can be so well trained without rod or swordI dont see any other assembly elsewhere so well trainedSo I infer this about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore Ive seen some clever aristocrats who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplittersYoud think they live to demolish convictions with their intellectThey hearSo gentlemen that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or townThey formulate a question thinkingWell approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this questionIf he answers like this well refute him like thatand if he answers like that well refute him like thisWhen they hear thathe has come downthey approach himThe Buddha educates encourages fires up and inspires them with a Dhamma talkThey dont even get around to asking their question to the Buddha so how could they refute his answerInvariably they become his disciplesSo I infer this about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore I see some clever brahmins some clever householders some clever ascetics who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplittersThey dont even get around to asking their question to the Buddha so how could they refute his answerInvariably they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forthAnd he gives them the goingforthSoon after going forth living withdrawn diligent keen and resolute they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessWe were almost lost We almost perishedFor we used to claim that we were ascetics brahmins and perfected ones but we were none of these thingsBut now we really are ascetics brahmins and perfected onesSo I infer this about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore these chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages I give them a livelihood and bring them renownAnd yet they dont show me the same level of devotion that they show to the BuddhaOnce it so happened that while I was leading a military campaign and testing Isidatta and Purāṇa I took up residence in a cramped houseThey spent most of the night discussing the teaching then they lay down with their heads towards where the Buddha was and their feet towards meIt occurred to meIts incredible its amazingThese chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages I give them a livelihood and bring them renownAnd yet they dont show me the same level of devotion that they show to the BuddhaClearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddhas instructions than they had beforeSo I infer this about the Buddha from the teachingThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore the Buddha is an aristocrat and so am IThe Buddha is Kosalan and so am IThe Buddha is eighty years old and so am ISince this is soits proper for me to show the Buddha such utmost devotion and demonstrate such friendshipWell now sir I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease great king go at your convenienceThen King Pasenadi got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingSoon after the king had left the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicants before he got up and left King Pasenadi spoke shrines to the teachingLearn these shrines to the teachingMemorize these shrines to the teachingRemember these shrines to the teachingThese shrines to the teaching are beneficial and relate to the fundamentals of the spiritual lifeThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Simile of the SawSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time Venerable Phagguna of the TopKnot was mixing too closely together with the nunsSo much so thatif any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence Phagguna of the TopKnot got angry and upset and even instigated disciplinary proceedingsAnd if any mendicant criticized Phagguna of the TopKnot in their presence those nuns got angry and upset and even instigated disciplinary proceedingsThats how much Phagguna of the TopKnot was mixing too closely together with the nunsThen a mendicant went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what was going onSo the Buddha addressed a certain monkPlease monk in my name tell the mendicant Phagguna of the TopKnot thatthe teacher summons himYes sir that monk replied He went to Phagguna of the TopKnot and said to himReverend Phagguna the teacher summons youYes reverend Phagguna repliedHe went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to himIs it really true Phagguna that youve been mixing overly closely together with the nunsSo much so thatif any mendicant criticizes those nuns in your presence you get angry and upset and even instigate disciplinary proceedingsAnd if any mendicant criticizes you in those nuns presence they get angry and upset and even instigate disciplinary proceedingsIs that how much youre mixing overly closely together with the nunsYes sirPhagguna are you not a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessnessYes sirAs such its not appropriate for you to mix so closely with the nunsSo if anyone criticizes those nuns in your presence you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay lifeIf that happens you should train like thisMy mind will be unaffected I will blurt out no bad words I will remain full of compassion with a heart of love and no secret hateThats how you should trainSo even if someone strikes those nuns with fists stones rods and swords in your presence you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay lifeIf that happens you should train like thisMy mind will be unaffected I will blurt out no bad words I will remain full of compassion with a heart of love and no secret hateThats how you should trainSo if anyone criticizes you in your presence you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay lifeIf that happens you should train like this My mind will be unaffected I will blurt out no bad words I will remain full of compassion with a heart of love and no secret hateThats how you should trainSo Phagguṇa even if someone strikes you with fists stones rods and swords you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay lifeIf that happens you should train like this My mind will be unaffected I will blurt out no bad words I will remain full of compassion with a heart of love and no secret hateThats how you should trainThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants I used to be satisfied with the mendicantsOnce I addressed themI eat my food in one sitting per dayDoing so I find that Im healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyYou too should eat your food in one sitting per dayDoing so youll find that youre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyI didnt have to keep on instructing those mendicantsI just had to prompt their mindfulnessSuppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads with a goad readyThen a deft horse trainer a master charioteer might mount the chariot taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left Hed drive out and back wherever he wishes whenever he wishesIn the same way I didnt have to keep on instructing those mendicantsI just had to prompt their mindfulnessSo mendicants you too should give up whats unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualitiesIn this way youll achieve growth improvement and maturity in this teaching and trainingSuppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal treesthat was choked with castoroil weedsThen along comes a person who wants to help protect and nurture that groveTheyd cut down the crooked sal saplings that were robbing the sap and throw them out Theyd clean up the interior of the groveand properly care for the straight wellformed sal saplingsIn this way in due course that sal grove would grow increase and matureIn the same way mendicants you too should give up whats unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualitiesIn this way youll achieve growth improvement and maturity in this teaching and trainingOnce upon a time mendicants right here in Sāvatthī there was a housewife named VedehikāShe had this good reputationThe housewife Vedehikā is sweet eventempered and calmNow Vedehikā had a bonded maid named Kāḷī who was skilled tireless and wellorganized in her workThen Kāḷī thoughtMy mistress has a good reputation as beingsweet eventempered and calmBut does she actually have anger in her and just not show it Or does she have no angerOr is it just because my work is wellorganized that she doesnt show anger even though she still has it insideWhy dont I test my mistressSo Kāḷī got up during the dayVedehikā said to herWhat the hell KāḷīWhat is it madamYoure getting up in the daywhats up with you girlNothing madamNothings up you bad girl but you get up in the day Angry and upset she scowledThen Kāḷī thoughtMy mistress actually has anger in her and just doesnt show it its not that she has no angerIts just because my work is wellorganized that she doesnt show anger even though she still has it insideWhy dont I test my mistress furtherSo Kāḷī got up later in the dayVedehikā said to herWhat the hell KāḷīWhat is it madamYoure getting up later in the daywhats up with you girlNothing madamNothings up you bad girl but you get up later in the day Angry and upset she blurted out angry wordsThen Kāḷī thoughtMy mistress actually has anger in her and just doesnt show it its not that she has no angerIts just because my work is wellorganized that she doesnt show anger even though she still has it insideWhy dont I test my mistress furtherSo Kāḷī got up even later in the dayVedehikā said to herWhat the hell KāḷīWhat is it madamYoure getting up even later in the daywhats up with you girlNothing madamNothings up you bad girl but you get up even later in the day Angry and upset she grabbed a rollingpin and hit Kāḷī on the head cracking it openThen Kāḷī with blood pouring from her cracked skull denounced her mistress to the neighborsSee ladies what the sweet one didSee what the eventempered one did See what the calm one didHow on earth can she grab a rollingpin and hit her only maid on the head cracking it open just for getting up lateThen after some time the housewife Vedehikā got this bad reputationThe housewife Vedehikā is fierce illtempered and not calm at allIn the same way a mendicant may be the sweetest of the sweet the most eventempered of the eventempered the calmest of the calm so long as they dont encounter any disagreeable criticismBut its when they encounter disagreeable criticism that youll know whether theyre really sweet eventempered and calmI dont say that a mendicant is easy to admonish if they make themselves easy to admonish only for the sake of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickWhy is thatBecause when they dont get robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick theyre no longer easy to admonishBut when a mendicant is easy to admonish purely because they honor respect revere worship and venerate the teaching then I say that theyre easy to admonishSo mendicants you should train yourselves We will be easy to admonish purely because we honor respect revere worship and venerate the teachingThats how you should trainMendicants there are these five ways in which others might criticize youTheir speech may be timely or untimelytrue or falsegentle or harshbeneficial or harmfulfrom a heart of love or from secret hateWhen others criticize you they may do so in any of these waysIf that happens you should train like thisOur minds will remain unaffected We will blurt out no bad words We will remain full of compassion with a heart of love and no secret hateWe will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person And with them as a basis we will meditate spreading a heart full of love to everyone in the worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willThats how you should trainSuppose a person was to come along carrying a spade and basketI shall make this great earth be without earthAnd theyd dig all over scatter all over spit all over and urinate all over sayingBe without earth Be without earthWhat do you think mendicantsCould that person make this great earth be without earthWhy is thatBecause this great earth is deep and limitlessIts not easy to make it be without earthThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are these five ways in which others might criticize youTheir speech may be timely or untimelytrue or falsegentle or harshbeneficial or harmfulfrom a heart of love or from secret hateWhen others criticize you they may do so in any of these waysIf that happens you should train like thisOur minds will remain unaffected We will blurt out no bad words We will remain full of compassion with a heart of love and no secret hateWe will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person And with them as a basis we will meditate spreading a heart like the earth to everyone in the worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willThats how you should trainSuppose a person was to come along with dye such as red lac turmeric indigo or rose madderI shall draw pictures on the sky making pictures appear thereWhat do you think mendicantsCould that person draw pictures on the skyWhy is thatBecause the sky is formless and invisibleIts not easy to draw pictures thereThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are these five ways in which others might criticize you Suppose a person was to come along carrying a blazing grass torchI shall burn and scorch the river Ganges with this blazing grass torchWhat do you think mendicantsCould that person burn and scorch the river Ganges with a blazing grass torchWhy is thatBecause the river Ganges is deep and limitlessIts not easy to burn and scorch it with a blazing grass torchThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are these five ways in which others might criticize you Suppose there was a catskin bag that was rubbed wellrubbed very wellrubbed soft silky rid of rustling and cracklingThen a person comes along carrying a stick or a stoneI shall make this soft catskin bag rustle and crackle with this stick or stoneWhat do you think mendicantsCould that person make that soft catskin bag rustle and crackle with that stick or stoneWhy is thatBecause that catskin bag is rubbed wellrubbed very wellrubbed soft

simile of the sawThis will be for your lasting welfare and happinessThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Cātumā in a myrobalan groveNow at that time around five hundred mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Cātumā to see the BuddhaAnd the visiting mendicants while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants preparing their lodgings and putting away their bowls and robes made a dreadful racketThen the Buddha said to Venerable nandananda whos making that dreadful racket Youd think it was fishermen hauling in a catchAnd nanda told him what had happenedWell then nanda in my name tell those mendicants thatthe teacher summons themYes sir nanda replied He went to those mendicants and saidVenerables the teacher summons youYes reverend replied those mendicantsThen they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to themMendicants whats with that dreadful racket Youd think it was fishermen hauling in a catchAnd they told him what had happenedGo away mendicants I dismiss you You are not to stay in my presenceYes sir replied those mendicants They got up from their seats bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right They set their lodgings in order and left taking their bowls and robesNow at that time the Sakyans of Cātumā were sitting together at the meeting hall on some businessSeeing those mendicants coming off in the distancethey went up to them and saidHello venerables where are you goingSirs the mendicant Saṅgha has been dismissed by the BuddhaWell then venerables sit here for a minute Hopefully well be able to restore the Buddhas confidenceYes sirs replied the mendicantsThen the Sakyans of Cātumā went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himMay the Buddha approve of the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha welcome the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the pastThere are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and trainingIf they dont get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apartIf young seedlings dont get water they may change and fall apartIn the same way there are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training If they dont get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apartIf a young calf doesnt see its mother it may change and fall apartIn the same way there are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training If they dont get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apartMay the Buddha approve of the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha welcome the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the pastThen Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the BuddhaHe arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidMay the Buddha approve of the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha welcome the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the pastThere are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training If they dont get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apartIf young seedlings dont get water they may change and fall apart If a young calf doesnt see its mother it may change and fall apartIn the same way there are mendicants here who are junior recently gone forth newly come to this teaching and training If they dont get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apartMay the Buddha approve of the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha welcome the mendicant SaṅghaMay the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the pastThe Sakyans of Cātumā and Brahmā Sahampati were able to restore the Buddhas confidence with the similes of the seedlings and the calfThen Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicantsGet up reverends and pick up your bowls and robesThe Buddhas confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Cātumā and Brahmā Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the calfYes reverend replied those mendicantsThen they rose from their seats and taking their bowls and robes went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to Venerable SāriputtaSāriputta what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by meSir I thought thisThe Buddha has dismissed the mendicant SaṅghaNow he will remain passive dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life and so will weHold on Sāriputta hold on Dont you ever think such a thing againThen the Buddha addressed Venerable MahāmoggallānaMoggallāna what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by meSir I thought thisThe Buddha has dismissed the mendicant SaṅghaNow he will remain passive dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life Meanwhile Venerable Sāriputta and I will lead the mendicant SaṅghaGood good MoggallānaFor either I should lead the mendicant Saṅgha or else Sāriputta and MoggallānaThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants when you go into the water you should anticipate four dangersWhat fourThe dangers of waves crocodiles whirlpools and sharksThese are the four dangers that anyone who enters the water should anticipateIn the same way a gentleman who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate four dangersWhat fourThe dangers of waves crocodiles whirlpools and sharksAnd what mendicants is the danger of wavesIts when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinkingIm swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in sufferingHopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of sufferingWhen theyve gone forth their spiritual companions advise and instruct themYou should go out like this and come back like that You should look to the front like this and to the side like that You should contract your limbs like this and extend them like that This is how you should bear your outer robe bowl and robesThey thinkFormerly as laypeople we advised and instructed othersAnd now these mendicantswho youd think were our children or grandchildrenimagine they can advise and instruct usThey resign the training and return to a lesser lifeThis is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because theyre afraid of the danger of wavesDanger of waves is a term for anger and distressAnd what mendicants is the danger of crocodilesIts when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinkingIm swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in sufferingHopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of sufferingWhen theyve gone forth their spiritual companions advise and instruct themYou may eat consume taste and drink these things but not those You may eat whats allowable but not whats unallowable You may eat at the right time but not at the wrong timeThey thinkFormerly as laypeople we used to eat consume taste and drink what we wanted not what we didnt wantWe ate and drank both allowable and unallowable things at the right time and the wrong timeAnd these faithful householders give us a variety of delicious foods at the wrong time of day But these mendicants imagine they can gag our mouthsThey resign the training and return to a lesser lifeThis is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because theyre afraid of the danger of crocodilesDanger of crocodiles is a term for gluttonyAnd what mendicants is the danger of whirlpoolsIts when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinkingIm swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in sufferingHopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of sufferingWhen theyve gone forth they robe up in the morning and taking their bowl and robe enter a village or town for alms without guarding body speech and mind without establishing mindfulness and without restraining the sense facultiesThere they see a householder or their child amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulationThey thinkFormerly as laypeople we amused ourselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulationAnd its true that my family is wealthyI can both enjoy my wealth and make meritThey resign the training and return to a lesser lifeThis is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because theyre afraid of the danger of whirlpoolsDanger of whirlpools is a term for the five kinds

scantily clad with revealing clothesLust infects their mindso they resign the training and return to a lesser lifeThis is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because theyre afraid of the danger of sharksDanger of sharks is a term for femalesThese are the four dangers that a gentleman who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipateThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Analysis of DeedsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundNow at that time Venerable Samiddhi was staying in a wilderness hutThen as the wanderer Potaliputta was going for a walk he came up to Venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to himReverend Samiddhi I have heard and learned this in the presence of the ascetic GotamaDeeds by way of body and speech are done in vain Only mental deeds are realAnd There is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at allDont say that Reverend Potaliputta dont say that Dont misrepresent the Buddha for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not goodAnd the Buddha would not say thisBut reverend there is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at allReverend Samiddhi how long has it been since you went forthNot long reverend three yearsWell now what are we to say to the senior mendicants when even such a junior mendicant imagines their Teacher needs defendingAfter doing an intentional deed by way of body speech or mind reverend what does one feelAfter doing an intentional deed by way of body speech or mind reverend one feels sufferingThen neither approving nor dismissing Samiddhis statement Potaliputtagot up from his seat and leftSoon after he had left Venerable Samiddhi went to Venerable nanda and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideand informed nanda of all they had discussedWhen he had spoken nanda said to himReverend Samiddhi we should see the Buddha about this matterCome lets go to the Buddha and inform him about thisAs he answers so well remember itYes reverend Samiddhi repliedThen nanda and Samiddhi went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one sideand told him what had happenedWhen they had spoken the Buddha said to nandaI dont recall even seeing the wanderer Potaliputta nanda so how could we have had such a discussionThe wanderer Potaliputtas question should have been answered after analyzing it but this foolish person answered definitivelyWhen he said this Venerable Udāyī said to himBut perhaps sir Venerable Samiddhi spoke in reference to the statementSuffering includes whatever is feltBut the Buddha said to Venerable nandaSee how this foolish person Udāyī comes up with an ideaI knew thathe was going to come up with such an irrational ideaRight from the start Potaliputta asked about the three feelingsSuppose the foolish person Samiddhi had answered the wanderer Potaliputtas question like thisAfter doing an intentional deed to be experienced as pleasant by way of body speech or mind one feels pleasureAfter doing an intentional deed to be experienced as painful by way of body speech or mind one feels painAfter doing an intentional deed to be experienced as neutral by way of body speech or mind one feels neutralAnswering in this way Samiddhi would have rightly answered PotaliputtaStill who are those foolish and incompetent wanderers who follow other paths to understand the Realized Ones great analysis of deedsnanda if only you would all listen to the Realized Ones explanation of the great analysis of deedsNow is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy OneLet the Buddha explain the great analysis of deedsThe mendicants will listen and remember itWell then nanda listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir nanda repliedThe Buddha said thisnanda these four people are found in the worldWhat fourSome person here kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious and have wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellBut some other person here kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious and have wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmBut some other person here refrains from killing living creatures stealing committing

heavenly realmBut some other person here refrains from killing living creatures stealing committing sexual misconduct or using speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre contented kindhearted and have right viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellNow some ascetic or brahminby dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focusexperiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that it gives rise to clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman With that clairvoyance they see that personhere who killed living creatures stole and committed sexual misconduct who used speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and who was covetous malicious and had wrong view And they see that when their body breaks up after death that person is reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellIt seems that there is such a thing as bad deeds and the result of bad conductFor I saw a person here who killed living creatures  and had wrong view And when their body broke up after death they were reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellIt seems that everyone who kills living creatures  and has wrong view is reborn in hellThose who know this are right Those who know something else are wrongAnd so they obstinately stick to what they have known seen and understood for

time several very wellknown welltodo brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala They includedthe brahmins Caṅkī Tārukkha Pokkharasāti Jāṇussoṇi Todeyya and othersThen as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discussion the question ofhow one is a brahminBhāradvāja said thisWhen youre well born on both your mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generationthen youre a brahminVāseṭṭha said thisWhen youre ethical and accomplished in doing your dutiesthen youre a brahminBut neither was able to persuade the otherSo Vāseṭṭha said to BhāradvājaMaster Bhāradvāja the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis staying in a forest near IcchānaṅgalaHe has this good

overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysWe go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesThe HoneyCakeSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree MonasteryThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kapilavatthu for almsHe wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Great Woodplunged deep into it and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the days meditationDaṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan while going for a walkplunged deep into the Great Wood He approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side leaning on his staff and said to the BuddhaWhat does the ascetic teach What does he explainSir my teaching is such that one does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans And it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures without doubting stripped of worry and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that stateThats what I teach and thats what I explainWhen he had spoken Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head waggled his tongue raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows and he departed leaning on his staffThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery sat down on the seat spread outand told the mendicants what had happenedWhen he had spoken one of the mendicants said to himBut sir what is the teaching such that the Buddha does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humansAnd how is it that perceptions do not underlie the Buddha the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures without indecision stripped of worry and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that stateMendicant a person is beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptionsIf they dont find anything worth approving welcoming or getting attached to in the source from which these arisejust this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire repulsion views doubt conceit the desire to be reborn and ignorance This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword the end of quarrels arguments and fights of accusations divisive speech and liesThis is where these bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left overThat is what the Buddha saidWhen he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwellingSoon after the Buddha left those mendicants consideredThe Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detailWho can explain in

ended it is in line with the teaching to answerFormerly reverends when I was still a layperson I was ignorantThen the Realized One or one of his disciples taught me the DhammaI gained faith in the Realized Oneand reflectedLiving in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide openIts not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from lay life to homelessnessAfter some time I gave up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle I shaved off hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce I had gone forth I took up the training and livelihood of the mendicants I gave up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword I was scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beingsI gave up stealing I took only whats given and expected only whats given I kept myself clean by not thievingI gave up unchastity I became celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sexI gave up lying I spoke the truth and stuck to the truth I was honest and trustworthy not tricking the world with my wordsI gave up divisive speech I didnt repeat in one place what I heard in another so as to divide people against each other Instead I reconciled those who are divided supporting unity delighting in harmony loving harmony speaking words that promote harmonyI gave up harsh speech I spoke in a way thats mellow pleasing to the ear lovely going to the heart polite likable and agreeable to the peopleI gave up talking nonsense My words were timely true and meaningful in line with the teaching and training I said things at the right time which are valuable reasonable succinct and beneficialI avoided injuring plants and seeds I ate in one part of the day abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong timeI avoided dancing singing music and seeing showsI avoided beautifying and adorning myself with garlands perfumes and makeupI avoided high and luxurious bedsI avoided receiving gold and moneyraw grainswomen and girlsmale and female bondservantsgoats and sheepchicken and pigselephants cows horses and maresand fields and landI avoided running errands and messagesbuying and sellingfalsifying weights metals or measuresbribery fraud cheating and duplicitymutilation murder abduction banditry plunder and violenceI became content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the bellyWherever I went I set out taking only these thingsLike a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burdenIn the same way I became content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the bellyWherever I went I set out taking only these thingsWhen I had this entire spectrum of noble ethics I experienced a blameless happiness inside myselfWhen I saw a sight with my eyes I didnt get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason I practiced restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraintWhen I heard a sound with my ears When I smelled an odor with my nose When I tasted a flavor with my tongue When I felt a touch with my body When I knew a thought with my mind I didnt get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of the mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason I practiced restraint protecting the faculty of the mind and achieving its restraintWhen I had this noble sense restraint I experienced an unsullied bliss inside myselfI acted with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silentWhen I had this noble spectrum of ethics this noble sense restraint and this noble mindfulness and situational awarenessI frequented a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawAfter the meal I returned from almsround sat down crosslegged with my body straight and established mindfulness right thereGiving up desire for the world I meditated with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desireGiving up ill will and malevolence I meditated with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill willGiving up dullness and drowsiness I meditated with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsinessGiving up restlessness and remorse I meditated without restlessness my mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorseGiving up doubt I meditated having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtI gave up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsI truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingI truly understood These are defilements This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen it was freed I knew it was freedI understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThat is how I know and see so that I have eradicated ego possessiveness and underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuliSaying Good you should applaud and cheer that mendicants statementand then say to themWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith EsukārīSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen Esukārī the brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe four kinds of servicefor a brahmin an aristocrat a merchant and a workerThis is the service they prescribe for a brahminA brahmin an aristocrat a merchant and a worker may all serve a brahminThis is the service they prescribe for an aristocratAn aristocrat a merchant and a worker may all serve an aristocratThis is the service they prescribe for a merchantA merchant or a worker may serve a merchantThis is the service they prescribe for a workerOnly a worker may serve a workerFor who else will serve a workerThese are the four kinds of service that the brahmins prescribeWhat do you say about thisBut brahmin did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of serviceNo Master GotamaIts as if they were to force a steak on a poor penniless person telling them they must eat it and then pay for itIn the same way the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of service without the consent of these ascetics and brahminsBrahmin I dont say that you should serve everyone nor do I say that you shouldnt serve anyoneI say that you shouldnt serve someone if serving them makes you worse not betterAnd I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you better not worseIf they were to ask an aristocrat thisWho should you serve Someone in whose service you get worse or someone in whose service you get betterAnswering rightly an aristocrat would saySomeone in whose service I get betterIf they were to ask a brahmin a merchant or a worker thisWho should you serve Someone in whose service you get worse or someone in whose service you get betterAnswering rightly a worker would saySomeone in whose service I get betterBrahmin I dont say that coming from an eminent family makes you a better or worse personI dont say that being very beautiful makes you a better or worse personI dont say that being very wealthy makes you a better or worse personFor some people from eminent families kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong viewThats why I dont say that coming from an eminent family makes you a better personBut some people from eminent families also refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct They refrain from using speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre not covetous or malicious and they have right viewThats why I dont say that coming from an eminent family makes you a worse personPeople who are very beautifulwho are very wealthymay also behave in the same waysThats why I dont say that any of these things makes you a better or worse personBrahmin I dont say that you should serve everyone nor do I say that you shouldnt serve anyoneAnd I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you grow in faith ethics learning generosity and wisdomI say that you shouldnt serve someone if serving them doesnt make you grow in faith ethics learning generosity and wisdomWhen he had spoken Esukārī said to himMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe four kinds of wealthfor a brahmin an aristocrat a merchant and a workerThe wealth they prescribe for a brahmin is living on almsA brahmin who scorns his own wealth living on alms fails in his duty like a guard who stealsThe wealth they prescribe for an aristocrat is the bow and quiverAn aristocrat who scorns his own wealth the bow and quiver fails in his duty like a guard who stealsThe wealth they prescribe for a merchant is farming and animal husbandryA merchant who scorns his own wealth farming and animal husbandry fails in his duty like a guard who stealsThe wealth they prescribe for a worker is the scythe and flailA worker who scorns his own wealth the scythe and flail fails in his duty like a guard who stealsThese are the four kinds of wealth that the brahmins prescribeWhat do you say about thisBut brahmin did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of wealthNo Master GotamaIts as if they were to force a steak on a poor penniless person telling them they must eat it and then pay for itIn the same way the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of wealth without the consent of these ascetics and brahminsI declare that a persons own wealth is the noble transcendent teachingBut they are reckoned by recollecting the traditional family lineage of their mother and father wherever they are incarnatedIf they incarnate in a family of aristocrats they are reckoned as an aristocratIf they incarnate in a family of brahmins they are reckoned as a brahminIf they incarnate in a family of merchants they are reckoned as a merchantIf they incarnate in a family of workers they are reckoned as a workerIts like fire which is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it burnsA fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fireA fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fireA fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fireA fire that burns dependent on cowdung is reckoned as a cowdung fireIn the same way I declare that a persons own wealth is the noble transcendent teachingBut they are reckoned by recollecting the traditional family lineage of their mother and father wherever they are incarnatedSuppose someone from a family of aristocrats goes forth from the lay life to homelessness Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One they refrain from killing living creatures stealing and sex They refrain from using speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre not covetous or malicious and they have right view They succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingSuppose someone from a family of brahmins merchants workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One  they succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingWhat do you think brahminIs only a brahmin capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this region and not an aristocrat merchant or workerNo Master GotamaAristocrats brahmins merchants and workers can all do soFor all four classes are capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this regionIn the same way suppose someone from a family of aristocratsmerchantsor workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One  they succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingWhat do you think brahminIs only a brahmin capable of taking some bathing paste of powdered shell going to the river and washing off dust and dirt and not an aristocrat merchant or workerNo Master GotamaAll four classes are capable of doing thisIn the same way suppose someone from a family of aristocratsmerchantsor workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One  they succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingWhat do you think brahminSuppose an anointed aristocratic king were to gather a hundred people born in different castes and say to themPlease gentlemen let anyone here who was born in a family of aristocrats brahmins or chieftains take a drillstick made of teak sal frankincense wood sandalwood or cherry wood light a fire and produce heatAnd let anyone here who was born in a family of outcastes hunters bambooworkers chariotmakers or wastecollectors take a drillstick made from a dogs drinking trough a pigs trough a dustbin or castoroil wood light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think brahminWould only the fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood have flames color and radiance and be usable as fireand not the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality woodNo Master GotamaThe fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood would have flames color and radiance and be usable as fireand so would the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality woodFor all fire has flames color and radiance and is usable as fireIn the same way suppose someone from a family of aristocratsmerchantsor workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One they refrain from killing living creatures stealing and sex They refrain from using speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre not covetous or malicious and they have right view They succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingWhen he had spoken Esukārī said to himExcellent Master Gotama Excellent From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesMeasuring UpSo I have heardAt one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill in the deer park at Bhesakaḷās WoodThere Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicantsReverends mendicantsReverend they repliedVenerable Mahāmoggallāna said thisSuppose a mendicant invitesother mendicants to admonish them But theyre hard to admonish having qualities that make them hard to admonish Theyre impatient and dont take instruction respectfully So their spiritual companions dont think its worth advising and instructing them and that person doesnt gain their trustAnd what are the qualities that make them hard to admonishFirstly a mendicant has wicked desires having fallen under the sway of wicked desiresThis is a quality that makes them difficult to admonishFurthermore a mendicant glorifies themselves and puts others down Theyre irritable overcome by anger Theyre irritable and hostile due to anger Theyre irritable and stubborn due to anger Theyre irritable and blurt out words bordering on anger When accused they object to the accuser When accused they rebuke the accuser When accused they retort to the accuser When accused they dodge the issue distract the discussion with irrelevant points and display annoyance hate and bitterness When accused they dont accept the consequences of their deeds They are offensive and contemptuous Theyre jealous and stingy Theyre devious and deceitful Theyre obstinate and vain Furthermore a mendicant is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let goThis too is a quality that makes them difficult to admonishThese are the qualities that make them hard to admonishSuppose a mendicant doesnt inviteother mendicants to admonish them But theyre easy to admonish having qualities that make them easy to admonish Theyre accepting and take instruction respectfully So their spiritual companions think its worth advising and instructing them and that person gains their trustAnd what are the qualities that make them easy to admonishFirstly a mendicant doesnt have wicked desires Furthermore a mendicant isnt attached to their own views not holding them tight but letting them go easilyThese are the qualities that make them easy to admonishIn such a case a mendicant should measure themselves against another like thisThis person has wicked desires having fallen under the sway of wicked desires And I dont like or approve of this personAnd if I were to fall under the sway of wicked desires others wouldnt like or approve of meA mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought I will not fall under the sway of wicked desires This person is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go And I dont like or approve of this personAnd if I were to be attached to my own views holding them tight and refusing to let go others wouldnt like or approve of meA mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought I will not be attached to my own views holding them tight but will let them go easilyIn such a case a mendicant should check themselves like thisDo I have wicked desires Have I fallen under the sway of wicked desiresSuppose that upon checking a mendicant knows thatthey have fallen under the sway of wicked desires Then they should make an effort to give up those bad unskillful qualitiesBut suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows thatthey havent fallen under the sway of wicked desires Then they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows thatthey are attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go Then they should make an effort to give up those bad unskillful qualitiesSuppose that upon checking a mendicant knows thattheyre not attached to their own views holding them tight but let them go easily Then they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualitiesSuppose that upon checking a mendicant sees that they havent given up all these bad unskillful qualities Then they should make an effort to give them all upBut suppose that upon checking a mendicant sees that they have given up all these bad unskillful qualities Then they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualitiesSuppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water If they see any dirt or blemish there theyd try to remove itBut if they dont see any dirt or blemish there theyre happy thinkingHow fortunate that Im cleanIn the same way suppose that upon checking a mendicant sees that they havent given up all these bad unskillful qualities Then they should make an effort to give them all upBut suppose that upon checking a mendicant sees that they have given up all these bad unskillful qualities Then they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualitiesThis is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse on the Lions RoarSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī in a woodland grove behind the townNow at that time Sunakkhatta the Licchavi had recently left this teaching and trainingHe was telling a crowd in VesālīThe ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesHe teaches what hes worked out by logic following a line of inquiry expressing his own perspectiveAnd his teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering the goal for which its taughtThen Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for almsHe heard what Sunakkhatta was sayingThen he wandered for alms in VesālīAfter the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedSāriputta Sunakkhatta that silly man is angryHis words are spoken out of angerThinking he criticizes the Realized One in fact he just praises himFor it is praise of the Realized One to sayHis teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering the goal for which its taughtBut theres no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teachingThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedAnd theres no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teachingThat Blessed One wields the many kinds of psychic power multiplying himself and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realmAnd theres no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teachingThat Blessed One with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman hears both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or farAnd theres no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teachingThat Blessed One understands the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with his own mindHe understands mind with greed as mind with greedand mind without greed as mind without greedHe understands mind with hate mind without hate mind with delusion mind without delusion constricted mind scattered mind expansive mind unexpansive mind mind that is supreme mind that is not supreme mind immersed in samādhi mind not immersed in samādhi freed mind as freed mindand unfreed mind as unfreed mindThe Realized One possesses ten powers of a Realized One With these he claims the bulls place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and turns the holy wheelFirstly the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossibleSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Relying on this he claims the bulls place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and turns the holy wheelFurthermore the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past future and present in terms of causes and reasonsSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Furthermore the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice leadSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Furthermore the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elementsSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Furthermore the Realized One truly understands the diverse attitudes of sentient beingsSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Furthermore the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mindSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Furthermore the Realized One truly understands corruption cleansing and emergence regarding the absorptions liberations immersions and attainmentsSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Furthermore the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives That isone two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expandingHe remembers There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives with features and detailsSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Furthermore with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad placeHe understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized OneFurthermore the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilementsSince he truly understands this this is a power of the Realized One Relying on this he claims the bulls place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and turns the holy wheelA Realized One possesses these ten powers of a Realized One With these he claims the bulls place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and turns the holy wheelWhen I know and see in this way suppose someone were to say thisThe ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in

is reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellI understand the animal realm the ghost realm humanity gods and the path and practice that leads to the world of the godsAnd I understand how someone practicing that way when their body breaks up after death is reborn in a good place a heavenly realmAnd I understand extinguishment and the path and practice that leads to extinguishmentAnd I understand how someone practicing that way realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsWhen Ive comprehended the mind of a certain person I understandThis person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up after death they will be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThen some time later I see that they have indeed been reborn in hell where they experience exclusively painful feelings sharp and severeSuppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a mans height full of glowing coals that neither flamed nor smokedThen along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat weary thirsty and parched And they have set out on a path that meets with that same pit of coalsIf a person with good eyesight saw them theyd sayThis person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very pit of coalsThen some time later they see that they have indeed fallen into that pit of coals where they experience exclusively painful feelings sharp and

feelingsSuppose there was a tree growing on rugged ground with thin foliage casting dappled shadeThen along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat weary thirsty and parched And they have set out on a path that meets with that same treeIf a person with good eyesight saw them theyd sayThis person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very treeThen some time later they see them sitting or lying under that tree where they experience many painful feelings When Ive comprehended the mind of a certain person I understandThis person  will be reborn among human beingsThen some time later I see that they have indeed been reborn among human beings where they experience many pleasant feelingsSuppose there was a tree growing on smooth ground with abundant foliage casting dense shadeThen along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat weary thirsty and parched And they have set out on a path that meets with that same treeIf a person with good eyesight saw them theyd sayThis person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very treeThen some time later they see them sitting or lying

proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very lotus pondThen some time later they would see that person after they had plunged into that lotus pond bathed and drunk When all their stress weariness and heat exhaustion had faded away they emerged and sat or lay down in that woodland thicket where they experienced exclusively pleasant feelingsIn the same way

ethics immersion and wisdom would reach enlightenment in this very life such is the consequence I sayUnless they give up that speech and thought and let go of that view they will be cast down to hellSāriputta I recall having practiced a spiritual path consisting of four factorsI used to be a selfmortifier the ultimate selfmortifier I used to live rough the ultimate roughliver I used to live in disgust at sin the ultimate one living in disgust at sin I used to be secluded in ultimate seclusionAnd this is what my selfmortification was like I went naked ignoring conventions I licked my hands and didnt come or stop when asked I didnt consent to food brought to me or food prepared specially for me or an invitation for a mealI didnt receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where food for distribution is advertised or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing I accepted no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drank no beerI went to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfulsI fed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a dayI ate once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnight I lived committed to the practice of eating food at set intervalsI ate herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung I survived on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruitI wore robes of sunn hemp mixed hemp corpsewrapping cloth rags lodh tree bark antelope hide whole or in strips kusa grass bark woodchips human hair horsetail hair or owls wingsI tore out hair and beard committed to this practiceI constantly stood refusing seatsI squatted committed to the endeavor of squattingI lay on a mat of thorns making a mat of thorns my bedI was committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the eveningAnd so I lived committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the bodySuch was my practice of selfmortificationAnd this is what my rough living was likeThe dust and dirt built up on my body over many years until it started flaking offIts like the trunk of a palemoon ebony tree which builds up bark over many years until it starts flaking offBut it didnt occur to meOh this dust and dirt must be rubbed off by my hand or anothersThat didnt occur to meSuch was my rough livingAnd this is what my living in disgust of sin was likeId step forward or back ever so mindfully I was full of pity even regarding a drop of water thinkingMay I not accidentally injure any little creatures that happen to be in the wrong placeSuch was my living in disgust of sinAnd this is what my seclusion was likeI would plunge deep into a wilderness region and stay thereWhen I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks or a lumberjack Id flee from forest to forest from thicket to thicket from valley to valley from uplands to uplandsWhy is thatSo that I wouldnt see them nor they meI fled like a wild deer seeing a human beingSuch was my practice of seclusionI would go on all fours into the cowpens after the cattle had left and eat the dung of the young suckling calvesAs long as my own urine and excrement lasted I would even eat thatSuch was my eating of most unnatural thingsI would plunge deep into an aweinspiring forest grove and stay thereIt was so aweinspiring thatnormally it would make your hair stand on end if you werent free of greedAnd on days such as the cold spell when the snow falls in the dead of winter I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by dayBut in the last month of summer Id stay in the open by day and in the forest by nightAnd then these verses which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to meScorched and frozenalone in the aweinspiring forestNaked no fire to sit besidethe sage still pursues his questI would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillowThen the cowboys would come up to me Theyd spit and piss on me throw mud on me even poke sticks in my earsBut I dont recall ever having a bad thought about themSuch was my abiding in equanimityThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewPurity comes from foodLets live on jujubesSo they eat jujubes and jujube powder and drink jujube juiceAnd they enjoy many jujube concoctionsI recall eating just a single jujubeYou might think thatat that time the jujubes must have been very bigBut you should not see it like thisThe jujubes then were at most the same size as todayEating so very little my body became extremely emaciatedDue to eating so little my limbs became like the joints of an eightyyearold or a corpsemy bottom became like a camels hoofmy vertebrae stuck out like beads on a stringand my ribs were as gaunt as the brokendown rafters on an old barnDue to eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets like the gleam of water sunk deep down a wellDue to eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bittergourd in the wind and sunDue to eating so little the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my bellyDue to eating so little when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right thereDue to eating so little when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell outThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewPurity comes from foodLets live on mung beans Lets live on sesame Lets live on ordinary rice Due to eating so little when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell outBut Sāriputta I did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by that conduct that practice that grueling workWhy is thatBecause I didnt achieve that noble wisdom thats noble and emancipating and which leads someone who practices it to the complete ending of sufferingThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewPurity comes from transmigrationBut its not easy to find a realm that I havent previously transmigrated to in all this long time except for the gods of the pure abodesFor if I had transmigrated to the gods of the pure abodes I would not have returned to this realm againThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewPurity comes from rebirthBut its not easy to find any rebirth that I havent previously been reborn in There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewPurity comes from abode of rebirthBut its not easy to find an abode where I havent previously abided There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewPurity comes from sacrificeBut its not easy to find a sacrifice that I havent previously offered in all this long time when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a welltodo brahminThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewPurity comes from serving the sacred flameBut its not easy to find a fire that I havent previously served in all this long time when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a welltodo brahminThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewSo long as this gentleman is youthful young blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life he will be endowed with perfect lucidity of wisdomBut when hes old elderly and senior advanced in years and has reached the final stage of lifeeighty ninety or a hundred years oldhe will lose his lucidity of wisdomBut you should not see it like thisFor now I am old elderly and senior Im advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life I am eighty years oldSuppose I had four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years And they each were perfect in memory range retention and perfect lucidity of wisdomImagine how easily a welltrained expert archer with a strong bow would shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm treeThats how extraordinary they were in memory range retention and perfect lucidity of wisdomTheyd bring up questions about the four kinds of mindfulness meditation again and again and I would answer each question Theyd remember the answers and not ask the same question twiceAnd theyd pause only to eat and drink go to the toilet and sleep to dispel weariness But the Realized One would not run out of Dhamma teachings words and phrases of the teachings or spontaneous answersAnd at the end of a hundred years my four disciples would pass awayEven if you have to carry me around on a stretcher there will never be any deterioration in the Realized Ones lucidity of wisdomAnd if theres anyone of whom it may be rightly said thata being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans its of me that this should be saidNow at that time Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Buddha fanning himThen he said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazingWhile I was listening to this exposition of the teaching my hair stood upWhat is the name of this exposition of the teachingWell Nāgasamāla you may remember this exposition of the teaching as The Hairraising DiscourseThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Nāgasamāla was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesCorruptionsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas MonasteryNow at that time the mendicants of Kosambi were arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed wordsThen a mendicant went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and told him what was happening addingPlease sir go to those mendicants out of compassionThe Buddha consented in silenceThen the Buddha went up to those mendicants and saidEnough mendicants Stop arguing quarreling and fightingWhen he said this one of the mendicants said to the BuddhaWait sirLet the Buddha the Lord of the Dhammaremain passive dwelling in blissful meditation in the present lifeWe will be known for this arguing quarreling and fightingFor a second time and a third time the Buddha said to those mendicantsEnough mendicants Stop arguing quarreling and fightingFor a third time that mendicant said to the BuddhaWait sirLet the Buddha the Lord of the Dhammaremain passive dwelling in blissful meditation in the present lifeWe will be known for this arguing quarreling and fightingThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kosambi for almsAfter the meal on his return from almsround he set his lodgings in order Taking his bowl and robe he recited these verses while standing right thereWhen many voices shout at oncenoone thinks that theyre a foolWhile the Saṅghas being splitnone thought another to be betterDolts pretending to be astutethey talk their words right out of boundsThey blab at will their mouths agapeand noone knows what leads them onThey abused me they hit meThey beat me they robbed meFor those who bear such a grudgehatred never endsThey abused me they hit meThey beat me they robbed meFor those who bear no such grudgehatred has an endFor never is hatredsettled by hateits only settled by lovethis is an ancient lawOthers dont understandthat here we need to be restrainedBut those who do understand thisbeing clever settle their quarrelsBreakers of bones and takers of lifethieves of cattle horses wealththose who plunder the nationeven they can come togetherso why on earth cant youIf you find an alert companiona wise and virtuous friendthen overcoming all challengeswander with them joyful and mindfulIf you find no alert companionno wise and virtuous friendthen like a king who flees his conquered realmwander alone like a tusker in the wildsIts better to wander alonetheres no fellowship with foolsWander alone and do no wrongat ease like a tusker in the wildsAfter speaking these verses while standing the Buddha went to the village of the child saltminerswhere Venerable Bhagu was staying at the timeBhagu saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceso he spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feetThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outand washed his feetBhagu bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to himI hope youre keeping well mendicant I hope youre all right And I hope youre having no trouble getting almsfoodIm keeping well sir Im all right And Im having no trouble getting almsfoodThen the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired Bhagu with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and set out for the Eastern Bamboo ParkNow at that time the venerables Anuruddha Nandiya and Kimbila were staying in the Eastern Bamboo ParkThe park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceand said to the BuddhaDont come into this park asceticThere are three gentlemen who love themselves staying hereDont disturb themAnuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddhaand said to himDont keep the Buddha out good park keeperOur Teacher the Blessed One has arrivedThen Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila and said to themCome forth venerables come forth Our Teacher the Blessed One has arrivedThen Anuruddha Nandiya and Kimbila came out to greet the BuddhaOne received his bowl and robe one spread out a seat and one set out water for washing his feetThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outand washed his feetThose venerables bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to AnuruddhaI hope youre keeping well Anuruddha and friends I hope youre all right And I hope youre having no trouble getting almsfoodWere keeping well sir were all right And were having no trouble getting almsfoodI hope youre living in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyesIndeed sir we live in harmony as you sayBut how do you live this wayIn this case sir I thinkIm fortunate so very fortunateto live together with spiritual companions such as theseI consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body speech and mind both in public and in privateWhy dont I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables ideasAnd thats what I doThough were different in body sir were one in mind it seems to meAnd the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise and they addedThats how we live in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyesGood good Anuruddha and friendsBut I hope youre living diligently keen and resoluteIndeed sir we live diligentlyBut how do you live this wayIn this case sir whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish binIf theres anything left over whoever returns last eats it if they like Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows or drop it into water that has no living creaturesThen they put away the seats drinking water and rubbish bin and sweep the refectoryIf someone sees that the pot of water for washing drinking or the toilet is empty they set it upIf he cant do it he summons another with a wave of the hand and they set it up by lifting it with their hands But we dont break into speech for that reasonAnd every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachingsThats how we live diligently keen and resoluteGood good Anuruddha and friendsBut as you live diligently like this have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at easeWell sir while meditating diligent keen and resolute we perceive both light and vision of formsBut before long the light and the vision of forms vanishWe havent worked out the reason for thatWell you should work out the reason for thatBefore my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI too perceived both light and vision of formsBut before long my light and vision of forms vanishedIt occurred to meWhats the cause whats the reason why my light and vision of forms vanishIt occurred to meDoubt arose in me and because of that my immersion fell awayWhen immersion falls away the light and vision of forms vanishIll make sure that doubt will not arise in me againWhile meditating diligent keen and resolute I perceived both light and vision of formsBut before long my light and vision of forms vanishedIt occurred to meWhats the cause whats the reason why my light and vision of forms vanishIt occurred to meLoss of focus arose in me and because of that my immersion fell awayWhen immersion falls away the light and vision of forms vanishIll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus will arise in me againWhile meditating Dullness and drowsiness arose in me Ill make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness will arise in me againWhile meditating Terror arose in me and because of that my immersion fell awayWhen immersion falls away the light and vision of forms vanishSuppose a person was traveling along a road and killers were to spring out at them from both sides Theyd feel terrified because of thatIn the same way terror arose in me Ill make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror will arise in me againWhile meditating Excitement arose in me and because of that my immersion fell awayWhen immersion falls away the light and vision of forms vanishSuppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure And all at once theyd come across five entrances Theyd feel excited because of thatIn the same way excitement arose in me Ill make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement will arise in me againWhile meditating Discomfort arose in me Ill make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort will arise in me againWhile meditating Excessive energy arose in me and because of that my immersion fell awayWhen immersion falls away the light and vision of forms vanishSuppose a person was to grip a quail too tightly in this handsit would die right thereIll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy will arise in me againWhile meditating Overly lax energy arose in me and because of that my immersion fell awayWhen immersion falls away the light and vision of forms vanishSuppose a person was to grip a quail too looselyit would fly out of their handsIll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy will arise in me againWhile meditating Longing arose in me Ill make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy nor longing will arise in me againWhile meditating Perceptions of diversity arose in me Ill make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy nor longing nor perception of diversity will arise in me againWhile meditating diligent keen and resolute I perceived both light and vision of formsBut before long my light and vision of forms vanishedIt occurred to meWhats the cause whats the reason why my light and vision of forms vanishIt occurred to meExcessive concentration on forms arose in me and because of that my immersion fell awayWhen immersion falls away the light and vision of forms vanishIll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy nor longing nor perception of diversity nor excessive concentration on forms will arise in me againWhen I understood that doubt is a corruption of the mind I gave it upWhen I understood that loss of focusdullness and drowsinessexcitementdiscomfortexcessive energyoverly lax energyperception of diversityand excessive concentration on forms are corruptions of the mind I gave them upWhile meditating diligent keen and resolute I perceived light but did not see formsor I saw forms but did not see lightAnd this went on for a whole night a whole day even a whole night and dayI thoughtWhat is the cause what is the reason for thisIt occurred to meWhen I dont focus on the foundation of the forms but focus on the foundation of the light then I perceive light and do not see formsBut when I dont focus on the foundation of the light but focus on the foundation of the forms then I see forms and do not perceive lightAnd this goes on for a whole night a whole day even a whole night and dayWhile meditating diligent keen and resolute I perceived limited light and saw limited formsor I perceived limitless light and saw limitless formsAnd this went on for a whole night a whole day even a whole night and dayI thoughtWhat is the cause what is the reason for thisIt occurred to meWhen my immersion is limited then my vision is limitedand with limited vision I perceive limited light and see limited formsBut when my immersion is limitless then my vision is limitlessand with limitless vision I perceive limitless light and see limitless formsAnd this goes on for a whole night a whole day even a whole night and dayWhen I understood that doubtloss of focusdullness and drowsinessexcitementdiscomfortexcessive energyoverly lax energyperception of diversityand excessive concentration on forms are corruptions of the mind I gave them upI thoughtIve given up my mental corruptionsNow let me develop immersion in three waysI developed immersion while placing the mind and keeping it connected without placing the mind but just keeping it connected without placing the mind or keeping it connected with rapture without rapture with pleasure with equanimityWhen I had developed immersion in these waysthe knowledge and vision arose in meMy freedom is unshakable this is my last rebirth now there are no more future livesThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Anuruddha was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith DīghanakhaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain in the Boars CaveThen the wanderer Dīghanakha went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama this is my doctrine and viewI believe in nothingThis view of yours Aggivessanado you believe in thatIf I believed in this view Master Gotama it wouldnt make any difference it wouldnt make any differenceWell Aggivessana there are many more in the world who sayIt wouldnt make any difference It wouldnt make any differenceBut they dont give up that view and they grasp another viewAnd there are a scant few in the world who sayIt wouldnt make any difference It wouldnt make any differenceAnd they give up that view by not grasping another viewThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewI believe in everythingThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewI believe in nothingThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewI believe in some things and not in othersRegarding this the view of the ascetics and brahmins who believe in everythingis close to greed bondage approving attachment and graspingThe view of the ascetics and brahmins who believe in nothingis far from greed bondage approving attachment and graspingWhen he said this the wanderer Dīghanakha said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama commends my conviction He recommends my convictionNow regarding the ascetics and brahmins whobelieve in some things and not in othersTheir view of what they believe in is close to greed bondage approving attachment and graspingTheir view of what they dont believe in is far from greed bondage approving attachment and graspingWhen it comes to the view of the ascetics and brahmins whobelieve in everythinga sensible person reflects like thisI have the view thatI believe in everythingSuppose I obstinately stick to this view and insist thatThis is the only truth other ideas are sillyThen Id argue with two peoplean ascetic or brahmin who believes in nothingand an ascetic or brahmin who believes in some things and not in othersAnd when theres arguing theres quarreling when theres quarreling theres anguish and when theres anguish theres harmSo considering in themselves the potential for arguing quarreling anguish and harm they

mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destruction You should see it as impermanent as suffering as diseased as an abscess as a dart as misery as an affliction as alien as falling apart as empty as notselfDoing so youll give up desire affection and subservience to the bodyThere are these three feelingspleasant painful and neutralAt a time when you feel a pleasant feeling you dont feel a painful or neutral feelingyou only feel a pleasant feelingAt a time when you feel a painful feeling you dont feel a pleasant or neutral feelingyou only feel a painful feelingAt a time when you feel a neutral feeling you dont feel a pleasant or painful feelingyou only feel a neutral feelingPleasant painful and neutral feelings are impermanent conditioned dependently originated liable to end vanish fade away and ceaseSeeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with pleasant painful and neutral feelingsBeing disillusioned desire fades awayWhen desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceA mendicant whose mind is freed like this doesnt side with anyone or fight with anyone They speak the language of the world without misapprehending itNow at that time Venerable Sāriputta was standing behind the Buddha fanning himThen he thoughtIt seems the Buddha speaks of giving up and letting go all these things through direct knowledgeReflecting like this Venerable Sāriputtas mind was freed from the defilements by not graspingAnd the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the wanderer DīghanakhaEverything that has a beginning has an endThen Dīghanakha saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions He said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesThe Mendicants of KosambiSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas MonasteryNow at that time the mendicants of Kosambi were arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed wordsThey couldnt persuade each other or be persuaded nor could they convince each other or be convincedThen a mendicant went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what was happeningSo the Buddha addressed a certain monkPlease monk in my name tell those mendicants thatthe teacher summons themYes sir that monk replied He went to those monks and saidVenerables the teacher summons youYes reverend those monks repliedThey went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to themIs it really true mendicants that you have been arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed wordsAnd that you cant persuade each other or be persuaded nor can you convince each other or be convincedYes sir they saidWhat do you think mendicantsWhen youre arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed words are you treating your spiritual companions with kindness by way of body speech and mind both in public and in privateNo sirSo it seems that when youre arguing you are not treating each other with kindnessSo what exactly do you know and see you foolish men that you behave in such a wayThis will be for your lasting harm and sufferingThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants these six warmhearted qualities make for fondness and respect conducing to inclusion harmony and unity without quarrelingFirstly a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with bodily kindness both in public and in privateThis warmhearted quality makes for fondness and respect conducing to inclusion harmony and unity without quarrelingFurthermore a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with verbal kindness Furthermore a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with mental kindness Furthermore a mendicant shares without reservation any material possessions they have gained by legitimate means even the food placed in the almsbowl using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions Furthermore a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions both in public and in private Those precepts are unbroken impeccable spotless and unmarred liberating praised by sensible people not mistaken and leading to immersion Furthermore a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions both in public and in private That view is noble and emancipating and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of sufferingThis warmhearted quality makes for fondness and respect conducing to inclusion harmony and unity without quarrelingThese six warmhearted qualities make for fondness and respect conducing to inclusion harmony and unity without quarrelingOf these six warmhearted qualities the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering It holds and binds everything togetherIts like a bungalow The roofpeak is the chief point which holds and binds everything togetherIn the same way of these six warmhearted qualities the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering It holds and binds everything togetherAnd how does the view that is noble and emancipating lead one who practices it to the complete ending of sufferingIts when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut and reflects like thisIs there anything that Im overcome with internally and havent given up because of which I might not accurately know and seeIf a mendicant is overcome with sensual desire its their mind thats overcomeIf a mendicant is overcome with ill willdullness and drowsinessrestlessness and remorsepursuing speculation about this worldpursuing speculation about the next worldor arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding others with barbed words its their mind thats overcomeThey understandThere is nothing that Im overcome with internally and havent given up because of which I might not accurately know and seeMy mind is properly disposed for awakening to the truthsThis is the first knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent and is not shared with ordinary peopleFurthermore a noble disciple reflectsWhen I develop cultivate and make much of this view do I personally gain serenity and quenchingThey understandWhen I develop cultivate and make much of this view I personally gain serenity and quenchingThis is their second knowledge Furthermore a noble disciple reflectsAre there any ascetics or brahmins outside of the Buddhist community who have the same kind of view that I haveThey understandThere are no ascetics or brahmins outside of the Buddhist community who have the same kind of view that I haveThis is their third knowledge Furthermore a noble disciple reflectsDo I have the same nature as a person accomplished in viewAnd what mendicants is the nature of a person accomplished in viewThis is the nature of a person accomplished in viewThough they may fall into a kind of offense for which rehabilitation has been laid down they quickly disclose clarify and reveal it to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companionAnd having revealed it they restrain themselves in the futureSuppose there was a little baby boy If he puts his hand or foot on a burning coal he quickly pulls it backIn the same way this is the nature of a person accomplished in viewThough they may still fall into a kind of offense for which rehabilitation has been laid down they quickly reveal it to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companionAnd having revealed it they restrain themselves in the futureThey understandI have the same nature as a person accomplished in viewThis is their fourth knowledge Furthermore a noble disciple reflectsDo I have the same nature as a person accomplished in viewAnd what mendicants is the nature of a person accomplished in viewThis is the nature of a person accomplished in viewThough they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics higher mind and higher wisdomSuppose there was a cow with a baby calf She keeps the calf close as she grazesIn the same way this is the nature of a person accomplished in viewThough they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics higher mind and higher wisdomThey understandI have the same nature as a person accomplished in viewThis is their fifth knowledge Furthermore a noble disciple reflectsDo I have the same strength as a person accomplished in viewAnd what mendicants is the strength of a person accomplished in viewThe strength of a person accomplished in view is that when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught they pay heed pay attention engage wholeheartedly and lend an earThey understandI have the same strength as a person accomplished in viewThis is their sixth knowledge Furthermore a noble disciple reflectsDo I have the same strength as a person accomplished in viewAnd what mendicants is the strength of a person accomplished in viewThe strength of a person accomplished in view is that when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teachingThey understandI have the same strength as a person accomplished in viewThis is the seventh knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent and is not shared with ordinary peopleWhen a noble disciple has these seven factors they have properly investigated their own nature with respect to the realization of the fruit of streamentryA noble disciple with these seven factors has the fruit of streamentryThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Man From the City of AṭṭhakaSo I have heardAt one time Venerable nanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of BeluvaNow at that time the householder Dasama from the city of Aṭṭhaka had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some businessHe went to the Chicken Monastery approached a certain mendicant bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir where is Venerable nanda now stayingFor I want to see himHouseholder Venerable nanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of BeluvaThen the householder Dasama having concluded his business there went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see nandaHe bowed sat down to one side and said to nandaSir nanda is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed Onewho knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddhapracticing which a diligent keen and resolute mendicants mind is freed their defilements are ended and they arrive at the supreme sanctuaryThere is householderAnd what is that one thingHouseholder its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThen they reflectEven this first absorption is produced by choices and intentionsThey understand But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessationAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilementsIf they dont attain the ending of defilements with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre reborn spontaneously because of their passion and love for that meditation They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that worldThis is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed Onewho knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddhapracticing which a diligent keen and resolute mendicants mind is freed their defilements are ended and they arrive at the supreme sanctuaryFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorption Furthermore a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willThen they reflectEven this hearts release by love is produced by choices and intentionsThey understand But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation Furthermore a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion rejoicing equanimity Furthermore householder a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite spaceThen they reflectEven this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentionsThey understand But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingnessThen they reflectEven this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentionsThey understand But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessationAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilementsIf they dont attain the ending of defilements with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre reborn spontaneously because of their passion and love for that meditation They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that worldThis too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed Onewho knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddhapracticing which a diligent keen and resolute mendicants mind is freed their defilements are ended and they arrive at the supreme sanctuaryWhen he said this the householder Dasama said to Venerable nandaSir suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure And all at once theyd come across eleven entrancesIn the same way I was searching for the door to the deathless And all at once I got to hear of eleven doors to the deathlessSuppose a person had a house with eleven doors If the house caught fire theyd be able to flee to safety through any one of those doorsIn the same way Im able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to the deathlessSir those who follow other paths seek a fee for the teacher Why shouldnt I make an offering to Venerable nandaThen the householder Dasama having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta served and satisfied them with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsHe clothed each and every mendicant in a pair of garments with a set of three robes for nanda And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for nandaMiddle DiscoursesConducive to the ImperturbableSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus near the Kuru town named KammāsadammaThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants sensual pleasures are impermanent hollow false and deceptivemade by illusion cooed over by foolsSensual pleasures in this life and in lives to comesensual perceptions in this life and in lives to comeboth of these are Māras sovereignty Māras domain and Māras territoryThey conduce to bad unskillful qualities such as desire ill will and aggressionAnd they create an obstacle for a

Māras domain and Māras territoryThey conduce to bad unskillful qualities such as desire ill will and aggressionAnd they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training hereWhy dont I meditate with an abundant expansive heart having mastered the world and stabilized the mindThen I will have no more bad unskillful qualities such as desire ill will and aggressionAnd by giving them up my mind no longer limited will become limitless and well developedPracticing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimensionBeing confident they either attain the

this Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaSir take a mendicant who practices like thisIt might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine I am giving up what exists what has come to beIn this way they gain equanimityWould that mendicant become extinguished or notOne such mendicant might become extinguished nanda while another might notWhat is the cause sir what is the reason for thisnanda take a mendicant who practices like thisIt might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine I am giving up what exists what has come to beIn this way they gain equanimityThey approve welcome and keep clinging to that equanimityTheir consciousness relies on that and grasps itA mendicant with grasping does not become extinguishedBut sir what is that mendicant graspingThe dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionSir it seems that mendicant is grasping the best thing to graspIndeed nandaFor the best thing to grasp isthe dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionTake a mendicant who practices like thisIt might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine I am giving up what exists what has come to beIn this way they gain equanimityThey dont approve welcome or keep clinging to that equanimitySo their consciousness doesnt rely on that and grasp itA mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguishedIts incredible sir its amazingThe Buddha has explained to us how to cross over the flood by relying on one support or the otherBut sir what is noble liberationAnanda its when a mendicant reflects like thisSensual pleasures in this life and in lives to comesensual perceptions in this life and in lives to comevisions in this life and in lives to comeperceptions of visions in this life and in lives to comeperceptions of the imperturbable perceptions of the dimension of nothingness perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionthat is identity as far as identity extendsThis is the deathless namely the liberation of the mind through not graspingSo nanda I have taught the ways of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable the dimension of nothingness and the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception I have taught how to cross the flood by relying on one support or the other and I have taught noble liberationOut of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciplesHere are these roots of trees and here are these empty hutsPractice absorption nanda Dont be negligent Dont regret it later This is my instruction to youThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesIs This What You Think Of MeSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Kusināra in the Forest of OfferingsThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants is this what you think of meThe ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes almsfood lodgings or rebirth in this or that stateNo sir we dont think of you that wayIf you dont think of me that waythen what exactly do you think of meWe think of you this wayThe Buddha is compassionate and wants whats best for usHe teaches out of compassionSo it seems you thinkthat I teach out of compassionIn that case each and every one of you should train in the things I have taught from my direct knowledge that isthe four kinds of mindfulness meditation the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven awakening factors and the noble eightfold path You should train in these things in harmony appreciating each other without quarrelingAs you do so it may happen that two mendicants disagree about the teachingNow you might thinkThese two venerables disagree on both the meaning and the phrasing So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to themThe venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasingBut the venerables should know that this is howsuch disagreement on the meaning and the phrasing comes to bePlease dont get into a fight about thisThen they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to themThe venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasingBut the venerables should know that this

train in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling one of the mendicants might commit an offense or transgressionIn such a case you should not be in a hurry to accuse themThe individual should be examined like thisI wont be troubled and the other individual wont be hurt for theyre not irritable and hostile They dont hold fast to their views but let them go easily I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillfulIf thats what you think then its appropriate to speak to themBut suppose you think thisI will be troubled and the other individual will be hurt for theyre irritable and hostile However they dont hold fast to their views but let them go easily I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillfulBut for the other individual to get hurt is a minor matterIts more importantthat I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillfulIf thats what you think then its appropriate to speak to themBut suppose you think thisI will be troubled but the other individual wont be hurt for theyre not irritable and hostileHowever they hold fast to their views refusing to let go Nevertheless I can

them in the skillfulDont underestimate the value of equanimity for such a personAs you train in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling mutual talebearing might come up with contempt for each others views resentful bitter and exasperatedIn this case you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable among those who side with one party and say to themReverend as we were training mutual talebearing came up If the Ascetic knew about this would he rebuke itAnswering rightly the mendicant should sayYes reverend he wouldBut without giving that up reverend can one realize extinguishmentAnswering rightly the mendicant should sayNo reverend one cannotThen they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to themReverend as we were training mutual talebearing came up If the Ascetic knew about this would he rebuke itAnswering rightly the mendicant should sayYes reverend he wouldBut without giving that up reverend can one realize extinguishmentAnswering rightly the mendicant should sayNo reverend one cannotIf others should ask that mendicantWere you the venerable who drew those mendicants away from the unskillful and established them in the skillfulAnswering rightly the mendicant should sayWell reverends I approached the Buddha He taught me the Dhamma After hearing that teaching I explained it to those mendicantsWhen those mendicants heard that teaching they were drawn away from the unskillful and established in the skillfulAnswering in this way that mendicant doesnt glorify themselves or put others down They answer in line with the teaching with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse with SakuludāyīSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundNow at that time several very wellknown wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks feeding groundThey included Annabhāra Varadhara Sakuludāyī and other very wellknown wanderersThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsThen it occurred to himIts too early to wander for alms in RājagahaWhy dont I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks feeding groundSo the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderersNow at that time Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such astalk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existenceSakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceand hushed his own assemblyBe quiet good sirs dont make a soundHere comes the ascetic GotamaThe venerable likes quiet and praises quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachThen those wanderers fell silentThen the Buddha approached Sakuludāyīwho said to himCome Blessed OneWelcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readyThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outwhile Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha said to himUdāyī what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedSir leave aside what we were sitting talking about just nowIt wont be hard for you to hear about that laterSir a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths were sitting together at the debating hall and this discussion came up among themThe people of Aṅga and Magadha are so fortunate so very fortunateFor there are these ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community and teach a community Theyre wellknown and famous religious founders regarded as holy by many people And they have come down for the rainy season residence at RājagahaThey include Pūraṇa KassapaMakkhali GosālaAjita KesakambalaPakudha KaccāyanaSañjaya

too has come down for the rains residence at RājagahaWhich of these ascetics and brahmins is honored respected revered and venerated by their disciples And how do their disciples after honoring and respecting them remain loyalSome of them saidThis Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many peopleBut hes not honored respected revered venerated and esteemed by his disciples And his disciples not honoring and respecting him dont remain loyal to himOnce it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundredsThen one of his disciples made a noiseMy good sirs dont ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about thatHe doesnt know thatI know it Ask me about itand Ill answer youIt happened that Pūraṇa Kassapa didnt

by his disciples And his disciples honoring and respecting him remain loyal to himOnce it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundredsThen one of his disciples cleared their throatAnd one of their spiritual companions nudged them with their knee to indicateHush venerable dont make sound Our teacher the Blessed One is teachingWhile the ascetic Gotama is teaching an assembly of many hundreds there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throatsThat large crowd is poised on the edge of their seats thinkingWhatever the Buddha teaches we shall listen to itIts like when theres a person at the crossroads pressing out pure manuka honeyand a large crowd is poised on the edge of their seatsIn the same way while the ascetic Gotama is teaching an assembly of many hundreds there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throatsThat large crowd is poised on the edge of their seats thinkingWhatever the Buddha teaches we shall listen to itEven when a disciple of the ascetic Gotama resigns the training and returns to a lesser life having been overly attached to their spiritual companions they speak only praise of the teacher the teaching and the Saṅgha They blame only themselves not others We were unlucky we had little merit For even after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we werent able to practice for life the perfectly full and pure spiritual lifeThey become monastery workers or lay followers and they proceed having undertaken the five preceptsThats how the ascetic Gotama is honored respected revered and venerated by his disciples And thats how his disciples honoring and respecting him remain loyal to himBut Udāyī how many qualities do you see in me because of which my disciples honor respect revere and venerate me and after honoring and respecting me they remain loyal to meSir I see five such qualities in the BuddhaWhat fiveThe Buddha eats little and praises eating littleThis is the first such quality I see in the BuddhaFurthermore the Buddha is content with any kind of robe and praises such contentmentThis is the second such quality I see in the BuddhaFurthermore the Buddha is content with any kind of almsfood and praises such contentmentThis is the third such quality I see in the BuddhaFurthermore the Buddha is content with any kind of lodging and praises such contentmentThis is the fourth such quality I see in the BuddhaFurthermore the Buddha is secluded and praises seclusionThis is the fifth such quality I see in the BuddhaThese are the five qualities I see in the Buddha because of which his disciples honor respect revere and venerate him and after honoring and respecting him they remain loyal to himSuppose Udāyī my disciples were loyal to me because I eat little Well there are disciples of mine who eat a cupful of food or half a cupful they eat a wood apple or half a wood appleBut sometimes I even eat this bowl full to the brim or even moreSo if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I eat little then those disciples who eat even less would not be loyal to meSuppose my disciples were loyal to me because Im content with any kind of robe Well there are disciples of mine who have rag robes wearing shabby robes They gather scraps from charnel grounds rubbish dumps and shops make them into a patchwork robe and wear itBut sometimes I wear robes offered by householders that are strong yet next to which bottlegourd down is coarseSo if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because Im content with any kind of robe then those disciples who wear rag robes would not be loyal to meSuppose my disciples were loyal to me because Im content with any kind of almsfood Well there are disciples of mine who eat only almsfood wander indiscriminately for almsfood happy to eat whatever they glean When theyve entered an inhabited area they dont consent when invited to sit downBut sometimes I even eat by invitation boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out served with many soups and saucesSo if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because Im content with any kind of almsfood then those disciples who eat only almsfood would not be loyal to meSuppose my disciples were loyal to me because Im content with any kind of lodging Well there are disciples of mine who stay at the root of a tree in the open air For eight months they dont go under a roofBut sometimes I even stay in bungalows plastered inside and out draftfree with latches fastened and windows shutteredSo if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because Im content with any kind of lodging then those disciples who stay at the root of a tree would not be loyal to meSuppose my disciples were loyal to me because Im secluded and I praise seclusion Well there are disciples of mine who live in the wilderness in remote lodgings Having ventured deep into remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest they live there coming down to the midst of the Saṅgha each fortnight for the recitation of the monastic codeBut sometimes I live crowded by monks nuns laymen and laywomen by rulers and their ministers and teachers of other paths and their disciplesSo if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because Im secluded and praise seclusion then those disciples who live in the wilderness would not be loyal to meSo Udāyī its not because of these five qualities that my disciples honor respect revere and venerate me and after honoring and respecting me they remain loyal to meThere are five other qualities because of which my disciples honor respect revere and venerate me and after honoring and respecting me they remain loyal to meWhat fiveFirstly my disciples esteem me for the higher ethicsThe ascetic Gotama is ethical He possesses the entire spectrum of ethical conduct to the highest degreeSince this is sothis is the first quality because of which my disciples are loyal to meFurthermore my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge and visionThe ascetic Gotama only claims to know when he does in fact knowHe only claims to see when he really does seeHe teaches based on direct knowledge not without direct knowledgeHe teaches based on reason not without reasonHe teaches with a demonstrable basis not without itSince this is sothis is the second quality because of which my disciples are loyal to meFurthermore my disciples esteem me for my higher wisdomThe ascetic Gotama is wise He possesses the entire spectrum of wisdom to the highest degreeIts not possible that he would fail to foresee grounds for future criticism or to legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come upWhat do you think UdāyīWould my disciples knowing and seeing this break in and interrupt meNo sirThats because I dont expect to be instructed by my disciplesInvariably my disciples expect instruction from meSince this is sothis is the third quality because of which my disciples are loyal to meFurthermore my disciples come to me and ask how the noble truth of suffering applies to the suffering in which they are swamped and mired And I provide them with a satisfying answer to their questionThey ask how the noble truths of the origin of sufferingthe cessation of sufferingand the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering apply to the suffering that has overwhelmed them and brought them low And I provide them with satisfying answers to their questionsSince this is sothis is the fourth quality because of which my disciples are loyal to meFurthermore I have

qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusionIts like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish sprinkling it little by little with water They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture spread through inside and out yet no moisture oozes outIn the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusionFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with

of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersionIts like a deep lake fed by spring waterTheres no inlet to the east west north or south and no rainfall to replenish it from time to timeBut the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches steeps fills and spreads throughout the lake Theres no part of the lake thats not spread through with cool waterIn the same way a

pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThey sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mindIts like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth Theres no part of the body thats not spread over with white clothIn the same way they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mindAnd many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insightFurthermore I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand thisThis body of mine is physical Its made up of the four primary elements produced by mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destructionAnd this consciousness of mine is attached to it tied to itSuppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked transparent and clear endowed with all good qualitiesAnd it was strung with a thread of blue yellow red white or golden brownAnd someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and check itThis beryl gem is naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked transparent and clear endowed with all good qualitiesAnd its strung with a thread of blue yellow red white or golden brownIn the same

in all its various parts not deficient in any facultySuppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheathTheyd thinkThis is the reed this is the sheath The reed and the sheath are different things The reed has been drawn out from the sheathOr suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbardTheyd thinkThis is the sword this is the scabbard The sword and the scabbard are different things The sword has been drawn out from the scabbardOr suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its sloughTheyd thinkThis is the snake this is the slough The snake and the slough are different things The snake has been drawn out from the sloughIn the same way I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to create from this body another body consisting of form mindmade complete in all its various parts not deficient in any facultyAnd many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insightFurthermore I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying themselves and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful They control the body as far as the Brahmā realmSuppose a deft potter or their apprentice had some wellprepared clay They could produce any kind of pot that they likeOr suppose a deft ivorycarver or their apprentice had some wellprepared ivory They could produce any kind of ivory item that they likeOr suppose a deft goldsmith or their apprentice had some wellprepared gold They could produce any kind of gold item that they likeIn the same way I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insightFurthermore I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman they hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or farSuppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directionsIn the same way I have explained to

comprehended them with their own mindThey understand mind with greed as mind with greedand mind without greed as mind without greedmind with hate as mind with hateand mind without hate as mind without hatemind with delusion as mind with delusionand mind without delusion as mind without delusionconstricted mind as constricted mindand scattered mind as scattered mindexpansive mind as expansive mindand unexpansive mind as unexpansive mindmind that is not supreme as mind that is not supremeand mind that is supreme as mind that is suprememind immersed in samādhi as mind immersed in samādhiand mind not immersed in samādhi as mind not immersed in samādhifreed mind as freed mindand unfreed mind as unfreed mindSuppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water If they had a spot theyd know I have a spot and if they had no spots theyd know I have no spotsIn the same way I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with their own mind And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insightFurthermore I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past lives That isone two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expandingThere I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsSuppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village From that village theyd go to yet another village And from that village theyd return to their home village Theyd thinkI went from my home village to another village There I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like that From that village I went to yet another village There too I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like that And from that village I returned to my home villageIn the same way I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past livesAnd many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insightFurthermore I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mindThey spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsSuppose there were two houses with doorsA person with good eyesight standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and froIn the same way I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that with clairvoyance that

explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsSuppose there was a lake that was transparent clear and uncloudedA person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying still Theyd thinkThis lake is transparent clear and unclouded And here are the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying stillIn the same way I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsAnd many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insightThis is the fifth quality because of which my disciples are loyal to meThese are the five qualities because of which my disciples honor respect revere and venerate me and after honoring and respecting me they remain loyal to meThat is what the Buddha

origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessationWhen theyve done this theyre defined as a noble disciple who has right view whose view is correct who has experiential confidence in the teaching and has come to the true teachingBut what is defilement What is its origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessationThere are these three defilementsThe defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceDefilement originates from ignorance Defilement ceases when ignorance ceases The practice that leads to the cessation of defilement is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionA noble disciple understands in this way defilement its origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessation Theyve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am Theyve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge and make an end of suffering in this very lifeWhen theyve done this theyre defined as a noble disciple who has right view whose view is correct who has experiential confidence in the teaching and has come to the true teachingThis is what Venerable Sāriputta saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Development of the FacultiesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Kajaṅgalā in a bamboo groveThen the brahmin student Uttara a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to himUttara does Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the facultiesHe does Master GotamaBut how does he teach itMaster Gotama its when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no soundThats how Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the facultiesIn that case Uttara a blind person and a deaf person will have developed facultiesaccording to what Pārāsariya saysFor a blind person sees no sight with the eye and a deaf person hears no sound with the earWhen he said this Uttara sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to sayKnowing this the Buddha addressed Venerable nandananda the development of the faculties taught by Pārāsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble OneNow is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy OneLet the Buddha teach the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble OneThe mendicants will listen and remember itWell then nanda listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir nanda repliedThe Buddha said thisAnd how nanda is there the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble OneWhen a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes liking

and I have taught the noble one with developed facultiesOut of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciplesHere are these roots of trees and here are these empty hutsPractice absorption nanda Dont be negligent Dont regret it later This is my instruction to youThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidThe Middle Discourses is completedMiddle DiscoursesThe Simile of the SnakeSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time a mendicant called Ariṭtha who had previously been a vulture trapper had the following harmful misconceptionAs I understand the Buddhas teachings the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs themSeveral mendicants heard about thisThey went up to Ariṭṭha and said to himIs it really true Reverend Ariṭṭha that you have such a harmful misconceptionAs I understand the Buddhas teachings the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs themAbsolutely reverends As I understand the Buddhas teachings the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs themThen wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view the mendicants pursued pressed and grilled himDont say that Ariṭṭha Dont misrepresent the Buddha for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good And the Buddha would not say thatIn many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive and that they really do obstruct the one who performs themThe Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksWith the similes of a skeleton a lump of meat a grass torch a pit of glowing coals borrowed goods fruit on a tree a butchers knife and chopping block a staking sword a snakes head the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksBut even though the mendicants pursued pressed and grilled him in this way Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on stating itWhen they werent able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view the mendicants went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedSo the Buddha addressed a certain monkPlease monk in my name tell the mendicant Ariṭṭha formerly a vulture trapper thatthe teacher summons himYes sir that monk replied He went to Ariṭṭha and said to himReverend Ariṭṭha the teacher summons youYes reverend Ariṭṭha repliedHe went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to himIs it really true Ariṭṭha that you have such a harmful misconceptionAs I understand the Buddhas teachings the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs themAbsolutely sir As I understand the Buddhas teachings the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs themSilly man who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that wayHavent I said in many ways that obstructive acts are obstructive and that they really do obstruct the one who performs themIve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksWith the similes of a skeleton a lump of meat a grass torch a pit of glowing coals borrowed goods fruit on a tree a butchers knife and chopping block a staking sword a snakes head Ive said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksBut still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp harm yourself and make much bad karmaThis will be for your lasting harm and sufferingThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsWhat do you think mendicantsHas this mendicant Ariṭṭha kindled even a spark of wisdom in this teaching and trainingHow could that be sirWhen this was said Ariṭṭha sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to sayKnowing this the Buddha saidSilly man you will be known by your own harmful misconceptionIll question the mendicants about thisThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants do you understand my teachings as Ariṭṭha does when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp harms himself and makes much bad karmaFor in many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive and that they really do obstruct the one who performs themThe Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksWith the similes of a skeleton a snakes head the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksGood good mendicants Its good that you understand my teaching like thisFor in many ways I have said that obstructive acts are obstructive Ive said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksBut still this Ariṭṭha misrepresents me by his wrong grasp harms himself and makes much bad karmaThis will be for his lasting harm and sufferingTruly mendicants its not possible to perform sensual acts without sensual pleasures sensual perceptions and sensual thoughtsTake a foolish person who memorizes the teachingstatements songs discussions verses inspired exclamations legends stories of past lives amazing stories and classificationsBut they dont examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdomand so dont come to a considered acceptance of themThey just memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debatesThey dont realize the goal for which they memorized themBecause theyre wrongly grasped those teachings lead to their lasting harm and sufferingWhy is thatBecause of their wrong grasp of the teachingsSuppose there was a person in need of a snake And while wandering in search of a snaketheyd see a big snakeand grasp it by the coil or the tailBut that snake would twist back and bite them on the hand or the arm or limbresulting in death or deadly painWhy is thatBecause of their wrong grasp of the snakeIn the same way a foolish person memorizes the teaching and those teachings lead to their lasting harm and sufferingWhy is thatBecause of their wrong grasp of the teachingsNow take a gentleman who memorizes the teachingstatements songs discussions verses inspired exclamations legends stories of past lives amazing stories and classificationsAnd once hes memorized them he examines their meaning with wisdomand comes to a considered acceptance of themHe doesnt memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debatesHe realizes the goal for which he memorized themBecause theyre correctly grasped those teachings lead to his lasting welfare and happinessWhy is thatBecause of his correct grasp of the teachingsSuppose there was a person in need of a snake And while wandering in search of a snaketheyd see a big snakeand hold it down carefully with a cleft stickOnly then would they correctly grasp it by the neckAnd even though that snake might wrap its coils around that persons hand or arm or some other limb that wouldnt result in death or deadly painWhy is thatBecause of their correct grasp of the snakeIn the same way a gentleman memorizes the teaching and those teachings lead to his lasting welfare and happinessWhy is thatBecause of his correct grasp of the teachingsSo mendicants when you understand what Ive said you should remember it accordinglyBut if Ive said anything that you dont understand you should ask me about it or some competent mendicantsMendicants I will teach you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft its for crossing over not for holding onListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisSuppose there was a person traveling along the roadTheyd see a large deluge whose near shore was dubious and perilous while the far shore was a sanctuary free of perilBut there was no ferryboat or bridge for crossing overTheyd thinkWhy dont I gather grass sticks branches and leaves and make a raft Riding on the raft and paddling with my hands and feet I can safely reach the far shoreAnd so theyd do exactly thatAnd when theyd crossed over to the far shore theyd thinkThis raft has been very helpful to meRiding on the raft and paddling with my hands and feet I have safely crossed over to the far shoreWhy dont I hoist it on my head or pick it up on my shoulder and go wherever I wantWhat do you think mendicantsWould that person be doing what should be done with that raftNo sirAnd what mendicants should that person do with the raftWhen theyd crossed over they should thinkThis raft has been very helpful to me Why dont I beach it on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go wherever I wantThats what that person should do with the raftIn the same way I have taught how the teaching is similar to a raft its for crossing over not for holding onBy understanding the simile of the raft you will even give up the teachings let alone what is against the teachingsMendicants there are these six grounds for viewsTake an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good personsThey regard form like this This is mine I am this this is my selfThey also regard feeling perception whatever is seen heard thought known sought and explored by the mind like this This is mine I am this this is my selfAnd the same for this ground for viewsThe self and the cosmos are one and the same After death I will be permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everThey also regard this This is mine I am this this is my selfBut an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good personsThey regard form like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfThey also regard feeling perception whatever is seen heard thought known sought and explored by the mind like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfAnd the same for this ground for viewsThe self and the cosmos are one and the same After death I will be permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everThey also regard this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfSeeing in this way theyre not anxious about what doesnt existWhen he said this one of the mendicants asked the BuddhaSir can there be anxiety about what doesnt exist externallyThere can mendicant said the BuddhaIts when someone thinksOh but it used to be mine and it is mine no moreOh but it could be mine and I will get it no moreThey sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionThats how there is anxiety about what doesnt exist externallyBut can there be no anxiety about what doesnt exist externallyThere can mendicant said the BuddhaIts when someone doesnt thinkOh but it used to be mine and it is mine no moreOh but it could be mine and I will get it no moreThey dont sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionThats how there is no anxiety about what doesnt exist externallyBut can there be anxiety about what doesnt exist internallyThere can mendicant said the BuddhaIts when someone has such a viewThe self and the cosmos are one and the same After death I will be permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everThey hear the Realized One or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds fixations obsessions insistences and underlying tendencies regarding views for the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishmentThey thinkWhoa Im going to be annihilated and destroyed I wont exist any moreThey sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionThats how there is anxiety about what doesnt exist internallyBut can there be no anxiety about what doesnt exist internallyThere can said the BuddhaIts when someone doesnt have such a viewThe self and the cosmos are one and the same After death I will be permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everThey hear the Realized One or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds fixations obsessions insistences and underlying tendencies regarding views for the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishmentIt never occurs to themWhoa Im going to be annihilated and destroyed I wont exist any moreThey dont sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionThats how there is no anxiety about what doesnt exist internallyMendicants it would make sense to be possessive about something thats permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everBut do you see any such possessionNo sirGood mendicantsI also cant see any such possessionIt would make sense to grasp at a doctrine of self that didnt give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressBut do you see any such doctrine of selfNo sirGood mendicantsI also cant see any such doctrine of selfIt would make sense to rely on a view that didnt give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressBut do you see any such view to rely onNo sirGood mendicantsI also cant see any such view to rely onMendicants were a self to exist would there be the thought Belonging to my selfYes sirWere what belongs to a self to exist would there be the thought My selfYes sirBut self and what belongs to a self are not acknowledged as a genuine fact This being so is not the following a totally foolish teachingThe self and the cosmos are one and the same After death I will be permanent everlasting eternal imperishable and will last forever and everWhat else could it be sir Its a totally foolish teachingWhat do you think mendicantsIs form permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo sirWhat do you think mendicantsIs feeling consciousness permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo sirSo mendicants you should truly see any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfYou should truly see any kind of feeling perception consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfSeeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form feeling perception choices and consciousnessBeing disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis is called a mendicant who has lifted up the crossbar filled in the trench and pulled up the pillar who is unbarred a noble one with banner and burden put down detachedAnd how has a mendicant lifted the crossbarIts when a mendicant has given up ignorance cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump obliterated it so its unable to arise in the futureThats how a mendicant has lifted the crossbarAnd how has a mendicant filled in the trenchIts when a mendicant has given up transmigrating through births in future lives cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump obliterated it so its unable to arise in the futureThats how a mendicant has filled in the trenchAnd how has a mendicant pulled up the pillarIts when a mendicant has given up craving cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump obliterated it so its unable to arise in the futureThats how a mendicant has pulled up the pillarAnd how is a mendicant unbarredIts when a mendicant has given up the five lower fetters cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so theyre unable to arise in the futureThats how a mendicant is unbarredAnd how is a mendicant a noble one with banner and burden put down detachedIts when a mendicant has given up the conceit I am cut it off at the root made it like a palm stump obliterated it so its unable to arise in the futureThats how a mendicant is a noble one with banner and burden put down detachedWhen a mendicants mind is freed like this the gods together with Indra Brahmā and Pajāpati search as they may will not findanything that such a Realized Ones consciousness depends onWhy is thatBecause even in the present life the Realized One is undiscoverable I sayThough I speak and explain like this certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false hollow lying untruthful claimThe ascetic Gotama is an exterminator He advocates the annihilation eradication and obliteration of an existing beingI have been falsely misrepresented as being what I am not and saying what I do not sayIn the past as today what I describe is suffering and the cessation of sufferingThis being so if others abuse attack harass and trouble the Realized One he doesnt get resentful bitter and emotionally exasperatedOr if others honor respect revere or venerate him he doesnt get thrilled elated and emotionally excitedHe just thinksThey do such things for what has already been completely understoodSo mendicants if others abuse attack harass and trouble you dont make yourselves resentful bitter and emotionally exasperatedOr if others honor respect revere or venerate you dont make yourselves thrilled elated and emotionally excitedJust thinkThey do such things for what has already been completely understoodSo mendicants give up what isnt yoursGiving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happinessAnd what isnt yoursForm isnt yours give it upGiving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happinessperception consciousness isnt yours give it upGiving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happinessWhat do you think mendicantsSuppose a person was to carry off the grass sticks branches and leaves in this Jetas Grove or burn them or do what they want with themWould you thinkThis person is carrying us off burning us or doing what they want with usWhy is thatBecause thats neither self nor belonging to selfIn the same way mendicants give up what isnt yoursGiving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happinessAnd what isnt yoursperception consciousness isnt yours give it upGiving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happinessThus the teaching has been well explained by me made clear opened illuminated and stripped of patchworkIn this teaching there are mendicants who are perfected who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment For them there is no cycle of rebirths to be found In this teaching there are mendicants who have given up the five lower fetters All of them are reborn spontaneously They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that world In this teaching there are mendicants who having given up three fetters and weakened greed hate and delusion are oncereturners All of them come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering In this teaching there are mendicants who have ended three fetters All of them are streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening In this teaching there are mendicants who are followers of principles or followers by faith All of them are bound for awakeningThus the teaching has been well explained by me made clear opened illuminated and stripped of patchworkIn this teaching there are those who have a degree of faith and love for me All of them are bound for heavenThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Analysis of a Recitation PassageSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants I shall teach you the analysis of a recitation passageListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisA mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally and they are not anxious because of graspingWhen this is the case and they are no longer anxious there is for them no coming to be of the origin of sufferingof rebirth old age and death in the futureThat is what the Buddha saidWhen he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwellingSoon after the Buddha left those mendicants consideredThe Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detailWho can explain in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the BuddhaThen those mendicants thoughtThis Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companionsHe is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the BuddhaLets go to him and ask him about this matterThen those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one sideThey told him what had happened and saidMay Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain thisReverends suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But hed pass over the roots and trunk imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leavesSuch is the consequence for the venerables Though you were face to face with the Buddha you passed him by imagining that you should ask me about this matterFor he is the Buddha who knows and sees He is vision he is knowledge he is the truth he is supreme He is the teacher the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the bestower of the deathless the lord of truth the Realized OneThat was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matterYou should have remembered it in line with the Buddhas answerCertainly he is the Buddha who knows and sees He is vision he is knowledge he is the truth he is supreme He is the teacher the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the bestower of the deathless the lord of truth the Realized OneThat was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matterWe should have remembered it in line with the Buddhas answerStill Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companionsHe is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the BuddhaPlease explain this if its no troubleWell then reverends listen and pay close attention I will speakYes reverend they repliedVenerable Mahākaccāna said thisReverends the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detailA mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally and they are not anxious because of grasping When this is the case and they are no longer anxious there is for them no coming to be of the origin of sufferingof rebirth old age and death in the futureAnd this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitationAnd how is consciousness scattered and diffused externallyTake a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes Their consciousness follows after the features of that sight tied attached and fettered to gratification in its features So their consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externallyWhen they hear a sound with their ears When they smell an odor with their nose When they taste a flavor with their tongue When they feel a touch with their body When they know a thought with their mind their consciousness follows after the features of that thought tied attached and fettered to gratification in its features So their consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externallyThats how consciousness is scattered and diffused externallyAnd how is consciousness not scattered and diffused externallyTake a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes Their consciousness doesnt follow after the features of that sight and is not tied attached and fettered to gratification in its features So their consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused externallyWhen they hear a sound with their ears When they smell an odor with their nose When they taste a flavor with their tongue When they feel a touch with their body When they know a thought with their mind their consciousness doesnt follow after the features of that thought and is not tied attached and fettered to gratification in its features So their consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused externallyThats how consciousness is not scattered and diffused externallyAnd how is their consciousness stuck internallyTake a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedTheir consciousness follows after that rapture and bliss born of seclusion tied attached and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of seclusion So their mind is said to be stuck internallyFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedTheir consciousness follows after that rapture and bliss born of immersion tied attached and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of immersion So their mind is said to be stuck internallyFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissTheir consciousness follows after that equanimity tied attached and fettered to gratification in that equanimous bliss So their mind is said to be stuck internallyFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessTheir consciousness follows after that neutral feeling tied attached and fettered to gratification in that neutral feeling So their mind is said to be stuck internallyThats how their consciousness is stuck internallyAnd how is their consciousness not stuck internallyIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedTheir consciousness doesnt follow after that rapture and bliss born of seclusion and is not tied attached and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of seclusion So their mind is said to be not stuck internallyFurthermore they enter the second absorption Their consciousness doesnt follow after that rapture and bliss born of immersion Furthermore they enter and remain in the third absorption Their consciousness doesnt follow after that equanimity and is not tied attached and fettered to gratification in that equanimous bliss So their mind is said to be not stuck internallyFurthermore they enter and remain in the fourth absorption Their consciousness doesnt follow after that neutral feeling and is not tied attached and fettered to gratification in that neutral feeling So their mind is said to be not stuck internallyThats how their consciousness is not stuck internallyAnd how are they anxious because of graspingIts when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good personsThey regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in formBut that form of theirs decays and perishesand consciousness latches on to the perishing of formAnxieties occupy their mind born of latching on to the perishing of form and originating in accordance with natural principlesSo they become frightened worried concerned and anxious because of graspingThey regard feeling consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousnessBut that consciousness of theirs decays and perishesand consciousness latches on to the perishing of consciousnessAnxieties occupy their mind born of latching on to the perishing of consciousness and originating in accordance with natural principlesSo they become frightened worried concerned and anxious because of graspingThats how they are anxious because of graspingAnd how are they not anxious because of graspingIts when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good personsThey dont regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in formWhen that form of theirs decays and perishesconsciousness doesnt latch on to the perishing of formAnxietiesborn of latching on to the perishing of form

consciousnessAnxietiesborn of latching on to the perishing of consciousness and originating in accordance with natural principlesdont occupy their mindSo they dont become frightened worried concerned or anxious because of graspingThats how they are not anxious because of graspingThe Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detailA mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally and they are not anxious because of graspingWhen this is the case and they are no longer anxious there is for them no coming to be of the origin of sufferingof rebirth old age and death in the futureAnd this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitationIf you wish you may go to the Buddha and ask him about thisYou should remember it in line with the Buddhas answerYes reverend said those mendicants approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna saidThen they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened sayingMahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner with these words and phrasesMahākaccāna is astute mendicants he has great wisdomIf you came to me and asked this question I would answer it in exactly the same way as MahākaccānaThat is what it means and thats how you should remember itThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith BhaddāliSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants I eat my food in one sitting per dayDoing so I find that Im healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyYou too should eat your food in one sitting per dayDoing so youll find that youre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyWhen he said this Venerable Bhaddāli said to the BuddhaSir Im not going to try to eat my food in one sitting per dayFor when eating once a day I might feel remorse and regretWell then Bhaddāli eat one part of the meal in the place where youre invited and bring the rest back to eatEating this way too you will sustain yourselfSir Im not going to try to eat that way eitherFor when eating that way I might also feel remorse and regretThen as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it Bhaddāli announced he would not try to keep itThen for the whole of that three months Bhaddāli did not present himself in the presence of the Buddha as happens when someone doesnt fulfill the training according to the Teachers instructionsAt that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha thinking thatwhen his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wanderingThen Bhaddāli went up to those mendicants and exchanged greetings with themWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideThe mendicants said to BhaddāliReverend Bhaddāli this robe is being made for the BuddhaWhen its finished and the three months of the rains residence have passed the Buddha will set out wanderingCome on Bhaddāli learn your lesson Dont make it hard for yourself later onYes reverends Bhaddāli repliedHe went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himI have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me that as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it I announced I would not try to keep itPlease sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in futureIndeed Bhaddāli you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you that as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it you announced you would not try to keep itAnd you didnt realize this situationThe Buddha is staying in Sāvatthī and hell know meas the mendicant named Bhaddāli who doesnt fulfill the training according to the Teachers instructionsAnd you didnt realize this situationSeveral monks have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī several nuns have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī several laymen reside in Sāvatthī several laywomen reside in Sāvatthī and theyll know meas the mendicant named Bhaddāli who doesnt fulfill the training according to the Teachers instructions Several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī and theyll know meas the mendicant named Bhaddāli one of the senior disciples of Gotama who doesnt fulfill the training according to the Teachers instructionsYou also didnt realize this situationI made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me that as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it I announced I would not try to keep itPlease sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in futureIndeed Bhaddāli you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you that as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it you announced you would not try to keep itWhat do you think BhaddāliSuppose I was to say this to a mendicant who is freed both waysPlease mendicant be a bridge for me to cross over the mud Would they cross over themselves or struggle to get out of it or just say noNo sirWhat do you think BhaddāliSuppose I was to say the same thing to a mendicant who is freed by wisdomor a personal witnessor attained to viewor freed by faithor a follower of the teachingsor a follower by faithPlease mendicant be a bridge for me to cross over the mud Would they cross over themselves or struggle to get out of it or just say noNo sirWhat do you think BhaddāliAt that time were you freed both ways freed by wisdom a personal witness attained to view freed by faith a follower of the teachings or a follower by faithNo sirWerent you void hollow and mistakenYes sirI made a mistake sir Please sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in futureIndeed Bhaddāli you made a mistake But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly I accept itFor it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is deal with it properly and commit to restraint in the futureBhaddāli take a mendicant who doesnt fulfill the training according to the Teachers instructionsThey thinkWhy dont I frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawHopefully Ill realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesSo they frequent a secluded lodgingWhile theyre living withdrawn theyre reprimanded by the Teacher by sensible spiritual companions after examination by deities and by themselvesBeing reprimanded in this way they dont realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesWhy is thatBecause thats how it is when someone doesnt fulfill the training according to the Teachers instructionsBut take a mendicant who does fulfill the training according to the Teachers instructionsThey thinkWhy dont I frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawHopefully Ill realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThey frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawWhile theyre living withdrawn theyre not reprimanded by the Teacher by sensible spiritual companions after examination by deities or by themselvesNot being reprimanded in this way they realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedWhy is thatBecause thats what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teachers instructionsFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedWhy is thatBecause thats what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teachers instructionsFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissWhy is thatBecause thats what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teachers instructionsFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessWhy is thatBecause thats what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teachers instructionsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives that is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding  They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsWhy is thatBecause thats what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teachers instructionsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind  Theyre reborn in the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind  theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman  they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsWhy is thatBecause thats what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teachers instructionsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceWhy is thatBecause thats what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teachers instructionsWhen he said this Venerable Bhaddāli said to the BuddhaWhat is the cause sir what is the reason why they punish some monk repeatedly pressuring himAnd what is the cause what is the reason why they dont similarly punish another monk repeatedly pressuring himTake a monk who is a frequent offender with many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he dodges the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points He displays annoyance hate and bitterness He doesnt proceed properly he doesnt fall in line he doesnt proceed to get past it and he doesnt say Ill do what pleases the SaṅghaIn such a case the monks sayReverends this monk is a frequent offender with many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he dodges the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points He displays annoyance hate and bitterness He doesnt proceed properly he doesnt fall in line he doesnt proceed to get past it and he doesnt say Ill do what pleases the SaṅghaItd be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is not quickly settledAnd thats what they doTake some other monk who is a frequent offender with many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he doesnt dodge the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points He doesnt display annoyance hate and bitterness He proceeds properly he falls in line he proceeds to get past it and he says Ill do what pleases the SaṅghaIn such a case the monks sayReverends this monk is a frequent offender with many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he doesnt dodge the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points He doesnt display annoyance hate and bitterness He proceeds properly he falls in line he proceeds to get past it and he says Ill do what pleases the SaṅghaItd be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is quickly settledAnd thats what they doTake some other monk who is an occasional offender without many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he dodges the issue In such a case the monks sayReverends this monk is an occasional offender without many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he dodges the issue Itd be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is not quickly settledAnd thats what they doTake some other monk who is an occasional offender without many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he doesnt dodge the issue In such a case the monks sayReverends this monk is an occasional offender without many offensesWhen admonished by the monks he doesnt dodge the issue Itd be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is quickly settledAnd thats what they doTake some other monk who gets by with mere faith and loveIn such a case the monks sayReverends this monk gets by with mere faith and loveIf we punish him repeatedly pressuring himno let him not lose what little faith and love he hasSuppose there was a person with one eye Their friends and colleagues relatives and kin would protect that one eyeLet them not lose the one eye that they haveIn the same way some monk gets by with mere faith and loveIn such a case the monks sayReverends this monk gets by with mere faith and loveIf we punish him repeatedly pressuring himno let him not lose what little faith and love he hasThis is the cause this is the reason why they punish some monk repeatedly pressuring himAnd this is the cause this is the reason why they dont similarly punish another monk repeatedly pressuring himWhat is the cause sir what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicantsAnd what is the cause what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicantsThats how it is Bhaddāli When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicantsThe Teacher doesnt lay down training rules for disciples as long as certain defiling influences have not appeared in the SaṅghaBut when such defiling influences appear in the Saṅgha the Teacher lays down training rules for disciples to protect against themAnd they dont appear until the Saṅgha has attained a great sizean abundance of material support and fame learning and seniorityBut when the Saṅgha has attained these things then such defiling influences appear in the Saṅgha and the Teacher lays down training rules for disciples to protect against themThere were only a few of you there at the time when I taught the exposition of the teaching on the simile of the thoroughbred coltDo you remember that BhaddāliNo sirWhat do you believe the reason for that isSir its surely because for a long time now I havent fulfilled the training according to the Teachers instructionsThats not the only reason BhaddāliRather for a long time I have comprehended your mind and knownWhile Im teaching this silly man doesnt pay heed pay attention engage wholeheartedly or lend an earStill Bhaddāli I shall teach the exposition of the teaching on the simile of the thoroughbred coltListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Bhaddāli repliedThe Buddha said thisSuppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred First of all hed make it get used to wearing the bitBecause it has not done this before it still resorts to some tricks dodges and evasionsBut with regular and gradual practice it quells that bad habitWhen it has done this the horse trainer next makes it get used to wearing the harnessBecause it has not done this before it still resorts to some tricks dodges and evasionsBut with regular and gradual practice it quells that bad habitWhen it has done this the horse trainer next makes it get used to walking in procession circling prancing galloping charging the protocols and traditions of court and in the very best speed fleetness and friendlinessBecause it has not done this before it still resorts to some tricks dodges and evasionsBut with regular and gradual practice it quells that bad habitWhen it has done this the horse trainer next rewards it with a grooming and a rub downA fine royal thoroughbred with these ten factors is worthy of a king fit to serve a king and reckoned as a factor of kingshipIn the same way a mendicant with ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of veneration with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the worldIts when a mendicant has an adepts right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right immersion right knowledge and right freedomA mendicant with these ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of veneration with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the worldThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Bhaddāli was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Noble SearchSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsThen several mendicants went up to Venerable nanda and said to himReverend its been a long time since weve heard a Dhamma talk from the BuddhaIt would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the BuddhaWell then reverends go to the brahmin Rammakas hermitageHopefully youll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the BuddhaYes reverend they repliedThen after the meal on his return from almsround the Buddha addressed nandaCome nanda lets go to the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother for the days meditationYes sir nanda repliedSo the Buddha went with nanda to the Eastern MonasteryIn the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed nandaCome nanda lets go to the eastern gate to batheYes sir nanda repliedSo the Buddha went with nanda to the eastern gate to batheWhen he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himselfThen nanda said to the BuddhaSir the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearbyIts so delightfulso lovelyPlease visit it out of compassionThe Buddha consented in silenceHe went to the brahmin Rammakas hermitageNow at that time several mendicants were sitting together in the hermitage talking about the teachingThe Buddha stood outside the door waiting for the talk to endWhen he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked with the latchThe mendicants opened the door for the Buddhaand he entered the hermitage where he sat on the seat spread outand addressed the mendicantsMendicants what were you sitting talking about just nowWhat conversation was unfinishedSir our unfinished discussion on the teaching was about the Buddha himself when the Buddha arrivedGood mendicantsIts appropriate for gentlemen like you who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to sit together and talk about the teachingWhen youre sitting together you should do one of two thingsdiscuss the teachings or keep noble silenceMendicants there are these two searchesthe noble search and the ignoble searchAnd what is the ignoble searchIts when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn Themselves liable to grow old fall sick die sorrow and become corrupted they seek what is also liable to these thingsAnd what should be described as liable to be rebornPartners and children male and female bondservants goats and sheep chickens and pigs and elephants and cattle are liable to be rebornThese attachments are liable to be rebornSomeone who is tied infatuated and attached to such things themselves liable to being reborn seeks what is also liable to be rebornAnd what should be described as

who is tied infatuated and attached to such things themselves liable to grow old seeks what is also liable to grow oldAnd what should be described as liable to fall sickPartners and children male and

corruptionSomeone who is tied infatuated and attached to such things themselves liable to corruption seeks what is also liable to corruptionThis is the ignoble searchAnd what is the noble searchIts when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn seeks the unborn supreme sanctuary extinguishment Themselves liable to grow old fall sick die sorrow and become corrupted understanding the drawbacks in these things they seek the unaging unailing undying sorrowless uncorrupted supreme sanctuary extinguishmentThis is the noble searchMendicants before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI too being liable to be reborn sought what is also liable to be reborn Myself liable to grow old fall sick die sorrow and become corrupted I sought what is also liable to these thingsThen it occurred to meWhy do I being liable to be reborn grow old fall sick sorrow die and become corrupted seek things that have the same natureWhy dont I seek the unborn unaging unailing undying sorrowless uncorrupted supreme sanctuary extinguishmentSome time later while still blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of lifethough my mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful facesI shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peaceI approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingḷāra Kālāma repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it occurred to meIt is not solely by mere faith that ḷāra Kālāma declares I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved itSurely he meditates knowing and seeing this teachingSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma to what extent do you say youve realized this teaching with your own insightWhen I said this he declared the dimension of nothingnessThen it occurred to meIts not just ḷāra Kālāma who has faithmindfulnessimmersionand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that ḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point and declare having achieved itI have reverendI too reverend have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved itWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsSo the teaching that Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved itThe teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved itSo the teaching that I know you know and the teaching that you know I knowI am like you and you are like meCome now reverend We should both lead this community togetherAnd that is how my teacher ḷāra Kālāma placed me his student on the same position as him and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingnessRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingUddaka repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it occurred to meIt is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved itSurely he meditated knowing and seeing this teachingSo I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend to what extent did Rāma say hed realized this teaching with his own insightWhen I said this Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen it occurred to meIts not just Rāma who had faithmindfulnessimmersionand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point and declared having achieved itHe had reverendI too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved itWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsSo the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved itThe teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved itSo the teaching that Rāma directly knew you know and the teaching you know Rāma directly knewRāma was like you and you are like RāmaCome now reverend You should lead this communityAnd that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a teacher and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands I arrived at Senanigama near UruvelāThere I saw a delightful park a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby was a village to go for almsThen it occurred to meThis park is truly delightful a lovely grove with a flowing river thats clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby theres a village to go for almsThis is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditationSo I sat down right there thinkingThis is good enough for meditationAnd so being myself liable to be reborn understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn I sought the unborn supreme sanctuary extinguishmentand I found it Being myself liable to grow old fall sick die sorrow and become corrupted understanding the drawbacks in these things I sought the unaging unailing undying sorrowless uncorrupted supreme sanctuary extinguishmentand I found itKnowledge and vision arose in meMy freedom is unshakable this is my last rebirth now there are no more future livesThen it occurred to meThis principle I have discovered is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astuteBut people like attachment they love it and enjoy itIts hard for them to see this thing that is specific conditionality dependent originationIts also hard for them to see this thing that is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishmentAnd if I were to teach the Dhamma others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for meAnd then these verses which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to meIve struggled hard to realize thisenough with trying to explain itThis teaching is not easily understoodby those mired in greed and hateThose caught up in greed cant seewhats subtle going against the streamdeep hard to see and very finefor theyre shrouded in a mass of darknessSo as I reflected like this my mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahmā Sahampati knowing what I was thinking thoughtOh my goodness The world will be lost the world will perish For the mind of the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha inclines to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the BuddhaHe arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidSir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teachingThere will be those who understand the teachingThats what Brahmā Sahampati saidThen he went on to sayAmong the Magadhans there appeared in the pastan impure teaching thought up by those still stainedFling open the door to the deathlessLet them hear the teaching the immaculate one discoveredStanding high on a rocky mountainyou can see the people all aroundIn just the same way allseer wise onehaving ascended the Temple of Truthrid of sorrow look upon the peopleswamped with sorrow oppressed by rebirth and old ageRise hero Victor in battle leader of the caravanwander the world without obligationLet the Blessed One teach the DhammaThere will be those who understandThen understanding Brahmās invitation I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha because of my compassion for sentient beingsAnd I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did notIts like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the waters surface And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to themIn the same way I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyesThen I replied in verse to Brahmā SahampatiFlung open are the doors to the deathlessLet those with ears to hear decide their faithThinking it would be troublesome Brahmā I did not teachthe sophisticated sublime Dhamma among humansThen Brahmā Sahampati knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted bowed and respectfully circled me keeping me on his right before vanishing right thereThen I thoughtWho should I teach first of allWho will quickly understand this teachingThen it occurred to meThat ḷāra Kālāma is astute competent clever and has long had little dust in his eyesWhy dont I teach him first of allHell quickly understand the teachingBut a deity came to me and saidSir ḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days agoAnd knowledge and vision arose in meḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days agoI thoughtThis is a great loss for ḷāra KālāmaIf he had heard the teaching he would have understood it quicklyThen I thoughtWho should I teach first of allWho will quickly understand this teachingThen it occurred to meThat Uddaka son of Rāma is astute competent clever and has long had little dust in his eyesWhy dont I teach him first of allHell quickly understand the teachingBut a deity came to me and saidSir Uddaka son of Rāma passed away just last nightAnd knowledge and vision arose in meUddaka son of Rāma passed away just last nightI thoughtThis is a great loss for UddakaIf he had heard the teaching he would have understood it quicklyThen I thoughtWho should I teach first of allWho will quickly understand this teachingThen it occurred to meThe group of five mendicants were very helpful to me They looked after me during my time of resolute strivingWhy dont I teach them first of allThen I thoughtWhere are the group of five mendicants staying these daysWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Benares in the deer park at IsipatanaSo when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I wished I set out for BenaresWhile I was traveling along the road between Gaya and Bodhgaya the jīvaka ascetic Upaka saw meReverend your faculties are so very clear and your complexion is pure and brightIn whose name have you gone forth reverend Who is your Teacher Whose teaching do you believe inI replied to Upaka in verseI am the champion the knower of allunsullied in the midst of all thingsIve given up all freed through the ending of cravingSince I know for myself whose follower should I beI have no teacherThere is noone like meIn the world with its godsI have no counterpartFor in this world I am the perfected oneI am the supreme TeacherI alone am fully awakenedcooled extinguishedI am going to the city of Kāsito roll forth the Wheel of DhammaIn this world that is so blindIll beat the deathless drumAccording to what you claim reverend you ought to be the Infinite VictorThe victors are those who like mehave reached the ending of defilementsI have conquered bad qualities Upakathats why Im a victorWhen I had spoken Upaka said If you say so reverend Shaking his head he took a wrong turn and leftTraveling stage by stage I arrived at Benares and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at IsipatanaThe group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distanceand stopped each other sayingHere comes the ascetic Gotama Hes so indulgent he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceWe shouldnt bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robeBut we can set out a seat he can sit if he likesYet as I drew closer the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreedSome came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe some spread out a seat while others set out water for washing my feetBut they still addressed me by name and as reverendSo I said to themMendicants dont address me by name and as reverendThe Realized One is perfected a fully awakened BuddhaListen up mendicants I have achieved the Deathless I shall instruct you I will teach you the DhammaBy practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBut they said to meReverend Gotama even by that conduct that practice that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones How could you have achieved such a state now that youve become indulgent strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceSo I said to themThe Realized One has not become indulgent strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceThe Realized One is perfected a fully awakened BuddhaListen up mendicants I have achieved the Deathless I shall instruct you I will teach you the DhammaBy practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very lifeBut for a second time they said to meReverend Gotama  youve returned to indulgenceSo for a second time I said to themThe Realized One has not become indulgent But for a third time they said to meReverend Gotama even by that conduct that practice that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones How could you have achieved such a state now that youve become indulgent strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceSo I said to themMendicants have you ever known me to speak like this beforeNo sir we have notThe Realized One is perfected a fully awakened BuddhaListen up mendicants I have achieved the Deathless I shall instruct you I will teach you the DhammaBy practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessI was able to persuade the group of five mendicantsThen sometimes I advised two mendicants while the other three went for almsThen those three would feed all six of us with what they brought backSometimes I advised three mendicants while the other two went for almsThen those two would feed all six of us with what they brought backAs the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this being themselves liable to be reborn understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn they sought the unborn supreme sanctuary extinguishmentand they found it Being themselves liable to grow old fall sick die sorrow and become corrupted understanding the drawbacks in these things they sought the unaging unailing undying sorrowless uncorrupted supreme sanctuary extinguishmentand they found itKnowledge and vision arose in themOur freedom is unshakable this is our last rebirth now there are no more future livesMendicants there are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationThere are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escape You should understand that theyhave met with calamity and disaster and are vulnerable to the Wicked OneSuppose a deer in the wilderness was lying caught on a pile of snaresYoud know that ithas met with calamity and disaster and is vulnerable to the hunterAnd when the hunter comes it cannot flee where it wantsIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escape You should understand that theyhave met with calamity and disaster and are vulnerable to the Wicked OneThere are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation without being tied infatuated or attached seeing the drawbacks and understanding the escape You should understand that theyhavent met with calamity and disaster and are not vulnerable to the Wicked OneSuppose a deer in the wilderness was lying on a pile of snares without being caughtYoud know that ithasnt met with calamity and disaster and isnt vulnerable to the hunterAnd when the hunter comes it can flee where it wantsIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation without being tied infatuated or attached seeing the drawbacks and understanding the escape You should understand that theyhavent met with calamity and disaster and are not vulnerable to the Wicked OneSuppose there was a wild deer wandering in the forest that walked stood sat and laid down in confidenceWhy is thatBecause its out of the hunters rangeIn the same way a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra put out his eyes without a trace and gone where the Wicked One cannot seeFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite spaceThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousnessThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingnessThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling And having seen with wisdom their defilements come to an endThis is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra put out his eyes without a trace and gone where the Wicked One cannot seeTheyve crossed over clinging to the world And they walk stand sit and lie down in confidenceWhy is thatBecause theyre out of the Wicked Ones rangeThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse on the FullMoon NightSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras motherNow at that time it was the sabbaththe full moon on the fifteenth dayand the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monksThen one of the mendicants got up from their seat arranged their robe over one shoulder raised their joined palms toward the Buddha and saidId like to ask the Buddha about a certain point if youd take the time to answerWell then mendicant take your own seat and ask what you wishThat mendicant took his seat and said to the BuddhaSir are these the five grasping aggregatesform feeling perception choices and consciousnessYes they are replied the BuddhaSaying Good sir that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said Then he asked another questionBut sir what is the root of these five grasping aggregatesThese five grasping aggregates are rooted in desireBut sir is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates anotherRather the desire and greed for them is the grasping thereBut sir can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregatesThere can said the BuddhaIts when someone thinksIn the future may I be of such form such feeling such perception such choices and such consciousnessThats how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregatesSir what is the scope of the term aggregates as applied to the aggregatesAny kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near this is called the aggregate of formAny kind of feeling at all Any kind of perception at all Any kind of choices at all Any kind of consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near this is called the aggregate of consciousnessThats the scope of the term aggregates as applied to the aggregatesWhat is the cause sir what is the reason why the aggregate of form is foundWhat is the cause what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling perception consciousness is foundThe four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is foundContact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling perception and choices are foundName and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is foundBut sir how does identity view come aboutIts when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good personsThey regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in formThey regard feeling as self self as having feeling feeling in self or self in feelingThey regard perception as self self as having perception perception in self or self in perceptionThey regard choices as self self as having choices choices in self or self in choicesThey regard consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousnessThats how identity view comes aboutBut sir how does identity view not come aboutIts when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good personsThey dont regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in formThey dont regard feeling as self self as having feeling feeling in self or self in feelingThey dont regard perception as self self as having perception perception in self or self in perceptionThey dont regard choices as self self as having choices choices in self or self in choicesThey dont regard consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousnessThats how identity view does not come aboutSir whats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to formperceptionand consciousnessThe pleasure and happiness that arise from form this is its gratificationThat form is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawbackRemoving and giving up desire and greed for form this is its escapeThe pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling perception consciousness this is its gratificationThat consciousness is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawbackRemoving and giving up desire and greed for consciousness this is its escapeSir how does one know and see so that theres no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuliOne truly sees any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfOne truly sees any kind of feeling perception consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfThats how to know and see so that theres no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuliNow at that time one of the mendicants had the thoughtSo it seems good sir that form feeling perception choices and consciousness are notselfThen what self will the deeds done by notself affectBut the Buddha knowing what that monk was thinking addressed the mendicantsIts possible that some foolish person hereunknowing and ignorant their mind dominated by cravingthinks they can overstep the teachers instructions They thinkSo it seems good sir that form feeling perception choices and consciousness are notselfThen what self will the deeds done by notself affectNow mendicants you have been educated by me in questioning with regard to all these things in all such casesWhat do you think mendicantsIs form permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo sirWhat do you think mendicantsconsciousness permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo sirSo you should truly see any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or nearall formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfYou should truly see any kind of feeling perception consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understandingThis is not mine I am not this this is not my selfSeeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form feeling perception choices and consciousnessBeing disillusioned desire fades awayWhen desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidAnd while this discourse was being spoken the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not graspingMiddle DiscoursesThe Great FortySo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants I will teach you noble right immersion with its vital conditions and

by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the worldIf any ascetic or brahmin imagines they can criticize and reject the exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty they deserve rebuke and criticism on ten legitimate grounds in the present lifeIf such a gentleman criticizes right view they praise and honor the ascetics and brahmins who have wrong viewIf they criticize right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right immersion right knowledge right freedom they praise and honor the ascetics and brahmins who have wrong freedomIf any ascetic or brahmin imagines they can criticize and reject the exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty they deserve rebuke and criticism on these ten legitimate grounds in the

is thatFor fear of blame attack and condemnationThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesAdvice to ChannaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundNow at that time the venerables Sāriputta Mahācunda and Channa were staying on the Vultures Peak MountainNow at that time Venerable Channa was sick suffering gravely illThen in the late afternoon Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to himCome Reverend Cunda lets go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illnessYes reverend replied MahācundaAnd then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one sideThen Sāriputta said to ChannaI hope youre keeping well Reverend Channa I hope youre alright I hope that your pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growingReverend Sāriputta Im not keeping well Im not alrightThe pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fadingThe winds piercing my head are so severe it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp pointThe pain in my head is so severe it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my headThe winds piercing my belly are so severe it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaverThe burning in my body is so severe it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coalsIm not keeping well Im not alrightThe pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fadingReverend Sāriputta I will slit my wrists I dont wish to livePlease dont slit your wristsVenerable Channa keep going We want you to keep goingIf you dont have any suitable food well find it for youIf you dont have suitable medicine well find it for youIf you dont have a capable carer well find one for youPlease dont slit your wristsVenerable Channa keep going We want you to keep goingReverend Sāriputta its not that I dont have suitable foodor suitable medicineor a capable carerMoreover for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love not without loveFor it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love not without loveYou should remember this The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelesslyId like to ask you about a certain point if youd take the time to answerAsk Reverend Sāriputta When Ive heard it Ill knowReverend Channa do you regard the eye eye consciousness and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way This is mine I am this this is my selfDo you regard the ear mind mind consciousness and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way This is mine I am this this is my selfReverend Sāriputta I regard the eye eye consciousness and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfI regard the ear mind mind consciousness and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfReverend Channa what have you seen what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfReverend Sāriputta after seeing cessation after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen he said this Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable ChannaSo Reverend Channa you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you canFor the dependent there is agitation For the independent theres no agitationWhen theres no agitation there is tranquilityWhen there is tranquility theres no inclinationWhen theres no inclination theres no coming and goingWhen theres no coming and going theres no passing away and reappearingWhen theres no passing away and reappearing theres no this world or world beyond or between the twoJust this is the end of sufferingAnd when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and leftNot long after those venerables had left Venerable Channa slit his wristsThen Sāriputta went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir Venerable Channa has slit his wristsWhere has he been reborn in his next lifeSāriputta didnt the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personallySir there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhanawhere Channa had families with whom he was friendly intimate and familiarThe mendicant Channa did indeed have such familiesBut this is not enough for me to call someone blameworthyWhen someone lays down this body and takes up another body I call them blameworthyBut the mendicant Channa did no such thingYou should remember this The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelesslyThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Sāriputta was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse at GosiṅgaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick houseNow at that time the venerables Anuruddha Nandiya and Kimbila were staying in the sal forest park at GosiṅgaThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to that parkThe park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceand said to himDont come into this park asceticThere are three gentlemen who love themselves staying hereDont disturb themAnuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddhaand said to himDont keep the Buddha out good park keeperOur Teacher the Blessed One has arrivedThen Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila and said to themCome forth venerables come forth Our Teacher the Blessed One has arrivedThen Anuruddha Nandiya and Kimbila came out to greet the BuddhaOne received his bowl and robe one spread out a seat and one set out water for washing his feetHe sat on the seat spread outand washed his feetThose venerables bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to AnuruddhaI hope youre keeping well Anuruddha and friends I hope youre alright And I hope youre having no trouble getting almsfoodWere alright Blessed One were getting by And we have no trouble getting almsfoodI hope youre living in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyesIndeed sir we live in harmony like thisBut how do you live this wayIn this case sir I thinkIm fortunate so very fortunateto live together with spiritual companions such as theseI consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body speech and mind both in public and in privateWhy dont I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables ideasAnd thats what I doThough were different in body sir were one in mind it seems to meAnd the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise and they addedThats how we live in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyesGood good Anuruddha and friendsBut I hope youre living diligently keen and resoluteIndeed sir we live diligentlyBut how do you live this wayIn this case sir whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish binIf theres anything left over whoever returns last eats it if they like Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows or drop it into water that has no living creaturesThen they put away the seats drinking water and rubbish bin and sweep the refectoryIf someone sees that the pot of water for washing drinking or the toilet is empty they set it upIf he cant do it he summons another with a wave of the hand and they set it up by lifting it with their hands But we dont break into speech for that reasonAnd every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachingsThats how we live diligently keen and resoluteGood good Anuruddha and friendsBut as you live diligently like this have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at easeHow could we not sirWhenever we want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities we enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at ease that we have achieved while living diligent keen and resoluteGood goodBut have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditationHow could we not sirWhenever we want as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled we enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditationGood goodBut have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditationHow could we not sirWhenever we want with the fading away of rapture we enter and remain in the third absorption where we meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThis is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditationGood goodBut have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditationHow could we not sirWhenever we want with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness we enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThis is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditationGood goodBut have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditationHow could we not sirWhenever we want going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite we enter and remain in the dimension of infinite spaceThis is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditationGood goodBut have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditationHow could we not sirWhenever we want going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite we enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all we enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness we enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditationGood goodBut have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditationHow could we not sirWhenever we want going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception we enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling And having seen with wisdom our defilements have come to an endThis is another superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at ease that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditationAnd we dont see any better or finer way of meditating at ease than thisGood goodThere is no better or finer way of meditating at ease than thisThen the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired the venerables Anuruddha Nandiya and Kimbila with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and leftThe venerables then accompanied the Buddha for a little way before turning back Nandiya and Kimbila said to AnuruddhaDid we ever tell you that we hadgained such and such meditations and attainments up to the ending of defilements as you revealed to the BuddhaThe venerables did not tell me that they hadgained such meditations and attainments But I discovered it by comprehending your mindsand deities also told meI answered when the Buddha directly asked about itThen the native spirit Dīgha Parajana went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to himThe Vajjis are lucky The Vajjian people are so very luckythat the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha stays there as well as these three gentlementhe venerables Anuruddha Nandiya and KimbilaHearing the cry of Dīgha Parajana the Earth Gods raised the cry Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods the Gods of the Four Great Kings the Gods of the ThirtyThree the Gods of Yama the Joyful Gods the Gods Who Love to Create the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others the Gods of Brahmās Host raised the cryThe Vajjis are lucky The Vajjian people are so very luckythat the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha stays there as well as these three gentlementhe venerables Anuruddha Nandiya and KimbilaAnd so at that moment in that instant those venerables were known as far as the Brahmā realmThats so true Dīgha Thats so trueIf the family from which those three gentlemen went forth from the lay life to homelessness were to recollect those venerables with confident heart that would be for that familys lasting welfare and happinessIf the family circle all the aristocrats all the brahmins all the merchants all the workers were to recollect those venerables with confident heart that would be for all those workers lasting welfare and happinessIf the whole worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humanswere to recollect those venerables with confident heart that would be for the whole worlds lasting welfare and happinessSee Dīgha how those three gentlemen are practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the native spirit Dīgha Parajana was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesGuaranteedSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named SālāThe brahmins and householders of Sālā heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familywandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the BuddhaBefore sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentThe Buddha said to themSo householders is there some other teacher youre happy with in whom you have acquired grounded faithNo sirSince you havent found a teacher youre happy with you should undertake and implement this guaranteed teachingFor when the guaranteed teaching is undertaken it will be for your lasting welfare and happinessAnd what is the guaranteed teachingThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewTheres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightAnd there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts thisThere is meaning in giving sacrifice and offerings There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds There is an afterlife There is obligation to mother and father There are beings reborn spontaneously And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightWhat do you think householdersDont these doctrines directly contradict each otherYes sirSince this is so consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is thattheres no meaning in giving etcYou can expect that they will reject good conduct by way of body speech and mind and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body speech and mindWhy is thatBecause those ascetics and brahmins dont see that unskillful qualities are full of drawbacks sordidness and corruption or that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciationMoreover since there actually is another world their view that there is no other world is wrong viewSince there actually is another world their thought that there is no other world is wrong thoughtSince there actually is another world their speech that there is no other world is wrong speechSince there actually is another world in saying that there is no other world they contradict those perfected ones who know the other worldSince there actually is another world in convincing another that there is no other world they are convincing them to accept an untrue teachingAnd on account of that they glorify themselves and put others downSo they give up their former ethical conduct and are established in unethical conductAnd that is how wrong view gives rise to these many bad unskillful qualitieswrong view wrong thought wrong speech contradicting the noble ones convincing others to accept untrue teachings and glorifying oneself and putting others downA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayIf there is no other world when this individuals body breaks up they will keep themselves safeAnd if there is another world when their body breaks up after death they will be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellBut lets assume that those who say that there is no other world are correctRegardless that individual is still criticized by sensible people in the present life as being an immoral individual of wrong view a nihilistBut if there really is another world they lose on both countsFor they are criticized by sensible people in the present life and when their body breaks up after death they will be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThey have wrongly undertaken this guaranteed

undertaken this guaranteed teaching in such a way that it encompasses the positive outcomes of both sides leaving out the unskillful premiseThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine

these four people are found in the worldWhat fourOne person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselvesOne person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying othersOne person mortifies themselves and others committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and othersOne person doesnt mortify either themselves or others committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or othersThey live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesAnd what person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselvesIts when someone goes naked ignoring conventions And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the bodyThis is called a person who mortifies themselves being committed to the practice of mortifying themselvesAnd what person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying othersIts when a person is a butcher of sheep pigs poultry or deer a hunter or fisher a bandit an executioner a butcher of cattle a jailer or has some other cruel livelihoodThis is called a person who mortifies others being committed to the practice of mortifying othersAnd what person mortifies themselves and others being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and othersIts when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a welltodo brahmin His bondservants servants and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful facesThis is called a person who mortifies themselves and others being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and othersAnd what person doesnt mortify either themselves or others committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or othersliving without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place  They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or othersThey live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesWhen he had spoken the brahmins and householders of Sālā said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysWe go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesPrepared ChariotsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundThen several mendicants who had completed the rainy season residence in their native land went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to themIn your native land mendicants which of the native mendicants is esteemed in this wayPersonally having few wishes they speak to the mendicants on having few wishes Personally having contentment seclusion aloofness energy ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedom they speak to the mendicants on all these things Theyre an adviser and instructor one who educates encourages fires up and inspires their spiritual companionsPuṇṇa Mantāṇiputta sir is esteemed in this way in our native landNow at that time Venerable Sāriputta was meditating not far from the BuddhaThen he thoughtPuṇṇa Mantāṇiputta is fortunate so very fortunatein that his sensible spiritual companions praise him point by point in the presence of the Teacher and that the Teacher seconds that appreciationHopefully some time or other Ill get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa and we can have a discussionWhen the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he wished he set out for SāvatthīTraveling stage by stage he arrived at Sāvatthīwhere he stayed in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryPuṇṇa heard that the Buddha had arrived at SāvatthīThen he set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for SāvatthīEventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jetas Grove He went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired him with a Dhamma talkThen having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said Puṇṇa got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he went to the Dark Forest for the days meditationThen a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta and said to himReverend Sāriputta the mendicant named Puṇṇa of whom you have often spoken so highly after being inspired by a talk of the Buddhas left for the Dark Forest for the days meditationSāriputta quickly grabbed his sitting cloth and followed behind Puṇṇa keeping sight of his headPuṇṇa plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree for the days meditationAnd Sāriputta did likewiseThen in the late afternoon Sāriputta came out of retreat went to Puṇṇa and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to PuṇṇaReverend is our spiritual life lived under the BuddhaYes reverendIs the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of ethicsCertainly notThen is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of mindCertainly notIs the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of viewCertainly notThen is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification through overcoming doubtCertainly notIs the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the variety of pathsCertainly notThen is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practiceCertainly notIs the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and visionCertainly notWhen asked each of these questions you answered Certainly notThen what exactly is the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the BuddhaThe purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is extinguishment by not graspingReverend is purification of ethics extinguishment by not graspingCertainly notIs purification of knowledge and vision extinguishment by not graspingCertainly notThen is extinguishment by not grasping something apart from these thingsCertainly notWhen asked each of these questions you answered Certainly notHow then should we see the meaning of this statementIf the Buddha had declared purification of ethics to be extinguishment by not grasping he would have declared that which has grasping to be extinguishment by not grasping If the Buddha had declared purification of knowledge and vision to be extinguishment by not grasping he would have declared that which has grasping to be extinguishment by not graspingBut if extinguishment by not grasping was something apart from these things an ordinary person would become extinguishedFor an ordinary person lacks these thingsWell then reverend I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose that while staying in Sāvatthī King Pasenadi of Kosala had some urgent business come up in SāketaNow between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven prepared chariots were stationed ready for himThen Pasenadi having departed Sāvatthī mounted the first prepared chariot by the gate of the royal compound The first prepared chariot would bring him to the second where hed dismount and mount the second chariotThe second prepared chariot would bring him to the third The third prepared chariot would bring him to the fourth The fourth prepared chariot would bring him to the fifth The fifth prepared chariot would bring him to the sixth The sixth prepared chariot would bring him to the seventh where hed dismount and mount the seventh chariotThe seventh prepared chariot would bring him to the gate of the royal compound of SāketaAnd when he was at the gate friends and colleagues relatives and kin would ask himGreat king did you come to Sāketa from Sāvatthī by this prepared chariotIf asked this how should King Pasenadi rightly replyThe king should replyWell while staying in Sāvatthī I had some urgent business come up in SāketaNow between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven prepared chariots were stationed ready for meThen having departed Sāvatthī I mounted the first prepared chariot by the gate of the royal compoundThe first prepared chariot brought me to the second where I dismounted and mounted the second chariot The sixth prepared chariot brought me to the seventh where I dismounted and mounted the seventh chariotThe seventh prepared chariot brought me to the gate of the royal compound of SāketaThats how King Pasenadi should rightly replyIn the same way reverend purification of ethics is only for the sake of purification of mind Purification of mind is only for the sake of purification of view Purification of view is only for the sake of purification through overcoming doubt Purification through overcoming doubt is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the variety of paths Purification of knowledge and vision of the variety of paths is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice Purification of knowledge and vision of the practice is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision Purification of knowledge and vision is only for the sake of extinguishment by not graspingThe spiritual life is lived under the Buddha for the sake of extinguishment by not graspingWhen he said this Sāriputta said to PuṇṇaWhat is the venerables name And how are you known among your spiritual companionsReverend my name is PuṇṇaAnd I am known as Mantāṇiputta among my spiritual companionsIts incredible reverend its amazingVenerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta has answered each deep question point by point as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teachers instructionsIt is fortunate for his spiritual companions so very fortunatethat they get to see Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta and pay homage to himEven if they only got to see him and pay respects to him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth it would still be very fortunate for them And its fortunate for me so very fortunate that I get to see the venerable and pay homage to himWhen he said this Puṇṇa said to SāriputtaWhat is the venerables name And how are you known among your spiritual companionsReverend my name is UpatissaAnd I am known as Sāriputta among my spiritual companionsGoodness I had no idea I was consulting with the Venerable Sāriputta the disciple who is fit to be compared with the Teacher himselfIf Id known I wouldnt have said so muchIts incredible reverend its amazingVenerable Sāriputta has asked each deep question point by point as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teachers instructionsIt is fortunate for his spiritual companions so very fortunatethat they get to see Venerable Sāriputta and pay homage to himEven if they only got to see him and pay respects to him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth it would still be very fortunate for them And its fortunate for me so very fortunate that I get to see the venerable and pay homage to himAnd so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others fine wordsMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse on the Mass of SufferingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree MonasteryThen Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himFor a long time sir I have understood your teaching like thisGreed hate and delusion are corruptions of the mindDespite understanding this sometimes my mind is occupied by thoughts of greed hate and delusionI wonder what qualities remain in me that I have such thoughtsMahānāma there is a quality that remains in you that makes you have such thoughtsFor if you had given up that quality you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensual pleasuresBut because you havent given up that quality you are still living at home and enjoying sensual pleasuresSensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksEven though a noble disciple has clearly seen this with right wisdom so long as they dont achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities or something even more peaceful than thatthey might still return to sensual pleasuresBut when they do achieve that rapture and bliss or something more peaceful than thatthey will not return to sensual pleasuresBefore my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI too clearly saw with right wisdom thatSensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksBut so long as I didnt achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities or something even more peaceful than thatI didnt announce that I would not return to sensual pleasuresBut when I did achieve that rapture and bliss or something more peaceful than thatI announced that I would not return to sensual pleasuresAnd what is the gratification of sensual pleasuresThere are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationThe pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation this is the gratification of sensual pleasuresAnd what is the drawback of sensual pleasuresIts when a gentleman earns a living by means such ascomputing accounting calculating farming trade raising cattle archery government service or one of the professionsBut they must face cold and heat being hurt by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles and risking death from hunger and thirstThis is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasuresThat gentleman might try hard strive and make an effort but fail to earn any moneyIf this happens they sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusion saying Oh my hard work is wasted My efforts are fruitlessThis too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasuresThat gentleman might try hard strive and make an effort and succeed in earning moneyBut they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it thinkingHow can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits consumed by fire swept away by flood or taken by unloved heirsAnd even though they protect it and ward it rulers or bandits take it or fire consumes it or flood sweeps it away or unloved heirs take itThey sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionWhat used to be mine is goneThis too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasuresFurthermore for the sake of sensual pleasures kings fight with kings aristocrats fight with

Vultures Peak MountainNow at that time several Jain ascetics on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock were constantly standing refusing seats And they felt painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionThen in the late afternoon I came out of retreat and went to the Black Rock to visit those Jain ascetics I said to themReverends why are you constantly standing refusing seats so that you suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionWhen I said this those Jain ascetics said to meReverend the Jain leader Nātaputta claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thusKnowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and wakingO Jain ascetics you have done bad deeds in a past life Wear them away with these severe and grueling austeritiesAnd when you refrain from such deeds in the present by way of body speech and mind youre not doing any bad deeds for the futureSo due to eliminating past deeds by mortification and not doing any new deeds theres nothing to come up in the futureWith nothing to come up in the future deeds end With the ending of deeds suffering ends With the ending of suffering feeling ends And with the ending of feeling all suffering will have been worn awayWe like and accept this and we are satisfied with itWhen they said this I said to themBut reverends do you knowfor sure that you existed in the past and it is not the case that you didnt existNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowfor sure that you did bad deeds in the pastNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowthat you did such and such bad deedsNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowthat so much suffering has already been worn away Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn awayNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowabout giving up unskillful qualities in the present life and embracing skillful qualitiesNo we dont reverendSo it seems that you dont know any of these thingsThat being so when those in the world who are violent and bloodyhanded and make their living by cruelty are reborn among humans they go forth as Jain asceticsReverend Gotama pleasure is not gained through pleasure pleasure is gained through painFor if pleasure were to be gained through pleasure King Seniya Bimbisāra of Māgadha would gain pleasure since he lives in greater pleasure than Venerable GotamaClearly the venerables have spoken rashly without reflectionRather Im the one who should be asked aboutwho lives in greater pleasure King Bimbisāra or Venerable GotamaClearly we spoke rashly and without reflectionBut forget about that Now we ask Venerable GotamaWho lives in greater pleasure King Bimbisāra or Venerable GotamaWell then reverends Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think reverendsIs King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing perfect happiness for seven days and nights without moving his body or speakingNo he is not reverendWhat do you think reverendsIs King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing perfect happiness for six days five days four days three days two days No he is not reverendBut I am capable of experiencing perfect happiness for one day and night without moving my body or speakingI am capable of experiencing perfect happiness for two days three days four days five days six days seven daysWhat do you think reverends This being so who lives in greater pleasure King Bimbisāra or IThis being so Venerable Gotama lives in greater pleasure than King BimbisāraThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Mahānāma the Sakyan was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree MonasteryNow at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at allThen the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at allMay the Buddha be the first to use it and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use itThat would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of KapilavatthuThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented the Sakyans got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right Then they went to the new town hall where they spread carpets all over prepared seats set up a water jar and placed a lamp Then they went back to the Buddhabowed stood to one sideand told him of their preparations sayingPlease sir come at your convenienceThen the Buddha robed up and taking his bowl and robe went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing eastThe Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the west wall facing east with the Buddha right in front of themThe Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the east wall facing west with the Buddha right in front of themThe Buddha spent most of the night educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk Then he addressed Venerable nandananda speak about the practicing trainee to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu as you feel inspiredMy back is soreIll stretch itYes sir nanda repliedAnd then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting upThen nanda addressed Mahānāma the SakyanMahānāma a noble disciple is accomplished in ethics guards the sense doors eats in moderation and is dedicated to wakefulness They have seven good qualities and they get the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present

When they smell an odor with their nose When they taste a flavor with their tongue When they feel a touch with their body When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the

noble disciple has seven good qualitiesAnd how does a noble disciple get the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen they want without trouble or difficultyIts when a noble disciple quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption second absorption third absorption fourth

present life that belong to the higher mindwhen they want without trouble or difficulty they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee Their eggs are unspoiled and they are capable of breaking out of their shell becoming awakened and achieving the supreme sanctuarySuppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated Even if that chicken doesnt wishIf only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safelyStill they can break out and hatch safelyIn the same way when a noble disciple is practicing all these things they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee Their eggs are unspoiled and they are capable of breaking out of their shell becoming awakened and achieving the supreme sanctuaryRelying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past livesThat is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding  And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis is their first breaking out like a chick from an eggshellRelying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity

accomplished in knowledge and conductis first among gods and humansAnd that verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra not poorly sung well spoken not poorly spoken beneficial not harmful and it was approved by the BuddhaThen the Buddha got up and said to Venerable nandaGood good nandaIts good that you spoke to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the practicing traineeThis is what Venerable nanda saidand the teacher approvedSatisfied the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu were happy with what Venerable nanda saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter ClassificationSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundThen the layman Visākha went to see the nun Dhammadinnā bowed sat down to one side and said to herMaam they speak of this thing called identityWhat is this identity that the Buddha spoke ofVisākha the Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are identityThat is form feeling perception choices and consciousnessThe Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are identitySaying Good maam Visākha approved and agreed with what Dhammadinnā said Then he asked another questionMaam they speak of this thing called the origin of identityWhat is the origin of identity that the Buddha spoke ofIts the craving that leads to future rebirth mixed up with relishing and greed taking pleasure in various different realms That iscraving for sensual pleasures craving to continue existence and craving to end existenceThe Buddha said that this is the origin of identityMaam they speak of this thing called the cessation of identityWhat is the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke ofIts the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over giving it away letting it go releasing it and not adhering to itThe Buddha said that this is the cessation of identityMaam they speak of the practice that leads to the cessation of identityWhat is the practice that leads to the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke ofThe practice that leads to the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke of is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionBut maam is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates anotherThat grasping is not the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates Nor is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates anotherThe desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping thereBut maam how does identity view come aboutIts when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good personsThey regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in formThey regard feeling consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousnessThats how identity view comes aboutBut maam how does identity view not come aboutIts when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good personsThey dont regard form as self self as having form form in self or self in formThey dont regard feeling perception consciousness as self self as having consciousness consciousness in self or self in consciousnessThats how identity view does not come aboutBut maam what is the noble eightfold pathIt is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionBut maam is the noble eightfold path conditioned or unconditionedThe noble eightfold path is conditionedAre the three practice categories included in the noble eightfold path Or is the noble eightfold path included in the three practice categoriesThe three practice categories are not included in the noble eightfold path Rather the noble eightfold path is included in the three practice categoriesRight speech right action and right livelihood these things are included in the category of ethicsRight effort right mindfulness and right immersion these things are included in the category of immersionRight view and right thought these things are included in the category of wisdomBut maam what is immersion What things are the foundations of immersion What things are the prerequisites for immersion What is the development of immersionUnification of the mind is immersionThe four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the foundations of immersionThe four right efforts are the prerequisites for immersionThe cultivation development and making much of these very same things is the development of immersionHow many processes are thereThere are these three processesPhysical verbal and mental processesBut maam what is the physical process Whats the verbal process Whats the mental processBreathing is a physical process Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes Perception and feeling are mental processesBut maam why is breathing a physical process Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes Why are perception and feeling mental processesBreathing is physical Its tied up with the body thats why breathing is a physical processFirst you place the mind and keep it connected then you break into speech Thats why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processesPerception and feeling are mental Theyre tied up with the mind thats why perception and feeling are mental processesBut maam how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feelingA mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not thinkI will enter the cessation of perception and feeling or I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling or I have entered the cessation of perception and feelingRather their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a stateBut maam which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling physical verbal or mental processesVerbal processes cease first then physical then mentalBut maam how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feelingA mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not thinkI will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling or I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling or I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feelingRather their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a stateBut maam which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling physical verbal or mental processesMental processes arise first then physical then verbalBut maam when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling how many kinds of contact do they experienceThey experience three kinds of contact emptiness signless and undirected contactsBut maam when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling what does their mind slant slope and incline toTheir mind slants slopes and inclines to seclusionBut maam how many feelings are thereThere are three feelingspleasant painful and neutral feelingWhat are these three feelingsAnything felt physically or mentally as pleasant or enjoyableThis is pleasant feelingAnything felt physically or mentally as painful or unpleasantThis is painful feelingAnything felt physically or mentally as neither pleasurable nor painfulThis is neutral feelingWhat is pleasant and what is painful in each of the three feelingsPleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it perishesPainful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when it perishesNeutral feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge and painful when there is ignoranceWhat underlying tendencies underlie each of the three feelingsThe underlying tendency for greed underlies pleasant feeling The underlying tendency for repulsion underlies painful feeling The underlying tendency for ignorance underlies neutral feelingDo these underlying tendencies always underlie these feelingsNo they do notWhat should be given up in regard to each of these three feelingsThe underlying tendency to greed should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling The underlying tendency to repulsion should be given up when it comes to painful feeling The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neutral feelingShould these underlying tendencies be given up regarding all instances of these feelingsNo not in all instancesTake a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedWith this they give up greed and the underlying tendency to greed does not lie within thatAnd take a mendicant who reflectsOh when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in todayNursing such a longing for the supreme liberations gives rise to sadness due to longingWith this they give up repulsion and the underlying tendency to repulsion does not lie within thatTake a mendicant who giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessWith this they give up ignorance and the underlying tendency to ignorance does not lie within thatBut maam what is the counterpart of pleasant feelingPainful feelingWhat is the counterpart of painful feelingPleasant feelingWhat is the counterpart of neutral feelingIgnoranceWhat is the counterpart of ignoranceKnowledgeWhat is the counterpart of knowledgeFreedomWhat is the counterpart of freedomExtinguishmentWhat is the counterpart of extinguishmentYour question goes too far Visākha You couldnt figure out the limit of questionsFor extinguishment is the culmination destination and end of the spiritual lifeIf you wish go to the Buddha and ask him this question You should remember it in line with his answerAnd then the layman Visākha approved and agreed with what the nun Dhammadinnā said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled her keeping her on his right Then he went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one sideand informed the Buddha of all they had discussedWhen he had spoken the Buddha said to himThe nun Dhammadinnā is astute Visākha she has great wisdomIf you came to me and asked this question I would answer it in exactly the same way as the nun DhammadinnāThat is what it means and thats how you should remember itThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the layman Visākha was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Great Discourse on Taking Up PracticesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants sentient beings typically have the wish desire and hopeOh if only unlikable undesirable and disagreeable things would decrease and likable desirable and agreeable things would increaseBut exactly the opposite happens to themWhat do you take to be the reason for thisOur teachings are rooted in the BuddhaHe is our guide and our refuge Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember itWell then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisTake an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good personsThey dont know what practices they should cultivate and foster and what practices they shouldnt cultivate and fosterSo they cultivate and foster practices they shouldnt and dont cultivate and foster practices they shouldWhen they do so unlikable undesirable and disagreeable things increase and likable desirable and agreeable things decreaseWhy is thatBecause thats what its like for someone who doesnt knowBut an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good personsThey know what practices they should cultivate and foster and what practices they shouldnt cultivate and fosterSo they cultivate and foster practices they should and dont cultivate and foster practices they shouldntWhen they do so unlikable undesirable and

way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasureThere is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasureWhen it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain an ignoramus without knowing this doesnt truly understandThis is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future

now and results in future pleasureSo instead of avoiding that practice they cultivate itWhen they do so unlikable undesirable and disagreeable things decrease and likable desirable and agreeable things increaseWhy is thatBecause thats what its like for someone who knowsAnd what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future painIts when someone in pain and sadness kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong view Because of these things they experience pain and sadnessAnd when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThis is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future painAnd what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future painIts when someone with pleasure and happiness kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong view Because of these things they experience pleasure and happinessBut when

or nonsensical And theyre contented kindhearted with right view Because of these things they experience pleasure and happinessAnd when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmThis is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasureThese are the four ways of taking up practicesSuppose there was some bitter gourd mixed with poisonThen a man would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from painTheyd say to himHere mister this is bitter gourd mixed with poisonDrink it if you likeIf you drink it the color aroma and flavor will be unappetizing and it will result in death or deadly painHe wouldnt reject it Without reflection hed drink itThe color aroma and flavor would be unappetizing and it would result in death or deadly painThis is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain I saySuppose there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color aroma and flavorBut it was mixed with poisonThen a man would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from painTheyd say to himHere mister this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color aroma and flavorBut its mixed with poisonDrink it if you likeIf you drink it the color aroma and flavor will be appetizing but it will result in death or deadly painHe wouldnt reject it Without reflection hed drink itThe color aroma and flavor would be appetizing but it would result in death or deadly painThis is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pain I saySuppose there was some fermented urine mixed with different medicinesThen a man with jaundice would come alongTheyd say to himHere mister this is fermented urine mixed with different medicines Drink it if you likeIf you drink it the color aroma and flavor will be unappetizing but after drinking it you will be happyHe wouldnt reject it After appraisal hed drink itThe color aroma and flavor would be unappetizing but after drinking it he would be happyThis is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pleasure I saySuppose there was some curds honey ghee and molasses all mixed togetherThen a man with dysentery would come alongTheyd say to himHere mister this is curds honey ghee and molasses all mixed together Drink it if you likeIf you drink it the color aroma and flavor will be appetizing and after drinking it you will be happyHe wouldnt reject it After appraisal hed drink itThe color aroma and flavor would be appetizing and after drinking it he would be happyThis is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure I sayIts like the time after the rainy season when the sky is clear and cloudless And when the sun rises it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiatesIn the same way this way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure dispels the doctrines of the various other ascetics and brahmins as it shines and glows and radiatesThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Five and ThreeSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants there are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future and assert various hypotheses concerning the futureSome propose this The self is percipient and is sound after deathSome propose this The self is nonpercipient and is sound after deathSome propose this The self is neither percipient nor nonpercipient and is sound after deathBut some assert the annihilation eradication and obliteration of an existing being while others propose extinguishment in the present lifeThus they assert an existent self that is sound after death or they assert the annihilation of an existing being or they propose extinguishment in the present lifeIn this way five become three and three become fiveThis is the passage for recitation of the five and threeNow the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death describe it as having form or being formless or both having form and being formless or neither having form nor being formless Or they describe it as of unified perception or of diverse perception or of limited perception or of limitless perception Or some among those who go beyond this propose universal consciousness limitless and imperturbableThe Realized One understands this as followsThere are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death describing it as having form or being formless or both having form and being formless or neither having form nor being formless Or they describe it as of unified perception or of diverse perception or of limited perception or of limitless perceptionOr some aware that there is nothing at all propose the dimension of nothingness limitless and imperturbable They declare that this is the purest highest best and supreme of all those perceptions whether of form or of formlessness or of unity or of diversityAll that is conditioned and coarse But there is the cessation of conditionsthat is realUnderstanding thus and seeing the escape from it the Realized One has gone beyond all thatNow the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is nonpercipient and sound after death describe it as having form or being formless or both having form and being formless or neither having form nor being formlessSo they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and sound after deathWhy is thatBecause they believe that perception is a disease a boil a dart and that the state of nonperception is peaceful and sublimeThe Realized One understands this as followsThere are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is nonpercipient and sound after death describing it as having form or being formless or both having form and being formless or neither having form nor being formlessBut if any ascetic or brahmin should say thisApart from form feeling perception and choices I will describe the coming and going of consciousness its passing away and reappearing its growth increase and maturityThat is not possibleAll that is conditioned and coarse But there is the cessation of conditionsthat is realUnderstanding this and seeing the escape from it the Realized One has gone beyond all thatNow the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor nonpercipient and sound after death describe it as having form or being formless or both having form and being formless or neither having form nor being formlessSo they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death as well as those who assert a self that is nonpercipient and sound after deathWhy is thatBecause they believe that perception is a disease a boil a dart and that the state of neither perception nor nonperception is peaceful and sublimeThe Realized One understands this as followsThere are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor nonpercipient and sound after death describing it as having form or being formless or both having form and being formless or neither having form nor being formlessSome ascetics or brahmins assert the embracing of that dimension merely through the conditioned phenomena of what is seen heard thought and known But that is said to be a disastrous approachFor that dimension is said to be not attainable by means of conditioned phenomenabut only with a residue of conditioned phenomenaAll that is conditioned and coarse But there is the cessation of conditionsthat is realUnderstanding this and seeing the escape from it the Realized One has gone beyond all thatNow the ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation eradication and obliteration of an existing being reject those who assert a self that is sound after death whether percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nonpercipientWhy is thatBecause all of those ascetics and brahmins only assert their attachment to moving up to a higher realmAfter death we shall be like this After death we shall be like thatSuppose a trader was going to market thinkingWith this that shall be mine This way I shall get thatIn the same way those ascetics and brahmins seem to be like traders when they sayAfter death we shall be like this After death we shall be like thatThe Realized One understands this as followsThe ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation eradication and obliteration of an existing being from fear and disgust with identity they just keep running and circling around identitySuppose a dog on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar It would just keeping running and circling around that post or pillarIn the same way those ascetics and brahmins from fear and disgust with identity just keep running and circling around identityAll that is conditioned and coarse But there is the cessation of conditionsthat is realUnderstanding this and seeing the escape from it the Realized One has gone beyond all thatWhatever ascetics and brahmins theorize about the future and propose various hypotheses concerning the future all of them propose one or other of these five thesesThere are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past and propose various hypotheses concerning the past They propose the following each insisting that theirs is the only truth and that everything else is wrongThe self and the cosmos are eternalThe self and the cosmos are not eternalThe self and the cosmos are both eternal and not eternalThe self and the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternalThe self and the cosmos are finiteThe self and the cosmos are infiniteThe self and the cosmos are both finite and infiniteThe self and the cosmos are neither finite nor infiniteThe self and the cosmos are unified in perceptionThe self and the cosmos are diverse in perceptionThe self and the cosmos have limited perceptionThe self and the cosmos have limitless perceptionThe self and the cosmos experience nothing but happinessThe self and the cosmos experience nothing but sufferingThe self and the cosmos experience both happiness and sufferingThe self and the cosmos experience neither happiness nor sufferingNow consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as followsThe self and the cosmos are eternal This is the only truth other ideas are silly Its simply not possible for them to have purified and clear personal knowledge of this apart from faith preference oral tradition reasoned contemplation or acceptance of a view after considerationAnd in the absence of such knowledge even the partial knowledge that they are clear about is said to be grasping on their partAll that is conditioned and coarse But there is the cessation of conditionsthat is realUnderstanding this and seeing the

rapture of seclusionThis is peaceful this is sublime that is entering and remaining in the rapture of seclusionBut that rapture of seclusion of theirs ceasesWhen the rapture of seclusion ceases sadness arises and when sadness ceases the rapture of seclusion arisesIts like how the sunlight fills the space when the shadow leaves or the shadow fills the space when the sunshine leavesIn the same way when the rapture of seclusion ceases sadness arises and when sadness ceases the rapture of seclusion arisesThe Realized One understands this as followsThis good ascetic or brahmin letting go of

shedding the fetters of sensuality goes beyond the rapture of seclusion spiritual bliss and neutral feelingThey regard themselves like this I am at peace I am extinguished I am free of graspingClearly this venerable speaks of a practice thats conducive to extinguishmentNevertheless they still grasp at theories about the past or the future or the fetters of sensuality or the rapture of seclusion or spiritual bliss or neutral feelingAnd when they regard themselves like thisI am at peace I am extinguished I am free of grasping thats also said to be grasping on their partAll that is conditioned and

state of sublime peace that isliberation by not grasping after truly understanding these six sense fields origin ending gratification drawback and escapeThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith AṅgulimālaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time in the realm of King Pasenadi of Kosala there was a bandit named Aṅgulimāla He was violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beingsHe laid waste to villages towns and countriesHe was constantly murdering people and he wore their fingers as a necklaceThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsThen after the meal on his return from almsround he set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe he walked down the road that led to AṅgulimālaThe cowherds shepherds farmers and travelers saw him on the roadand said to himDont take this road asceticOn this road there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla He is violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beingsHe has laid waste to villages towns and countriesHe is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a necklacePeople travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten twenty thirty forty or fiftyStill they meet their end by Aṅgulimālas handBut when they said this the Buddha went on in silenceFor a second time and a third time they urged the Buddha to turn backBut when they said this the Buddha went on in silenceThe bandit Aṅgulimāla saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceand thoughtIts incredible its amazingPeople travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten twenty thirty forty or fiftyStill they meet their end by my handBut still this ascetic comes along alone and unaccompanied like he had beaten me alreadyWhy dont I take his lifeThen Aṅgulimāla donned his sword and shield fastened his bow and arrows and followed behind the BuddhaBut the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Aṅgulimāla could not catch up with him no matter how hard he tried even though the Buddha kept walking at a normal speedThen Aṅgulimāla thoughtIts incredible its amazingPreviously even when Ive chased a speeding elephant horse chariot or deer Ive always caught up with themBut I cant catch up with this ascetic no matter how hard I try even though hes walking at a normal speedHe stood still and saidStop stop asceticIve stopped Aṅgulimālanow you stopThen Aṅgulimāla thoughtThese Sakyan ascetics speak the truthYet while walking the ascetic Gotama saysIve stopped Aṅgulimālanow you stopWhy dont I ask him about thisThen he addressed the Buddha in verseWhile walking ascetic you say Ive stoppedAnd I have stopped but you tell me Ive notIm asking you this ascetichow is it youve stopped and I have notAṅgulimāla I have forever stoppedIve laid aside violence towards all creaturesBut you cant stop yourself from harming living creaturesthats why Ive stopped but you have notOh at long last a hermita great sage who I honor has entered this great forestNow that Ive heard your verse on DhammaI shall live without evilWith these words the bandit hurled his sword and weaponsdown a cliff into a chasmHe venerated the Holy Ones feetand asked him for the going forth right awayThen the Buddha the compassionate great hermitthe teacher of the world with its godssaid to him Come monkAnd with that he became a monkThen the Buddha set out for Sāvatthī with Venerable Aṅgulimāla as his second monkTraveling stage by stage he arrived at Sāvatthīwhere he stayed in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time a crowd had gathered by the gate of King Pasenadis royal compound making a dreadful racketIn your realm Your Majesty there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla He is violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beingsHe has laid waste to villages towns and countriesHe is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a necklaceYour Majesty must put a stop to himThen King Pasenadi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day with around five hundred horsesheading for the monasteryHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the Buddha on footHe bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to himWhat is it great king Is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha angry with you or the Licchavis of Vesālī or some other opposing rulerIn my realm there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla He is violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beings I shall put a stop to himBut great king suppose you were to see that Aṅgulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness And that he was refraining from killing living creatures stealing and lying that he was eating in one part of the day and was celibate ethical and of good character What would you do to himI would bow to him rise in his presence or offer him a seat Id invite him to accept robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick And Id organize his lawful guarding and protectionBut sir how could such an immoral evil man ever have such virtue and restraintNow at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla was sitting not far from the BuddhaThen the Buddha pointed with his right arm and said to the kingGreat king this is AṅgulimālaThen the king became frightened scared his hair standing on endKnowing this the Buddha said to himDo not fear great king You have nothing to fear from himThen the kings fear died downThen the king went over to Aṅgulimāla and saidSir is the venerable really AṅgulimālaYes great kingWhat clans were your father and mother fromMy father was a Gagga and my mother a MantāṇīMay the venerable Gagga Mantāṇīputta be happyIll make sure that youre provided with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickBut at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla lived in the wilderness ate only almsfood and owned just three robesSo he said to the kingEnough great king My robes are completeThen the king went back to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himIts incredible sir its amazingHow the Buddha tames those who are wild pacifies those who are violent and extinguishes those who are unextinguishedFor I was not able to tame him with the rod and the sword but the Buddha tamed him without rod or swordWell now sir I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease great king go at your convenienceThen King Pasenadi got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingThen Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsThen as he was wandering indiscriminately for almsfood he saw a woman undergoing a painful obstructed laborSeeing this it occurred to himOh beings suffer such filthOh beings suffer such filthThen after wandering for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedThe Buddha said to himWell then Aṅgulimāla go to that woman and say thisEver since I was born sister I dont recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature By this truth may both you and your baby be safeBut sir wouldnt that be telling a deliberate lieFor I have intentionally killed many living creaturesIn that case Aṅgulimāla go to that woman and say thisEver since I was born in the noble birth sister I dont recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature By this truth may both you and your baby be safeYes sir replied Aṅgulimāla He went to that woman and saidEver since I was born in the noble birth sister I dont recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature By this truth may both you and your baby be safeThen that woman was safe and so was her babyThen Aṅgulimāla living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Aṅgulimāla became one of the perfectedThen Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsNow at that time someone threw a stone that hit Aṅgulimāla someone else threw a stick and someone else threw gravelThen Aṅgulimālawith cracked head bleeding his bowl broken and his outer robe tornwent to the BuddhaThe Buddha saw him coming off in the distanceand said to himEndure it brahmin Endure it brahminYoure experiencing in this life the result of deeds that might have caused you to be tormented in hell for many years many hundreds or thousands of yearsLater Venerable Aṅgulimāla was experiencing the bliss of release while in private retreatOn that occasion he expressed this heartfelt sentimentHe who once was heedlessbut turned to heedfulnesslights up the worldlike the moon freed from a cloudSomeone whose bad deedis supplanted by the goodlights up the worldlike the moon freed from a cloudA young mendicantdevoted to the Buddhas teachinglights up the worldlike the moon freed from a cloudMay even my enemies hear a Dhamma talkMay even my enemies devote themselves to the Buddhas teachingMay even my enemies associate with those good peoplewho establish others in the DhammaMay even my enemies hear Dhamma at the right timefrom those who speak on acceptancepraising acquiescenceand may they follow

youre diligent and practice absorptionyoull attain abundant happinessIt was welcome not unwelcomethe advice I got was goodOf teachings that are sharedI encountered the bestIt was welcome not unwelcomethe advice I got was goodIve attained the three knowledgesand fulfilled the Buddhas instructionsMiddle DiscoursesThe InquirerSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants a mendicant who is an inquirer unable to comprehend anothers mind should scrutinize the Realized One to see whether he is a fully awakened Buddha or notOur teachings are rooted in the Buddha He is our guide and our refuge Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember itWell then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants a mendicant who is an inquirer unable to comprehend anothers mind should scrutinize the Realized One for two thingsthings that can be seen and heardCan anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or notScrutinizing him they find thatnothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized OneThey scrutinize furtherCan anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or notScrutinizing him they find thatnothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized OneThey scrutinize furtherCan anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or notScrutinizing him they find thatclean things can be seen and heard in the Realized OneThey scrutinize furtherDid the venerable attain this skillful state a long time ago or just recentlyScrutinizing him they find thatthe venerable attained this skillful state a long time ago not just recentlyThey scrutinize furtherAre certain dangers found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renownFor mendicants so long as a mendicant has not achieved fame and renown certain dangers are not found in themBut when they achieve fame and renown those dangers appearScrutinizing him they find thatthose dangers are not found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renownThey scrutinize furtherIs this venerable securely stopped or insecurely stoppedIs the reason they dont indulge in sensual pleasures that theyre free of greed because greed has endedScrutinizing him they find thatthat venerable is securely stopped not insecurely stoppedThe reason they dont indulge in sensual pleasures is that theyre free of greed because greed has endedIf others should ask that mendicantBut what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying thisAnswering rightly the mendicant should sayBecause whether that venerable is staying in a community or alone some people there are in a good state or a sorry state some instruct a group and some indulge in material pleasures while others remain unsullied Yet that venerable doesnt look down on them for thatAlso I have heard and learned this in the presence of the BuddhaI am securely stopped not insecurely stopped The reason I dont indulge in sensual pleasures is that Im free of greed because greed has endedNext they should ask the Realized One himself about thisCan anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or notThe Realized One would answerNothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized OneCan anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or notThe Realized One would answerNothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized OneCan anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or notThe Realized One would answerClean things can be seen and heard in the Realized OneI am that range and that territory but I do not identify with thatA disciple ought to approach a teacher who has such a doctrine in order to listen to the teachingThe teacher explains Dhamma with its higher and higher stages with its better and better stages with its dark and bright sidesWhen they directly know a certain principle of those teachings in accordance with how they were taught the mendicant comes to a conclusion about the teachings They have confidence in the teacherThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellIf others should ask that mendicantBut what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying thisAnswering rightly the mendicant should sayReverends I approached the Buddha to listen to the teachingHe explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages with its better and better stages with its dark and bright sidesWhen I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings in accordance with how I was taught I came to a conclusion about the teachings I had confidence in the TeacherThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellWhen someones faith is settled rooted and planted in the Realized One in this manner with these words and phrases its said to be grounded faith thats based on evidenceIt is firm and cannot be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the worldThis is how to scrutinize the Realized Ones qualitiesBut the Realized One has already been properly searched in this way by natureThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith Moggallāna the AccountantSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras motherThen the brahmin Moggallāna the Accountant went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama in this stilt longhouse we can see gradual progressdown to the last step of the staircaseAmong the brahmins we can see gradual progressAmong archers we can see gradual progressAmong us accountants who earn a living by accounting we can see gradual progressFor when we get an apprentice we first make them countOne one two twos three threes four fours five fives six sixes seven sevens eight eights nine nines ten tensWe even make them count up to a hundredIs it possible to similarly describe a gradual training gradual progress and gradual practice in this teaching and trainingIt is possible brahminSuppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred First of all hed make it get used to wearing the bitIn the same way when the Realized One gets a person for training they first guide them like thisCome mendicant be ethical and restrained in the monastic code conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault keep the rules youve undertakenWhen they have ethical conduct the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant guard your sense doors When you see a sight with your eyes dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason practice restraint protect the faculty of sight and achieve restraint over itWhen you hear a sound with your ears When you smell an odor with your nose When you taste a flavor with your tongue When you feel a touch with your body When you know a thought with your mind dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason practice restraint protect the faculty of mind and achieve its restraintWhen they guard their sense doors the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant eat in moderationReflect properly on the food that you eatNot for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice In this way I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and I will live blamelessly and at easeWhen they eat in moderation the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant be committed to wakefulness Practice walking and sitting meditation by day purifying your mind from obstacles In the evening continue to practice walking and sitting meditation In the middle of the night lie down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up In the last part of the night get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation purifying your mind from obstaclesWhen they are committed to wakefulness the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant have mindfulness and situational awareness Act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silentWhen they have mindfulness and situational awareness the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawAnd they do soAfter the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right thereGiving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desireGiving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill willGiving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsinessGiving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorseGiving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtThey give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissGiving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThats how I instruct the mendicants who are traineeswho havent achieved their hearts desire but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuaryBut for those mendicants who are perfectedwho have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenmentthese things lead to blissful meditation in the present life and to mindfulness and awarenessWhen he had spoken Moggallāna the Accountant said to the BuddhaWhen his disciples are instructed and advised like this by Master Gotama do all of them achieve the ultimate goal extinguishment or do some of them failSome succeed while others failWhat is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why though extinguishment is present the path leading to extinguishment is present and Master Gotama is present to encourage themstill some succeed while others failWell then brahmin Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think brahminAre you skilled in the road to RājagahaYes I amWhat do you think brahminSuppose a person was to come along who wanted to go to RājagahaHed approach you and saySir I wish to go to RājagahaPlease point out the road to RājagahaThen youd say to themHere mister this road goes to RājagahaGo along it for a while and youll see a certain village Go along a while further and youll see a certain townGo along a while further and youll see Rājagaha with its delightful parks woods meadows and lotus pondsInstructed like this by you they might still take the wrong road heading westBut a second person might come with the same question and receive the same instructionsInstructed by you they might safely arrive at RājagahaWhat is the cause brahmin what is the reason why though Rājagaha is present the path leading to Rājagaha is present and you are there to encourage themone person takes the wrong path and heads west while another arrives safely at RājagahaWhat can I do about that Master GotamaI am the one who shows the wayIn the same way though extinguishment is present the path leading to extinguishment is present and I am present to encourage themstill some of my disciples instructed and advised like this achieve the ultimate goal extinguishment while some of them failWhat can I do about that brahminThe Realized One is the one who shows the wayWhen he had spoken Moggallāna the Accountant said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood Theyre devious deceitful and sneaky Theyre restless insolent fickle scurrilous and loosetongued They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation and they are not committed to wakefulness They dont care about the ascetic life and dont keenly respect the training Theyre indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion lazy and lacking energy Theyre unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying minds witless and stupid Master Gotama doesnt live together with theseBut there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith Theyre not devious deceitful and sneaky Theyre not restless insolent fickle scurrilous and loosetongued They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation and they are committed to wakefulness They care about the ascetic life and keenly respect the training Theyre not indulgent or slack nor are they leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion Theyre energetic and determined Theyre mindful with situational awareness immersion and unified minds wise not stupid Master Gotama does live together with theseOf all kinds of fragrant root spikenard is said to be the bestOf all kinds of fragrant heartwood red sandalwood is said to be the bestOf all kinds of fragrant flower jasmine is said to be the bestIn the same way Master Gotamas advice is the best of contemporary teachingsExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesAll the DefilementsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants I will teach you the explanation of the restraint of all defilementsListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees not for one who does not know or seeFor one who knows and sees whatProper attention and improper attentionWhen you pay improper attention defilements arise and once arisen they growWhen you pay proper attention defilements dont arise and those that have already arisen are given upSome defilements should be given up by seeing some by restraint some by using some by enduring some by avoiding some by dispelling and some by developingDefilements Given Up by SeeingAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by seeingTake an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good personsThey dont understand to which things they should pay attention and to which things they should not pay attentionSo they pay attention to things they shouldnt and dont pay attention to things they shouldAnd what are the things to which they pay attention but should notThey are the things that when attention is paid to them give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow the defilements of sensual desiredesire to be rebornand ignoranceThese are the things to which they pay attention but should notAnd what are the things to which they do not pay attention but shouldThey are the things that when attention is paid to them do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements the defilements of sensual desiredesire to be rebornand ignoranceThese are the things to which they do not pay attention but shouldBecause of paying attention to what

attend improperly in this way one of the following six views arises in them and is taken as a genuine factThe view My self exists in an absolute senseThe view My self does not exist in an absolute senseThe view I perceive the self with the selfThe view I perceive what is notself with the selfThe view I perceive the self with what is notselfOr they have such a viewThis self of mine is he who speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms This self is permanent everlasting eternal and imperishable and will last forever and everThis is called a misconception the thicket of views the desert of views the trick of views the evasiveness of views the fetter of viewsAn uneducated ordinary person who is fettered by views is not freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressTheyre not freed from suffering I sayBut take an educated noble disciple who has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good personsThey understand to which things they should pay attention and to which things they should not pay attentionSo they pay attention to things they should and dont pay attention to things they shouldntAnd what are the things to which they dont pay attention and should notThey are the things that when attention is paid to them give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow the defilements of sensual desiredesire to be rebornand ignoranceThese are the things to which they dont pay attention and should notAnd what are the things to which they do pay attention and shouldThey are the things that when attention is paid to them do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements the defilements of sensual desiredesire to be rebornand ignoranceThese are the things to which they do pay attention and shouldBecause of not paying attention to what they should not and paying attention to what they should unarisen defilements dont arise and arisen defilements are given upThey properly attend This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingAnd as they do so they give up three fettersidentity view doubt and misapprehension of precepts and observancesThese are called the defilements that should be given up by seeingDefilements Given Up by RestraintAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by restraintTake a mendicant who reflecting properly lives restraining the faculty of the eyeFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not

partsReflecting properly they make use of almsfoodNot for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice In this way I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and I will live blamelessly and at easeReflecting properly they make use of lodgingsOnly for the sake of warding off cold and heat for

are usedThese are called the defilements that should be given up by usingDefilements Given Up by EnduringAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by enduringTake a mendicant who reflecting properly endures cold heat hunger and thirstThey endure the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles They endure rude and unwelcome criticism And they put up with physical painsharp severe acute unpleasant disagreeable and lifethreateningFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are enduredThese are called the defilements that should be given up by enduringDefilements Given Up by AvoidingAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by avoidingTake a mendicant who

arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoidedThese are called the defilements that should be given up by avoidingDefilements Given Up by DispellingAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by dispellingTake a mendicant who reflecting properly doesnt tolerate a sensual malicious or cruel thought that has arisen but gives it up gets rid of it eliminates it and obliterates it They dont tolerate any bad unskillful qualities that have arisen but give them up get rid of them eliminate them and obliterate themFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without dispelling these things do not arise when they are dispelledThese are called the defilements that should be given up by dispellingDefilements

principlestranquilityimmersionand equanimity which rely on seclusion fading away and cessation and ripen as letting goFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developedThese are called the defilements that should be given up by developingNow take a mendicant who by seeing has given up the defilements that should be given up by seeing By restraint theyve given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint By using theyve given up the defilements that should be given up by using By enduring theyve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring By avoiding theyve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding By dispelling theyve given up the defilements that should be given up by dispelling By developing theyve given up the defilements that should be given up by developingTheyre called a mendicant who lives having restrained all defilements who has cut off craving untied the fetters and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of sufferingThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesAt NaḷakapānaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna in the Parrot Tree groveNow at that time several very wellknown gentlemen had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in the BuddhaThe venerables Anuruddha Bhaddiya Kimbila Bhagu Koṇḍañña Revata nanda and other very wellknown gentlemenNow at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the mendicant SaṅghaThen the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those gentlemenMendicants those gentlemen who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in meI trust theyre satisfied with the spiritual lifeWhen this was said the mendicants kept silentFor a second and a third time the Buddha asked the same questionFor a third time the mendicants kept silentThen it occurred to the BuddhaWhy dont I question just those gentlemenThen the Buddha said to Venerable AnuruddhaAnuruddha and friends I hope youre satisfied with the spiritual lifeIndeed sir we are satisfied with the spiritual lifeGood good Anuruddha and friendsIts appropriate for gentlemen like yourselves who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to be satisfied with the spiritual lifeSince youre blessed with youth in the prime of life blackhaired you could have enjoyed sensual pleasures yet you have gone forth from the lay life to homelessnessBut you didnt go forth because you were forced to by kings or bandits or because youre in debt or threatened or to earn a livingRather didnt you go forth thinking Im swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in sufferingHopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of sufferingYes sirBut Anuruddha and friends when a gentleman has gone forth like this what should he doTake someone who doesnt achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities or something even more peaceful than that Their mind is still occupied by desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse doubt discontent and slothThats someone who doesnt achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities or something even more peaceful than thatTake someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities or something even more peaceful than that Their mind is not occupied by desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse doubt discontent and slothThats someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities or something even more peaceful than thatIs this what you think of meThe Realized One has not given up the defilements the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathThats why after appraisal he uses some things endures some things avoids some things and gets rid of some thingsNo sir we dont think of you that wayWe think of you this wayThe Realized One has given up the defilements the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathThats why after appraisal he uses some things endures some things avoids some things and gets rid of some thingsGood good Anuruddha and friendsThe Realized One has given up the defilements the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death He has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the futureJust as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growthin the same way the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the futureThats why after appraisal he uses some things endures some things avoids some things and gets rid of some thingsWhat do you think Anuruddha and friendsWhat advantage does the Realized One see in declaring the rebirth of his disciples who have passed awayThis one is reborn here while that one is reborn thereOur teachings are rooted in the BuddhaHe is our guide and our refugeSir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember itThe Realized One does not declare such things for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them nor for the benefit of possessions honor or popularity nor thinking So let people know about meRather

popularity nor thinking So let people know about me that the Realized One declares the rebirth of his disciples who have passed awayThis one is reborn here while that one is reborn thereRather there are gentlemen of faith who are full of joy and gladnessWhen they hear that they apply their minds to that endThat is for their lasting welfare and happinessThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Anuruddha and friends were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse With SakuludāyīSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundNow at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyī was residing together with a large assembly of wanderers in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks feeding groundThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsThen it occurred to himIts too early to wander for alms in RājagahaWhy dont I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks feeding groundThen the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderersNow at that time Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such astalk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existenceSakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceand hushed his own assemblyBe quiet good sirs dont make a soundHere comes the ascetic GotamaThe venerable likes quiet and praises quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachThen those wanderers fell silentThen the Buddha approached Sakuludāyīwho said to himCome Blessed OneWelcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readyThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outwhile Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha said to himUdāyī what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedSir leave aside what we were sitting talking about just nowIt wont be hard for you to hear about that laterWhen I dont come to the assembly they sit and engage in all kinds of unworthy talkBut when I have come to the assembly they sit gazing up at my face alone thinkingWhatever the ascetic Udāyī teaches we shall listen to itBut when the Buddha has come to the assembly both myself and the assembly sit gazing up at your face thinkingWhatever the Buddha teaches we shall listen to itWell then Udāyī suggest something for me to talk aboutMaster Gotama a few days ago someone was claiming to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thus Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and wakingWhen I asked them a question about the past they dodged the issue distracted the discussion with irrelevant points and displayed annoyance hate and bitternessThat reminded me of the BuddhaSurely it must be the Blessed One the Holy One who is so skilled in such mattersBut Udāyī who was it that made such a claim and behaved in such a wayIt was Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta sir
