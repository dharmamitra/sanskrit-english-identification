The fourth and last part of the Dhammasangani the Atthuddharakanda the SynopsisThe arrangement for the recitation of the AbhidhammaThe Numerical Section of the PatthanaIn the Anupada Sutta the Buddha himself speaks of the Venerable Sariputtas analysis of meditative consciousness into its chief mental concomitants which the Elder undertook from his own experience after rising from each of the meditative attainments in successionThis analysis may well be either a precursor or an abridgment of the detailed analysis of jhanaconsciousness given in the DhammasanganiConcerning the Venerable Sariputtas mastery of the Dhamma and its exposition the Buddha had this to say Nidana Samyutta NoAnd on another occasion the Master employed this simileSimilarly O monks is Sariputta endowed with five qualities and rightly turns the supreme Wheel of Dhamma even as I have turned itAnd this Wheel cannot be overturned by ascetics or priests by deities or Brahma nor by anyone else in the worldWhat are those five qualitiesSariputta O monks knows what is beneficial knows the Teaching knows the right measure knows the right time and knows the assembly Anguttara Nikaya Other Theras were not behind in their appreciationThe Elder Vangisa in his encomium in the Theragatha praises Sariputta who teaches in brief and also speaks in detail while in the same compilation other great Elders Maha Kassapa and Maha Moggallana also give their meed of praiseAnd the Venerable Maha Moggallana at the end of Sariputtas Discourse on Guiltlessness uttered these words of tribute to his friends sermon To monks who have heard the exposition of the Venerable Sariputta it will be like food and drink to their ears and mindHow well does he lift up his fellowmonks from what is unwholesome and confirm them in what is goodThe relationship in which the two Chief Disciples stood to one another in the matter of teaching was explained by the Buddha when he saidSariputta is able to expound the Four Noble Truths in detail to teach them and make them intelligible to proclaim reveal and explain them and make them clear Majjh Saccavibhanga SuttaAnd in the Anguttara NikayaA monk of faith O bhikkhus should cherish this right aspiration Oh may I become such as Sariputta and Moggallana For Sariputta and Moggallana are the model and standard for my bhikkhudisciplesThat the Venerable Sariputtas great reputation as a teacher of the Dhamma long survived him to become a tradition among later Buddhists is shown by the concluding passages of the Milindapañha written some three hundred years laterThere King Milinda compares Nagasena Thera to the Venerable Sariputta saying In this Buddhas Dispensation there is none other like yourself for answering questions except the Elder Sariputta the Marshal of the LawThat grand reputation still lives today upheld by the cherished teachings of the Great Disciple preserved and enshrined in some of the oldest books of Buddhism alongside the words of his MasterAs we have already seen the Venerable Sariputta was born into a brahman family of Upatissa village near Rajagaha his fathers name being Vaganta and his mothers SariHe had three brothers Cunda Upasena and Revata and three sisters named Cala Upacala and SisupacalaAll six took ordination and attained ArahatshipCunda was known by the name Samanuddesa meaning the Novice in the Sangha even after becoming a bhikkhu this was to distinguish him from the Elder Maha CundaAt the time of Sariputtas death Cunda was his attendant and it was he who informed the Buddha of his passing away bringing with him the Chief Disciples relicsThe story is told in the Cunda Sutta an outline of which will be given elsewhere in this bookUpasena who came to be known as Vagantaputta or Son of Vaganta as Sariputta is Son of Sari was said by the Buddha to be foremost among those of allpleasing deportmentHe died of a snakebite as is related in the Salatayana Samyutta Vagga SuttaRevata was the youngest of the brothers and their mother wishing to prevent his seeking ordination had him married when he was a very young boyBut on the wedding day he saw the grandmother of his future wife an old woman of stricken with all the signs of decrepitudeAt once he became disgusted with worldly lifeEscaping from the wedding procession by a ruse he fled to a monastery and was ordainedIn later years he was on his way to see the Buddha when he stopped at a forest of acacia trees and while spending the rainy season there he attained ArahatshipAfter that he became known as Revata Khadiravaniya  Revata of the Acacia Forest The Buddha distinguished him as being the foremost among forest dwellersThe three sisters Cala Upacala and Sisupacala wishing to follow their brothers example became nuns after their marriageIn marriage each of them had a son who was named after his mother Cala and so onThese three sons were also ordained being received as novices by Revata KhadtravaniyaTheir good conduct was praised by the Venerable Sariputta who met them when he went to see his youngest brother who was illThis is recorded in the Commentary to the Theragatha vCala Upacala and Sisupacala as nuns are said to have been approached by Mara with taunting and tempting questions to which they gave excellent repliesThese are recorded in the Theragatha and Bhikkhuni SamyuttaIn contrast to all these Sariputtas mother was a staunch brahman and hostile to the Buddhas Teaching and his followersIn the Commentary to the Dhammapada it is related that once when the Venerable Sariputta was in his own village of Nalaka with a large retinue of monks he came to his mothers house in the course of his almsroundHis mother gave him a seat and served him with food but while she did so she uttered abusive words Oh you eater of others leavings she saidWhen you fail to get leavings of sour ricegruel you go from house to house among strangers licking the leavings off the backs of ladiesAnd so it was for this that you gave up eighty crores of wealth and became a monkYou have ruined meNow go on and eatLikewise when she was serving food to the monks she said SoYou are the men who have made my son your page boyGo on eat nowThus she continued reviling them but the Venerable Sariputta spoke not a wordHe took his food ate it and in silence returned to the monasteryThe Buddha learned of the incident from the Venerable Rahula who had been among the monks at the timeAll the bhikkhus who heard of it wondered at the Elders great forbearance and in the midst of the assembly the Buddha praised him uttering the stanzaIt was not until right at the close of Sariputtas life that he was able to convert his mother that story will be told later onBut the incident that has been related here leads us to a consideration of the great Elders most pleasing characteristics his humility patience and forbearanceIt is the neighborhood of Jetavana where the Buddha is residingSome men are in a group talking about the noble qualities of the Elder SariputtaSuch great patience has our noble Elder they are saying that even when people abuse him and strike him he feels no trace of angerWho is this that never gets angry The question is from a brahman a holder of false viewsAnd when they tell him It is our Elder Sariputta he retorts It must be that nobody has ever provoked himThat is not so brahman they replyWell then I will provoke him to anger Provoke him to anger if you can Leave it to me says the brahmanI know just what to do to himThe Venerable Sariputta enters the city on his round for almsApproaching him from behind the brahman strikes him in a tremendous blow on the backWhat was that says the Venerable Sariputta and without so much as turning to look he continues on his wayThe fire of remorse leaps up in every part of the brahmans bodyProstrating himself at the Elders feet he begs for pardonFor what asks the Elder mildlyTo test your patience I struck you the penitent brahman repliesVery well I pardon youReverend sir the brahman says if you are willing to pardon me hereafter please take your food only at my house With these words he takes the Elders almsbowl which the Elder willingly yields and leading him to his house serves him with foodBut those who saw the assault are enragedThey gather at the brahmans house armed with sticks and stones to kill himWhen the Venerable Sariputta emerges accompanied by the brahman carrying his bowl they cry Reverend sir order this brahman to turn backWhy lay disciples asks the ElderThey answer The man struck youWe are going to give him what he deservesBut what do you meanWas it you or me he struckIt was you reverend sir Well if it was me he struck he has begged my pardonGo your ways And so dismissing the people and permitting the brahman to return the great Elder calmly makes his way to the monasteryThis incident recorded in the Dhammapada Commentary was the occasion of the Buddhas uttering the verses and of the Dhammapada which are among those that give the Buddhas definition of what constitutes a brahman that is to say rectitude of conduct rather than birth or rank Dhammapada vv The Venerable Sariputtas humility was as great as his patienceHe was willing to receive correction from anyone not only with submission but with gratitudeIt is told in the Commentary to the Devaputta Samyutta Susima Sutta that once through a momentary negligence a corner of the Elders underrobe was hanging down and a sevenyearold novice seeing this pointed it out to himThe Venerable Sariputta stepped aside at once and arranged the garment in the proper equallycircular wayThen he stood before the novice with folded hands saying Now it is correct teacherThere is a reference to this incident in the Questions of Milinda where these verses are ascribed to the Venerable SariputtaOn one occasion the Buddha mildly reproved Sariputta for not having carried his teaching far enoughWhen the brahman Dhanañjani was on his deathbed he was visited by the Venerable SariputtaThe Elder reflecting that brahmans are bent on the Brahmaworld taught the dying man the way to it through the BrahmaviharasAs a result it is said the brahman was in fact reborn thereWhen the Venerable Sariputta returned from the visit the Master asked him Why Sariputta while there was more to do did you set the brahman Dhanañjanis thoughts on the inferior Brahmaworld and then rising from your seat leave him The Venerable Sariputta replied I thought These brahmans are bent on the BrahmaworldShould I not show the brahman Dhanañjani the way to the communion with BrahmaThe brahman Dhanañjani has died Sariputta said the Buddha and he has been reborn in the BrahmaworldThis story which is found in the Dhanañjani Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya is interesting as an illustration of the undesirability of rebirth in an inferior Brahmaworld for one who is capable of bringing rebirth entirely to an endFor while the Buddha himself sometimes showed only the way to Brahma as for example in the Tevijja Sutta it seems probable that in the case of Dhanañjani the Master saw that he was fit to receive a higher teaching while the Venerable Sariputta lacking the capacity of knowing others hearts was not able to discern that factThe result is that Dhanañjani will spend an incalculable period in the Brahmaworld and will have to take human birth again before he can achieve the goalThe Venerable Sariputta received another gentle reproof when having asked the Buddha why it was that the Sasana of some of the Buddhas of the past did not last very long and the Buddha had replied that it was because those Enlightened Ones did not preach very much Dhamma did not lay down regulations for the disciples nor institute the recital of the Patimokkha Sariputta said that it was now time for the Blessed One to promulgate the regulations and to recite the Patimokkha so that the Holy Life might last for a long periodThe Buddha said Let it be Sariputtathe Tathagata himself will know the time for itThe Master will not lay down regulations for the disciples nor recite the Patimokkha until signs of corruption have appeared in the SanghaThe disciples concern that the Sasana should endure as long as possible is characteristic of Sariputta equally characteristic was it of the Buddha that he did not wish to lay down regulations until such time as it was absolutely necessary to do soHe went on to explain that at that time the leastadvanced member of the Sangha was a Sotapanna and therefore it was not yet necessary to lay down the rules of the bhikkhu lifeThe Catuma Sutta records another occasion when the great Elder was admonished by the MasterA large number of monks newly ordained as the Commentary tell us by the Venerable Sariputta and Maha Moggallana had come with the latter to pay their respects to the Buddha for the first timeOn arrival they were allotted quarters and started chatting with the resident monks of CatumaHearing the noise the Buddha summoned the resident monks to question them about it and was told that the commotion was caused by the new arrivalsThe text does not say the visiting monks were present at the time but they must have been for the Buddha addressed them with the words Go away monks I dismiss youYou should not stay with meThe newly ordained monks left but some persons intervened in their behalf and they were allowed to returnThe Buddha then said to the Venerable Sariputta What did you think Sariputta when I dismissed that group of monksThe Venerable Sariputta replied I thought The Blessed One wishes to remain unconcerned and to abide in the state of happiness hereandnow so we too shall remain unconcerned and abide in the state of happiness hereandnowHold SariputtaDo not allow such a thought ever to arise in you again the Buddha saidThen turning to Maha Moggallana he put the same questionWhen the Blessed One dismissed those monks replied Maha Moggallana I thought The Blessed One wishes to remain unconcerned and to abide in the state of happiness hereandnowThen I and the Venerable Sariputta should now look after the community of monks Well spoken Moggallana well spoken said the MasterIt is either myself or Sariputta or Moggallana who should look after the community of monksThe Sutta account is lacking in certain details which would place the story in the proper light necessary for an understanding of all its implications but it is possible that since the monks who had been dismissed were pupils of Sariputta and Maha Moggallana the Elder wished to show his displeasure with them and to indicate by his aloofness that they had behaved badlyOnce when the Buddha was residing at Jetavana the Venerable Sariputta was the victim of a false accusationIt so happened that at the end of the rains the Elder took leave of the Master and departed with his own retinue of monks on a journeyA large number of monks also took leave of Sariputta and in dismissing them he addressed those who were known by their personal and family names by those namesAmong them there was a monk who was not known by his personal and family name but a strong desire arose in him that the Chief Disciple should address him by those names in taking his departureIn the great throng of monks however the Venerable Sariputta did not give him this distinction and the monk was aggrievedHe does not greet me as he does the other monks he thought and conceived a grudge against SariputtaAt the same time it chanced that the hem of the Elders robe brushed against him and this added to his grievanceHe approached the Buddha and complained Lord the Venerable Sariputta doubtless thinking to himself I am the Chief Disciple struck me a blow that almost damaged my earAnd having done that without so much as begging my pardon he set out on his journeyThe Buddha summoned Sariputta into his presenceMeanwhile the Venerable Maha Moggallana and the Venerable Ananda knowing that a calumny was about to be exposed summoned all the monks convoking an assemblyApproach venerable sirs they calledWhen the Venerable Sariputta is face to face with the Master he will roar the roar of a lionAnd so it came aboutWhen the Master questioned the great Elder instead of denying the charge he said O Lord one who is not firmly established in the contemplation of the body with regard to his body such a one may be able to hurt a fellow monk and leave without apologizing Then followed the Venerable Sariputtas lions roarHe compared his freedom from anger and hatred with the patience of the earth which receives all things clean and unclean his tranquillity of mind to a bull with severed horns to a lowly Candala youth to water fire and wind and to the removal of impurity he compared the oppression he felt from his own body to the oppression of snakes and corpses and the maintenance of his body to that of fatty excrescencesIn nine similes he described his own virtues and nine times the great earth responded to the words of truthThe entire assembly was moved by the majestic force of his utteranceAs the Elder proclaimed his virtues remorse filled the monk who had unjustly traduced himImmediately he fell at the feet of the Blessed One admitting his slander and confessing his faultThereupon the Buddha said Sariputta pardon this deluded man lest his head should split into seven pieces Sariputtas reply was Venerable sir I freely pardon this venerable monk And with joined palms he added May this venerable monk also pardon me if I have in any way offended himIn this way they were reconciledThe other monks were filled with admiration saying See brethren the surpassing goodness of the ElderHe cherishes neither anger nor hatred against this lying slanderous monkInstead he crouches before him stretches his hands in reverence and asks his pardonThe Buddhas comment was Bhikkhus it is impossible for Sariputta and his like to cherish anger or hatredSariputtas mind is like the great earth firm like a gate post like a pool of still waterAnother incident of this nature in the early Sangha did not end so happily for the calumniator refused to admit his faultHe was a monk named Kokalika who approached the Buddha with a slander against the two Chief Disciples Sariputta and Moggallana have bad intentions O Lord he saidThey are in the grip of evil ambitionThe Master replied Do not say so KokalikaDo not say soHave friendly and trustful thoughts towards Sariputta and MoggallanaThey are of good behavior and lovableBut the misguided Kokalika paid no heed to the Buddhas wordsHe persisted with his false accusation and soon after that his whole body became covered with boils which continued to grow until eventually he died of his illnessThis incident was wellknownIt is recorded in the following places in the Suttapitaka Brahma Samyutta No Sutta Nipata Mahavagga No Anguttara Nikaya and Takkariya JatakaA comparison of these two incidents reveals the importance of penitenceNeither the Venerable Sariputta nor Maha Moggallana bore the monk Kokalika any illwill for his malice and his apologies had he offered them would have made no difference to the attitude of the two Chief DisciplesBut they would have benefited the erring monk himself averting the consequences of his bad kammaEvil rebounds upon those who direct it towards the innocent and so Kokalika was judged and punished by himself through his own deedsWe now come to the year of the Masters ParinibbanaThe Blessed One had spent the rainy season at Beluva village near Vesali and when the Retreat was over he left that place and going by the way he had come returned by stages to Savatthi and arrived at the Jeta Grove MonasteryThere the Elder Sariputta the Marshal of the Law paid homage to the Blessed One and went to his day quartersWhen his own disciples had saluted him and left he swept the place and spread his leather matThen having rinsed his feet he sat down crosslegged and entered into the state of the Fruition Attainment of ArahatshipAt the time predetermined by him he arose from the meditation and this thought occurred to him Do the Enlightened Ones have their final passing away first or the Chief Disciples And he saw that it is the Chief Disciples who pass away firstThereupon he considered his own lifeforce and saw that its residue would sustain him only for another weekHe then considered Where shall I have my final passing away And he thought Rahula finally passed away among the deities of the Thirtythree and the Elder Kondañña the Knower at the Chaddanta LakeWhere then will be my placeWhile thinking this over repeatedly he remembered his mother and the thought came to him Although she is the mother of seven Arahats she has no faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaHas she the supportive conditions in her to acquire that faith or has she notInvestigating the matter he discerned that she had the supportive conditions for the Pathintuition of streamentryThen he asked himself Through whose instruction can she win to the penetration of truthAnd he saw that not through anyone elses but only through his own instruction in the Dhamma could it come aboutAnd following upon that came the thought If I now remain indifferent people will say Sariputta has been a helper to so many others on the day for instance when he preached the Discourse to the Deities of Tranquil Mind a large number of devas attained Arahatship and still more of them penetrated to the first three Paths and on other occasions there were many who attained to streamentry and there thousands of families who were reborn in heavenly worlds after the Elder had inspired them with joyous confidence in the Triple GemYet despite this he cannot remove the wrong views of his own motherThus people may speak of meTherefore I shall free my mother from her wrong views and shall have my final passing away in the very chamber where I was bornHaving made that decision he thought This very day I shall ask the Masters permission and then leave for Nalaka And calling the elder Cunda who was his attendant he said Friend Cunda please ask our group of five hundred bhikkhus to take their bowls and robes for I wish to go to Nalaka And the elder Cunda did as he was biddenThe bhikkhus put their lodgings in order took their bowls and robes and presented themselves before the Elder SariputtaHe for his own part had tidied up his living quarters and swept the place where he used to spend the dayThen standing at the gate he looked back at the place thinking This is my last sight of itThere will be no more coming backThen together with the five hundred bhikkhus he went to the Blessed One saluted him and spoke May O Lord the Blessed One permit may the Exalted One consent the time of my final passing away has come I have relinquished the lifeforceNow says the text if the enlightened One were to have replied You may have your final passing away hostile sectarians would say that he was speaking in praise of death and if he had replied Do not have your final passing away they would say that he extolled the continuation of the round of existenceTherefore the Blessed One did not speak in either way but asked Where will your final passing away take placeThe Venerable Sariputta replied In the Magadha country in the village called Nalaka there in the chamber of my birth shall I finally pass awayThen the Blessed One said Do Sariputta what you think timelyBut now your elder and younger brethren in the Sangha will no longer have the chance to see a bhikkhu like youGive them once more a discourse on DhammaThe great Elder then gave a discourse displaying all his descending to mundane truth rising again and again descending he expounded the Dhamma directly and in symbolsAnd when he had ended his discourse he paid homage at the feet of the Masterembracing his legs he said So that I might worship these feet I have fulfilled the Perfections throughout an aeon and a hundred thousand kalpasMy hearts wish has found fulfillmentFrom now on there will be no more contact or meeting severed now is that intimate connectionThe City of Nibbana the unaging undying peaceful blissful heatassuaging and secure which has been entered by many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas  I too shall enter it nowIf any deed or word of mine did not please you O Lord may the Blessed One forgive meIt is now time for me to goNow once before the Buddha had answered this when he said There is nothing be it in deeds or words wherein I should have to reproach you SariputtaFor you are learned Sariputta of great wisdom of broad and bright quick keen and penetrative wisdomSo now he made answer in the same way I forgive you Sariputta he saidBut there was not a single word or deed of yours that was displeasing to meDo now Sariputta what you think timelyFrom this we see that on those few occasions when the Master seemed to reproach his Chief Disciple it was not that he was displeased with him in any way but rather that he was pointing out another approach to a situation another way of viewing a problemImmediately after the master had given his permission and the Venerable Sariputta had risen from paying homage at his feet the Great Earth cried out and with a single huge tremor shook to its watery boundariesIt was as though the Great Earth wished to say Though I bear these girdling mountain ranges with Mount Meru the encircling mountain walls and the Himavant I cannot sustain on this day so vast an accumulation of virtue And mighty thunder split the heavens a vast cloud appeared and heavy rain poured downThen the Blessed One thought I shall now permit the Marshal of the Law to depart and he rose from the seat of the Law went to his Perfumed Cell and there stood on the Jewel SlabThree times the Venerable Sariputta circumambulated the cell keeping it to his right and paid reverence at four placesAnd this thought was in his mind an aeon and a hundred thousand kalpas ago it was when I fell down at the feet of the Buddha Anomadassi and made the aspiration to see youThis aspiration has been realized and I have seen youAt the first meeting it was my first sight of you now it is my last and there will be none in the future And with raised hands joined in salutation he departed going backwards until the Blessed One was out of sightAnd yet again the Great Earth unable to bear it trembled to its watery boundariesThe Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus who surrounded himGo bhikkhus he saidAccompany your elder brother At these words all the four assemblies of devotees at once went out of the Jeta Grove leaving the Blessed One there aloneThe citizens of Savatthi also having heard the news went out of the city in an unending stream carrying incense and flowers in their hands and with their hair wet they followed the Elder lamenting and weepingThe Venerable Sariputta then admonished the crowd saying This is a road that none can avoid and asked them to returnAnd to the monks who had accompanied him he said You may turn back nowDo not neglect the MasterThus he made them go back and with only his own group of disciples he continued on his wayYet still some of the people followed him lamentingFormerly our Venerable went on journeys and returnedBut this is a journey without return To them the Elder said Be heedful friendsOf such nature indeed are all things that are formed and conditioned And he made them turn backDuring his journey the Venerable Sariputta spent one night wherever he stopped and thus for one week he favored many people with a last sight of himReaching Nalaka village in the evening he stopped near a banyan tree at the village gateIt happened that at the time a nephew of the elder Uparevata by name had gone outside the village and there he saw the Venerable SariputtaHe approached the elder saluted him and remained standingThe Elder asked him Is your grandaunt at home Yes venerable sir he repliedThen go and announce our coming said the ElderAnd if she asks why I have come tell her that I shall stay in the village for one day and ask her to prepare my birth chamber and provide lodgings for five hundred bhikkhusUparevata went to his grandaunt and said Grandaunt my uncle has comeWhere is he now she askedAt the village gateIs he alone or has someone else come with himHe has come with five hundred bhikkhusAnd when she asked him Why has he come he gave her the message the elder had entrusted to himThen she thought Why does he ask me to provide lodgings for so manyAfter becoming a monk in his youth does he want to be a layman again in his old age But she arranged the birth chamber for the Elder and lodgings for the bhikkhus had torches lit and then sent for the ElderThe Venerable Sariputta then accompanied by the bhikkhus went up to the terrace of the house and entered his birth chamberAfter seating himself he asked the bhikkhus to go to their quartersThey had hardly left when a grave illness dysentery fell upon the Elder and he felt severe painsWhen one pail was brought in another was carried outThe brahman lady thought The news of my son is not good and she stood leaning by the door of her own roomAnd then it happened the text tells us that the Four Great Divine Kings asked themselves Where may he now be dwelling the Marshal of the Law And they perceived that he was at Nalaka in his birth chamber lying on the bed of his Final Passing AwayLet us go for a last sight of him they saidWhen they reached the birth chamber they saluted the Elder and remained standingWho are you asked the ElderWe are the Great Divine Kings venerable sirWhy have you comeWe want to attend on you during your illnessLet it be said the Venerable SariputtaThere is an attendant hereYou may goWhen they had left there came in the same manner Sakka the king of the gods and after him Maha Brahma and all of them the elder dismissed in the same wayThe brahman lady seeing the coming and going of these deities asked herself Who could they have been who came and paid homage to my son and then left And she went to the door of the elders room and asked the Venerable Cunda for news about the Elders conditionCunda conveyed the inquiry to the Elder telling him The Great Upasika has comeThe Venerable Sariputta asked her Why have you come at this unusual hourTo see you dear she repliedTell me who were those who came firstThe Four Great Divine Kings upasikaAre you then greater than they she askedThey are like temple attendants said the ElderEver since our Master took rebirth they have stood guard over him with swords in handAfter they had left who was it that came then dearIt was Sakka the king of the godsAre you then greater than the king of gods dearHe is like a novice who carries a bhikkhus belongings answered SariputtaWhen our Master returned from the heaven of the Thirtythree Sakka took his bowl and robe and descended to earth together with himAnd when Sakka had gone who was it that came after him filling the room with his radianceUpasika that was your own Lord and Master the Great BrahmaThen are you greater my son even than my Lord the Great BrahmaYes UpasikaOn the day when our Master was born it is said that four Great Brahmas received the Great Being in a golden netUpon hearing this the brahman lady thought If my sons power is such as this what must be the majestic power of my sons Master and Lord And while she was thinking this suddenly the fivefold rapture arose in her suffusing her entire bodyThe Elder thought Rapture and joy have arisen in my motherNow is the time to preach the Dhamma to her And he said What was it you were thinking about upasikaI was thinking she replied if my son has such virtue what must be the virtue of his MasterThe Venerable Sariputta answered At the moment of my Masters birth at his Great Renunciation on his attaining Enlightenment and at his first turning of the Dhamma Wheel  on all these occasions the ten thousand worldsystem quaked and shookNone is there who equals him in virtue in concentration in wisdom in deliverance and in the knowledge and vision of deliverance And he then explained to her in detail the words of homage Such indeed is that Blessed OneAnd thus he gave her an exposition of the Dhamma basing it on the virtues of the BuddhaWhen the Dhamma talk given by her beloved son had come to an end the brahman lady was firmly established in the Fruition of streamentry and she said Oh my dear Upatissa why did you act like thatWhy during all these years did you not bestow on me this ambrosiaThe Elder thought Now I have given my mother the brahman lady RupaSari the nursingfee for bringing me upThis should suffice and he dismissed her with the words You may go now upasikaWhen she was gone he asked What is the time now CundaVenerable sir it is early dawnAnd the Elder said Let the community of bhikkhus assembleWhen the bhikkhus had assembled he said to Cunda Lift me up to a sitting position Cunda And Cunda did soThen the Elder spoke to the bhikkhus saying For fortyfour years I have lived and traveled with you my brethrenIf any deed or word of mine was unpleasant to you forgive me brethrenAnd they replied Venerable sir not the least displeasure has ever come from you to us who followed you inseparably like your shadowBut may you venerable sir grant forgiveness to usAfter that the Elder gathered his large robe around him covered his face and lay down on his right sideThen just as the Master was to do at his Maha Parinibbana he entered into the nine successive attainments of meditation in forward and reverse order and beginning again with the first absorption he led his meditation up to the fourth absorptionAnd at the moment after he had entered it just as the crest of the rising sun appeared over the horizon he utterly passed away into the Nibbanaelement which is without any remnant of clingingAnd it was the fullmoon day of the month Kattika which by the solar calendar is between October and NovemberThe brahman lady in her room thought How is my sonhe does not say anything She rose and going into the Elders room she massaged his legsThen seeing that he had passed away she fell at his feet loudly lamenting O my dear sonBefore this we did not know of your virtueBecause of that we did not gain the good fortune to have seated in this house and to feed many a hundred bhikkhusWe did not gain the good fortune to have built many monasteries And she lamented thus up to sunriseAs soon as the sun was up she sent for goldsmiths and had the treasure room opened and had the pots full of gold weighed on a large scaleThen she gave the gold to the goldsmiths with the order to prepare funeral ornamentsColumns and arches were erected and in the center of the village the upasika had a pavilion of heartwood builtIn the middle of the pavilion a large gabled structure was raised surrounded by a parapet wall of golden arches and columnsThen they began the sacred ceremony in which men and deities mingledAfter the great assembly of people had celebrated the sacred rites for a full week they made a pyre with many kinds of fragrant woodsThey placed the body of the Venerable Sariputta on the pyre and kindled the wood with bundles of Usira rootsThroughout the night of the cremation the concourse listened to sermons on the DhammaAfter that the flames of the pyre were extinguished by the Elder Anuruddha with scented waterThe Elder Cunda gathered together the relics and placed them in a filter clothThen the Elder Cunda thought I cannot tarry here any longerI must tell the Fully Enlightened One of the final passing away of my elder brother the Venerable Sariputta the Marshal of the Law So he took the filter cloth with the relics and the Venerable Sariputtas almsbowl and robes and went to Savatthi spending only one night at each stage of the journeyThese are the events released in the Commentary to the Cunda Sutta of the Satipatthana Samyutta with additions from the parallel version in the Commentary to the Mahaparinibbana SuttaThe narrative is taken up in the Cunda Sutta which followsAnd the Venerable Sariputta passed away finally through that very illnessThen the Novice Cunda took the almsbowl and robes of the Venerable Sariputta and went to Savatthi to the Jeta Grove Anathapindikas parkThere he betook himself to the Venerable Ananda and having saluted him seated himself at one sideThus seated he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Venerable sir the Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing awayThese are his bowl and robesOn this matter Cunda we ought to see the Blessed OneLet us go friend Cunda and meet the MasterHaving met him we shall acquaint the Blessed One with that factYes Venerable sir said the Novice CundaThey went to see the Blessed One and having arrived there and saluted the Master they seated themselves at one sideThen the Venerable Ananda addressed the Blessed OneO Lord the Novice Cunda has told me this The Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing awayThese are his bowl and robes Then O Lord my own body became weak as a creeper everything around became dim and things were no longer clear to me when I heard about the final passing away of the Venerable SariputtaHow is this AnandaWhen Sariputta had his final passing away did he take from you your portion of virtue or your portion of concentration or your portion of the knowledge and vision of deliveranceNot so LordWhen the Venerable Sariputta had his final passing away he did not take my portion of virtue concentration wisdom deliverance or my portion of the knowledge and vision of deliveranceBut O Lord the Venerable Sariputta has been to me a mentor teacher and instructor one who rouses inspires and gladdens untiring in preaching Dhamma a helper of his fellow monksAnd we remember how vitalizing enjoyable and helpful his Dhamma instruction wasHave I not taught you aforetime Ananda that it is the nature of all things near and dear to us that we must suffer separation from them and be severed from themOf that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not departThat indeed is not possibleIt is Ananda as though from a mighty hardwood tree a large branch should break off so has Sariputta now had his final passing away from this great and sound community of bhikkhusIndeed Ananda of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not departThis indeed is not possibleTherefore Ananda be ye an island unto yourself a refuge unto yourself seeking no external refuge with the Teaching as your island the Teaching your refuge seeking no other refugeThe Commentary takes up the narrative thusThese O monks are the shellcolored relics of the bhikkhu who not long ago asked for permission to have his final passing awayHe who fulfilled the Perfections for an incalculable aeon and a hundred thousand kalpas  this was that bhikkhuHe who obtained the seat next to me  this was that bhikkhuHe who apart from me had none to equal him in wisdom throughout the whole tenthousandfold universe  this was that bhikkhuOf great wisdom was this bhikkhu of broad wisdom bright wisdom quick wisdom of penetrative wisdom was this bhikkhuFew wants had this bhikkhu he was contented bent on seclusion not fond of company full of energy an exhorter of his fellow monks censuring what is evilHe who went forth into homelessness abandoning the great fortune obtained through his merits in five hundred existences  this was that bhikkhuHe who in my Dispensation was patient like the earth  this was that bhikkhuHarmless like a bull whose horns had been cut  this was that bhikkhuOf humble mind like a Candala boy  this was that bhikkhuSee here O monks the relics of him who was of great wisdom of broad bright quick keen and penetrative wisdom who had few wants and was contented bent on seclusion not fond of company energetic  see here the relics of him who was an exhorter of his fellow monks who censured evilThen the Buddha spoke the following verses in praise of his Great DiscipleWhen the Blessed One had thus lauded the virtues of the Venerable Sariputta he asked for a stupa to be built for the relicsAfter that he indicated to the Elder Ananda his wish to go to RajagahaAnanda informed the monks and the Blessed One together with a large body of bhikkhus journeyed to RajagahaAt the time he arrived there the Venerable Maha Moggallana had also had his final passing awayThe Blessed One took his relics likewise and had a stupa raised for themThen he departed from Rajagaha and going by stages towards the Ganges he reached UkkacelaThere he went to the bank of the Ganges and seated with his following of monks he preached the Ukkacela Sutta on the Parinibbana of Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaThe Blessed One surveyed the silent gathering of monks and then spoke to them sayingThis assembly O bhikkhus appears indeed empty to me now that Sariputta and Maha Moggallana have passed awayNot empty for me is an assembly nor need I have concern for a place where Sariputta and Maha Moggallana dwellThose who in the past have been Holy OnesFully enlightened Ones those Blessed Ones too had such excellent pairs of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaThose who in the future will be Holy Ones fully Enlightened Ones those Blessed Ones too will have such excellent pairs of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaMarvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning those disciples that they will act in accordance with the Masters Dispensation will act in according to his advice that they will be dear to the four Assemblies will be loved respected and honored by themMarvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning the Perfect Ones that when such a pair of disciples has passed away there is no grief no lamentation on the part of the Perfect OneFor of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not departThat indeed is not possibleTherefore bhikkhus be ye an island unto yourselves a refuge unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Teaching as your island the Teaching your refuge seeking no other refugeAnd with that profound and deeply moving exhortation which echoes again and again through the Buddhas Teaching up to the time of his own final passing away ends the story of the youth Upatissa who became the masters Chief Disciple the beloved Marshal of the Law The Venerable Sariputta died on the full moon of the month Kattika which begins in October and ends in November of the solar calendarThe death of Maha Moggallana followed a halfmonth later on the Uposatha of the New MoonHalf a year later according to tradition came the Parinibbana of the Buddha himselfCould such an auspicious combination of three great personages so fruitful in blessings to gods and men have been brought about purely by chanceWe find the answer to that question in the Milindapañha where Nagasena saysSo the weary round of becoming which linked them together in time came at last to its end time which is but the succession of fleeting events became for them the Timeless and round of birth and death gave place to the DeathlessAnd in their final lives they kindled a glory that has illumined the worldLong may it continue to do soThe suttas attributed to the Venerable Sariputta cover a wide range of subjects connected with the Holy Life from simple morality up to abstruse points of doctrine and meditational practiceA list of them together with a brief description of the subject matter of each is given belowtheir arrangement in the Sutta Pitaka does not give any indication of the chronological order in which they were deliveredSome few however contain references to particular events which make it possible to assign to them a period in the Buddhas ministryOne such is the Anathapindika Sutta preached just before the great lay disciples deathLater when Dhanañjani was on his deathbed he requested the Elder to visit him and the Venerable Sariputta spoke to him on the way to Brahma through the BrahmaviharasThe Buddha mildly reproached the elder for not having led Dhanañjani to a higher understandingThe Venerable Sariputta is called to Anathapindikas deathbed and admonishes him to free his mind from any attachment whatsoever beginning with the six sense organs Thus should you train yourself householder I shall not cling to the eye and my consciousness will not attach itself to the eye Thus householder should you train yourself This is repeated in full for each of the other five sense organs the six sense objects the sixfold consciousness sixfold contact sixfold feeling born of contact the six elements the five aggregates the four incorporeal jhanas and concludes with detachment from this world and all other worlds detachment from all things seen heard sensed and thought from all that is encountered sought and pursued in mindIn short detachment should be practiced as to the entire range of experience beginning with what for a dying person will be his immediate concern his sense faculties and their functionThis call for detachment drawing ever wider circles and repeating the same mighty chord of thought must have had a deeply penetrating impact and a calming liberating even cheering influence on the dying devotees mindThis was what Sariputta the skilled teacher obviously intendedAnd in fact his words had that impact because our text says that Anathapindika was moved to tears by the loftiness of the discourse one in profundity unlike any he had ever heard beforeAnathapindika passed away soon after and was reborn as a deity in Tusita HeavenRoman figures denote the number of the book and Arabic figures the number of the suttaThe division of the suttas in the Anguttara Nikaya is only numericalHere it is said that if one finds in oneself four qualities one can know for certain that one has lost wholesome qualities and that this is what has been called deterioration by the Blessed OneThese four are excessive greed excessive hate excessive delusion and lack of knowledge and wisdom concerning the diverse profound subjectsIf on the other hand one finds in oneself four other qualities one can know for certain that one has not lost ones wholesome qualities and that this is what has been called progress by the Blessed OneThese four other qualities are attenuated greed attenuated hate attenuated delusion and the possession of knowledge and wisdom concerning the diverse profound subjectsSariputta replies to questions put by his nephew Jambukhadaka who was a Paribbajaka ie a nonBuddhist asceticAs might be expected the Venerable Sariputta makes frequent appearances in the Jatakas the stories of the Buddhas previous livesIn these the Bodhisatta and Sariputta assume various roles in some existences we find Sariputta as the teacher and the Bodhisatta as pupil as for example in the Susima Cula Nandiya Silavimamsa Karandiya and Maha Dhammapala JatakasIn the lastmentioned Jataka however the Bodhisatta as pupil gives his teacher Sariputta a valuable lesson not to give the Five Precepts indiscriminately to those who have no desire to accept them nor the intention to observe themIn several births Sariputta appears as a human being and the Bodhisatta an animalSome examples are the Cula Nandiya Jataka the Romaka Jataka  where Sariputta as a wise ascetic instructs a partridge the Bodhisatta  the Bhojajaniya Jataka and the Dummedha JatakaIn other stories the roles are reversed as in the Jarudapana and Kundakakucchi Sindhava Jatakas where Sariputta is an animal and the Bodhisatta humanSometimes as in the Kurungamiga Jataka both are animalsThe following are summaries of Jatakas in which the Venerable Sariputtas previous personalities appearOn Sanchi Hill in Bhopal are the remains of ten stupas which are among the oldest buildings still standing in IndiaBy their architectural features and sculpture they have always been recognised as belonging to the high noon of Buddhist art the characters in which their numerous inscriptions are written placing them at about the period of Asoka that is some time around the middle of the third century BSome are in good preservation while others have been reduced in the course of centuries to mere mounds of earth and stoneIt was in one of these the now famous Third Stupa that Sir Alexander Cunningham discovered the sacred Body Relics of the Buddhas Chief Disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana inAt about the same time more relics of the two great Arahats were found in a stupa at Satadhara about six miles distant from SanchiOn sinking a shaft in the center of the stupa on Sanchi Hill Cunningham came upon a large stone slab upwards of five feet in length lying in a direction from north to southBeneath the slab were found two boxes of gray sandstone each with a brief inscription in Brahmi characters on the lidThe box to the south was inscribed Sariputtasa  of Sariputta while that to the north bore the legend MahaMogalanasa  of Maha MoggallanaThe southernmost box contained a large flat casket of white steatite rather more than six inches broad and three inches in heightThe surface was hard and polished and the box which had been turned on a lathe was a beautiful piece of workmanshipAround this casket were some fragments of sandalwood believed to have been from the funeral pyre while inside it besides the Relic various precious stones were foundThis casket contained a single bone relic of the Venerable Sariputta not quite one inch in lengthThe stone box to the north enclosed another steatite casket similar to that of Sariputta but slightly smaller and with a softer surfaceInside it were two bone relics of the Venerable Maha Moggallana the larger of them being something less than half an inch in lengthEach of the two steatite caskets had a single ink letter inscribed on the inner surface of the lid Sa for Sariputta on the southern and Ma for Maha Moggallana on that to the northIn Cunninghams words Sariputta and Maha Moggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha and were usually styled his right and left hand disciplesTheir ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life This is explained by the fact that the Buddha customarily sat facing eastIn the stupa at Satadhara one of a group which Cunningham noted was called locally Buddha Bhita or Buddha Monuments he discovered two caskets of pale mottled steatiteThese were inscribed like those at Sanchi Sariputtasa and Maha Mogallanasa respectivelyThis stupa showed signs of having been violated by robbers but the bone relics had been left undistrubedCunningham who is a very capable archaeologist has left a detailed account of everything his excavations brought to light in these and other stupas and it is thanks to him that the authenticity of the relics is established beyond all doubtThe relics from both stupas were removed to England and placed in the Victoria and Albert Museum but some discrepancies between Cunninghams description of the caskets and the actual boxes in which the relics were deposited gives reason to believe that he or someone else transferred the relics from Sanchi to the caskets discovered at Satadhara and what became of the Sanchi steatite caskets is not known for certainThe Sacred Relics were preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum until when the Maha Bodhi Society approached the British government with a request that they be returned to IndiaThe request was at once granted but owing to the outbreak of the second World War in that year the actual transfer was delayed for reasons of safety until Feb thOn that date they were handed over to the representatives of the Maha Bodhi Society at the Victoria and Albert Museum and so began their journey back to the land of their originBefore being restored to India however the relics were taken to Sri Lanka where they were received with great honor and amid general rejoicingFor two and a half months in they were displayed for public worship at the Colombo Museum where it has been estimated that well over two million people paid homage to themIt is said that not only Buddhists but Hindus Christians and Muslims joined in paying reverence to themThe next stage of their journey to the new Vihara that was being erected for their reenshrinement at Sanchi was CalcuttaThere the relics were displayed for public homage at the Dharmarajika Vihara headquarters of the Maha Bodhi Society of IndiaThe same scenes of religious devotion were enacted thereEvery day for two weeks an unbroken stream of people filed past the shrine where the relics were exposed from morning until late eveningMost of the devotees were Hindus but there was also a large number of Muslims among them and the reverence shown by all was a deeply impressive sightMany had come from distant parts to pay their respects to the remains of these great sons of IndiaNext came a request from Burma that the relics should be taken for exposition hereThis was readily grantedThe reception given to them in that country revived all the pomp and religious fervor of ancient timesIn order that everyone in Burma should be given an opportunity of worshipping them the relics were conducted on a riverine tour along the Irrawaddy from Mandalay to RangoonThe steamer that conveyed them was escorted by boats decorated in traditional Burmese style and at every town along the river the relics were taken ashore in procession for worship at the chief pagodaAt the same time religious meetings were held drawing vast crowds of people from the adjacent villages to hear sermons and the recitation of suttas which usually continued all through the nightSubsequently at the request of the respective governments the relics were taken for exposition to Nepal and LadakhAfter they were returned to India the Burmese government asked that a portion of the Sacred Relics should be given to BurmaThe Maha Bodhi Society of India agreed to this and the then Prime Minister of Burma went in person to Calcutta to receive themThey were ceremonially transferred to him on the th OctoberThe portion allotted to Burma was afterwards enshrined in the Kaba Aye Zedi built on the site of the Sixth Great Buddhist Council close to RangoonThe elaborate ceremonies connected with the crowning of the pagoda and the installation of the relics lasted from the th to th of MarchAnother portion was given to Sri Lanka to be enshrined in a new stupa built by the Maha Bodhi Society of Sri Lanka to receive themAt the time of writing they are housed in the temple of the Maha Bodhi Society Colombo awaiting the completion of the buildingOn the th November the remaining relics were duly enshrined at Sanchi on completion of the new Chetiyagiri Vihara built to receive themThere they remain objects of the deepest veneration to pilgrims from every Buddhist country and a lasting reminder of the lives of those in whom the Buddhas Teaching bore its finest fruitThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas PleasanceThe Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus and they replied to him saying Reverend Sir The Blessed One spoke as followsFive things should be reflected on from time to time by the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousnessWhat fiveWhen evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion arise in a bhikkhu through reflection on an adventitious object he should reflect on a different object which is connected with skillThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike an experienced carpenter or carpenters apprentice striking hard at pushing out and getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one should the bhikkhu in order to get rid of the adventitious object reflect on a different object which is connected with skillThen the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf the evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who in order to get rid of an adventitious object reflects on a different object which is connected with skill he should ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of miseryThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike a welldressed young man or woman who feels horrified humiliated and disgusted because of the carcass of a snake dog or human that is hung round his or her neck should the bhikkhu in whom unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the object which is connected with skill ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of miseryThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who ponders on their disadvantageousness he should in regard to them endeavor to be without attention and reflectionThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike a keeneyed man shutting his eyes and looking away from some direction in order to avoid seeing visible objects come within sight should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his pondering on their disadvantageousness endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards themThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards evil unskillful thoughts he should reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughtsThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinJust as a man finding no reason for walking fast walks slowly finding no reason for walking slowly stands finding no reason for standing sits down finding no reason for sitting down lies down and thus getting rid of a posture rather uncalm resorts to a restful posture just so should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts arise in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection regarding them reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughtsThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his reflection on the removal of a source of unskillful thoughts he should with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mindThen the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike a strong man holding a weaker man by the head or shoulders and restraining subduing and beating him down should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the source of unskillful thoughts restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mind with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palateThen the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinWhen indeed bhikkhus evil unskillful thoughts due to reflection on an adventitious object are eliminated when they disappear and the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within through his reflection on an object connected with skill through his pondering on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts his endeavoring to be without attentiveness and reflection as regards those thoughts or through his restraining subduing and beating down of the evil mind by the good mind with clenched teeth and tongue pressing on the palate that bhikkhu is called a master of the paths along which thoughts travelThe thought he wants to think that he thinks the thought he does not want to think that he does not thinkHe has cut down craving removed the fetter rightly mastered pride and made an end of sufferingThe Blessed One said this and the bhikkhus glad at heart approved of his wordsThus have I heard evam me sutamThis Discourse on the Removal of Distracting Thoughts was heard by me in this wayMe refers to the Elder Ananda who recited the Discoursecollection of the Pali canon at the first Council of purified ones held at Rajagaha after the passing away of the BuddhaBy the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness adhicittam anuyuttena bhikkhunaConsciousness connected with the practice of the ten courses of skillful action is referred to here as just consciousnessSuperior to that is the consciousness of the eight absorptions become a basis for the development of insightThis consciousness is the higher consciousnessConsciousness of the eight absorptions that has become a basis for the development of insight is meant here by higher consciousnessSome say that the consciousness associated with insight is the higher consciousnessBy one who is intent on means by one who is diligently occupied withThis bhikkhu is not intent on the higher consciousness the while he is going forth sittingmat in hand to a place near a tree in a jungle thicket at the bottom of a hill or on a slope with the thought I shall do the recluses duty He is also not intent on that when removing grass and leaves for the sitting place with hands or feetWhen however having sat down after washing his hands and feet he remains with legs crossed having taken up his preliminary subject of meditation he is indeed intent on the higher consciousnessIntent on means intent on producing the yet unarisen higher things and zealously developing to completion the higher things that have already arisenThe preliminary subject of meditation is the subject of meditation the bhikkhu is fosteringWhen he remains having taken up means when having taken up the preliminary subject of meditation he remains applying himself to itThough full absorption is not reached through the meditation he is still one intent on the higher consciousnessThings nimittani are practical methods  reasonable waysFrom time to time kalena kalam means on different occasionsIs not the subject of meditation to be reflected on always without putting it aside even for a momentWhy did the Blessed One say from time to timeThere are thirtyeight subjects classified in the textBy the bhikkhu who having selected one of these one which appeals to him and is seated there is no reflection on these five things so long as imperfections do not appearWhen an imperfection appears the danger should be driven away by means of these thingsPointing out this the Blessed One said From time to time The opinion of the objector is as follows Because it is said by him who is intent on the higher consciousness  and as the term intent on the higher consciousness means diligently applying oneself to the meditation without a break is it not the fact that the Blessed One began his exposition with the words these five things should be reflected on from time to time in order to point out the method of driving out danger to the meditation that progressesThe other stated that there are thirtyeight subjects of meditation in the text and so forth in order to point out that the Master said From time to time because these five things have to be reflected on at the proper time for the purpose of purifying the mind of the beginner devoted to inner culture when sometimes imperfections of meditation arise in himConnected with desire chandupasamhita means associated with desire associated with lustThe field and the object of these three obsessive thoughts should be knownThe eight kinds of consciousness associated with greed are the field of obsessive thoughts connected with desireThe two kinds of consciousness associated with hatred are the field of obsessive thoughts connected with hateEven the twelve kinds of unwholesome consciousness are the field of obsessive thoughts connected with delusionThe two kinds of consciousness combining with scepsis and restlessness indeed are equally the field of these obsessive thoughts connected with delusionTo even all three kinds of obsessive thought just living beings and inanimate things are the object since these obsessive thoughts come into being in regard to living beings and inanimate things viewed unimpartially by way of liking and disliking themLiving beings and inanimate things are unimpartially viewed by way of liking and disliking when the dear and the not dear are unequally seen are wrongly seenViewing unimpartially is the laying hold of an object with unsystematic attention through looking in ignorantly in a worldly wayHe should reflect on a different object which is connected with skill aññam nimittam manasikatabbam kusalupasamhitam means an object different from the adventitious object and one which is connected with skill should be reflected onHere the explanation of the term different object is as follows When a thought connected with desire for living beings arises the development of the idea of the unlovely is a different object and when a thought connected on with desire for inanimate things arises the reflection on impermanence is a different objectWhen a thought connected with hate towards living beings arises the development of the idea of friendliness is a different object and when a thought connected with hate for inanimate things arises the reflection on the modes of materiality is a different objectWheresoever a thought connected with delusion concerning living beings or things arises the fivefold reliance associated with the doctrine is the different objectAn object different from the adventitious object tato nimittato aññam nimittamA different new object separate from the cause for the arising of unskillful thought connected with desire hate and delusionOne which is connected with skill kusala nimittotamThe cause for the proceeding of states of consciousness that is with skillShould be reflected on manasikatabbamShould be placed in the mind should be thought upon as a meditation or should go in the mindfluxThe unlovely is indeed the unlovely objectWhen greed arises in regard to living beings with thoughts like the following This ones hands are beautiful This ones feet are beautiful one should think by way of the unlovely thus To what are you attachedAre you attached to the hair of the head the hair of the body nails teeth skin or urineThis body held up by three hundred bones bound with nine hundred nerve strings plastered over with nine hundred lumps of flesh wrapped completely in a wet skin covered with the color of the cuticle drips filth from the nine open sores and the ninetynine thousand pores of the hairs of the bodyIt is filled with a collection of bones is badsmelling contemptible repellent and is the sum of the thirtytwo partsThere is neither essence nor excellence in itTo one who thinks thus of the unlovely the greed connected with living beings is cast outTherefore the different object is the thinking on the object which produces greed by way of the meditation on the unlovelyWhen there is greed for inanimate things like bowls and robes it is cast out through reflection of two kinds of bringing about detachment for inanimate things namely those on ownerlessness and temporariness taught in the section of the enlightenment factors in the commentary to the Satipatthana SuttaTherefore the thinking on the object by way of the reflection of impermanence is the different objectReflection on ownerlessness and temporariness this bowl gradually ends up as broken pieces having changed color became old developed cracks and holes or having smashed up this robe having faded worn out will have to be thrown away with the end of a stick after it is used as a rag to wipe the feet withIf these had an owner he would prevent them from being destroyedIn this manner should the reflection on ownerlessness be doneAnd the reflection on temporariness should be done with the thought that these cannot last long that these are of brief durationWhen there is hatred towards living beings friendliness should be developed as taught in the discourse on the Overcoming of Illwill the instruction with the Parable of the Saw and the likeIn one developing friendliness hatred vanishesTherefore the development of friendliness for the object is the different objectThe discourse on the Overcoming of Illwill in the Anguttara Nikaya is as followsBhikkhus these are the five ways of overcoming illwillWhenever illwill is arisen in a bhikkhu it should altogether be overcomeWhat are the fiveShould illwill arise at any time in a person friendliness should be developed in him compassion should be developed in him equanimity should be developed in him the state of being without mindfulness and reflection should be developed in him Thus should illwill be overcome in that personIndeed these are five ways of overcoming illwillWherever it is arisen in a bhikkhu it should be overcome entirelyAnd the like similes like that of the firebrand from funeral pyreFriendliness should be developed having overcome hate in the manner taught in the above mentioned teachingsFurther when one gets angry with the stump a thorn grass or leaves one should ask oneself With whom are you angryOr who is it that is angryIs it the earthelement or the waterelementTo one who reflects on the elements anger in regard to inanimate things vanishesTherefore the reflection of the elements of the object is the different objectWhen however delusion appears in any circumstances there should be dependence on reliance on or the resorting to five thingsThey are as followsThe practice of living under the guidance of a teacherThe work of learning the doctrineThe work of inquiring into the meaning of doctrines learnedThe act of listening to the doctrine at suitable timesThe work of inquiring into what are and what are not causesThrough dependence on these five things or through resorting to these five expedients the element of delusion is eliminatedIn this way also a bhikkhus delusion is eliminated When he while learning too becomes energetic through the thought The teacher punishes him who does not learn at the proper time him who does not recite well and him who does not recite at allIn this way also a bhikkhus delusion is eliminated When he while inquiring from esteemed and respected bhikkhus after going into their presence Reverend Sir how is thisWhat does this mean dispels doubtsIn this way also a bhikkhus delusion is eliminated When to him the meaning of various passages becomes clear while listening carefully to the doctrine after going to a place where the doctrine is expounded to the publicIn this way also a bhikkhus delusion is eliminated While he becomes expert in discerning the cause of a thing from what is not its cause saying thus This is the reason for this this not the reasonFurther unskillful thoughts are surely eliminated in one practicing by any one of the thirtyeight subjects of meditation but the lust hatred and delusion which are eliminated by their direct opposites by what is contrary to them namely these five objects are thoroughly eliminatedIt is like this a fire may surely be put out after its being struck with firebrands earth and branches but when it is extinguished with water which is directly opposed to it it is extinguished wellIn the same way the lust hatred and delusion which is eliminated with these five objects are eliminated wellTherefore it should be understood were these statedBecomes energeticThe bhikkhu who is possessed of the desire for things like the asking of permission to go to the village becomes energetic and activeThe meaning of various passages becomes clear  to one listening to the doctrine the meaning of different passages explained becomes clear with the comprehension thus Here virtue is expounded here concentration here wisdomExpert in discerning the cause of a thing from what is not its cause by knowing for instance that the eye visible object light and so forth are the reasons for eyeconsciousness and not for earconsciousnessConnected with skillDependent on skill become a condition of skillJust withinJust inside the pasture that is just within the resort the subjectofmeditation of the bhikkhu devoted to the higher consciousnessCarpenter  joinerWith a fine pegA peg of heartwood finer than some peg one wishes to take out of a boardCoarse pegAn incongruous peg in a board or plank of sandalwood or of a heartwoodIn a board of heartwood  in a plank of sandal heartwoodAn incongruous peg  a peg standing incompatibly there in a board or plank of sandalwoodThe mind of the bhikkhu intent on the higher consciousness is like the plank of sandal heartwood the unskillful thoughts are like the incongruous peg the skillful object of meditation on things such as the unlovely which is different from the object producing unskillfulness is like the fine pegThe removal of unskillful objects such as the meditation on the unlovely is like the removal of the coarse with the fine pegIf the yogin who like a person shocked by the carcass slung round his neck by an enemy who has brought it thinks wisely by himself of these unskillful thoughts as blamable and productive of suffering in many ways the unskillful thoughts are eliminated in himBut he who is unable to think wisely by himself should see his teacher and tell the teacher about the troublesOr he should see his preceptor a respected fellowbhikkhu or the chief of the order for the same purposeOr he should ring the bell assemble even the order of bhikkhus and inform the order of the troublesFor at a meeting of many persons there surely will be one learned man who will explain to him who is troubled Thus should the disadvantages of these thoughts be understood or he will check these thoughts of the person troubled in meditation with the talk that is intended for the removal of desire for the body and so forthShould endeavor to be without attention and reflectionThose unskillful thoughts should just not be remembered not be dwelt uponOne should be occupied with something elseJust as a man who does not want to see a certain object shuts his eyes just so should the bhikkhu in whom an unskillful thought arises while he is meditating on the subject of meditation to which he resorts repeatedly occupy himself with something elseBy doing that his unskillful thought is eliminatedWhen that unskillful thought is eliminated he should again sit down to meditate on the subjectofmeditation he is keeping to preliminary object of meditation to which he repeatedly resortsIf the unskillful thought is not eliminated he should recite aloud some composition of doctrinal explanation he knows by heartIf when being occupied with something else in this way too it is not eliminated he should take out from his bag a manual if he has one in which the virtues of the Buddha and the Doctrine are written and by reading it occupy himself with something elseIf by that too it is not eliminated he should take out of the bag such things like the pair of firesticks and by turning his attention to them saying This is the upper firestick this is the lower and so forth occupy himself with something elseIf by that too it is not eliminated he should having taken out the receptacle by contemplating the requisites thus This is the awl this is the pair of scissors this is the nailcutter this is the needle occupy himself with something elseIf by that too it is not eliminated he should occupy himself with something else by darning the wornout parts of the robeSo long as the unskillful thought is not eliminated he should by doing various skillful actions occupy himself with something elseWhen it is eliminated he should again sit down to meditate on the subject he is keeping toComposition of doctrinal explanation  a composition helpful to the subjectofmeditationManualA book carried about and which is about the size of the fistBy contemplating  by concentratingBut building work should not be begunWhyBecause when the unskillful thought is destroyed there will be no time for reflection on the subjectofmeditationBut wise ones of old destroyed unskillful thought having done building work toono time because of the making complete of what is begunThe bringing to an end of what is begun or not beginning is the counsel of the elder This is a story connected with building activityThe preceptor of Tissa the novice it is said was staying at the great monastery of the city of TissaReverend Sir said the novice to the preceptor I am dissatisfied Then the elder said to the novice Water for bathing is scarce in this monasteryTake me to Cittalapabbata The novice did thatThere the Thera told him This monastery is very largely property made over to the use of the Order as a wholeMake me a personal dwelling placeGood Reverend Sir said the noviceHe began to do three things at onceThe learning of the Samyutta Nikaya from the beginning the clearing of a cave on a hill and work on the preliminary stage of practice on the meditation on fire and reached absorption in the subjectofmeditation learned the Samyutta Nikaya to the end and finished clearing the caveHaving done all he informed the preceptor about the completion of the tasksThe preceptor said Novice it was done by you with difficultyToday you yourself first stay thereThe novice while staying that night in the cave having obtained suitable weather conditions developed insight reached arahantship and passed away just thereHaving taken his bones they built a shrineTo this day that shrine is known as the shrine of the elder TissaWhile exerting himself in clearing the cave just to check unskillful thoughts in reciting the Samyutta Nikaya and in the practice of the preparatory part of the meditation on the firedevice for doing the work that precedes the function of seeing the truth through Streamwinning he accumulated the merit of the three kinds of skillful action of body speech and mindThe elder said Water for bathing is scarce in this monasteryTake me to Cittalapabbata having known the novices latent tendency and his particular meditationdeviceTherefore everything was effected according to his intentionThis is called the section dealing with nonattention on account of the explanation in it of the manner of checking the flow of unskillful thoughts by not attending to themHe again said If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu and so forth in order to set forth the section of inquiry into the source of the unskillful thoughtsThe section of inquiry into the source of the unskillful thoughts is the making clear of the source of the source of unskillful thoughtsHe should reflect on the removal of the thought source of those unskillful thoughtsWhat is forming is formation condition cause source is the meaningThat state in which there is stopping or ending is stopping or endingThis is stated What is the cause of this unskillful thoughtWhat is its conditionBy what reason has it arisenThinking thus the source of the unskillful thoughts and the source of the unskillful thoughts and the source of the source should be reflected on by the yoginJust as if bhikkhus a man should walk fast and then to him it should occur thus But why do I walk fastNow let me walk slowly And as if then he should walk slowly and it should occur to him thus Why do I walk slowlyNow let me standBut why do I walk slowly He thinks thus What profit is there to me by this fast walkingI shall walk slowlyAnd as if then he should walk slowly as if he having thought in the foregoing way should walk slowlyThis is the method of explanation throughoutThe mans walking fast is comparable to the bhikkhus entry into the state of unskillful thinking the walking slowly to the cutting off of unskillful thoughtconduct the standing to the descent of the subjectofmeditation into the bhikkhus mind with the cutting off of unskillful thoughtconduct the sitting down to the attainment of arahantship through the development of insight the lying down to passing the day in the attainment of the fruit that has Nibbana for its objectIn him who goes to the source and the source of that source of unskillful thoughts questioning himself thus Possessed of what cause due to what condition are the unskillful thoughts there is a slackening of unskillful thoughts when the slackening of unskillful thought conduct reaches its highest point unskillful thoughts are entirely dissolvedWhat produces unskillful thoughts is the source of unskillful thoughtIt is the condition for unskillful thoughts unwise reflection on the sensuously favorable etc taking them as lovely etcThe state indeed by which the production of unskillful thoughts ends is called the removal of the source of unskillful thoughtThe source of unskillful thought is the delusion of perceiving unlovely things and so forth as lovely and so forthTherefore it is said the source and the source of that source should be reflected onIn him who goes to the source of unskillful thoughts  in him who goes along the domain of knowledge by way of investigation to the root of wrong thoughts to the cause of their arisingThere is a slackening of unskillful thoughtconductIn him who knows according to reality unskillful thoughts do not continuously proceed as in the time before he knew trulyWhen the slackening of unskillful thoughtconduct reaches its highest point through arriving at a stable state graduallyUnskillful thoughts are entirely dissolvedEven all wrong thoughts go do not assail one or owing to the completion of the meditation are eliminated without remainderThe meaning should be brought out through the Daddabha birthstoryIt is said that a ripe vilva fruit having been cut off from its stalk fell close to the ear of a hare which was asleep at the foot of the vilva treeGetting up on hearing that noise it thought The earth is being destroyed and fledThe other beasts which were in front of him fled too seeing the hares flightAt that time the Bodhisatta was a lion and he thought The earth is destroyed at the end of an eonIn the interval there is no destruction of the earthNow let me after going from source to source find outThe lion questioned each animal separately beginning with the elephantWhen he came to the hare he asked Dear did you see the earth being destroyed The hare Yes lord The lion Come friend show The hare I am not able sire Saying Hey come dont fear the lion using gentle speech alternately with firm speech took the hare along with himThe hare standing not far from the vilva tree said May there be blessing to theeIn that place in which I stayed it echoedI do not know why it echoedThe Bodhisatta told the hare You stay here and went up to the treeHe saw where the hare had lain saw the ripe vilva fruit and looking upwards saw the fruitstalk from which the fruit had fallen and concluded as follows This hare whilst lying asleep here got the idea that the earth was being destroyed when he heard the sound of the fruit that fell near his ear Then he questioned the hare to see if the facts he had found out were trueThe hare said Yes lord confirming the lions conclusionsThe lion thereupon uttered this stanzaThe hare ran after the echoing sound of the vilva fruit that fellHaving listened to the hares words the army of frightened beasts ranAfter that the Bodhisatta comforted the beasts saying Dont fearThus unskillful thoughts are eliminated in him who goes from source to sourceIt is said that beneath the place where the hare was sleeping there was a huge rat hole  a big excavation made by rats  and that the fruit falling on the ground above it caused a loud soundWith the repetition of the words If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise the Master points out to the bhikkhu who fails to check the unskillful thoughts according to the instruction in the section of inquiring into the source of unskillful thoughts another methodWith clenched teeth with the upper teeth placed on the lowerThe mind by the mindThe unskillful state of mind should be checked by the skillful state of mindStrong manJust as if a brawny man  a person with great physical strength  should having caught hold of a weaker one by head or body restrain subdue and beat down that weaker person  make him wearied exhausted and to faint  just so should the unskillful thoughts be checked by the bhikkhu who wrestles with the unskillful thoughts having overcome them saying Who are you and who am I and after whipping up great energy saying Let the flesh and blood of this body dry up let skin sinews and bones remain To point out the foregoing meaning the Master gave the simile of the strong manThe unskillful state of mind  the unskillful state of mind with such things like sensual thoughtShould be checkedShould after overcoming be checked thus in such a way that in the future no unskillful thoughts assail the bhikkhuThe state of the nonarising of things should be produced is the meaningWhen indeed BhikkhuThis is called the division of summing upThe meaning of the phrase is even clearThe division of that which was pointed out from the beginning thus Five things should be reflected on from time to time by the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness by way of the summing up of the time of reflection of his object mentioned in the passageAs a teacher of archery having taught the art of the five weapons to a prince come from a foreign country spurs him on thus Go and take up the rulership of your country after showing him what ought to be done with the five weapons thus If robbers meet you on the way use the bow if that is destroyed or broken use the spear the sword and go And having done this having gone to his own country taken up the rulership the prince enjoys the fortune of sovereigntyIf to the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness objects productive of unskillfulness arise during his meditation he having established himself in the instruction of the section of the different object and checked those unskillful thoughts will reach saintship after developing insight unable to do it in that way he will do it by the instruction of the section on disadvantages unable to do it in that way he will do it in that way too by the instruction of the section of searching the cause unable to do it in that way too by the instruction of the section of restraining he will develop insight and reach saintshipHe is called a master of the paths taken by the turns of thoughtHe is called one who is expert of control in the paths taken by the turns of thoughts one who is conversant with the art of control in the paths taken by the turns of thoughtThe thought he will intendThis was said to show his expertness of controlFormerly he was not able to think as he wanted and thought what he did not want to think aboutNow owing to his expertness in the control of thought he is able to think as he wishesTherefore it was said The thoughts he will want to think those thoughts he will thinkThe thoughts he will not want to think those thoughts he will not thinkHe has cut off cravingThis and the rest should be understood as taught in the Sabbasava Suttanta CommentaryThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseSpiritual progress depends on the emergence of five cardinal virtues  faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdomThe conduct of the ordinary worldling is governed by his sensebased instincts and impulsesAs we progress new spiritual forces gradually take over until in the end the five cardinal virtues dominate and shape everything we do feel and thinkThese virtues are called in Sanskrit and Pali indriya variously translated by faculties controlling faculties or spiritual facultiesThe same five virtues are called powers if emphasis is on the fact that they are unshakable by their oppositesFaith is called the seed and without it the plant of spiritual life cannot start at allWithout faith one can as a matter of fact do nothing worthwhile at allThis is true not only of Buddhism but of all religions and even the pseudoreligions of modern times such as CommunismAnd this faith is much more than the mere acceptance of beliefsIt requires the combination of four factors  intellectual volitional emotional and socialIntellectually faith is an assent to doctrines which are not substantiated by immediately available direct factual evidenceTo be a matter of faith a belief must go beyond the available evidence and the believer must be willing and ready to fill up the gaps in the evidence with an attitude of patient and trusting acceptanceFaith taken in this sense has two opposites ie a dull unawareness of the things which are worth believing in and doubt or perplexityIn any kind of religion some assumptions are taken on trust and accepted on the authority of scriptures or teachersGenerally speaking faith is however regarded as only a preliminary step as a merely provisional stateIn due course direct spiritual awareness will know that which faith took on trust and longed to know Now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face Much time must usually elapse before the virtue of wisdom has become strong enough to support a vigorous insight into the true nature of realityUntil then quite a number of doctrinal points must be taken on faithWhat then in Buddhism are the objects of faithThey are essentially four the belief in karma and rebirth the acceptance of the basic teachings about the nature of reality such as conditioned coproduction emptiness etc confidence in the Three Refuges the Buddha the Dharma and the Order and a belief in the efficacy of the prescribed practices and in Nirvana as the final way out of our difficultiesI shall say more about them when I have dealt with the other aspects of faithIn this skeptical age we anyway dwell far too much on the intellectual side of faithshraddha the word we render as faith is etymologically akin to Latin cor the heart and faith is far more a matter of the heart than of the intellectIt is as ProfRadhakrishnan incisively puts it the striving after selfrealization by concentrating the powers of the mind on a given idea Volitionally faith implies a resolute and courageous act of willIt combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the selfconfidence that one can do itSuppose that people living on the one side of a river are doomed to perish from many enemies diseases and famineSafety lies on the other shoreThe man of faith is then likened to the person who swims across the river braving its dangers saving himself and inspiring others by his exampleThose without faith will go on dithering along the hither bankThe opposites to this aspect of faith are timidity cowardice fear wavering and a shabby mean and calculating mentalityEmotionally faith is an attitude of serenity and lucidityIts opposite here is worry the state of being troubled by many thingsIt is said that someone who has faith loses the five terrors ie he ceases to worry about the necessities of life about loss of reputation death unhappy rebirth and the impression he may make on an audienceIt is fairly obvious that the burden of life must be greatly lightened by belief in karma emptiness or notselfEven an unpleasant fate can be accepted more easily when it is understood as a dispensation of justice when vexations are explained as an inevitable retribution when law seems to rule instead of blind chance when even apparent loss is bound to turn into true gainAnd if there is no self what and whom do we worry aboutIf there is only one vast emptiness what is there to disturb our radianceSocially and that is more difficult to understand faith involves trust and confidence in the Buddha and the SanghaIts opposite here is the state of being submerged in cares about ones sensory social environment cares which spring from either social pressure or social isolationThe break with the normal social environment is of course complete only in the case of the monk who as the formula goes in faith forsakes his home To a lesser extent it must be carried out by every practitioner of the Dharma who must live apart from his society in spirit if not in factThe company of others and the help we expect from them are usually a mainstay of our sense of securityBy going for refuge to the Buddha and the Sangha one turns from the visible and tangible to the invisible and elusiveBy placing ones reliance on spiritual forces one gains the strength to disregard public opinion and social discouragementSome measure of defiant contempt for the world and its ways is inseparable from a spiritual lifeThe spiritual man does not belong to his visible environment in which he is bound to feel rather a strangerHe belongs to the community of the saints to the family of the BuddhaBuddhism substitutes a spiritual for the natural environment with the Buddha for the father the Prajnaparamita for the mother the fellowseekers for brothers and sisters relatives and friendsIt is with these more invisible forces that one must learn to establish satisfactory social relationsIn carrying out this task faith requires a considerable capacity for renunciationThis concludes our survey of the four factors which go into the making of faithLike other spiritual qualities faith is somewhat paradoxical in that in one sense it is a gift which one cannot obtain by merely wanting to and in another sense it is a virtue that can be cultivatedThe capacity for faith varies with the constitution of the individual and his social circumstancesIt is usual to classify types of personality according to whether they are dominated by greed hatred or confusionThose who walk in greed are said to be more susceptible to faith than the other two because of the kinship which exists between faith and greedTo quote Buddhaghosa As on the unwholesome plane greed clings and takes no offense so faith on the wholesome planeAs greed searches for objects of sensedesire so faith for the qualities of morality etcAs greed does not let go that which is harmful so faith does not let go that which is beneficialAs regards social conditions there are ages of faith and ages of unbeliefThe present age rather fosters unbeliefIt puts a premium on intellectual smartness so that faith is easily held to indicate nothing but a weak head or a lack of intellectual integrityIt multiplies the distractions from the sensory world to such an extent that the calm of the invisible world is harder to reach than everIt exposes the citizen to so great a variety of conflicting viewpoints that he finds it hard to make a choiceThe prestige of science the concern with a high standard of living and the disappearance of all institutions of uncontested authority are the chief foes of faith in our presentday societyIt is largely a matter of temperament whether we believe that matters will improve in the near futureAs a virtue faith is strengthened and built up by selfdiscipline and not by discussing opinionsIntellectual difficulties are by no means the most powerful among the obstacles to faithDoubts are inevitable but how one deals with them depends on ones characterThe first of our four articles of faith well illustrates this situationThere are many sound reasons for accepting the rebirth doctrineThis is not the place to expound them and I must be content to refer the reader to the very impressive EastWest Anthology on Reincarnation which JHead and SCranston have published inYet although belief in rebirth is perfectly rational and does not conflict with any known fact the range of the average persons vision is so limited that he has no access to the decisive evidence which is direct and immediate experienceThe rebirth doctrine assumes at least two things that behind the natural causality which links together events in the world of sense there are other invisible chains of a moral causality which assures that all good acts are rewarded all bad actions punished and that this chain of moral sequences is not interrupted by death but continues from rebirth to rebirthTo the average person these two assumptions cannot be proved absolutely conclusively and beyond the possibility of a doubtHowever plausible they may seem on rational grounds Buddhism teaches that they become a matter of direct experience only after the superknowledges have been developedThe fourth superknowledge is the recollection of ones own previous rebirths and the fifth the knowledge of the rebirths of other people by which one sees that whatever happens to them happens in accordance with their deeds There are many wellauthenticated cases of persons spontaneously remembering certain details of one or the other of their own previous lives and these people obviously have an additional reason for belief in rebirth which is lacking in those who cannot recall ever having lived beforeFull certitude on the issue is however given to those only who can on the basis of the fourth jhana and by taking definite prescribed and disciplined steps on emerging from that jhana recall their manifold former lives according to the wellknown formula There I was that was my name that was my family that was my caste such was my food this was the happiness this the suffering which I experienced this was the duration of my lifespanDeceased there I was born elsewhere and there had this name etc When a monk has practiced properly and successfully these things become as clear to him as if lit up by a lampUntil that time comes we cannot claim that we fully know the doctrine of karma and rebirth to be trueWe take it partly on faithAnd this faith of ours is maintained less by our dialectical skill as by the virtues of patience and courageFor we must be willing to wait patiently until we are spiritually ripe for the emergence of the superknowledges however far off that might seem to beAnd secondly we must be willing to take risksLife nowhere offers a one hundred per cent security and for our convictions least of allEmployed in gaining wealth a merchant must risk his propertyEmployed in taking life a soldier must risk his own lifeEmployed in saving his soul the spiritual man must risk his own soulThe stake automatically increases with the prospect of gainOf course we may be mistakenI sometimes wonder what I would think if on dying I would not as I now fondly imagine wake up on the Bardo plane but find myself confronted with Acheron and the threeheaded Cerberus or worse still were illtreated with fire and brimstone in a Christian hellThe experience would I admit be rather disconcertingAll that I can say in the face of such uncertainty is that I am willing to take the consequences and that I hope that my fund of boldness audacity and good humor will not run outOne has the choice to magnify intellectual doubts or to minimize themIt seems not unreasonable that one should blame the difficulties of the teaching on ones own distance from the truth ones own intellectual and moral imperfectionsHow can one expect to remember ones past lives if at present one cannot even recall hour by hour what one did during one single day a mere month agoIf one hesitates to accept as not immediately obvious the doctrine that this world is the result of ignorance and of the craving of nonexistent individuals for nonexistent objects  is this not perhaps due to the very denseness of ones own ignorance for which one can collect plenty of proofs all day longDoubts are effectively overcome when one purifies ones own life so as to become more worthy of knowledgeIt is a condition of all learning that one accepts a great deal on trust that one gives the teacher the benefit of the doubtOtherwise one can learn nothing at all and remains shut out from all truthTo have faith means to take a deep breath to tear oneself away from the daily cares and concerns and to turn resolutely to a wider and more abiding realityAt first we are by ourselves too stupid and inexperienced to see the tracks which lead to salvationSo we must put our trust in the Sages of the past and listen intently to their words dimmed by distance and the noise of the present day but still just audibleOne last word about tolerance without which faith remains raw and unsure of itselfIt is a perpetual trial to our faith that we should constantly meet with people who believe differentlyWe are easily tempted to wish this irritant removed to coerce others if only by argument and to annihilate them if only by dubbing them foolsIntolerance for people of other faiths though often mistaken for ardor betrays nothing so much as doubts within oneselfWe can of course always console ourselves by assuming that the others in their own way believe what we do and that in the end it all comes to the same thingBut that does not always sound very convincing and what we must I am afraid learn to do is to bear with their presenceNext to faith vigorLittle need be said about the need for being energetic if one wants to achieve somethingWithout vigor without strenuous effort without perseverance one obviously cannot make much progressEverybody knows what vigor is although a generation which made the fortune of the discoverers of nightstarvation might wish that it had more of itThe fact that faith and vigor are virtues does not however imply that they are good all through and that regardless of the consequences they should be strengthened at all timesExcess is to be deprecated even in virtuesAll the five virtues must be regarded as one wholeTheir balance and harmony is almost as important as the virtues themselvesThey support each other to some extent but they also stand in each others wayThe one must sometimes be used to correct the excess of the otherIn this way concentration must come to the rescue of the latent faults of vigorWhen vigor and energy have it all their own way tranquillity is in dangerWe all know people with a large dash of adrenalin in their blood who are always busy perhaps even madly efficient but not particularly restfulVigor by itself leads to excitement and has to be controlled by a development of concentrated calmSimilarly faith alone without wisdom can easily become mere credulityWisdom alone can teach what is worth believingThis can be illustrated by Don Quixote who in literature is perhaps the purest embodiment of faith and whose actions demonstrate that too much faith by itself is not necessarily a good thingCervantes novel gives a fine and detailed description of all the chief attributes of faithDon Quixote vigorously fearlessly without complaining and even serenely endures all tribulations because he wants to help others all of them equally according to their needsWhen he dashes into the middle of the boiling lake he reaches the very height of selfabandonment of which faith as such is capableAnd just when he does not know what will happen to him he finds himself among flowery fields beautiful beyond those of Elysium His faith has conquered the senses it transmutes the data of commonsense experience and the barbers basin becomes Mambrinos helmetAnd yet when we consider the intellectual basis of his faith we find that it consists in nothing more than a belief in the truth and veracity of the Romances which describe the fictitious and not particularly edifying doings of the knighterrants of the pastThis is the reason why his adventures form a sorry sight why he is a caricature even of a knight of the Middle Ages why shorn of all commonsense faith in this case becomes slightly pathologicalMrBlyth claims that the Don Quixote of the First Part is Zen incarnate that the man who surpasses Hakuin Rinzai Eno Daruma and Shakyamuni himself is Don Quixote de la Mancha Knight Errant Zen it seems like all good things can be abusedIt is not very probable that when the cloak of Zen is thrown over them all donkeys do become tigers all absurdities profunditiesIrrationalism is not without its attractions but can be overdoneTo suggest that one scripture one conviction one faith is as good as another smacks rather more of the spiritual nihilism of our present age than of the wisdom of SengtsanI admit that I have always liked Don Quixote for saying that the perfection of madness does not consist in going mad for some actual reason or other but in running mad without the least constraint or necessity But still I cannot help feeling that there is some difference intangible perhaps but nevertheless real between the perfection of madness and the perfection of wisdomDon Quixotes faith was a rather puerile one because he had no judgment and his vision was defectiveBlyth himself admits in the end that Don Quixote lacks the Confucian virtue of Prudence the balance of the powers of the mindI am not so sure about prudence but the balance of the powers of the mind is certainly not only a Confucian but also a Buddhist virtue and a very essential oneBuddhaghosa whom I am expounding here leaves us in no doubt on this matterWhat distinguishes a bhikkhu from a knighterrant is that he is essentially sober and calm that his view of the world is sweetly rational that he avoids violence in the pursuit of his aims and that his estimate of his own role in the world does not greatly exceed his actual size in relation to the universeA Buddhist owes his soberness to the cultivation of the third virtue of mindfulnessWhereas faith and vigor when driven to excess must be restrained by their counterparts ie wisdom and tranquil concentration the virtue of mindfulness does not share this disabilityMindfulness should be strong everywhereFor it protects the mind from excitedness into which it might fall since faith vigor and wisdom may excite us and from indolence into which it might fall since concentration favors indolenceTherefore mindfulness is desirable everywhere like a seasoning of salt in all sauces like the prime minister in all state functionsHence it is said The Lord has declared mindfulness to be useful everywhere for the mind finds refuge in mindfulness and mindfulness is its protectorWithout mindfulness there can be no exertion or restraint of the mind Although traces of it are not altogether absent in other religious and philosophical disciplines in Buddhism alone mindfulness occupies a central positionIf one were asked what distinguishes Buddhism from all other systems of thought one would have to answer that it is the dharmatheory and the stress laid on mindfulnessMindfulness is not only the seventh of the steps of the holy eightfold path the third of the five virtues and the first of the seven limbs of enlightenmentOn occasions it is almost equated with Buddhism itselfSo we read at the beginning of the Satipatthana Sutta that the four applications of mindfulness are the one and only way that leads beings to purity to the transcending of sorrow and lamentation to the appeasement of pain and sadness to entrance upon the right method and to the realization of NirvanaWhat then is mindfulnessThe Abhidharma guided by the etymology of the Sanskrit term defines it as an act of remembering which prevents ideas from floating away and which fights forgetfulness carelessness and distractionThis definition by itself though correct does not really make the function of this virtue very clear to us todayThe theoretical assumptions which underlie the various practices summed up in the word mindfulness are too much taken for grantedWhat one assumes is that the mind consists of two disparate parts  a depth which is calm and quiet and a surface which is disturbedThe surface layer is in perpetual agitation and turmoilThe center at the bottom of the mind beyond both the conscious and the unconscious mind as modern psychologists understand it is quite stillThe depth is however usually overlaid to such an extent that people remain incredulous when told of a submerged spot of stillness in their inmost heartsIn most cases the surface is so turbulent that the calm of the depth can be realized only in rare intervalsMindfulness and concentration are the two virtues which are concerned with the development of inward calmThe principal enemies of spiritual quietude are the senses the movements of the body the passions wants and desires and discursive thinkingThey have the power to be enemies when they are not subjected to any discipline and when the ego identifies itself with what takes place on the surface of the mind participating heartily in it and the illusion arises that these activities are my doings my concerns and the sphere in which I live and have my beingWhen thus busy with worldly things we have neither strength nor freedomIn order to conquer these enemies of spiritual quietude we must withdraw the senses from their objects as the tortoise draws in its limbs keep watch on our muscular movements cease wanting anything and dissociate all wants from the ego and cut off discursive thinkingBy an effort of the imagination one must try to see oneself at rest floating freely with no force exerted on ones spiritual selfThe practice of mindfulness then is a series of efforts which aim at maintaining this isolationMindfulness is the name given to the measures which we take to protect the patch of inner calm which may at first not seem very largeOne as it were draws a line round this domain and at its boundaries keeps watch on trespassersThe expectation is that conscious attention will disintegrate the power of the enemies diminish their number and dissociate them from the egoHowever diverse in nature the numerous exercises which come under the heading of mindfulness may seem to be they all have in common this one purpose that of guarding the incipient and growing calm in ones heartFirst as regards the sensory stimuli there is the restraint of the senses also called the guarding of the doors of the senses For two reasons sense stimulation may disturb inner calm because it gives an occasion for undesirable states like greed hate etc to invade and flood the mind because attention to the sensory world however necessary and apparently innocuous distracts from the object of wisdom which is the emptiness of dharmasOne cannot grasp what is meant by restraint of the sense dominants if one regards it as quite a natural thing that the mind should dwell on senselinked objectsThis is indeed most unnaturalIn its natural purity thought abides in the calm contemplation of emptinessThe mind which sees hears etc is a fallen mindThe capacity of senseexperience to compel the mind to act in a certain way is greatly diminished if each sensory stimulus is examined at the point where it passes the threshold of consciousnessAttention normally passive involuntary and compulsive is subjected to voluntary controlIn the process of imposing some control on the senses one will be surprised to find how keen they are to function how eager to find suitable objects with which to feed ones impulses and instincts ones hopes and fears ones interests and appetites satisfactions and grievancesIt is not so bad that one should see things hear sounds etc but it is a threat to spiritual health when one gets interested and entranced when one takes up what is seen and heard and seizes on it as a sign of what mattersThe practice of mindfulness is not confined to taking note of what enters the mind by way of the senseorgansOne also tries to determine what is allowed to enter and to generally reduce the number of sensory impacts by restraining the use of the physical organ for instance when one walks with eyes directed only a few feet or yards aheadIn addition by an effort of the will one refuses to cooperate with ones habitual impulses in building up a mere casual observation into a thing of moment to which one returns again and againFinally the intruder is weakened and worn down by appropriate reflectionsHe is kept out of the heart and devalued  as trivial as already passed as nothing in particular and by thinking that this does not concern me at all this means nothing to me it is only a waste when salvation and Nirvana are consideredSecondly as regards the muscular movements of the body  an unquiet body is a concomitant of a disturbed mind both its cause and symptomIt is important to mindfulness that one should consciously notice the position and movement of the body when walking eating speaking etc and suppress and correct those movements which are uncontrolled hasty and uncoordinatedThis practice can it is true not be carried out at all timesIn London traffic for instance the unhurried and unflurried demeanor of the mindful has little survival valueWhere however it can be applied we come to cherish this exercise which pulls us together sometimes to an amazing extent in an amazingly short timeInsignificant as it may seem compared with the splendors of Buddhist art and metaphysics this training is their indispensable foundation stoneIt is by his dignified and selfpossessed deportment that the bhikkhu is recognizedAnd of course we should not forget that the mindful attention to muscular movements includes the breathing practices which are a most fruitful source of insightWhere we have to face the disturbance of the passions and of stray thoughts in general the defense of our inward calm becomes more difficultMindfulness itself turns into incipient concentrationAt this point one may ask whether the practice of the five cardinal virtues from faith to wisdom is at all likely to be furthered by writing articles about themIt is of course not an entirely useless undertaking to guard the traditional teaching from current misunderstandings quite apart from the pleasure of putting fleas into peoples ears and fomenting discussions about the importance of faith or the value of eruditionBut what about the virtues themselvesThomas a Kempis once said that he would rather feel compunction than know the definition of itWhat matters to a Buddhist is that he should be strong in faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdom and what use to him is the knowledge of how they are definedDetailed advice on how these virtues should be practiced it is true can never be given in articles written for the general readerSuch advice must always be addressed to one person at a time must take their individual constitution into account and can therefore be given only by word of mouthOn the other hand if mindfulness is a virtue then the ability to recollect ones own virtues is also a feature of the Buddhist lifeAnd how can one attend to the presence or absence of mental states in oneself if one is unable to recognize them for what they areThe Satipatthana Sutta recommends systematic meditation on the wholesome and unwholesome mental states which arise in the mindTo quote the Sutta one knows for instance when there is vigor that there is vigor when there is no vigor that there is no vigor how the vigor which did not exist came to be produced and how and under what conditions it will grow to greater perfectionPsychology is so vital to Buddhist instruction because one cannot know anything definite about the furniture of ones mind unless one is acquainted with the categories into which mental conditions can be analyzedA mindful man is well informed about his own mental conditionHis capacity for introspection is highly developedAnd his interest in his own mind will not really make him selfcentered as long as he remembers that he has to deal with the rise and fall of impersonal processesIn addition in the case of the higher mental states rational clarity is imperative if constant selfdeception and wasteful groping in the dark are to be avoidedIn a new country a map is helpful so that one may know where one isThe manuals of mystical theology written by the practicing contemplatives of the Catholic Church are also rich in descriptions of the sublimer virtuesBut this is not allWhere the Buddhist virtues are described for a lay audience one must not omit to mention the allimportant fact that the upper ranges of these virtues demand a reformation of the conduct of life which is greater than almost any layman is willing to undertakeThe higher mindfulness and nearly the whole range of concentration and wisdom presuppose a degree of withdrawal from the world which is incompatible with the life of an ordinary citizenThose who are unwilling to achieve a radical seclusion from the world can practice these virtues only in a very rudimentary formIt is quite idle to pretend that they do not involve a complete break with the established habits of life and thoughtUnless we make the sacrifices involved in withdrawing from the world we are bound to remain strangers to the fullness of mindfulness concentration and wisdomBut if the monastic life is a necessary condition for these virtues why talk about them at allPartly because it is salutary though painful that we should see their absence in us and partly because they constitute the subjective counterpart of the scriptures which we readThe Suttas describe the world as it appears on a spiritual level on which concentration and wisdom have come to maturityThe understanding of the scriptures is furthered by an understanding of the subjective attitude which corresponds to themAnd so although we are forced to go beyond the range of our immediate experience and although the description tends to become more intangible as it rises to loftier heights we will now leaving aside the higher ranges of mindfulness try to explain the traditional definitions of concentration and wisdom as they are handed down to usConcentration continues the work of mindfulnessIt deepens our capacity to regain the peaceful calm of our inner natureBut here we are at once faced with the difficulty that in Buddhist psychology concentration occurs twice as a factor essential to all thought and as a special and rather rare virtueIn its simplest form concentration is the narrowing of the field of attention in a manner and for a time determined by the willThe mind is made onepointed does not waver does not scatter itself and it becomes steady like the flame of a lamp in the absence of windWithout a certain degree of onepointedness no mental activity at all can take placeEach mental act lasts strictly speaking for one moment only and is at once followed by anotherThe function of concentration is to provide some stability in this perpetual flux by enabling the mind to stand in or on the same object without distraction for more than one momentIn addition it is a synthetic quality that binds together a number of mental states which arise at the same time as water binds the lather of soapBuddhaghosa stresses the fact that intellectual concentration is also found in unwholesome thoughtsThe mind must be undistracted so that the murderers knife does not miss the theft does not miscarryA mind of single intent is capable of doing what it does more effectively be it good or badThe higher degrees of this kind of concentration owe much to the presence of the hunting instinct and can best be observed in a stoat following a rabbitIntellectual concentration is a quality which is ethically and spiritually neutralMany scientific workers have an unusually high capacity for concentrated thoughtAnyone acquainted with the scientific humanists who inhabit our big cities will however agree that their intellectual achievements are not conducive to either peace of mind or spiritual progressWhen Sir Isaac Newton boiled his watch instead of the egg his landlady had given him he thereby showed the intensity with which he focussed his mind on his intellectual taskBut the result of his intellectual labors has been to cast a dark shadow over the spiritual radiance of the universe and ever since the celestial harmonies have become nearly inaudibleAs HWLongfellow in his poem on The Arsenal at Springfield has put itHow then does concentration as a spiritual virtue differ from concentration as a condition of the intellectSpiritual or transic concentration results less from intellectual effort than from a rebirth of the whole personality including the body the emotions and the willIt cannot possibly be achieved without some discipline over the body since we must be able to endure the prescribed posture practice the prescribed breathing exercises and so onIt is further built on a change of outlook which we can well describe as ethical Tradition is quite unambiguous on this pointBefore spiritual concentration can be even approached we must have stilled or suppressed five vices which are known as the five hindrances sense desire ill will sloth and torpor excitedness and sense of guilt and doubtWhere these hindrances are present where concentrated thought is fused with greed the desire to excel to get a good job etc there concentration as a spiritual virtue is not foundIn this sense physical ease and selfpurification are the first two distinctive features of spiritual concentrationThe third is the shift in attention from the sensory world to another subtler realmThe methods by which this shift is effected are traditionally known as the four trances and the four formless attainmentsThey are essentially a training in increasing introversion achieved by progressively diminishing the impact of the outer stimuliAs a result of their successful withdrawal and renunciation the spiritually concentrated release the inward calm which dwells in their heartsThis concentration cannot be won however unless no attention is given to sensory data and everything sensory is viewed as equally unimportantSubjectively it is marked by a soft tranquil and pacified passivity objectively by the abstraction into an unearthly world of experience which lifts one above the world and bestows a certainty greater than anything the senses may teachThe experience is so satisfying that it burns up the world and only its cold ashes are found when one returns to itAnd so we come to wisdom the highest virtue of allWisdom is based on concentration because of the saying One who is concentrated knows sees what really is Is concentration then an indispensable precondition of wisdomThe answer lies in distinguishing three stages of wisdom according to whether it operates on the level of learning about what tradition has to say concerning the psychological and ontological categories which form the subjectmatter of wisdom discursive reflection on the basic facts of life and meditational developmentThe third alone requires the aid of transic concentration whereas without it there can be proficiency in the first twoAnd the wisdom which consists of learning and reflection should not be despisedThe main stream of Buddhist tradition has always greatly esteemed learningOur attitude to the apple of knowledge differs from that of many ChristiansOn the whole we regard it as rather more nourishing than banefulThe wisdom which is the fifth and crowning virtue is not the wisdom that can be found in the untutored child of nature the corny sage of the backwoods or the selfmade philosopher of the suburbsIt can operate only after a great deal of traditional information has been absorbed a great deal of sound learning acquiredThe required skill in metaphysical and psychological analysis would be impossible without a good knowledge of the material on which this skill ought to be exercisedFrom this point of view learning is perhaps less to be regretted than its absenceThe second stage after learning is reflection which is an operation of the intellectEven the relative beginner can greatly increase his wisdom by discursive meditations on the basic facts of lifeFinally it is on the level of mental development that this meditational technique reaches its maturity and then it does indeed require the aid of mindfulness and concentrationWisdom is of course only a very approximate equivalent of prajnaTo the average person nowadays wisdom seems to denote a compound made up of such qualities as sagacity prudence a welldeveloped sense of values serenity and sovereignty over the world won by the understanding of the mode of its operationThe Buddhist conception of wisdom is not unlike this but more preciseIt is best clarified by first giving its connotations and then its actual definitionAs for the connotations we read in the Dhammasangani On that occasion the dominant of wisdom is wisdom understanding search research search for dharma discernment discrimination differentiation erudition expert skill subtlety clarity reflection investigation amplitude sagacity a guide insight comprehension a goad wisdom wisdom as virtue wisdom as strength the sword of wisdom the lofty height of wisdom the light luster and splendor of wisdom the treasure of wisdom absence of delusion search for dharmas right view From mere cleverness wisdom is distinguished by its spiritual purpose and we are told expressly that it is designed to cut off the defilementsNow to the actual definition Wisdom penetrates into dharmas as they are in themselvesIt disperses the darkness of delusion which covers up the ownbeing of dharmasWhat then does wisdom meditate aboutWisdom may be held to concern itself with three possible topics true reality the meaning of life the conduct of lifeBuddhist tradition assumes that the second and third depend on the firstIn its essence wisdom is the strength of mind which permits contact with the true reality which is also called the realm of dharmasDelusion folly confusion ignorance and selfdeception are the opposites of wisdomIt is because ignorance and not sin is the root evil that wisdom is regarded as the highest virtueA holiness which is devoid of wisdom is not considered impossible but it cannot be gained by the path of knowledge to which alone these descriptions applyThe paths of faith of love of works etc have each their own several lawsAs the unfaltering penetration into the true nature of objects wisdom is the capacity to meditate in certain ways about the dharmic constituents of the universeThe rules of that meditation have been laid down in the scriptures particularly in the Abhidharma and a superb description can be found in the latter part of Buddhaghosas Path of PurificationMindfulness and concentration were as we saw based on the assumption of a duality in the mind  between its calm depth and its excited surfaceWisdom similarly assumes a duality between the surface and depth of all thingsObjects are not what they appear to beTheir true reality in which they stand out as dharmas is opposed to their appearance to commonsense and much strength of wisdom is required to go beyond the deceptive appearance and to penetrate to the reality of dharmas themselvesThe king said Is it through wise attention that people become exempt from further rebirth  Yes that is due to wise attention and also to wisdom and the other wholesome dharmas  But is not wise attention the same as wisdom  No Your MajestyAttention is one thing and wisdom anotherSheep and goats oxen and buffaloes camels and asses have attention but wisdom they have not  Well put Venerable NagasenaThe king said What is the mark of attention and what is the mark of wisdom  Consideration is the mark of attention cutting off that of wisdom  How is thatGive me a simile  You know barleyreapers I suppose  Yes I do  How then do they reap the barley  With the left hand they seize a bunch of barley in the right hand they hold a sickle and they cut the barley off with that sickle  Just so Your Majesty the yogin seizes his mental processes with his attention and by his wisdom he cuts off the defilements  Well put Venerable NagasenaThe king said When you just spoke of the other wholesome dharmas which ones did you mean  I meant morality faith vigor mindfulness and concentration  And what is the mark of morality  Morality has the mark of providing a basis for all wholesome dharmas whatever they may beWhen based on morality all the wholesome dharmas will not dwindle away  Give me an illustration  As all plants and animals which increase grow and prosper do so with the earth as their support with the earth as their basis just so the yogin with morality as his support with morality as his basis develops the five cardinal virtues ie the cardinal virtues of faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdomGive me a further illustrationAs the builder of a city when constructing a town first of all clears the site removes all stumps and thorns and levels it and only after that he lays out and marks off the roads and crossroads and so builds the city even so the yogin develops the five cardinal virtues with morality as his support with morality as his basisThe king said What is the mark of faith  Faith makes serene and it leaps forward  And how does faith make serene  When faith arises it arrests the five hindrances and the heart becomes free from them clear serene and undisturbed  Give me an illustration  A universal monarch might on his way together with his fourfold army cross over a small streamStirred up by the elephants and horses by the chariots and infantry the water would become disturbed agitated and muddyHaving crossed over the universal monarch would order his men to bring some water for him to drinkBut the king would possess a miraculous waterclearing gem and his men in obedience to his command would throw it into the streamThen at once all fragments of vegetation would float away the mud would settle at the bottom the stream would become clear serene and undisturbed and fit to be drunk by the universal monarchHere the stream corresponds to the heart the monarchs men to the yogin the fragments of vegetation and the mud to the defilements and the miraculous waterclearing gem to faithAnd how does faith leap forward  When the yogin sees that the hearts of others have been set free he leaps forward by way of aspiration to the various fruits of the holy life and he makes efforts to attain the yet unattained to find the yet unfound to realize the yet unrealized  Give me an illustration  Suppose that a great cloud were to burst over a hillslopeThe water then would flow down the slope would first fill all the hills clefts fissures and gullies and would then run into the river below making its banks overflow on both sidesNow suppose further that a great crowd of people had come along and unable to size up either the width or the depth of the river should stand frightened and hesitating on the bankBut then some man would come along who conscious of his own strength and power would firmly tie on his own loincloth and jump across the riverAnd the great crowd of people seeing him on the other side would cross likewiseEven so the yogin when he has seen that the hearts of others have been set free leaps forward by aspiration to the various fruits of the holy life and he makes efforts to attain the yet unattained to find the yet unfound to realize the yet unrealizedAnd this is what the Lord has said in the Samyutta NikayaWell put NagasenaThe king asked And what is the mark of vigor  Vigor props up and when propped up by vigor all the wholesome dharmas do not dwindle away  Give me a simile  If a mans house were falling down he would prop it up with a new piece of wood and so supported that house would not collapseThe king asked And what is the mark of mindfulness  Calling to mind and taking upHow is calling to mind a mark of mindfulness  When mindfulness arises one calls to mind the dharmas which participate in what is wholesome and unwholesome blamable and blameless inferior and sublime dark and light ie these are the four applications of mindfulness these the four right efforts these the four roads to psychic power these the five cardinal virtues these the five powers these the seven limbs of enlightenment this is the holy eightfold path this is calm this insight this knowledge and this emancipationThereafter the yogin tends those dharmas which should be tended and he does not tend those which should not be tended he partakes of those dharmas which should be followed and he does not partake of those which should not be followedIt is in this sense that calling to mind is a mark of mindfulness  Give me a simile  It is like the treasurer of a universal monarch who each morning and evening reminds his royal master of his magnificent assets So many elephants you have so many horses so many chariots so much infantry so many gold coins so much bullion so much property may Your Majesty bear this in mind In this way he calls to mind his masters wealthAnd how does mindfulness take up  When mindfulness arises the outcome of beneficial and harmful dharmas is examined in this way These dharmas are beneficial these harmful these dharmas are helpful these unhelpful Thereafter the yogin removes the harmful dharmas and takes up the beneficial ones he removes the unhelpful dharmas and takes up the helpful onesIt is in this sense that mindfulness takes up  Give me a comparison  It is like the invaluable adviser of a universal monarch who knows what is beneficial and what is harmful to his royal master what is helpful and what is unhelpfulThereafter what is harmful and unhelpful can be removed what is beneficial and helpful can be taken upThe king asked And what is the mark of concentration  It stands at the headWhatever wholesome dharmas there may be they all are headed by concentration they bend towards concentration lead to concentration incline to concentration  Give me a comparison  It is as with a building with a pointed roof whatever rafters there are they all converge on the top bend towards the top meet at the top and the top occupies the most prominent placeSo with concentration in relation to the other wholesome dharmas  Give me a further comparison  If a king were to enter battle with his fourfold army then all his troops  the elephants cavalry chariots and infantry  would be headed by him and would be ranged around himSuch is the position of concentration in relation to the other wholesome dharmasThe king then asked What then is the mark of wisdom  Cutting off is as I said before one mark of wisdomIn addition it illuminates  And how does wisdom illuminate  When wisdom arises it dispels the darkness of ignorance generates the illumination of knowledge sheds the light of cognition and makes the holy truths stand out clearlyThereafter the yogin with his correct wisdom can see impermanence ill and notself  Give me a comparison  It is like a lamp which a man would take into a dark houseIt would dispel the darkness would illuminate shed light and make the forms in the house stands out clearly  Well put Venerable Nagasena Milindapañha pp translated by Edward ConzeThe five faculties are faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdomHere what is faithBy this faith one has faith in four dharmasWhich fourHe accepts the right view which assumes renewed becoming in the world of birthanddeath he puts his trust in the ripening of karma and knows that he will experience the fruit of any karma that he may have done even to save his life he does not do any evil deedHe has faith in the mode of life of a Bodhisattva and having taken up this discipline he does not long for any other vehicleHe believes when he hears all the doctrines which are characterized by the true clear and profound knowledge of conditioned coproduction by such terms as lack of self absence of a being absence of a soul absence of a person and by emptiness the signless and the wishlessHe follows none of the false doctrines and believes in all the qualities of a Buddha his powers grounds of selfconfidence and all the rest and when in his faith he has left behind all doubts he brings about in himself those qualities of a BuddhaThis is known as the virtue of faithHis vigor consists of his bringing about the dharmas in which he has faithHis mindfulness consists in his preventing the qualities which he brings about by vigor from being destroyed by forgetfulnessHis concentration consists in his fixing his onepointed attention on these very same qualitiesWith the faculty of wisdom he contemplates those dharmas on which he has fixed his onepointed attention and penetrates to their realityThe cognition of those dharmas which arises in himself and which has no outside condition is called the virtue of wisdomThus these five virtues together are sufficient to bring forth all the qualities of a Buddha Akshayamati Sutra translated by Edward ConzeBy taking your stand on mindfulness you must hold back from the senseobjects your senses unsteady by natureFire snakes and lightning are less inimical to us than our own senses so much more dangerousFor they assail us all the timeEven the most vicious enemies can attack only some people at some times and not at others but everybody is always and everywhere weighed down by his sensesAnd people do not go to hell because some enemy has knocked them down and cast them into it it is because they have been knocked down by their unsteady senses that they are helplessly dragged thereThose attacked by external enemies may or may not suffer injury to their souls but those who are weighed down by the senses suffer in body and soul alikeFor the five senses are rather like arrows which have been smeared with the poison of fancies have cares for their feathers and happiness for their points and fly about in the space provided by the range of the senseobjects shot off by Kama the God of Love they hit men in their very hearts as a hunter hits a deer and if men do not know how to ward off these arrows they will be their undoing when they come near us we should stand firm in selfcontrol be agile and steadfast and ward them off with the great armor of mindfulnessAs a man who has subdued his enemies can everywhere live and sleep at ease and free from care so can he who has pacified his sensesFor the senses constantly ask for more by way of worldly objects and normally behave like voracious dogs who can never have enoughThis disorderly mob of the senses can never reach satiety not by any amount of senseobjects they are rather like the sea which one can go on indefinitely replenishing with waterIn this world the senses cannot be prevented from being active each in its own sphereBut they should not be allowed to grasp either the general features of an object or its particularitiesWhen you have beheld a sightobject with your eyes you must merely determine the basic element and should not under any circumstances fancy it as say a woman or a man But if now and then you have inadvertently grasped something as a woman or a man you should not follow that up by determining the hairs teeth etc as lovelyNothing should be subtracted from the datum nothing added to it it should be seen as it really is as what it is like in real truthIf you thus try to look continually for the true reality in that which the senses present to you covetousness and aversion will soon be left without a footholdCoveting ruins those living beings who are bent on sensuous enjoyment by means of pleasing forms like an enemy with a friendly face who speaks loving words but plans dark deedsBut what is called aversion is a kind of anger directed towards certain objects and anyone who is deluded enough to pursue it is bound to suffer for it either in this or a future lifeAfflicted by their likes and dislikes as by excessive heat or cold men will never find either happiness or the highest good as long as they put their trust in the unsteady senses Saundaranandakavya xiii  translated by Edward ConzeThe Lord When he practices the perfection of meditation for the sake of other beings his mind becomes undistractedFor he reflects that even worldly meditation is hard to accomplish with distracted thoughts how much more so is full enlightenmentTherefore I must remain undistracted until I have won full enlightenmentMoreover Subhuti a Bodhisattva beginning with the first thought of enlightenment practices the perfection of meditationHis mental activities are associated with the knowledge of all modes when he enters into meditationWhen he has seen forms with his eye he does not seize upon them as signs of realities which concern him nor is he interested in the accessory detailsHe sets himself to restrain that which if he does not restrain his organ of sight might give him occasion for covetousness sadness or other evil and unwholesome dharmas to reach his heartHe watches over the organ of sightAnd the same with the other five senseorgans  ear nose tongue body and mindWhether he walks or stands sits or lies down talks or remains silent his concentration does not leave himHe does not fidget with his hands or feet or twitch his face he is not incoherent in his speech confused in his senses exalted or uplifted fickle or idle agitated in body or mindCalm is his body calm is his voice calm is his mindHis demeanor shows contentment both in private and public He is frugal easy to feed easy to serve of good life and habits though in a crowd he dwells apart even and unchanged in gain and loss not elated not cast downThus in happiness and suffering in praise and blame in fame and disrepute in life or death he is the same unchanged neither elated nor cast downAnd so with foe or friend with what is pleasant or unpleasant with holy or unholy men with noises or music with forms that are dear or undear he remains the same unchanged neither elated nor cast down neither gratified nor thwartedAnd whyBecause he sees all dharmas as empty of marks of their own without true reality incomplete and uncreated Prajnaparamita ch translated by Edward ConzeThis is the morality which consists in the restraint of the senses Here someone having seen a form with his eye does not seize on its general appearance or the details of itThat which might so long as he dwells unrestrained as to the force of the eye give occasion for covetous sad evil and unwholesome dharmas to flood him that he sets himself to restrain he guards the controlling force of the eye and brings about its restraintAnd likewise when he has heard sounds with the ear smelled smells with the nose tasted tastes with the tongue touched touchables with the body cognized mindobjects with the mindHaving seen a form with his eye when he has seen a form with the visual consciousness which is capable of seeing forms and which in normal language is usually called the eye though it actually is its toolFor the Ancients have said The eye cannot see forms because it is without thought thought cannot see forms because it is without eyeWhen the object knocks against the door one sees with the thought which has eyesensibility for its basis In the expression one sees with the eye only accessory equipment is indicated just as one may say one shoots with a bowTherefore the meaning here is having seen form with visual consciousnessHe does not seize on its general appearance he does not seize on its appearance as man or woman or its appearance as attractive etc which makes it into a basis for the defiling passionsBut he stops at what is actually seenHe does not seize on the details of it he does not seize on the variety of its accessory features like the hands or feet the smile the laughter the talk the looking here the looking away etc which are in common parlance called details because they manifest the defiling passions by again and again tainting with themBut he seizes only on that which is really there ie the impurity of the parts of the body like Mahatissa the Elder who lived on Mount CetiyaOnce that Elder went from Mount Cetiya to Anuradhapura to gather almsIn a certain family the daughterinlaw had quarreled with her husband and adorned and beautified like a heavenly maiden she left Anuradhapura early in the morning and went away to stay with some relativesOn the way she saw the Elder and as her mind was perverted she gave a loud laughThe Elder looked to see what was the matter he acquired at the sight of her teeth the notion of repulsiveness and thereby reached Arahatship The husband who ran after her on same road saw the Elder and asked him whether he had by any chance seen a womanThe Elder repliedThat which might etc that which might be the reason or that nonrestraint of the faculty of the eye which might be the cause why in this person when he dwells without having restrained the faculty of the eye with the gate of mindfulness ie when he has left the door of the eye open such dharmas as covetousness etc flood him ie pursue and submerge himThat he sets himself to restrain he sets himself to close this faculty of the eye with the gate of mindfulnessAnd one who sets himself to do that of him it is said that he guards the controlling force of the eye and brings about its restraintBut it is not with reference to the faculty of the eye itself that there is restraint or nonrestraint and it is not concerning the eye considered as a sensitive organ that mindfulness arises or the lack of itBut it is at the impulsive moment that there is lack of restraint if and when immorality arises then or lack of mindfulness or lack of cognition lack of patience or lazinessNevertheless one speaks of the nonrestraint of the sense of sightAnd whyBecause when the mind is in that condition also the door is unguardedThe situation can be compared with that of a city when its four gates are unguarded then although in the interior of the city the doors of the houses the storerooms and private rooms are well guarded nevertheless all the property in the city is actually unguarded and unprotected and robbers can once they have entered through the city gates do whatever they likeIn the same sense also the door is unguarded when in consequence of the arising of immorality etc there is lack of restraint at the impulsive momentBut when morality etc arise at that moment then the door also is guardedJust again as with the city When the citygates are well guarded then although in the interior the doors of the houses etc are unguarded nevertheless all the property in the city is actually well guarded and well protected for the citygates being closed robbers cannot enterJust so also the door is guarded when morality etc arise at the impulsive moment The same explanation applies to when he has heard sounds with the ear etcThe restraint of the senses thus consists in short in the avoiding of the seizing of the general appearance etc of sightobjects etc which lead to ones being pursued by the defiling passionsAnd it should be achieved through mindfulnessFor it is effected by mindfulness in so far as the senseorgans when they are governed by mindfulness can no longer be influenced by convetousness etcTherefore we should remember the Fire Sermon which says It were better monks if the eye were stroked with a heated iron bar afire ablaze aflame than that one should seize on either the general appearance or the details of the forms of which the eye is aware The disciple should achieve a thorough restraint of the senses in that by unimpaired mindfulness he prevents that seizing on the general appearance etc which makes the consciousness which proceeds through the door of the eye etc with forms etc for its range liable to be flooded by covetousness etcAnd one should become like Cittagutta the Elder who lived in the great Kurandaka CaveIn that cave there was a delightful painting which showed the seven Buddhas leaving for the homeless lifeOne day numerous monks were wandering about in the cave going from lodging to lodgingThey noticed the painting and said What a delightful painting Venerable Bhikkhu The Elder replied For more than sixty years brethren I have lived in this cave and I have never known whether there is a painting here or whether there is notToday only I have learned it from you people who use your eyes For all that time during which the Elder had lived there he had never lifted up his eyes and looked more closely at the caveAt the entrance to the cave there was a large ironwood treeTo that also the Elder had never looked up but he knew that it was in flower when each year he saw the filaments which had fallen down on the groundAll the sons of good family who have their own welfare at heart should therefore rememberVisuddhimagga I   translated by Edward Conzeshould by means of this sign attend to another sign which is more wholesomeor he should investigate the peril of these ideas Unwholesome truly are these ideasBlameworthy are these ideasOf painful result are these ideasor he should pay no attention to these ideasor he should attend to the composition of the factors which effect these ideasor with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the gums he should by means of sheer mental effort hold back crush and burn out the thoughtIn doing so these evil and unwholesome ideas bound up with greed hate or delusion will be forsaken and disappear from their forsaking thought will become inwardly settled and calm composed and concentratedThis is called the effort to overcomeUnwholesome ideas may arise with reference to beings  be they desirable undesirable or unconsidered  or to things such as ones possessions or things which annoy like stumps or thornsThe wholesome counterideas which drive them out arise from the following practices which are directly opposed to themGreed about beings Meditation about the repulsiveness of the bodyGreed about things Attention to their impermanenceHate for beings The development of friendlinessHate for things Attention to the elements which of the physical elements composing the thing am I angry withDelusion about beings and thingsThese are the direct and correct antidotes to the faulty ideasHe investigates them with the power of wisdom and rejects them like a snakes carcassHe should not remember those ideas not attend to them but become one who is otherwise engagedHe should be like someone who not wanting to see a certain sightobject just closes his eyes when these ideas arise in his mind he should take hold of his basic subject of meditation and become engaged in thatIt may help him to break the spell of intruding thoughts and to occupy his mind otherwise if he recites with great faith a passage from the Scriptures or reads out a passage in praise of the Buddha or Dharma or he may sort out his belongings and enumerate them one by one these are the scissors this is the needle etc or he should do some sewing or he should do some good work for a given period of timeAnd after that he should return to his basic subject of meditationHe should analyze the conditions for these ideas and ask himself What is their cause what their condition what the reason for their having arisenHe should put forth great vigor and with a wholesome thought he should hold back an unwholesome one Majjhima Nikaya No and Papañcasudani translated by Edward ConzeThere are these five faculties monks the faculty of faith the faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration and the faculty of wisdomWhere can the faculty of faith be seenIn the four characteristic qualities of a streamwinnerWhere can the faculty of vigor be seenIn the four right effortsWhere can the faculty of mindfulness be seenIn the four foundations of mindfulnessWhere can the faculty of concentration be seenIn the four meditative absorptionsWhere can the faculty of wisdom be seenIn the Four Noble Truths Sutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraBy accomplishment and perfection in the five faculties one is an arahantIf the faculties are weaker one is a nonreturner if they are still weaker one is a oncereturner or a streamwinner or a Dhammadevotee or a faithdevoteeThus monks through the difference of faculties there is difference of result and the difference of results makes for the difference of individuals Sutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraThus monks he who practices the five faculties to their perfection wins to perfectionHe who practices them partially wins a partial resultNot barren I say are the five faculties Sutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraBut he who is entirely in any degree and respect without these five faculties stands outside in the class of ordinary men Sutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraThus I have heardOn one occasion when the Exalted One lived in the Eastern Cottage at Savatthi he addressed the Venerable Sariputta as followsDo you believe Sariputta that the faculty of faith if cultivated and regularly practiced leads to the Deathless is bound for the Deathless ends in the Deathless that the faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom if cultivated and regularly practiced leads to the Deathless is bound for the Deathless ends in the DeathlessHerein O Lord I do not follow the Exalted One out of faithThose by whom this is unknown unseen uncognized unrealized and unexperienced by wisdom they will herein follow others out of faithBut those by whom this is known seen cognized realized and experienced by wisdom they have no uncertainty no doubt about it that these five faculties if cultivated and regularly practiced lead to the Deathless are bound for the Deathless end in the DeathlessBy me O Lord it has been known seen cognized realized and experienced by wisdom and I have no uncertainty no doubt about it that the faculty of faith the faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom if cultivated and regularly practiced leads to the Deathless is bound for the Deathless ends in the DeathlessWell said Sariputta well said spoke the Lord Sutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraIt is through cultivating and regularly practicing one faculty that a cankerfree bhikkhu makes known his knowledge Ceased has rebirth fulfilled is the holy life the task is done nothing further remains after this Which is the one facultyThe faculty of wisdomIn a noble disciple endowed with wisdom faith that goes along with it is firmly established vigor that goes along with it is firmly established mindfulness that goes along with it is firmly established concentration that goes along with it is firmly establishedThis monks is the one faculty through the cultivating and regularly practicing of which a cankerfree bhikkhu makes known his knowledge Ceased has rebirth fulfilled is the holy life the task is done nothing further remains after this Sutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraJust as among all heartwood fragrances that of the red sandalwood is deemed best so monks among states that partake of enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is deemed best namely for the purpose of enlightenmentWhich monks are the states partaking of enlightenmentThe faculty of faith is a state partaking of enlightenment and it leads to enlightenmentThe faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom is a state partaking of enlightenment and it leads to enlightenmentAnd among them the faculty of wisdom is deemed best namely for the purpose of enlightenment Sutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraThus I have heardOn one occasion the Exalted One dwelt among the Anga people at Apana a town of the AngasThere the Exalted One addressed the Venerable Sariputta as followsA noble disciple Sariputta who has singleminded confidence in the Perfect One can he have uncertainty or doubt concerning the Perfect Ones dispensationA noble disciple Lord who has singleminded confidence in the Perfect One cannot have uncertainty or doubt concerning the Perfect Ones dispensationOf a noble disciple endowed with faith it can be expected Lord that he will live employing his vigor to the overcoming of unsalutary states and the acquisition of salutary states energetic with strenuous exertion unremittingly applying himself to things salutaryThis vigor of his O Lord is his faculty of vigorOf a noble disciple who is endowed with faith and employs his vigor it can be expected Lord that he will be mindful equipped with the highest mindfulness and circumspection and that he remembers well and keeps in mind what has been done and said long agoThis mindfulness of his Lord is his faculty of mindfulnessOf a noble disciple who is endowed with faith employing his vigor keeping his mindfulness alert it can be expected Lord that making the highest relinquishment his object he will obtain concentration will obtain unification of mindThis concentration of his Lord is his faculty of concentrationOf a noble disciple endowed with faith vigor and mindfulness and whose mind is concentrated it can be expected Lord that he will know this Without a conceivable beginning and end is this round of existence no first beginning can be perceived of beings hastening and hurrying on enveloped in ignorance and ensnared by cravingThe entire fading away and cessation of this very ignorance which is a mass of darkness this is the state of peace this is the state sublime namely the quiescence of all formations the relinquishment of all substrata of existence the extinction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbana This wisdom of his Lord is the faculty of wisdomThe noble disciple who has faith after thus striving again and again after thus applying mindfulness again and again after thus concentrating his mind again and again is now fully convinced These teachings which before I had only heard I now dwell in their personal experience and having penetrated them with wisdom I now see them This faith of his Lord is his faculty of faithWell said Sariputta well said spoke the Exalted OneSutta translated by Nyanaponika MahatheraImparting balance to the faculties is the equalizing of the controlling faculties of faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdomFor if the faith faculty is strong and the others weak then the vigor faculty cannot perform its function of exerting the mindfulness faculty its function of attending to the object the concentration faculty its function of excluding distraction the wisdom faculty its function of seeingSo the strength of the faith faculty should be reduced by reflecting on the phenomenal nature and by not paying attention to what has caused the excessive strength of the faith facultyThen if the vigor faculty is too strong the faith faculty cannot perform its function of convincing nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several functionsSo in that case the excessive strength of the vigor faculty should be reduced by cultivating tranquillity concentration and equanimitySo too with the other factors for it should be understood that when any one of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several functionsHowever what is particularly recommended is the balancing of faith with wisdom and concentration with vigorFor one who is strong in faith and weak in wisdom places his confidence foolishly in an unworthy objectOne strong in wisdom and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as a sickness caused by medicineBut with the balancing of the two faith and wisdom a man has confidence only in a deserving objectIf there is too much of concentration and too little of vigor the mind will be overpowered by indolence to which concentration inclinesBut if vigor is too strong and concentration too weak the mind will be overpowered by agitation to which vigor inclinesBut concentration coupled with vigor cannot lapse into indolence and vigor coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitationSo these two should be balanced for absorption comes with the balancing of the twoAgainOne working on concentration needs strong faith since it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorptionAs to concentration and wisdom one working on concentration needs strong onepointedness of mind since that is how he reaches full absorption and one working on insight needs strong wisdom since that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics but with the balancing of the two he reaches full absorption as wellStrong mindfulness however is needed in all instances for mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith vigor and wisdom which tend to agitation and from lapsing into indolence through concentration which tends to indolenceSo it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all curries as a prime minister in all the kings businessHence it is said It was declared by the Exalted One that mindfulness indeed is of universal use WhyBecause the mind has mindfulness as its refuge and mindfulness is manifested as protection and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without mindfulness Visuddhimagga Adapted from Bhikkhu anamolis translation The Path of Purification ppThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe philosophy of Buddhism is contained in the Four Noble TruthsThe truth of suffering reveals that all forms of becoming all the various elements of existence comprised in the five aggregates or groups of existence  also called the five categories which are the objects of clinging  are inseparable from suffering as long as they remain objects of grasping or clingingAll corporeality all feelings and sensations all perceptions all mental formations and consciousness being impermanent are a source of suffering are conditioned phenomena and hence notselfCeaseless origination and dissolution best characterize the process of existence called life for all elements of this flux of becoming continually arise from conditions created by us and then pass away giving rise to new elements of being according to ones actions or kammaAll suffering originates from craving and our very existence is conditioned by craving which is threefold the craving for sense pleasures craving for continued and renewed existence and craving for annihilation after deathThis is the truth of the origin of sufferingThe attainment of perfect happiness the breaking of the chain of rebirths and suffering through the realization of Nibbana is possible only through the utter extirpation of that threefold cravingThis is the truth of sufferings cessationThe methods of training for the liberation from all suffering are applied by following the Noble Eightfold Path of Right Understanding Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Living Right Exertion Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration of MindThe Noble Eightfold Path consists of three types of training summed up in virtuous conduct concentration and wisdomThis is the truth of the way that leads to the cessation of sufferingThe prevalence of suffering and absence of freedom and happiness is due to mans subjection to the three roots of all unskill and evil and all unwholesome actions vizlust hatred and delusionVirtuous conduct casts out lustThe calm of true concentration and mental culture conquers hatredWisdom or right understanding also called direct knowledge resulting from meditation dispels all delusionAll these three types of training are possible only through the cultivation of constant mindfulness which forms the seventh link of the Noble Eightfold PathMindfulness is called a controlling faculty and a spiritual power and is also the first of the seven factors of enlightenmentRight Mindfulness has to be present in every skillful or karmically wholesome thought momentIt is the basis of all earnest endeavor for liberation and maintains in us the sense of urgency to strive for enlightenment or NibbanaThe Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness the Satipatthana Sutta is the tenth discourse of the Middle Length Collection of the Discourses of the Enlightened OneIt is this version which is translated in the present publicationThere is another version of it in the Collection of Long Discourses which differs only by a detailed explanation of the Four Noble TruthsThe great importance of the Discourse on Mindfulness has never been lost to the Buddhists of the Theravada traditionIn Sri Lanka even when the knowledge and practice of the Dhamma was at its lowest ebb through centuries of foreign domination the Sinhala Buddhists never forgot the Satipatthana SuttaMemorizing the Sutta has been an unfailing practice among the Buddhists and even today in Sri Lanka there are large numbers who can recite the Sutta from memoryIt is a common sight to see on fullmoon days devotees who are observing the Eight Precepts engaged in community recital of the SuttaBuddhists are intent on hearing this Discourse even in the last moments of their lives and at the bedside of a dying Buddhist either monks or laymen recite this venerated textIn the private shrine room of a Buddhist home the book of the Satipatthana Sutta is displayed prominently as an object of reverenceMonastery libraries of palmleaf manuscripts have the Sutta bound in highly ornamented coversOne such book with this Discourse written in Sinhala script on palmleaf has found its way from Sri Lanka as far as the State University Library of Bucharest in RumaniaThis was disclosed while collecting material for the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism when an Esperantist correspondent gave us a list of a hundred books on Buddhism found in the Rumanian University LibrariesThe subjects dealt with in the Satipatthana Sutta are corporeality feeling mind and mind objects being the universe of right Buddhist contemplation for deliveranceA very prominent place in the Discourse is occupied by the discussion on mindfulness of breathingTo make the present publication of greater practical value to the reader an introductory exposition of the methods of practicing that particular meditation will now be givenMindfulness of breathing takes the highest place among the various subjects of Buddhist meditationIt has been recommended and praised by the Enlightened One thus This concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and practiced much is both peaceful and sublime it is an unadulterated blissful abiding and it banishes at once and stills evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise Though of such a high order the initial stages of this meditation are well within the reach of a beginner though he be only a lay student of the BuddhaDhammaBoth in the Discourse here translated and in the th Discourse of the same Collection which specifically deals with that meditation the initial instructions for the practice are clearly laid downHerein monks a monk having gone to the forest or the root of a tree or to an empty place sits down with his legs crossed keeps his body erect and his mindfulness alertEver mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in a long breath he knows I am breathing in a long breath breathing out a long breath he knows I am breathing out a long breath Breathing in a short breath he knows I am breathing in a short breath breathing out a short breath he knows I am breathing out a short breath Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in thus he trains himselfExperiencing the whole body I shall breathe out thus he trains himselfCalming the activity of the body I shall breathe in thus he trains himselfCalming the activity of the body I shall breathe out thus he trains himselfThese are instructions given by the Enlightened One to the monks who after their alms round had the whole remaining day free for meditationBut what about the lay Buddhist who has a limited time to devote to this practiceAmong the places described as fit for the practice of meditation one is available to all suññagara litempty house may mean any room in the house that has no occupant at that moment and one may in the course of the twentyfour hours of the day find a room in ones house that is empty and undisturbedThose who work all day and feel too tired in the evening for meditation may devote the early hours of the morning to the practice of mindfulness of breathingThe other problem is the right posture for meditationThe full lotus posture of the yogi the padmasana as we see it in the Buddha statues proves nowadays rather difficult to many even to easternersA youthful meditator however or even a middleaged one can well train himself in that posture in stagesHe may for instance start with sitting on a low broad chair or bed bending only one leg and resting the other on the floor and so in gradual approximation he may finally master that postureThere are also other easier postures of sitting with legs bent for instance the halflotus postureIt will be worth ones effort to train oneself in such postures but if one finds them difficult and uncomfortable at the outset it will not be advisable to delay or disturb ones start with meditation proper on that accountOne may allow a special time for sittingpractice using it as best as one can for contemplation and reflection but for the time being the practice of meditation aiming at higher degrees of concentration may better be done in a posture that is comfortableOne may sit on a straight backed chair of a height that allows the legs to rest comfortably on the floor without strainAs soon however as a crosslegged posture has become more comfortable one should assume it for the practice of mindfulness of breathing since it will allow one to sit in meditation for a longer time than is possible on a chairThe meditators body and mind should be alert but not tenseA place with a dimmed light will be profitable since it will help to exclude diverting attention to visible objectsThe right place time and posture are very important and often essential for a successful meditative effortThough we have been breathing throughout our life we have done so devoid of mindfulness and hence when we try to follow each breath attentively we find that the Buddhist teachers of old were right when they compared the natural state of an uncontrolled mind to an untamed calfOur minds have long been dissipated among visible data and other objects of the senses and of thought and hence do not yield easily to attempts at mindcontrolSuppose a cowherd wanted to tame a wild calf he would take it away from the cow and tie it up apart with a rope to a stout postThen the calf might dash to and fro but being unable to get away and tired after its effort it would eventually lie down by the postSo too when the meditator wants to tame his own mind that has long been reared on the enjoyment of sense objects he should take it away from places where these sense objects abound and tie the mind to the post of inbreaths and outbreaths with the rope of mindfulnessAnd though his mind may then dash to and fro when deprived of its liberty to roam among the sense objects it will ultimately settle down when mindfulness is persistent and strongWhen practicing mindfulness of breathing attention should be focused at the tip of the nose or at the point of the upper lip immediately below where the current of air can be feltThe meditators attention should not leave this focusing point from where the incoming and outgoing breaths can be easily felt and observedThe meditator may become aware of the breaths route through the body but he should not pay attention to itAt the beginning of the practice the meditator should concentrate only on the inbreaths and outbreaths and should not fall into any reflections about themIt is only at a later stage that he should apply himself to the arousing of knowledge and other states connected with the concentrationIn this brief introduction only the first steps of the beginner can be discussedFor more information the student may refer to the English translation of the Visuddhimagga by Bhikkhu anamoli or to Mindfulness of Breathing by Bhikkhu anamoli and to The Heart of Buddhist Meditation by Nyanaponika TheraThe lay Buddhist who undertakes this practice will first take the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts he will review the reflections on the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha transmit thoughts of lovingkindness in all directions recollect that this meditation will help him to reach the goal of deliverance through direct knowledge and mental calm and only then should he start with the mindfulness of breathing proper first by way of countingThe Buddhist teachers of old recommend that a beginner should start the practice by counting the breaths mentallyIn doing so he should not stop short of five or go beyond ten or make any break in the seriesBy stopping short of five breaths his mind has not enough room for contemplation and by going beyond ten his mind takes the number rather than the breaths for its objects and any break in the series would upset the meditationWhen counting the meditator should first count when the inbreath or the outbreath is completed not when it beginsSo taking the inbreath first he counts mentally one when that inbreath is complete then he counts two when the outbreath is complete three after the next inbreath and so on up to ten and then again from one to ten and so he should continueAfter some practice in counting at the completion of a breath breathing may becoming fasterThe breaths however should not be made longer or shorter intentionallyThe meditator has to be just mindful of their occurrence as they come and goNow he may try counting one when he begins to breathe in or breathe out counting up to five or ten and then again from one to five or tenIf one takes both the inbreath and outbreath as one it is better to count only up to fiveCounting should be employed until one can dispense with it in following the sequence of breaths successivelyCounting is merely a device to assist in excluding stray thoughtsIt is as it were a guideline or railing for supporting mindfulness until it can do without such helpThere may be those who will feel the counting more as a complication than a help and they may well omit it attending directly to the flow of the respiration by way of connecting the successive breathsAfter the counting has been discarded the meditator should now continue his practice by way of connecting that is by following mindfully the in and out breaths without recourse to counting and yet without a break in attentivenessHere too the breaths should not be followed beyond the nostrils where the respiratory air enters and leavesThe meditator must strive to be aware of the whole breath in its entire duration and without missing one single phase but his attention must not leave the place of contact the nostrils or that point of the upper lip where the current of air touchesWhile following the inbreaths and outbreaths thus they become fainter and fainter and at times it is not easy to remain aware of that subtle sensation of touch caused by the respirationKeener mindfulness is required to keep track of the breaths thenBut if the meditator perseveres one day he will feel a different sensation a feeling of ease and happiness and occasionally there appears before his mental eye something like a luminous star or a similar sign which indicates that one approaches the stage of access concentrationSteadying the newly acquired sign one may cultivate full mental absorption or at least the preliminary concentration as a basis for practicing insightThe practice of mindfulness of breathing is meant for both mental calm and insightDirect knowledge being the object of Buddhist meditation the concentration gained by the meditative practice should be used for the clear understanding of reality as manifest in oneself and in the entire range of ones experienceThough penetrative insight leading to Nibbana is the ultimate object progress in mindfulness and concentration will also bring many benefits in our daily livesIf we have become habituated to follow our breaths for a longer period of time and can exclude all intruding irrelevant thoughts mindfulness selfcontrol and efficiency are sure to increase in all our activitiesJust as our breathing so also other processes of body and mind will become clearer to us and we shall come to know more of ourselvesIt has been said by the Buddha Mindfulness of breathing developed and repeatedly practiced is of great fruit of great advantage for it fulfills the four foundations of mindfulness the four foundations of mindfulness developed and repeatedly practiced fulfill the seven enlightenment factors the seven enlightenment factors developed and repeatedly practiced fulfill clearvision and deliverance Clear vision and deliverance or direct knowledge and the bliss of liberation are the highest fruit of the application of mindfulnessThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was living among the Kurus at Kammasadamma a market town of the Kuru peopleThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu thus Monks and they replied to him Venerable Sir The Blessed One spoke as followsThis is the only way monks for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the four foundations of mindfulnessWhat are the fourHerein a monk lives contemplating the body in the body ardent

approved of his wordsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe essay that forms the first part of this booklet bears in its German original the title Pabbajja which in Pali the language of the Buddhist texts means Going forth namely from the household life to the homelessness of a Buddhist monkThe Pali word Pabbajja is also the term for the first ordination bestowed for entry into the Buddhist monastic Order by which the candidate becomes a Novice or Samanera like the author of the writings presented here whose illness and premature death deprived him of taking higher ordinationFritze Stange the lay name of our author was a German by birth and received his novice ordination in at Matara under the nestor of the German Buddhist monks the Venerable Nyanatiloka TheraTogether with Sumano a Dutchman called Bergendahl was ordained as the Samanera SuññoThey were the first two pupils of the Venerable Nyanatiloka who on his part had received novice ordination in and higher ordination in both in BurmaAs related in the Appendix of this booklet illness obliged Sumano to go back to Germany but in the same year he returned again to Ceylon together with the Venerable Nyanatiloka who had paid a short visit to GermanyHe took ordination again and then lived in the undulating grassy hillocks of Bandarawela in Ceylons upcountry  a landscape of ascetical bareness breathing seclusion and quietudeThere he died and was cremated in JanuaryA spout just by the spot where he lived still bears in the Sinhala language the name German PhihillaSumano was held in great reverence by the people for his deep pietyHe was of an unassuming nature but his bearing emanated an atmosphere of saintliness and detachment of maturity and gentle firmness which obviously must have set him apart from the multitudeThe same atmosphere of the true ascetics sincere and forceful simplicity radiates from the pages of his little book PabbajjaIts first publication in Germany in the year deeply impressed and inspired the members of the small circles of German BuddhistsAn English version by Bhikkhu Silacara appeared in Ceylon the same yearThis has been fully revised for the present edition after comparison with the German originalSumanos letters appeared in print in a German Buddhist magazine Die Buddhistische Warte and are published here for the first time in an English version prepared by the Venerable Nyanaponika TheraBoth essays and letters served first to justify and explain Sumanos unusual step of entering Buddhist monkhood in the EastThere is however nothing apologetic in his words no diffident defense they are rather a stirring call to kindred minds for proceeding on that hard but incomparably rewarding road towards the unshakable deliverance of mind In the same spirit they are offered here to the reader as a companion to another booklet in this series of Buddhist publications The Ascetic Ideal by Ronald FussellHe is beside himself Marvelous is it O Lord extraordinary is it O Lord how the Exalted One has so clearly pointed out the Four Satipatthana which lead to the purification of beings to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation to the cessation of pain and grief to the attainment of the path to the realization of NibbanaFor we also Lord as householders have from time to time fixed our minds upon the Four Satipatthana  Whilst we thus dwell with earnest minds eager unweariedly the memories of household things pass from us and as they so pass the heart grows ever more steady becomes quieted and unified finds peaceThe more frequently a man thus dwells all the more perceptibly does the alienation increase does the world die away from him for ever more clearly does the true nature of the world reveal itself to the mind through the persistent contemplation of this truth founded in experienceAlways the same law always the same songI know not Ananda even of a single form whereby pleasure and satisfaction in form does not pass into sorrow and lamentation pain grief despair since it is transient and changeable  and so with feeling and so with perception and so with the mental formations and so with consciousnessThis world however seeks pleasure loves pleasure prizes pleasureOnly a few beings are stirred by things that are truly stirring in comparison with the greater number who remain unstirred by truly stirring thingsAnd again there are only a few who being stirred earnestly strive in comparison with the greater number who being stirred yet do not earnestly striveUnrestrained by the perception of the hollowness of things flows on the hot stream of foolish desire O that no birth lay before us no old age no death no sorrow no lamentation no pain no grief no despair but this is not to be obtained by mere desiring and not to get what one desires is suffering Ahif only our parents would remain alive Ahif only our loved one would not die Ahthe misery of this law of natureHow many millions daily sob and weep over gravesThe misery of this law of natureWhat dear to one brings sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair attachment is the root of suffering Hence the uprooting of suffering is nonattachment the way of escape from all this wretchedness is nonattachment denial renunciationWhoso cleaves to woe follows after woe is bound up with woe and thus considers That belongs to me that I am that is my self  can such one really comprehend woe can such a one avoid the woe that encompasses him But he who withdraws himself from attachment and learns to renounce to deny and to turn away deprives the hearts pain of its nourishment and by degrees brings about its extinctionThe turning away of the will vanquishes all woeThis turning away comes into operation where there is an understanding of suffering of the arising of suffering of the cessation of suffering and of the path that leads to the cessation of sufferingBefore understanding these truths man hastens from birth to death in the sea of existence without deriving therefrom any true gain for his deliverance  worn out for naught the body perishes It is through lack of understanding and insight into the Four Holy Truths ye disciples that we had travel so long the weary round of Samsara  both you and What think ye which is greater  the floods of tears which weeping and wailing ye have shed on this long journey ever and again hastening towards new birth and new death united to the undesired sundered from the desired  this or the waters of the four great seasFor long have ye experienced the death of a mother for long the death of a father for long the death of a son for long the death of a daughter for long the death of brothers and sisters for long ye were harassed by disease and whilst experiencing the death of mother of father of son of daughter of brothers and sisters the loss of property the torment of disease whilst being united with the undesired and sundered from the desired thus hastening from birth to death and from death to birth ye have verily shed more tears on this long journey than all the waters that are held in the four great seasBut how is that possibleWithout beginning and without end is this Samsara unknowable is the beginning of beings sunk in ignorance who seized by craving ever and again are brought to renewed birth and so hastened through the endless round of rebirthsThus for long have ye experienced suffering experienced torment experienced misery and filled the graveyards  long enough truly to have become dissatisfied with all existence long enough to turn away from all being long enough to seek release from it allWho take this exhortation to themselvesThose whose minds are stirred by these thoughtsAnd being stirred they will learn to understand and will earnestly striveFor them delight and pleasure in the world gradually passes away they perceive the coarse as well as the subtle lures of Mara wearied are they of intoxication of selfdeception no longer do they shrink from the inevitable struggle for the overcoming of the world yea to this or that one the widespread misery in the world reveals itself to his mind so nakedly so powerfully that the cry for the end of it drowns every other voice Forth forth forth to the other shore Sunk am I in birth in old age and death in sorrow lamentation and pain in grief and despair sunk in suffering lost in sufferingO that it were possible to make an end of all this mass of suffering To such a comprehension to such a longing the meaning of asceticism becomes evident as that manner of living which really makes possible singleminded devotion to that most difficult of all tasks  the task of becoming perfectly good or pure or holy and thereby free from suffering and rebirthIf I truly understand the doctrine declared by the Exalted One it is not easy for one who remains in household life to fulfill point by point the wholly stainless wholly purified ascetic life Whoso lives in the house is busy overmuch is much occupied anxious about many things disturbed about many things he is not always entirely devoted to truthfulness not always and entirely zealous in self control chaste recollected given to renunciationThere has never been a householder Vaccha who without forsaking householdties has at the dissolution of the body made an end to sufferingTherefore whoso resolutely seeks the end After a time will leave behind a small property or leave behind a large property he forsakes a small circle of acquaintances or he forsakes a large circle of acquaintances and goes forth from home to homelessness  pabbajjaBut father and mother wife and children love and dutyThe sense of duty depends on understandingOnce a duty has been understood as the higher one it sets aside the lower conception of duty held formerlyFor years a man may have devoted himself to the care of wife and child prizing nothing higher than his familys welfareThen war comes to his countryThe course of events stirs him profoundly he is affected by new ideas another view of things gain strength within himSweet it is to die for the fatherland The feeling overpowers him What care I for wife what care I for child Of his own free will he goes forth to meet the foes of the fatherlandThe duty to his country now seems to him higher than the duty to his wife and childrenAnother man has in former days with full conviction solemnly vowed faithfully to stand by his country even to deathLater on in consequence of higher comprehension he gains a higher standpoint a wider outlook envisages politics as a citizen of the world thinks in universal terms This Frenchman is a fellow human being is a fellow suffererThis Russian is a fellow human being is a fellow suffererLife is a sacred thing frightful barbaric is this wholesale killing called war  the visible aggravation of suffering No longer can he slay his fellowmenIn case of a call to arms he willingly allows himself to be shot by his own countrymenThe duty Thou shalt not kill stands higher in his eyes than any duty towards his fatherlandYet another as pastor for many a year enjoyed a secure living with his familyBy degrees his views undergo a changeHe finds himself unable any longer to give his assent to dogmas to the doctrines of Revelation of Grace or of Forgiveness of Sins or Vicarious Atonement he can no longer believe in that deplorable and absurd doctrine of eternal damnation for the deeds of a brief spell of thirty years A higher knowledge has come to fruition within himClear and evident to him has become the universally ruling law the unchangeable equable relation of cause and effect the unfailingly just recompensations of right or wrong actionHe burdens his mind neither with thoughts about the unfathomable nor with useless discussions he go on preaching as beforeHe will follow his altered convictions give up his position as pastor  come what mayWhoso acts according to his deepest understanding is always straight and candid ever acts in accordance with truth  at least relatively so for a mans truth is his degree of understandingTo a man now who has clearly perceived the pitiable condition of all beings that share a common existence what higher holier or more urgent task can there be than to become perfectly kind perfectly good or holy and thereby to get himself cured of this being born growing old and dying of this sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHence if he has truly recognized the significance and value of asceticism for the fulfillment of this highest duty and experienced the impossibility of its perfect realization in household life there follows the going forth into homelessness as necessarily as the fall of the drop that is fullNo man can serve two masters  fully wellThe man who devotedly strives for the fulfillment of the Doctrine experiences intensely the unsatisfactoriness of divided allegianceHence after a time he gives it up for the blessing of himself as well as of his family an inward law of development that is beyond disputeOnly a mother knows the pangs of childbirth and only a mother knows the succeeding joys of motherhoodOnly he who has left home knows the relief of relinquishing accustomed bonds only he who has left home knows the happiness of being free an inward experience  indisputableThe joys of the family life and the joys of the homeless life  these are two different joys and the nobler of the two is the joy the homeless lifeIf millions of honest men in worldly life find Pabbajja the Going Forth obnoxious if they condemn the incomprehensible act as wrong as unnatural or deplore it as a mental aberration they are quite right from their own standpoint no intelligent man will contradict themThey act in accordance with their conception of duty and are great great in their place if before all things they care for beloved parents for wife and children and strive to fulfill the manifold important duties laid upon them by their life in the worldAlso the few who have a bent for the ascetic life and honestly long for it but feel themselves bound one way or another to their wanted way of life and therefore remain in its bondage  they also are right from their own standpointSo also are those individuals right who go forth being no longer bound inwardlyIt is not the outward circumstances that bind a man by himself is man really bound by himself is he really freeBy logic by reasoning or by eloquent words alone that act of going forth into homelessness can certainly not be argued or explainedBut whoso sees this law whoso sees this truth no longer asks for proofQuietly and with confidence he actsWhat the world says about it leaves him unconcernedThere are two goals the holy goal and the unholy goalBut what is the unholy goalOne himself subject to birth seeks what also is subject to birth himself subject to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilement seeks what also is subject to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilementBut what is subject to birth old age sickness death pain and defilementWife and child are subject to birth old age sickness death pain and defilement servant and maid lamb and goat gold and silver are subject to birth old age sickness death pain and defilementSubject to birth old age sickness death pain to defilement are these thingsAnd allured blinded enchanted a man himself subject to birth to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilement seeks what also is subject to birth old age sickness death to pain to defilementThis is the unholy goalBut what is the holy goalOne himself subject to birth perceiving the misery of this law of nature seeks that which is free from birth the incomparable surety of Nibbana subject to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilement perceiving the misery of this law of nature seeks that which is free from old age sickness death pain and defilement the incomparable surety of NibbanaThis is the holy goalFormerly when but a Bodhisatta myself subject to birth I sought what also was subject to birth myself subject to old age sickness death pain defilement sought what also was subject to old age sickness death pain defilementAnd it occurred to me as follows Why myself subject to birth old age sickness death pain defilement do I seek what also is subject to birth old age sickness death pain defilementWhat if now myself subject to birth perceiving the misery of this law of nature I were to seek the incomparable surety of Nibbana free from birth myself subject to old age sickness death pain defilement perceiving the misery of this law of nature I were to seek the incomparable surety of Nibbana free from old age sickness death pain defilementAnd after a time while still young with coalblack hair possessed of radiant youth in the prime of my life against the wish of my weeping and wailing parents I had my hair and beard shaved off put on the yellow robe and went forth from the household life to the houseless one Whoso well in time sees the holy goal with penetrating clearness he can no longer tie matrimonial bondsWhether however a man be old or young whether he be married or not  at whatever period of his life the urge in him for the ascetic life asserts itself then along with the other bonds binding to the worldly life the bonds of blood relationship also lose their forceThe mother has become an elder sister the father has become a brother the wife has become a sister the son has become a brother fellow beings fellow sufferersAttachment longing have died away alienation has set inSuch a one has no longer a place and use in the familyAnother law works in the members a wider loveIn love the ascetic goes forth from the family out of love he leaves itTruly difficult to understand is the love in genuine ascetic mind yet relatives also learn to understand itAnd if the families out of which those noble men have gone forth from home into homelessness think of these noble men with love for long will it make for their weal and happinessJust as a man who out of true feelings gives alms at the same time makes richer his family though to outward appearance that family may suffer some loss in goods or money so truly bestows a householder a rich treasure to an understanding family if in a right frame of mind moved by the highest of duties he renounces the worldly life even though that family may lose its external supportThis loss which not seldom is brought about by premature death can be made good and is unessential but essential is awakening from the slumber thoughtfulness insight the perspective of Anatta turning away detachment  that is what mattersNaught is the loss of relatives riches and honor but the loss of insight is the heaviest lossNaught is the gain of relatives riches and honor but the gain of insight  that is the highest gainWherefore let your endeavor be Insight will be gainLet this be your endeavorAnd the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji had heard it said The monk Sangamaji has arrived in Savatthi Then she took her child and went to the monastery at the Jeta Grove near SavatthiAt that time however the venerable Sangamaji sat at the foot of a tree to spend the afternoon there devoted to meditationThen the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji betook herself thither and spoke to the venerable Sangamaji Look at thy little son here O asceticGive me food But to these words the venerable Sangamaji maintained silenceA second and a third time the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji so spoke Look at thy little son hereGive me food And a second and a third time did the venerable Sangamaji preserve silenceThen the wife of the venerable Sangamaji laid the child down in front of the venerable Sangamaji and went away saying There is thy son O ascetic give him food The venerable Sangamaji however neither looked at the child nor uttered a wordNow when the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji having gone some distance turned round she saw that the venerable Sangamaji neither looked at the child nor said anythingThen she thought This ascetic cares not even for his child turned back took up the child and went awayIf any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my discipleWhosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple Luke and Think not that I come to send peace on peace I came not to send peace but a swordFor I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughterinlaw against her motherinlawAnd a mans foes shall be they of his own householdHe that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me Matthew XLet the dead bury their dead Luke IXMy kingdom is not of this world John Apart from the differences existing between the teachings of the Buddha and of the Christ all these sayings have these ideas in commonVoid throughout is this worldWhoso hungers and thirsts to overcome this world will loosen all earthly bonds count them but dirtCommentators and scribes there are in abundance but whoso has eyes will seeDay after day twentyfour hours older a hundred thousand heart beats nearer to the grave inevitablyO put all wishes aside save the desire to know truth recognize the truth and tell it come what may Whoso does not act in that way deceives himself and othersWhoso shrinks from the decision that truth demands puts obstacles in the way of himself and others though it may not always be obviousPut not thy trust in friends or relatives and put not off thy salvation till the future for man will forget thee sooner than thou thinkestIt is better to provide now in time and do the right than to trust to help of anotherIf thou art not solicitous for thee in the futureNow is the time very precious now is the day of salvation Thomas a KempisNone can do for another what is needed for deliveranceHere each has to rely on himself aloneConcern for oneself in that sense is far from being reprehensible egotismIt has nothing to do with the oppression or exploitation of others with harshness towards othersOnce Lord in an hour of solitude and retirement the following thoughts came to me To whom is ones self dear to whom is it not dear And this Lord occurred to me Those who do and speak and think evilly to these their self is not dearAnd even though they say We love ourselves yet they do not love themselvesAnd why notWhatsoever unlovely thing they do to one unbeloved that they do to their own selvesTherefore is it that their self is not dear to themThose however who act and speak and think rightly to them their self is dearAnd even though they may say We love not ourselves yet they do love themselvesAnd whyWhatsoever lovely thing they do to one beloved that they do to their own selvesTherefore is it that their self is dear to them  That is so great kingNot only is such true care for oneself unreprehensible but it is the only way to become hale and holy oneself and to help others to become likewiseA man may do ever so much good and take upon himself ever so many abnegations and yet as long as he does not know himself he will not reach deliverance  The only limitations he imposes upon himself are those arising from not knowing himselfIn the degree however that he knows himself he is able to do greatest service a man can render for another namely to help him to help himself to bring him to a true knowledge of himself of his own inner power Hence the more ardently a man devotes himself to the work of his own deliverance all the sooner and more effectively can he become a blessing to others for all the sooner can he learn and experience what will help himself and others to win true deliverance the laws for it are the same for allAny other helpful action however meritorious it may be is concerned with things external not with the world withinCan the blind lead the blindShall they not both fall into the ditch Whoso has ever offered to others bread for stones has first of all labored within himself lonely apart untiringly ardent and resoluteThe inward worker who has lived the truth speaks from experience with the assurance of an expert So it is he says and not So it may be Therefore his words produce in susceptible minds an inner crisis never experienced before a crisis severe but wholesome The word of the wise heals As is the speech of the inwards worker so is his outward behavior true straight and firm serene aloof uncommonSuch venerable ones are the greatest benefactors of their fellow men the best physicians visible witnesses of the fact that detachment from the world is possible by their very lives they point to the way by which that what continually produces and feeds new suffering can be eliminatedTherefore whether householder or monk  above all win to a true vision for thyselfKnow thyself  Be ever mindful of thyselfThat Cunda one himself sunk into the mire should pull out of the mire another sunk therein  this cannot beBut that one himself not sunk in the mire can lift out of the mire another sunk therein  that may beAnd that one himself not subdued not disciplined not attained to the extinction of delusion should lead others to become subdued and disciplined to attain to the extinction of delusion  this cannot beBut that one who himself is subdued and disciplined and has attained to the extinction of delusion should lead others also to become subdued and disciplined and to attain to the extinction of delusion  this may well beThe most likely possibility of escape from the mire of ignorance is offered by the life of a tree monkThough the Buddhas Teaching has been described as running counter to the common current profound subtle and hard to realize there are those in the world who on hearing that Teaching feel irresistibly attracted to the monk lifeThere are those who once they become aware of the general misery of life and of the way of the speediest release from it lay everything else aside and without delay go forth into the homeless life  their insight needed only to be roused Others again are able after a severe struggle to break up all bridges behind themDeeprooted desires and ideas coarse or subtle so strongly ingrained in ordinary life may obstruct for long an appreciation of the ascetic life hence people are not in a hurry to turn to it and the strength of character needed for renunciation is lackingEven that state of mind Mahanama still exists in thee and causes thy heart to be overpowered at times by impulses of desire by impulses of anger by impulses of delusionFor Mahanama if that state of mind no longer had any place in thee thou wouldst not remain in the home life in the enjoyment of desiresIt is quite true that noble characters can be found everywhere in society also in family life it is true that not a few householders die more ennobled in mind than many a monk it is true that an earnest devoted disciple by virtue of an unusually developed character due to his good Kamma of the past may without abandoning household ties attain to almost all stages of holiness that is up to the stage of the nonreturnerBut no one who knows will maintain that he who is determined to make an end of suffering may to the same effect remain in the household life as lead the life of a monkOn the contrary the wisest of all times teach that such a man will choose a mode of life detached from all worldly bonds he will go the road that offers the least resistance to his aspirationsSeparation isolation again and again is necessary for bringing suffering to an endJust as the steam which is asleep in the water and awakened by fire does not develop its giant strength does not become a concentrated power unless it is shut in likewise mans inner potentialities for lack of seclusion for lack of isolation cannot develop cannot be converted into higher powersMany live far below their possibilities because they continually surrender their individualities to others In the worldly life full selfrecollectedness full devotion to the goal do not come easilyThe chaotic mass of uncontrolled impressions will divert and distract again and again and will lead astraySadly great is the sum of energy daily expended to no profitIn home life too much nutriment gross or subtle is supplied by the world of the five senses and this will ever and again disturb those thoughts that in the nobleminded are naturally directed towards higher things hence there is only very slow progress in discarding and uprooting obstructing qualities and evil propensities of the mindQuite different is it in the homeless state in a life of solitudeThere man is as it were forsaken by all the world and thrown back entirely upon himself without palliatives and selfdeceptionsThere he learns to be profoundly ashamed of all that is base and feels himself impelled to strive for progress mindfully he breathes in mindfully he breathes out and he wins to the insight that frees from sufferingIn secluded places  in the depth of the forest in a lonely cottage a mountain cave a cemetery  the five senses in the absence of their usual objects of craving are as it were put out of action and the sixth sense the mind alone detached undisturbed effectively collected can do its work can understand the workings of greed hatred and delusion can reject themWhat are the characteristics of those venerable ones what is so special to them that people should say of them Truly these venerable ones have lost greed and hatred and delusion or are on the way to overcome themThis question may be answered thus Those venerable ones seek out lonely places in the depth of the forest There are not to be found any forms entering the field of vision that can be looked at and craved for no sounds entering the field of hearing to be listened to and craved for no odors entering the field of smell to be smelled and craved for no flavors entering the field of taste that can be tasted and craved for no bodily contacts entering the field of touch that can be felt and craved forBodily isolation in secluded places facilitates isolation from craving and other hindrancesAt the start this purification and concentration of mind comes only temporarily during specific meditative exercises but later on strengthened by these very exercises that pure and concentrated state of mind can be maintained for an increasingly longer time and will make possible a deep and penetrative insight into the true nature of thingsAnd that vision when completely cleansed of delusion will finally bring about ultimate isolation the freedom of every kind of attachmentIn other words to a disciple tirelessly meditating in solitude the transient painful and unsubstantial nature of all constituents of existence will become apparent with an increasing clarity and certaintyTo the degree however that ignorance and delusion about this world disappear also desire for anything in it and hate or anger against anything in it will die away they will lose their objects their foothold their basis their sanctionThus with the withdrawal of the fuel this terrible conflagration of suffering is brought to extinction sooner or later according to previous actionforce and present effortTrue holiness is never born without solitude never is it perfected without struggle with the passions withinYet the untiring activity of Gotama the Buddha and of many of his disciples demonstrate that solitude and the happiness of seclusion are not as many think the aim and end of the ascetic life but they are an essential means to the end and are an incomparable mine of strength and inspiration to him who resolutely strives for the goalYe should know that those people practice the most useful practicesKnow ye that the kingdom is blessed where man is inwardly oneThey produce more eternal gain in one moment than all works ever wrought outwardly Meister EckehartBy a wrong view of life all ascetic endeavor will naturally be considered as egotism pure and simple but right understanding will never regard it like thatThe true ascetic who has wholeheartedly taken up the training knows that in the absolute sense there is no ego nor anything belonging to it neither I nor mineNeither corporeality nor feeling perception formations and consciousness contain any abiding substance because they are transient painful subject to changeTherefore no longer can one who has entered the path where deliverance is assured bestir himself for the sake of the ego his striving aims at the final cessation of the conditioned personality by the gradual elimination of all its rootsBut during his more or less protracted struggle for final emancipation the Sekha is not yet entirely cured of all selfaffirmation of all impulses connected with I and Mine still the old Kamma clings to himOnly in the arahant the Holy One is the truth of Anatta fully realized and therewith all and every form of selfaffirmation is done away through the cessation rejection removal denial and relinquishment of all notions of I and Mine and all biases of selfconceit he has won perfect deliverance In other wordsIgnorance is the root of all selfaffirmationIt is this very truth that none in this world period has as perfectly penetrated as perfectly taught as the BuddhaThe entire hard struggle for deliverance was called by the Enlightened One briefly The liberation from the fetter of ignorance that is from selfillusionHence Sariputta thus should you train yourself Concerning this body endowed with consciousness there shall not arise any notions and biases shall not ariseAnd we shall abide in the attainment of this deliverance of the heart this deliverance by wisdom through which all these notions and biases cease Thus Sariputta should you train yourselfAnd in so far Sariputta as a monk attains to this deliverance of the heart this deliverance by wisdom he is called one who has cut off craving removed the fetters of existence has made an end of suffering by the full elimination of selfconceitThe more devotedly one strives towards this goal the more selfless he becomes and the earlier will he make an end of all egotismSangham saranam gacchamiI take refuge in the Order of MonksBut to be sure mere outward asceticism is of no availWhether one remains in the household life or whether one goes forth from it to the homeless state if one lives wrongly I do not praise itFor whosoever either remains at home or departs from home if he lives wrongly on account of that wrong way of life he can gain nothing on the good path of the Dhamma  I do not ascribe asceticism to a robe wearer just because he wears a monks robeI do not ascribe asceticism to a forest hermit just because he lives in the forestI do not ascribe asceticism to a knower of text just because he knows many texts Not because a man wears a robe dwells in the forest knows the texts speaks much about the Doctrine can he get rid of craving propensities can he get rid of hating propensities can he get rid of delusive propensitiesThere are people who void of faith go forth from home into homelessness hypocrites dissemblers shamascetics conceited men busy talkers and chatterers bad guardians of the doors of the senses without moderation at meals not devoted to wakefulness indifferent to asceticism without respect for the training fond of luxury importunate preferring what is detrimental shunning solitude as a heavy burden lazy without energy heedless and uncomprehending uncontrolled and distracted minds of small understanding and stupidSuch a monks asceticism appears to me O monks like a murderous weapon meant for slaughter doubled edged well sharpened covered band wrapped round with a robeA knife taken up by the blade wounds the hand misused asceticism drags one the downward pathIn error ye wander O monks of Assaji upon a false path ye wander O monks of AssajiHow far apart have they strayed the foolish from this Doctrine and Discipline Hard it is to serve the Exalted One very hard it is to serve the Exalted One  meeting with this experience many a weak disciple discouraged or displeased has given up asceticismOnly to him who knows suffering only to one who true to the Doctrine earnestly works within fighting purposefully and persistently against Mara  to such a one only will the external circumstances of asceticism prove to be what actually they ought to be according to Buddhas declaration The most suitable conditions which the world can offer for the complete overcoming of the worldAgain and again did the Master place before his disciples the hollowness and futility of halfhearted asceticism as well as the seriousness and difficulties of the true monks lifeNever did he attempt to persuade anyone to become his disciple or to lead the ascetic life under himHe lays the Doctrine before the people does not persuade them does not dissuade them He shows the nature of this world after he himself has understood and penetrated itThe doctrine excellent in the beginning excellent in the middle excellent in its consummation does he proclaim both in the spirit and in the letter he sets forth the holy life in its fullness and purity Now if the nature and purpose of this ascetic life becomes overwhelmingly clear to a householder or a householders son he will become an ascetic of his own free will following his inner urgeSunken I am in birth in old age and death in distress lamentation and pain in grief and despair sunken in suffering lost in sufferingOhthat it might be possible to make an end of this whole mass of misery In such a state of mind filled with confidence he renounces the worldly life and such a renunciation is called in the texts rightminded renunciationWith such a true renunciation such a true Pabbajja has he arrived in a clearing   but no furtherWhoso as a noble son has thus renounced what has he to doWhoso finds no detachment from desires from evil states of mind whoso finds no joy and happiness or other still better gain his heart will be seized and bound by lust will be seized and bound by illwill will be seized and bound by sloth and torpor will be seized and bound by restlessness and worry will be seized and bound by doubt will be seized and bound by dissatisfaction will be seized and bound by attachmentBut whoso finds detachment from desires from evil states of mind and finds joy and happiness and other states of mind and finds joy and happiness and other still better gain his heart will not be seized and bound by lust will not be seized and bound by illwill by sloth and torpor restlessness and worry by doubt dissatisfaction and attachment But this nobility of mind how is it acquiredOnly through meditation and again meditation Here trees invite there lonely cottagesGo meditateBe not slothful lest later ye repentTrue asceticism is an obstinate mute struggleMighty is MaraFearfully deepembedded is delusionDying and becomingDying and becoming No standing still should be permitted no satisfaction with what has been attainedEver more strong must ye become to reach what is still unreached to attain what is still unattained to realize what is still unrealized I declare unto you O monks I call upon you to give heed ye that aspire to the goal of asceticism see that the goal does not elude you while there is more to accomplishDying and becoming again and again  until nothing can any more become and hence there is nothing that can dieNo rest no stopping before Nibbana is reachedAlso to the world beyond I shall not cleave nor shall my consciousness be bound to that worldAll nutriment is misery heavenly food as wellTo be conscious is to be suffering An ascetic thus minded has found and finds ever greater and loftier results he is well satisfied with the ascetic life does not give up the noble effort It is called death in the Order of the Holy One when a person gives up asceticism and turns back to the common life of the world  this he now appreciates depending upon none in that experienceAs the moth that has caught sight of the light does not turn back to the darkness and as the ant dies on the sugar heap so he turns not back to the worldly way of life but devotes himself fully to the noble training so that he may reach the highest state Nibbana the extinction of delusionAnd so he becomes fit to eradicate the taints and to attain in this very life time to the taintfree deliverance of the heart the deliverance by wisdomWhoso monks practices the four Foundations of Mindfulness for seven years may expect one of the two results the Highest Knowledge in his present life time or if there is a remainder of clinging left the state of nonreturnSetting aside seven years whoso monks thus practices the four Foundations of Mindfulness for six years five years four years three years two years one year  nay setting aside one year whoso practices the four Foundations of Mindfulness for seven months may expect one of the two results the Highest Knowledge in his present life time or if there is a remainder of clinging the state of nonreturnSetting aside seven months whoso monks practices these four Foundations of Mindfulness for six months five months four months three months two months one month or half a month  nay setting aside half a month whoso practices these four Foundations of Mindfulness for seven days may expect one of these two results the Highest Knowledge in his present life time or if there is a remainder of clinging the state of nonreturnIf weak men only knew themselvesThe hero verily slumbers in many a oneFrom your letter I hear the cry for deliveranceDeliverance is born of knowledge For attaining to that liberating knowledge I can from my own experience only give the advice to you who are otherwise fairly well prepared to imbibe for a period of years the spirit of the Discourses of the Buddha and to set to work accordinglyThere will then be no need for you to believe that a system of thought can do justice to the world but you will know itBuddhism does justice to the world even to such a degree that it leads to the overcoming of itIt is an unspeakably vast task to struggle through and beyond all apparent contradictions and to struggle free from the most subtle fettersGotama the Buddha says expressly Profound is this doctrine hard to understand hard to perceive tranquil sublime beyond the realm of logic intelligible only to the wiseYou will hardly understand it without patience devotion guidance and effort But there are beings whose eyes are only little covered by dustNot hearing the truth they will be lostIt is they who will understand the Dhamma For it has been said that there are two conditions of right understanding the voice of others and wise reflectionFurthermore Also in this doctrine and discipline is it possible to show a gradual training practice gradual progressGradually one will come to acquire a wise understanding of the teachings proclaimed by the Exalted One and then lofty results will gradually be experiencedYou write that the spirit of Buddhism is repugnant to you owing to its rationalistic penetration of the worldI too had formerly that opinion but it disappears with a more exact knowledge about mans composite nature and his way of development as taught by the MasterMeditation rests upon the fact that mind is the forerunner in evolutionIn brief what man thinks that he becomesMeditation in the Buddhist sense includes what we in Christian lands call feeling heart love and so onWhat commonly is called feeling or emotion is in fact only a clinging low or noble it is but ties and fetters gross or subtleFor me for instance music was formerly such an important factor that when listening particularly to Beethovens symphonies I was clearly possessed by them ravished shakenEven four or five years ago I busied myself with writing music and compositionMy judgment of musical performances was generally appreciatedBut art is just a means to lead us on to the comprehending of suffering and not only to an emotional experience of it it takes us from the particular to the generalBut more subtle devices await usAll of them however are as the entire Teaching meant for letting go not for keeping a hold on themYou say that you have suffered much and yet you think that this world of suffering is a glorious placeBut if you progress from the emotional experience of suffering to an understanding of lifes general nature as ill then there will come a turning point in your ideasYou will come to reflect deeply upon the fact that the entire existence being something originated is bound up with impermanenceEverything originated is aniccaWhat ceases is woe is suffering and notself unsubstantial dukkham anattaAmong these three related characteristics of existence the most tangible one dukkha has been taken out fully stated and defined in the First Truth of suffering in the second its cause in the third its cessation and in the fourth the practical path of deliveranceHe who has eyes will perceive these thingsThe better one understands and practices the Eightfold Path the less one will be assailed by sufferingTanha that headed hydra will gradually die away  beginning with the grossest and ending with the most subtle craving which one notices only laterThen done is what ought to be done Suffering is transcended and thereby the world or life are transcendedCeased has rebirth lived to its end is the holy life the work is done nothing more beyond this  thus he knowsTo him who wishes to inquire further the following texts are recommended for thorough reflection the rd and nd Discourse of the Majjhima Nikaya and further the discourses and it is advisable to think slowly and carefully about causalityEnough for todayThough Buddhism as you say is for you partly still unpalatable yet in the first words of your letter you admit the strict consistency and inner strength of my own way of actionI have understood Buddhas logic and love the shortest way between two points is the straight lineThe study of Pali will permit you as much quicker penetration of the teaching since all translations are makeshifts our words are insufficient and often they lead astrayIf in addition you will learn by heart the most important Discourses fully or partly then you will have a solid foundation inwardly and with regard to your linguistic studies Letter of One who has understood the universality of suffering and the importance of the ascetic life for the speediest elimination of that suffering such a one will certainly sympathize with youAccording to your valuable and frank confession you have strong sensuality You may know that asceticism or the holy life is mostly called brahmacariyamIt is significant that the same term is used in the third sila of the monkHaving abandoned unchastity he lives a life of chastity he keeps aloof and abstains from that vulgar practice sexual intercourse He keeps aloof that is he observes a prudent distance from women lest he lend a hand to Mara because he is still weak and in the process of growthFor the millions of those who live a worldly life sexual intercourse within the limits indicated in Majjh is not regarded as akusala but for the disciple proper who wishes to bring suffering to an end it is always akusala unwholesome wrong and conducive to sufferingHow could he gain a deeper truly penetrating insight as long as that powerful affirmation of life vibrates through his organism and paralyzes his mindTherefore kammachanda or kamaraga is the first Hindrance Fetter and Defilement and its opposite nekkhamma renunciation is the first help and aid in gaining samma samadhi right concentration which is required for the pure vision of truthThough the entire realm of kama ie the five sense objects are a hindrance of samadhi yet one has to recognize the sexual sphere as the most portentous in the realm of sensualityOne knows what an enormous amount of energy is expended hereHe who is infatuated will be aware of it only faintly but later when fighting and subduing his passion it will become clear to him that he was formerly but a miserable specimen of humanity a slave of Mara he will then appreciate that a mind kept in a violent tremor by strong emotions cannot possibly see reality as it isThe BuddhaDhamma is said to go against the currentThe crowd goes along with the current lifeaffirmation lust hatred selfdelusionThe true disciple goes against that stream he negates it because he wishes to transcend the world get rid of itThe turning away of the will vanquishes all woe Our blind fellowbeings however who float along with the current will say But sexual desire is something natural It is that very fact which a perspicuous Buddhist knows and therefore turns awayHe who understands that has achieved muchAlso he who has strong sensual inclination can live brahmacariya the chaste lifeThere is one who is by nature lustful yet he preserves his chastity even if passion often makes him feel pain and torment but he is able though with pain and torment to live the noble pure life of chastity  A disciple who has made himself familiar with the Buddhas instruction is able to fight the passions with quite different weapons than other folk but knowledge without application is deadHow then can a tendency be gradually expelled from ones nature for instance that to sensualityBy displacing eliminating and replacingYou may have observed how thoughts are placed in the sequence of time how they follow each other and how only one thought at one time can be present to consciousness if ever so brieflyMake a start now and take matters into your own handInstead of allowing your thoughts to roam about aimlessly in a confused way and impelled by emotions  you should first select a time of the day a short half an hour in which to give to your thoughtprocesses a definite direction by choosing a suitable subject of meditationBy doing so gradually a countertendency is developed because during the minutes of asubhabhavana lust has simply dropped outIf you now return to your routine life the tendency developed during your practice will produce an aftereffect which will grow more and more beneficial in proportion to the intensity and duration of the practiceGradually with strengthened mindfulness that noble tendency will permeate almost whole thoughtprocess always ready to step in with its beneficial effect whenever Mara wishes to intrudeMost of our fellowbeings believe that they push while they are pushed themselves But the true disciple actually pushes matters himself because he has grasped the law of elimination by disuse and thus he displaces and eliminates so that passions die away until at the end there is nothing more to die awayFirst a Buddhist should suffuse and saturate himself with the Masters words like those in in the Sutta Nipata the Theragatha Suttas like Majjhima Nikaya No then if he has noble aspirations the powerful sexual urge will be reduced noticeablyAccording to the Masters injunction after listening there should be thorough reflection about it to be done best at a quiet placeYou should contemplate and analyze this body as it is described in Majjhima Nikaya He contemplates this body from the sole of the feet upwards and from the crown of the head downward covered by the skin filled with many impurities He understands it as a putrifying corpse food for worms as a skeleton and as decaying bones My body too is of that nature will become like that and cannot escape itAfter such thorough contemplation actual realization will unfailingly followIf he now sees women he is no longer dominated by the animal urge of carnal desire but he sees through it he sees them as skeletonsLooking ahead he already now perceives the flesh now after death it will be devoured by worms and then his prevailing feeling will be compassion Soon these bodies will perish and will add to the charnel fieldMay beings awake from their frenzy so that it may no longer be said of them Worn out in vain the body dies away but may their Kamma come gradually to restFor him who is moved by such compassion will it be possible to use a being for satisfying his lustOnly selfishness will be able to do so even if it hides behind greatest learningThe Master has taught his disciples  of whom none was a eunuch  how to regulate that desire and how to bring it to restIf you make substantial progress in that respect you will have achieved muchMay you remain mindful of the fact that you do it for your own sake for others sake and for the cause Sutta Nipata vNot many details can be told about your first questionI became aware of the fact I am afflicted by birth oldage and death sunken into sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair submerged by suffering lost in sufferingOh that it might be possible to make an end of that whole mass of suffering consider evolution in its widest senseI mean to say Beings understand and follow the teaching of the Blessed One according to the degree of their own developmentHe who has eyes will seeLet us assume there is an intelligent person a man of understanding He perceives clearly the impermanency of all that is originated and he understands the conclusion what is impermanent that is liable to suffering and it is notselfThrough both and he will understand the equation lifesuffering and now awake from his slumber he works with increasing intensity to make an end of suffering and thereby of lifeBut howDeliverance results from knowledge That liberating knowledge isto know sufferingto know the origin of sufferingto know the cessation of sufferingto know the path leading to sufferings cessationThis is the teaching particular to Enlightened Ones This only do I teach now as before suffering and the cessation of suffering Any doubt as to whether that knowledge is actually the only one needful to us now will disappear if one reflects carefully on the rd Discourse of Majjhima NikayaFrom experience I may give the assurance that man will grow in his detachment and that suffering will touch him less and less the more mindfully and energetically he walks the pathTanha the direct cause of suffering is gradually brought to extinctionFirst its gross form dies away and later the more subtle one that is imperceptible at the startThough as a rule only the genuine bhikkhu will be able to walk the path perfectly yet the opinion which one sometimes finds expressed that only the bhikkhu can do it at all is erroneousEveryone who leads the home life  more especially if living alone  can tread the Path and progress on it very far according to the nature of his actions Everyone who has become a bhikkhu with the clear awareness of what he is doing has once lived the worldly life before but has prepared himself before he chose to lead the ascetic life that is so beneficialGotama Buddha in the rd Discourse addressed to the citizens of Sala has given very valuable instructions for right conduct in thoughts words and deedsAdherence to that conduct will to the degree of ones success in doing so contribute considerably to the overcoming of sufferingWithout having fully understood the importance of a virtuous life for purification and for mental concentration it will be premature if the disciple desires to attain the meditative absorptionsIf you consider very carefully the following you will see clearly in that matterWe find in the texts the following threefold division of the PathUsually the factors numbered and are mentioned first because the Path cannot be trodden without a degree of Right Understanding and Right ThoughtIn their perfected form however they constitute pañña the highest wisdomVirtue comes firstThen follows Concentration comprising the th th and th factor of the Path Among them Right Effort consists of the Four Endeavors and these four are also called implements of concentration The four Foundations of Mindfulness which according to Discourse form the seventh Path factor are the objects of concentration and Concentration proper the th factor is explained by the four meditative absorptionsIn other words firstly strong energy has to be developed and untiringly one should work that is meditate in accordance with the four Foundations of Mindfulness for providing the inner training required for the entry into the First AbsorptionHow then can such mighty energy be developedIf he sees with his eyes a visible object he does not take up its general features nor its detailsBecause lust and grief unwholesome and evil thoughts may overwhelm him who dwells with his sense of sight unrestrained he practices that restraint guards his sense of sight and watches over it The same holds good for the other four physical senses and mind as the sixthThrough the six senses we communicate with the outer worldFrom this is seen the immense importance of controlling that apparatus for the specific purpose of gaining mental concentration and for the general purpose of eliminating sufferingHe who does not know and understand according to reality the eye visual objects visual consciousness visual impression the feelings produced by visual impression  he will be delighted in the eye being delighted in it and attached to it he will allow himself to be allured by it looking always for the enjoyment provided by itTo him the life process consisting of the five Groups will continue to accumulate and craving that leads to renewed existence finding delight here and there will continue to grow But he who knows and understands according to reality the eye will not be delighted in the eye seeing always the danger in itTo him the five Groups will decrease and craving will vanishThe concentration of one who has achieved that is Right ConcentrationHe who sees the Dependent Origination sees the Dhamma he who sees the Dhamma sees the Dependent OriginationThis spiritual struggle will lead to victory chiefly through constant mindfulness and thought concerning the fact of origination in other words impermanenceFor instance Now this unpleasant feeling has arisen in me produced by auditory impression and it is conditioned not unconditionedConditioned by whatBy sense impressionAnd he knows impression is impermanent he knows feeling is impermanent Then his mind thus discerning the elements becomes gladdened serene strong and steadySo far about Energy or Right Effort being the implement by which to attain concentrationInformation about the Four Foundations of Mindfulness will be found in MajjhThen while he thus dwells earnest ardent and mindful the memories bound up with home life will vanish in himI have experienced myself how important it is to meditate upon the four Foundations of MindfulnessI have learned that Discourse by heart in Pali and daily I repeat one seventh part of it in my meditation every week has brought new revelationsBut one must work for itHe who does not work cannot follow the truth It is not possible thus I teach to obtain assurance at once at the start but gradually fighting progressing step by step one will obtain assurance And because he makes determined effort he realizes for himself the highest truth and visualizes it by wise penetration He who attends to the preparatory work as indicated will avoid the illusions of wrong concentration and will steer straight towards Right Concentration because cultivation of samadhi means the cultivation of and the training in just these things ie Energy and MindfulnessThe fact that also householders can practice mindfulness is mentioned in Discourse We too O lord being householders have from time to time established our mind in the four Foundations of Mindfulness and we dwell O Lord contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending mindful having overcome covetousness and grief regarding the worldIf you now read a Discourse like the th where the Master gives a connected summary you will have confirmation of that sequence of practice mentioned above first sila then the control of the senses and mindfulnessAlso the five Hindrances which have to be overcome before one can enter the first Absorption are found in the th Discourse at the beginning of the fourth Foundation of MindfulnessHow difficult it is generally to gain the Absorptions is shown by the Buddhas statements in the th Discourse there profoundly and step by step the hindrances and their overcoming are shown But the difficulties mentioned there will not deter an earnest discipleHe knows that evolution does not proceed at a bound but that by an indefatigable application of the appropriate means progress undreamt of may be achieved in a short time However the fact cannot be concealed Profound is this teaching difficult to grasp you will hardly understand it without patience devotion effort and guidance and there are fools who study the teaching but though they have studied it they do not wisely examine the meaning of the teachings without wisely examining the teachings their contemplation will not yield satisfaction they do not grasp the purpose for which they have studied the teachingTo them their wrong grasp of the teaching will bring them harm and suffering for a long timeYet it has been said that the teaching is intelligible to every person of understanding and that it grows in clarity for the earnest discipleThere are no ascetics who know and understand everything at onceThat is impossible It is by training by indefatigable training that everything is nursed to maturityWhat a monk considers and reflects upon for a long time to that his mind will inclineIf once the fundamental truths have been thoroughly grasped and experienced and through a faithful devotion to the inner work the gradual perception of a great result has appeared then from such a soil a beneficial and powerful saddha concerning the future work will growThis is the first of the five qualities of spiritual striving by the help of which the disciple may achieve his aim quicklyI am filled with an unshakable SaddhaA confidence rooted in understanding and experience surmounts difficulties met by one who is given to speculative thinking a hairsplitter or a petty criticThough the way of expression may sometimes be difficult or strange and though in some instances the teachings given there may remain unintelligible for some time let us have SaddhaEnlightened Ones do not speak imperfectly Work Work as we have stressed above  that is the key wordThen the Dhamma will be realized experienced and no longer requires proof or guidance not even by a BuddhaIn the Liberated One is the knowledge of Liberation Equal to me will be those victorious ones who have destroyed cravingNamo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato SammasabuddhassaDear MrNIf you attach great significance to Mindfulness of Breathing you have perceived an important factAs the four Foundations of Mindfulness may be called the heart of the doctrine so is Mindfulness of Breathing if rightly understood the heart of the heartMindfulness of Breathing if developed well and regularly practiced brings to perfection the four Foundations of Mindfulness thus it is said in the th DiscourseHe who knows these means of deliverance and applies them will experience by himself that restlessness desire anger misapprehensions and thereby all deep sorrows will vanish and will reappear only and always when that mindfulness is absentWhile our other fellowbeings millions of them  go on living without any substantial gain in liberation he who knows the laws of deliverance can purposefully take into his hands the work of their unfolding he can loosen and finally break the chains of slaveryFirst of all three things are required herepersistencepersistencepersistenceWithout great devotion without extraordinary patience even one who is otherwise gifted will not be able to make progressIt is important that the beginner betakes himself to a quiet place as secluded as possible so that the habitual tanha  nourishment for the five senses  is reduced and the numerous sounds voices and noises which particularly at the beginning hinder so much any deeper concentration do not constantly interfereYou will not have missed the fact that it is expressly stated in the Discourses and that the disciple should resort to the forest an empty room etcThus whenever bonds of profession or family do not fetter you you should make haste to go out of your town like one who seeks hidden treasure and should choose a suitable spot in forest environmentThen you should sit down there in a posture that allows you the longest time of sitting immovablyMindfully he breathes in mindfully he breathes out  that is the general practice of Anapanasati introducing the subsequent specific exercises and forming the transition from ordinary confused thinking to concentrated meditation focused upon a definite mental objectThe former kind of thinking ordinary reflection is called vitakka ie discursive thinking By Mindfulness of Breathing that discursive thinking is suspended and silencedAnapanasati bhavetabba vitakkupacchedaya Mindfulness of Breathing ought to be practiced for cutting off discursive thinking How is it to be doneBreathing in long he knows I breathe in long breathing out long he knows I breathe out long Breathing in short he knows I breathe in short breathing out short he knows I breathe out short Now at one and the same time only one single thought can be clearly present to consciousness thoughts follow each other they are placed in timeAll exclusion of evil thoughts effected by meditation rests upon that fact is made possible by that factHe who thinks for one minute a thought of kindness has at that time no thought of hate in his mind he who thinks of a corpse for one minute has no lust while doing so he who contemplates impermanence for one minute will not have conceitWhenever and as long as one knows I breathe in and out long or short for that time even if it is only for a fraction of a second other vitakka will be excludedYou will however experience that when you resolve to be strictly watchful the first breaths that follow will go in and out a clear awareness of them but after that habitual worldly thoughts will appear again during a single breathBut if one considers that the complete tranquilization and exclusion of discursive thoughts is tantamount to the entry into the Second Absorption one will in spite of all relapses persist in ones practice week by week month by month year by year and during a single session the meditator will apply mindfulness times or times or moreGradually the law of development by use will show itself it works as reliably as the law of elimination by disuseIn one minute one may breathe timesIf one is conscious of it even if only at the beginning one will have given a definite direction to ones mind times in minutesIf for about minutes no breath has been missed it is certainly an achievement though to a beginner some fatigue may be noticeableThe simile of the turner given in the th Discourse shows clearly how simply that exercise is meantGenerally spoken it is the most simple that is truly great and profoundFrom the foregoing it will become clear how important that simple and easily intelligible exercise isIf patiently sustained it is bound to result in the calmness and concentration of mind aspired by youThe Master teaches how to bind a second postulate a Must  mindfulness  to breathing which is the constant companion of man from birth to deathThe first Must is faithful man must breathe constantlyThe second Must has to be developed from itIn other words breathing cannot wait if it is not to escape unnoticed mindfulness must be present and alertFor one of confused mindfulness I say there is no Mindfulness of BreathingThere are people endowed with outstanding giftsAs soon as they know the method they will practice with zeal and determinationPerhaps you too will even after a short time attain genuine Absorption of mind will easily leave behind the Sensuous Sphere and realize one or more stages of meditationThrough those two exercises that degree of Samatha can be achieved only if the five Hindrances are removed the presence of which is incompatible with AbsorptionBut even if for a long time the meditator cannot attain to the absorptions other gratifying results of Anapanasati will become evidentFirstly the calm and concentration of mind as effected by meditative training in solitude can now be maintained for increasingly longer periods of timeCalm and concentration will gradually enter into the meditators innermost being and will also manifest themselves outwardly in his daily behavior by a calmer and more composed way of speaking and by calmer bodily movements in going turning looking bending and stretching of limbsSecondly what is incomparably more important there will be a keener insight into the nature of the world that is of the five Khandhas as impermanent liable to suffering and notselfA man with keen eye sight will excel in observationSimilarly greater tranquillity means deeper insight and again strengthened insight into suffering will be an incentive to achieve a greater power of concentration as a means to the endIt is a reciprocal process No meditative absorption without wisdom and no wisdom without absorptionTherefore after having practiced for some time the exercises Noand one may go over to No contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in and outIn doing so one should keep in mind that what is spoken of here are phenomena objects of thought pertaining to the fourth Foundation of MindfulnessThe four Satipatthanas may be regarded as stages at the first stage one learns to contemplate on the gross material body as it appears to simple observationin the second Satipatthana the feelings likewise in their simple presentationin the third an essential change should follow the knowledge gradually prepared and matured by the first three Satipatthanas that the entire world of plurality is only an object for each subject a manifestation of thought hanging only on a single thread consciousnessThen the passage in Majjh Thus is corporeality thus its end etc will appear in a different light because the proper light has dawned upon the meditatorThus is corporeality appearances phenomena arising in consciousness with help of the likewise conditioned visual organ the auditory disappears again as a subjective process appearance anicca anattaIt is similar with the other Khandhas Thus is feeling thus is its origin thus its end Here one can learn to understand the whole of existence as an illusion as notself and the Egodelusion will dissolve quicklyThis is so because all wishing longing hating disliking fearing grieving or being excited in brief all mental afflictions stem from the Attaidea If that delusion loses its hold a decisive change takes place a detachment a feeling of liberation as never experienced beforeThe person is now seen as a temporary combination of ever changing Khandhas and after sometime this person will disappear from the scene it has never harbored an eternal selfThe idea of Anatta may get strengthened in us in a way somewhat like thatBy such a contemplation one will become selfless allloving truly detachedand the word in Majjhwill become clear He lives independent and does not cling to anything in the worldBy the power of thinking sharpened and made lucid by the exercises and of the facts of impermanence and notself will be visualized more stronglyTherefore I have given here that indication because it is insight that lastly leads to deliveranceConcentration is only the clarification of mind which however is indispensable just as in spectacles the glasses are the essential thing but one can look through them only after removing from them the dirt or moistureI have mentioned today only the exercises No andAs you know talking is here of little avail doing practicing is all that mattersAfter some time you may communicate your experiences and if required ask for further informationYou are quite right in saying that without explanation one cannot do much with the brief instructions particularly if the translation is unsatisfactoryBut in the Canon you will find further elucidations about the single pointsDear FriendA few words about givingupIt is better not to have cigars about oneself on principleSimilarly he who wishes to wean himself from alcohol will not carry a bottle with himHe who wants to give up desire for women will better not go to places where he will have to face temptationTo be sure of ones steps is important particularly at a stage of transitionMara is on the lookout for any possible opening therefore he must not be given any chanceOnce is not never He who has no cigars about himself cannot smokeNo fire can flare up without fuel for the present at least indulgence has been made impossibleGradually the law of elimination by disuse will come into effectThe need and desire for the former enjoyment will weaken and finally ceaseIf someone says that he has got over smoking etc but he carries cigars about him for the sake of a test then he has not yet fully abandoned tanhaHe who has entirely abolished that craving will no longer cherish such thoughts in that respect he is fully at peace and already thinks further aheadThus a disciple who has freed himself from sexual urge will though immune not seek temptationsMore important things have to be doneNo rest before NibbanaBesides if he refrains from testing his power of resistance this will be more profitable to others in his environment who cannot see into his heart but observe only his external behavior and quite reasonably their confidence might be shaken by their observations though they may not talk about itDoubtlessly the struggle against Mara is hard because for Mara it is actually a question of to be or not to be a fight of life or death for his kingdom of nature For long long times we have been his serfsNow this serfdom is over for usNevermore shall we find lasting satisfaction anywhere in this SamsaraOne who has taken the Buddha as his guide and master will understand the nature of Maras Realm so poignantly that he can no longer find full satisfaction in the Realm of Nature where everything is impermanentBy seeing the misery of it we are on the road of escape from itWhat now is the principal task for us who already possess a good deal of right understanding who at least have a knowledge of the doctrine and observe virtueTo watch watch watchTo be constantly on guardIn particular to try to remain mindfulSamadhi is the Buddhist practice properAt the start of the practice the mind is not collected at all the capacity of concentration is weakBut as the Master explained by training by unceasing training the little child first constantly falling learns to toddle about till finally as a grownup man he can walk steadily and continuously for long stretchesIf a man possessed of intelligence falls he has not been watchful was absentmindedLax mindfulness produces new taints and strengthens the old ones unflinching mindfulness gives no room for new taints and destroys the old ones For instance one has seen innumerable times that all formations are impermanent one has also agreed with the Buddhas words Whatever corporeality exists ones own or of others beautiful or ugly all corporeality should with proper understanding be regarded as it truly is It is not mine thus it will be abandoned will be rejected Very often the misery of corporeality has been felt most pungently and the misery of craving has been understood yet this or that object will still titillate our senses whenever watchfulness is lackingBut if one remains mindful and turns at once to an analysis of the perception one will not be enticed by any material fromOne will see that the material form has been made up into an evanescent structure of this or another kind by the karmic formations which are impermanent in themselves one will see that material form is put together in a similar way as a potter shapes potsThen his mind dissecting thus the elements will become joyful gladdened strong and steadyIt is doubtlessly a hard way but gloriously safeTruly in that manner one can perceptibly detach oneself from the worldFritz Stange student of natural sciences  thus my late friend then a newly registered freshman was introduced to the academical association to which I belongedA handsome young man with smooth blond hair and an elegant mustache with deeply blue and strikingly large eyes a gentle voice and a mild glance thus he stood before usHe was a gentle person and a keen student who in lonely hours used to comfort his soul by playing the violin he was an ardent admirer of Richard Wagner and if possible he did not miss a single performance of Wagners operasIf anyone had said that a person like he would ever become a Buddhist ascetic he would have provoked general laughterWe liked each other from the beginningStrange became my personal freshmanMy other freshman was a great artist in the field of music and has now become an excellent though little known Sanskritist and VedantistThe three of us united by bonds of closest friendship soon met regularly at the sessions of the Theosophical Society which everywhere has prepared the way for the Buddhist movementFollowing the wish of his father Stange had to give up his studies so dear to him and donned the uniform of an official of the Postal DepartmentFor none of us had the student life any special attraction and Stange himself saw in it only the karmic way by which we came togetherAs an official Stange remained a keen Theosophist lived as a vegetarian and plunged deeply into the study of those teachings which then we called BuddhismBesides he was unusually capable in his profession and personally he was the favorite of all who knew himWhen he was a probationer for the higher postal career at Kassel he began to study the Discourses of the Buddha in Neumanns translation under the guidance of a friend who was an ardent Buddhist and soon the resolution matured in him to seek deliverance from the grievous suffering that pervades the life of all beingsHe had fully grasped the Truth of SufferingBut knowledge alone was not sufficient for his fervent pure and profound heartThus he left as a true follower of the Blessed One his home his property and his relations in order to enter the Sangha in distant AsiaWhy does one go to the countries of Buddhism he wrote to me onceBriefly spoken because there and particularly in Burma all conditions are cut out for a life in the SanghaOne is relieved of all worldly cares for eating drinking clothing lodging etc in contrast to Europe one can live there the holy life first externallyHow one detaches oneself inwardly is everyones most personal affair Thus he came to CeylonThe reception he wrote was so friendly the helpful response so strikingly unexpected that already a fortnight after my arrival in Ceylon I followed an invitation of the Bhikkhu Jinavaravamsa to stay at Chulla LankaThere I have spent the holiest time of my life in meditation study of Pali and conversation about the teaching But this body that sickly thing did not stand it On medical advice Stange decided to return to Europe to cure his lung diseaseIn summer he lived first at Wingendorf near Lauban afterwards following the invitation of a friendly physician with Buddhist leanings at Birkfield in SyriaOn the th of October the ship took him out again hardly recoveredThis time he went soon to the healthy up country of Ceylon to BandarawelaUntil his complete recuperation he took as preliminary step towards the Sangha the white dress of an Upasaka but soon he donned again the yellow robe of a SamaneraHis intention was to return later to Europe together with Nyanatiloka for establishing the Sangha thereThe time will come he wrote in his letter of   when a Sangha will be established in Germany by thoroughly trained Bhikkhus and thereby a firm basis will be formed for the dissemination of the Teaching that brings such unspeakable bliss TheragathaHow earnest he was in his determination is confirmed by the following words of hisAnd even if I had not met a single good Bhikkhu this would not have disconcerted me Rare are Enlightened Ones Small is the number of those who are not gripped by them These words of the Enlightened One are of general validityA perceptive disciple will see in that fact an admonition to make all the quicker an end of sufferingSo strongly have I become aware of the truth of thisTeaching and of its profundity that on the one hand to swerve from that path to another one has become an impossibility and on the other hand even my walking alone on that path would be done without hesitation or surpriseNow his striving within this present impermanent existence has come to an endJust as his going forth from home was similar to that of his Lord and Master Gotama so it was the same illness dysentery which had dissolved the body of the Perfect one that also took away the dear heroic Samanera SumanoDeath is indeed the lot of everything born and originatedWhen Sumano started on his way to Homelessness he pointed out to his relatives the justification of that step in a beautifully lucid tract quoting in it especially sayings of Jesus of NazarethTo the public he gave the work published a few weeks ago Pabbajja Going Forth into Homelessness Only by absorbing its contents fully we shall be able to measure the singleminded pure noble and yet firmly rooted work for deliverance done by our friend who is now free from the world of appearanceWhat I have to say about Sumanos death is the following In autumn last year Bhikkhu Nyanatiloka the Burmese monk Silavamsa and myself made a walking tour for a week through the South West of Ceylon via Adams Peak and came also to BandarawelaFirst the three of us went to the small mudhut hardly X meters in size where Sumano had lived and diedThe hut is situated in a very lonely place outside of the village in the midst of bare grassy hillocks so that no sound can be heard from the village and no human habitation can be seen right aroundIt is desolate and lonely there as rarely anywhere elseThe second hut which when Sumano died was inhabited by Suñño had already fallen into decay and the rain had washed away nearly every vestige of itAfterwards we wanted also to go to the site of the cremation but we missed the placeHence I went without Nyanatiloka once more there together with the Thera of the Bandarawela Monastery and I found there besides some pieces of molten glass a few small unburned splinters of boneI picked them up and handed them over to Nyanatiloka who still keeps them at Dodanduwa as a tokenThe site of the cremation is on the top of one of those grassy hillocks about minutes distance from the hutBoys planted a Bodhi tree at that spotA great gathering is said to have been present at the cremation amongst them hundreds of Christians and Mohammedans who secretly respected the ascetic way of life led by Sumano After the cremation the ashes were distributed among the lay people and many a Christian Mohammedan and Hindu took them as gladly as a Buddhist The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis discourse of the Buddha  the seventh in the Collection of Middle Length Texts  deals first with a set of sixteen defilements of the human mind and in its second part with the disciples progress to the highest goal of Arahatship which can be achieved if  and only if  these impurities are gradually reduced and finally eliminatedWhile there are also defilements of insight which must be removed for the attainment of the goal the sixteen defilements dealt with here are all of an ethical nature and are concerned with mans social behaviorOnly the last of these sixteen negligence may also refer to purely personal concerns as well as to ones relations with othersA glance through the list will show that all these sixteen defilements derive from greediness and selfishness from aversion selfassertion and conceit or their combinationsIf we take for instance contempt being a weaker nuance of denigration we see that aversion and conceit contribute to it envy is fed by greediness and aversionThe pairs of contributive factors here exemplified do not of course occur at the same moment of consciousness but their repeated separate presence favors the arising of such derivatives as contempt and envyOn the other hand if those secondary defilements such as contempt and envy appear frequently they will bring about a close serial association of their feeders as for instance hate motivated by conceit or hate motivated by greed and these may easily become habitual sequences automatic chain reactions in our impulsive lifeInterlocked in such a manner the negative forces in our mind  the defilements roots of evil and fetters  will become more powerful and much more difficult to dislodgeThey will form closed systems hard to penetrate covering ever larger areas of our mindWhat may first have been isolated occurrences of unwholesome thoughts and acts will grow into hardened traits of character productive of an unhappy destiny in future livesAnd in all these grave consequences the secondary or derivative defilements have a great shareHence it is of vital importance that we do not fall victim to the last in the list of those defilements  negligence  and are not negligent in watchfulness and selfcontrolOut of regard for your own good it is proper to strive with heedfulness out of regard for others good it is proper to strive with heedfulness out of regard for your own and others good it is proper to strive with heedfulness Nidana SamyNoAs to others good how much more pleasant and harmonious will be human relations individual and communal if there is less pettiness and peevishness fewer vanities and jealousies and less selfassertiveness in words and deedsAs already remarked if these minor blemishes are reduced the larger and more serious defilements will have fewer opportunitiesHow often do deadly conflicts and deep involvement in guilt arise from petty but unresolved resentmentsThe composition of our list of defilements alone makes it clear that the Buddha was well aware of the social impact of these impurities and the structure of the discourse shows that he regarded the removal of these defilements as an integral part of the mental training aiming at deliveranceHence we may summarise this part of the discourse by saying that our social conduct strongly affects the chances of our spiritual progressThe nature of that influence is illustrated by the simile of the clothIf the texture of our mind is tarnished by blemishes in our social behavior the new coloring of higher mentality and higher wisdom cannot penetrateThe stains that soil the single strands of thought will show through the superficial coloring and besides the impure matter will reduce the porosity of the tissue ie the receptivity of our mind and thus prevent full absorption of any results gained in meditation or understandingThrough the accumulating waste products of uninhibited defilements a mental atmosphere is created that resists any depth penetration of spiritual forces and valuesFirst in accordance with the method of Satipatthana right mindfulness the presence of the defilements in ones behavior has to be clearly noticed and honestly acknowledged without attempts at evasion at minimizing or selfjustification for instance by giving them more respectable namesThis is what is implied in the words of the discourse Knowing to be a defilement of the mind  Such knowledge by itself may often discourage the recurrence of the defilements or weaken the strength of their manifestationsAccording to the Buddhist Teachers of Old this knowledge should be extended to the nature of the defilements the causes and circumstances of their arising their cessation and the means of effecting their cessationThis is an example of how to apply to an actual situation the formula of the Four Noble Truths as embodied in the contemplation of mindobjects of the Satipatthana SuttaAnother example is the application of the four truths to higher states of mind the Divine Abidings for the purpose of developing insightWhen the Noble Disciple on attaining to one of the higher paths sees himself freed from the defilements deep joy will arise in him enthusiasm for the goal and the way and an unshakable confidence in the Triple GemSo says our textBut a foretaste of all these fruits and blessings can already be gained by him who has succeeded in noticeably weakening and reducing the defilementsSuch enthusiasm and strengthened confidence being derived from his personal experience will be of great value to him adding wings to his further progressTo the extent of his experience he will have verified for himself the virtues of the DhammaWell proclaimed by the Blessed One is the Dhamma realisable here and now possessed of immediate result bidding you come and see accessible and knowable individually by the wiseFor rendering this discourse use has been made chiefly

intelligible and helpful to readers who are not familiar with the Pali language as wellThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks thus Monks  Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisMonks suppose a cloth were stained and dirty and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red

this negligence has been abandoned   he thereupon gains unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus Thus indeed is the Blessed One he is accomplished fully enlightened endowed with vision and conduct sublime knower of the worlds the incomparable guide of men who are tractable the teacher of gods and men enlightened and blessed he gains unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus Well proclaimed by the Blessed One is the Dhamma realizable here and now possessed of immediate result bidding you come and see accessible and knowable individually by the wise he gains unwavering confidence in the

curries even that will be no obstacle for himJust as cloth that is stained and dirty becomes clean and bright with the help of pure water or just as gold becomes clean and bright with the help of a furnace so too if a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hillrice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for himHe abides having suffused with a mind of lovingkindness one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to

from this field of perceptionWhen he knows and sees in this way his mind becomes liberated from the canker of sensual desire liberated from the canker of becoming liberated from the canker of ignoranceWhen liberated there is knowledge It is liberated and he knows Birth is exhausted the life of purity has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to come Such a monk is called one bathed with the inner bathingNow at that time the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja was seated not far from the Blessed One and he spoke to the Blessed One thus But does Master Gotama go to the Bahuka River to batheWhat good brahman is the Bahuka RiverWhat can the Bahuka River doTruly Master Gotama many people believe that the Bahuka River gives purification many people believe that the Bahuka River gives meritFor in the Bahuka River many people wash away the evil deeds they have doneThen the Blessed One addressed the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja in these stanzasWhen this was said the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja spoke thusMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificent Master GotamaThe Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were righting the overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the SanghaMay I receive the going forth under Master Gotama may I receive the full admissionAnd the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admissionAnd not long after his full admission dwelling alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Bharadvaja by his own realization understood and attained in this very life that supreme goal of the pure life for which men of good family go forth from home life into homelessnessAnd he had direct knowledge thus Birth is exhausted the pure life has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to comeAnd the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the ArahatsThe defilements to appear frequently as a group in the discourses eg in Majjh while in MajjhNois omittedA list of seventeen defilements appears regularly in each last discourse of Books to of the Anguttara Nikaya which carry the title Ragapeyyala the Repetitive Text on GreedIn these texts of the Anguttara Nikaya the first two defilements in the above list are called greed and hate to which delusion is added all the fourteen other defilements are identical with the above listKnowingSubComy Having known it either through the incipient wisdom or through the wisdom of the two lower pathsHe knows the defilements as to their nature cause cessation and means of effecting cessation This application of the formula of the Four Noble Truths to the defilements deserves close attentionAbandons themComy He abandons the respective defilement through the noble path where there is abandoning by eradication which according to SubComyis the final abandoningBefore the attainment of the noble paths all abandoning of defilements is of a temporary natureSee Nyanatiloka Thera Buddhist Dictionary svpahanaAccording to the Comy the sixteen defilements are finally abandoned by the noble paths in the following orderIf in the last group of terms covetousness is taken in a restricted sense as referring only to the craving for the five sense objects it is finally abandoned by the path of nonreturning and this is according to Comythe meaning intended hereAll greed however including the hankering after fine material and immaterial existence is eradicated only on the path of Arahatship hence the classification under the latter in the list aboveComyrepeatedly stresses that wherever in our text abandoning is mentioned reference is to the nonreturner for also in the case of defilements overcome on streamentry the states of mind which produce those defilements are eliminated only by the path of nonreturningThe disciples direct experience of being freed of this or that defilement becomes for him a living test of his former still imperfectly proven trust in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaNow this trust has become a firm conviction an unshakable confidence based on experienceBhikkhu anamoli translates this paragraph thus And whatever has according to the limitation been given up has been dropped let go abandoned relinquishedIn the Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka we read in the chapter Jhanavibhanga He is a bhikkhu because he has abandoned defilements limitedly or because he has abandoned defilements without limitationComy When reviewing  the abandonment of the defilements and his unwavering confidence strong joy arises in the nonreturner in the thought Such and such defilements are now abandoned by me It is like the joy of a king who learns that a rebellion in the frontier region has been quelledEnthusiasmAccording to Comy the word veda occurs in the Pali texts with three connotationsscripturejoyknowledgeHere it signifies joy and the knowledge connected with that joyAttha and dhamma are a frequently occurring pair of terms obviously intended to supplement each otherOften they mean letter and spirit of the doctrine but this hardly fits hereThese two terms occur also among the four kinds of analytic knowledgeAtthapatisambhida is explained as the discriminative knowledge of the result of a cause while dhammapatisambhida is concerned with the cause or conditionThe Comyapplies now the same interpretation to our present textual passage saying Atthaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews his unwavering confidence dhammaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews the abandonment of the defilement in part which is the cause of that unwavering confidence Hence the two terms refer to the joy that has as its object the unwavering confidence in the Buddha and so forth and the joy inherent in the knowledgeOur rendering of attha b goal is supported by Comy The unwavering confidence is called attha because it has to be reached ie to be approached in the sense of a limited goal or resultant blessingCfAng tasmim dhamme atthapatisamvedi ca hoti dhammapatisamvedi ca tassa atthapatisamvedino dhammapatisamvedino pamojjam jayati This text continues as our present discourse does with the arising of joy from gladnessAttha and dhamma refer here to the meaning and text of the Buddha word Comy Having shown the nonreturners meditation on the Divine Abidings the Blessed One now shows his practice of insight aiming at Arahatship and he indicates his attainment of it by the words He understands what exists etcThis nonreturner having arisen from the meditation on any of the four Divine Abidings defines as mind those very states of the Divine Abidings and the mental factors associated with themHe then defines as matter the heart base being the physical support and the four elements which on their part are the support of the heart baseIn that way he defines as matter the elements and corporeal phenomena derived from themWhen defining mind and matter in this manner he understands what existsHereby a definition of the truth of suffering has been givenThen in comprehending the origin of that suffering he understands what is low Thereby the truth of the origin of suffering has been definedFurther by investigating the means of giving it up he understands what is excellentHereby the truth of the path has been definedIn the Psalms of the Sisters the nun Punnika speaks to a brahman as follows Translby AFRhys Davids from Early Buddhist Poetry edBHorner Publby Ananda Semage ColomboThe Buddhas Discourse on Effacement is the eighth of the Collection of Middle Length TextsIts subject matter is closely connected with that of preceding text The Simile of the Cloth these two discourses supplement each other in several waysThe Simile of the Cloth speaks of sixteen defilements of social conduct as impeding the progress on higher stages of the path to deliveranceThe present Discourse on Effacement widens the range to fortyfour detrimental qualities of mind which must be effacedThese include thirteen of the sixteen defilements in M but they go beyond the realm of social ethics extending also to the hindrances the path factors etc and special attention is given to the effacement of wrong viewsThis discourse supplements Malso by dealing with the practical methods of effacement from the very beginning with thoughtarising on to avoidance etc and these methods apply as well to the purification from the sixteen defilements given in MOn the other hand the th discourse gives more details about the higher stages of progress that follow after the initial and partial purificationEffacement means the radical removal of detrimental qualities of mindThe fortyfour Modes of Effacement are enumerated in this discourse no less than five times and the first formulation is very significant Others will be harmful we shall not be harmful here and so forth through all the other itemsThis bespeaks of the Buddhas realistic outlook as befitting a world that cannot be improved by mere wishing nor by preaching at it There is no use nor hope in waiting for our neighbour to change his waysCleanup campaigns should start at our own door and then the neighbours may well be more responsive to our own example than to our preachingBesides if the aim is the radical effacement of mental defilements we cannot afford to waste time and be deviated from our task by sidelong glances at the behavior of othersHere lurks in addition the danger of prideHence the Sutta Nipata warns that though possessing many a virtue one should not compare oneself with others by deeming oneself better or equal or inferior It is a virtue that squints that will deprive the progress on the path of the element of selfforgetting joyous spontaneityThere is yet another reason for the injunction not to look to others behavior or misbehavior and this applies particularly to the defilements of social conduct mentioned in the Simile of the ClothIt is quite human to feel disappointed if ones selflessness kindliness modesty and so on do not find much response in the behavior of othersSuch disappointment may well discourage a person not only from continuing to live according to his moral standard but also from advancing further on the road to selflessness towards higher states of mental developmentSuch a person after an initial disappointment may easily be led to retire into the role of the disgruntled moralist as a respectable cloak for an egocentric lifeHere we meet the limitations and risks of a morality solely motivated by the social response to itTo avoid such a blind alley on ones road of progress it is important to make from the very beginning that declaration of moral independence which we may summarize thus Others may act speak and think wrongly but we shall act speak and think rightly  thus effacement can be doneBut the Buddha as a knower of the human heart was well aware that such a single or even repeated resolve will not always be strong enough to stir people into actionHence as an encouragement to those who may feel disheartened by their failures he speaks now of the importance of the arising of thoughts aiming at carrying out those acts of effacementBut again these thoughts will not be effective unless they are regularly and systematically cultivated and are not allowed to lapse into oblivionThen gradually they will be absorbed by our mind and heart and we shall fully identify ourselves with those valuesIn that way these thoughts and aspirations will grow stronger and will be able to overcome the resistance of inertia and antagonistic forces from within and withoutThe Master said To whatsoever one frequently gives attention and repeatedly reflects on to that the mind will turnThe great German mystic of the Middle Ages Meister Eckhart goes even a step further by saying If you do not have the longing have at least a longing for the longingNext to cultivating the hearts resolve the first direct step towards effacing the defilements is to know them that is the clear and honest confrontation with them in ones own mind as we pointed out when considering the Simile of the ClothThis will surely help in preventing their rearisingBut for strengthening and extending that effect it is necessary to cultivate also the positive counterparts of those fortyfour negative qualities as taught in the instruction on avoidanceThe Buddhas formulation in this section conveys the encouraging word that there actually exists such a road for avoiding or circumventing the wrong pathThe Buddha said If it were not possible to give up what is evil I would not tell you to give it up if it were not possible to develop what is good I would not tell you to develop itIn the field of insight this method is called abandoning by the opposite but by extension we may apply this term also to the wider range of our present contextApart from its highest purpose the cultivation of positive qualities of mind is on any level a road of progress a way that leads upwards It brings results here and now and leads to a favorable and happy rebirthIt will preserve and unfold what is best in us and prevent it from deteriorationConsidering the fearful possibilities in mans own nature and in the realms of existence this is no mean benefit of training the mind for the final effacement of defilements even if the results remain modest for a long timeFor him who has advanced so far there is now the warning in the text that he should not set himself up as a saviour of others while there is still more to do for himAt this stage the disciple may have effected some partial effacement but still the fires of greed hatred and delusion are not quenched in him or to express it with the other metaphor here used he is still immersed in the mireThough his chances for freeing himself from that bog of samsara have improved any wrong step or just his negligence and lack of persevering effort may cause a setbackHence a determined effort should now be made for the final quenching for radical effacementThis warning against an overestimation of ones position links up with the first sections of our text which we have still to considerThey likewise deal with the overrating of ones achievements here in the fields of insight and meditative absorptionsEven initial steps in these fields may result in experiences having such a strong impact on the mind that it is psychologically understandable if they lead to overestimationThis does not necessarily mean overrating oneself through pride but overrating the position of ones achievements on the path of progressOne may believe them to be complete in their field while they are only partial or to be final while they are only temporary suppressionsIf confronted with wrong views on self and world one will at first sight be inclined to believe that any trace of them in oneself can be eliminated by intellectual refutation that is by proving to ones own satisfaction that they are untenableAnd if one has a firm conviction in the truth of the Dhamma it will be easy to assume that one has discarded wrong views for goodIn that overestimation one may even go as far as to believe that one has entirely overcome the first of the ten fetters personalitybelief and hence is on the way to streamentry or has even reached itBut this can never be achieved on the intellectual level alone nor even on the first stages of insightmeditation which in themselves are no mean achievementMisconceptions of self and world which may be quite instinctive and unphilosophical are deeply anchored in mans natureThey are rooted not only in his intellectual opinions but also in his cravings and in his pride and selfassertionAll these three roots of wrong attitudes identify the alleged self or ego with the five aggregates comprising personalityandenvironmentThese wrong attitudes towards self and world may manifest themselves on various levels as casual thoughtarisings as a habitual bias and in words and deedsOnly if the selfidentification with the actual objects of wrong views ie the five aggregates is radically dissolved on the stage of streamentry can it be said that wrong views of self and world have been totally eliminated together with the bias towards themAs also craving and pride are involved in the formation of wrong views efforts for their effacement have to be undertaken also on the level of ethical behaviorHence the ethical part of the fortyfour Modes of Effacement has validity also for the removal of wrong viewsThe eight meditative attainments lift the human consciousness to sublime heights of refinement yet in the case of each the Buddha emphatically says that they are not states of effacement as he understands themThey can effect only temporary subsidence of defilements and if unsupported by mature virtue and insight they cannot penetrate deep enough into the recesses of the mind for a radical removal of moral and intellectual defilementsIt comes as a kind of anticlimax that after mentioning those sublime meditative attainments the Buddha now speaks of such quite ordinary and earthbound ethical qualities as harmlessness and ascribes to them and not to the meditative absorptions the capacity of leading to effacementThis juxtaposition implies indeed a very strong emphasis on the necessity of a sound ethical foundation for any spiritual progressOften we find that mystic thought in India and elsewhere evolving a monastic system from wrongly interpreted unificatory meditative experience has either ignored ethics or found it difficult to give it a convincing place and motivation in its systemThe exultation of mystic experience also often leads the meditator to a premature feeling of having gone beyond good and evil Such developments illustrate the wisdom of the Buddha in insisting on a sound ethical basis instead of an exclusive reliance on mystic experienceWhen examining closely the structure of this discourse we find in it a repeated balancing of contrasting attitudes of mind and of complementary qualities required for progress on the pathJust now we have observed that meditative achievements have to be balanced with deeply rooted ethical virtues which will also provide a link between the lone meditator and common humanity With the last of the fortyfour Modes of Effacement the effacing of wrong views is taken up again linking up with the beginning of the discourse and balancing the stress on ethical values in most of the other modesIn the phrasing of that last mode we note the stress laid on the overcoming of opinionatedness and tenacityThis points to the fact that for the initial loosening up and final overcoming of wrong views the following ethical modes are of decisive importance amenability and an increasing freedom from a domineering attitude obstinacy and arroganceThe entire discourse seems to be designed to meet in a very thorough manner two opposite psychological obstacles on the path discouragement in the face of its difficulties and overrating of partial resultsThe first part of the discourse deals with the latter extreme by stressing the limitations of initial and partial progressBut for meeting any discouragement caused by these warnings the Compassionate Master speaks of the value of seemingly simple ethical virtues and stresses the importance of the hearts earnest resolve as the first step which anyone can take who is serious about treading the path of actual effacementThese features of the discourse without being stated explicitly are inherent in its very structureThey will reveal themselves by a close scrutiny as here attempted and particularly by the actual practice of the teachings concernedThe Buddha appears here as the great Teacher of the Middle Path and the incomparable guide of mens hearts deeply concerned that those who tread the path may avoid the pitfalls of extreme emotional reactions and of onesided emphasis on any single aspect of the threefold totality of training in virtue concentration and insightAs in the preceding discourse the rendering of the present one also has been chiefly based on anamoli Theras manuscript translationTo a lesser extent use has been made of phrasings by Soma Thera and BHorner and for some passages the Editors own version has been includedThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen one evening the venerable MahaCunda rose from meditative seclusion and went to the Blessed OneHaving paid homage to him he sat down at one side and spoke thus to the Blessed OneVenerable sir there are these various views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines or worlddoctrinesDoes the abandoning and discarding of such views come about in a monk who is only at the beginning of his reflectionsCunda as to those several views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines and worlddoctrines if in which these views arise in which they underlie and become active is seen with right wisdom as it actually is thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self  then the abandoning of these views their discarding takes place in himIt may be Cunda that some monk detached from senseobjects detached from unsalutary ideas enters into the first absorption that is born of detachment accompanied by thoughtconception and discursive thinking and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that after the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking he gains the inner tranquillity and harmony of the second absorption that is free of thoughtconception and discursive thinking born of concentration and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that after the fading away of rapture the monk dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware and he experiences a happiness in his body of which the Noble Ones say Happily lives he who dwells in equanimity and is mindful  that third absorption he wins and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and abides in the fourth absorption which is beyond pleasure and pain and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that with the entire transcending of perceptions of corporeality with the disappearance of perceptions of senseresponse with nonattention to perceptions of variety thinking Space is infinite some monk enters upon and abides in the sphere of infinite space and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsIt may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite space thinking Consciousness is infinite some monk enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsIt may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsIt may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of nothingness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsBut herein Cunda effacement should be practiced by youCunda I say that even the arising of a thought concerned with salutary things is of great importance not to speak of bodily acts and words conformingTherefore CundaSuppose Cunda there were an uneven road and another even road by which to avoid it and suppose there were an uneven ford and another even ford by which to avoid itSo tooCunda as all unsalutary states lead downward and all salutary states lead upward even so CundaCunda it is impossible that one who is himself sunk in the mire should pull out another who is sunk in the mireBut it is possible Cunda that one not sunk in the mire himself should pull out another who is sunk in the mireIt is not possible Cunda that one who is himself not restrained not disciplined and not quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenchingBut it is possible Cunda that one who is himself restrained disciplined and fully quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenchingEven so CundaThus Cunda I have shown to you the instruction on effacement I have shown to you the instruction on thoughts arising I have shown to you the instruction on avoidance I have shown to you the instruction on the way upward I have shown to you the instruction on quenchingWhat can be done for his disciples by a Master who seeks their welfare and has compassion and pity on them that I have done for you CundaThere are these roots of trees there are empty placesMeditate Cunda do not delay lest you later regret itThis is my message to youThus spoke the Blessed OneSatisfied the venerable Cunda rejoiced in the Blessed Ones wordsAccording to the Comy the Theras question concerns those who overrate the degree of their achievement ie those who believe that in their meditative practice they have achieved this or that result while actually they have notOverestimation in that sense does not arise in ignorant common people who are entirely engrossed in worldly life nor does it arise in Noble Disciples because in a streamwinner the overestimation does not arise that he is a oncereturner etcSelfoverestimation can occur only in one who actually practices and has temporarily subdued the defilements by way of tranquillity or insightMahaCunda Thera being an arahant was no selfoverrater himself but in formulating his question he put himself in the place of one who is or as others say there may have been such selfoverraters among his pupils and for conveying to them the Buddhas reply he put his questionUnderlie ie habitually occurComy This refers to views which having been indulged in repeatedly have become strong and have not been removed SubComy By ultimate eliminationBecome activeComy Wrong views have arrived at the doors of body and speech ie which have found expression in words and deedsThe common meaning of sallekha is austere practice or asceticism but in the Buddhas usage it is the radical effacing or removal of the defilementsThe eight stages of meditation given here in the discourse consist of the four finematerial absorptions and the four immaterial absorptionsComysays that these meditative attainments are in common with the ascetics outsideComy The overraters meditative absorption is neither effacement nor is it the path of practice for effacementAnd why notBecause that jhana is not used by him as a basis for insight that is after rising from jhana he does not scrutinize the formationsHis jhana produces only onepointedness of mind and is as our text says an abiding in ease here and nowSubComy If one wishing to overcome the suffering of samsara goes with joyful confidence for refuge to the Triple Gem then this Refuge will be for him a supporting condition for higher virtue etc and it may gradually lead him to the attainment of the path of understandingThe Fortyfour Ways of EffacementSubComy But why is harmlessness mentioned at the very beginningBecause it is the root of all virtues harmlessness namely is a synonym of compassionEspecially it is the rootcause of morality because it makes one refrain from immorality which has as its characteristic mark the harming of othersJust as the killing of living beings has the harming of others as its mark so also the taking away of others property for robbing a mans wealth is worse than stabbing him Similarly chastity removes the cause for the pains of child bearing etc and there is hardly a need to mention the harm done by adulteryObvious is also the harm done to others by deception by causing dissension and by backbitingThe mark of harming others is also attached to gossip because it takes away what is beneficial and causes to arise what is not beneficial to covetousness as it causes one to take what is not given to ill will as it causes killing etc to wrong views as they are the cause of all that is unbeneficialOne who holds wrong views may in the conviction of acting righteously kill living beings and incite others to do likewiseThere is nothing to say about otherHarmlessness has the characteristic mark of making one refrain from immorality which on its part has the mark of harmingHence harmlessness is an especially strong productive cause of morality and morality again is the basis for concentration of mind while concentration is the basis for wisdomIn that way harmlessness is the root of all virtuesFurthermore in the case of the highest type of men who have noble aspirations who act considerately and wisely also their mental concentration and their wisdom just as their morality is conducive to the weal and happiness of othersIn that way too compassion is the root of all virtues and therefore it has been mentioned at the beginningNow the salutary courses of action are to show that these states are produced by harmlessnessThen follow the eight states of rightness to show that they must be brought about by basing them on morality which is the root of these virtuesNow the separation from the hindrances is included to indicate that this is the primary task for one intent on purifying the eightfold pathThen follows the cleansing from the defilements to indicate that effacement is accomplished by giving up anger etcAnd the cleansing from the defilements will be successful when aided by amenability to advice noble friendship and heedful diligenceNow the seven noble qualities are included to show that they will come to perfection in him who is endowed with amenability and the other and that they on their part after having strengthened insight will lead to the paths of sanctitudeFinally the passage on misapprehending according to ones individual views etcis meant to indicate that for such a one that wrong attitude is an obstacle to the attainment of the supramundane virtues and is therefore to be avoided totallyThis passage on misapprehending is also meant to show that one who by the right conduct here described is in the process of attaining one of the paths of sanctitude will be led to the acme of effacementIn this manner should be understood the purpose of stating these fortyfour modes of effacement as well as the order in which they appear in the discourseComysays that a salutary thought is of great importance as it leads entirely to weal and happiness and as it is the cause for the subsequent actions conforming to itExamples are given beginning with the intention to give almsfood to monks up to the aspiration for BuddhahoodThe SubComy however says that in some cases the importance is not in the thought itself but only in the actual execution of itThis certainly applies to the intention to give alms etcBut in the efforts for effacing the defilements the formation of a mental attitude directed towards it in other words the hearts resolve is certainly an important factorThis section of the discourse has been condensed in the present translationBut he who has chosen the path of effacement as his way of practice is well advised to repeat all fortyfour items linking them with his hearts earnest resolveAlso the last two sections of the discourse have been condensedAny salutary states of mind whether they produce rebirth or not and whether in a given rebirth they produce kamma results or not  all because of their type lead upwardsThey are just like that because on the occasion of their yielding a kamma result that result will be desirable and pleasantThe connection is as follows just as unsalutary states lead downwards so it is with that one state of harmfulness for him who is harmfulJust as all salutary states lead upwards so it is with that one state of harmlessness for him who is harmlessSuppose there is a king who sends a letter to the border region and the people there unable to read it by themselves have the letter read to them by another able to do itHaving learned of the contents they respond with respect knowing it as the kings orderBut they do not think that it is the letter readers order he will receive praise only for his smooth and fluent reading of the letterSimilarly even if preachers of the ability of Sariputta Thera expound the Dhamma still they are just like readers of a letter written by anotherTheir sermon should truly be attributed to the Blessed One like the decree to the kingThe preachers however receive their limited praise just because they expound the Dhamma with a smooth and fluent dictionHence that statement in the discourse is correctThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose Dhammapada The message of the Awakened Ones so stated as it is in the Dhammapada in the plain terms of good and evil upholds the same values that every great compassionate religion sharesBut the seed of good has to grow in the soil of truth and how the tree grows depends upon the nature of the soil in which it is planted and whence it draws nourishmentWith men as the custodians of the true the fulfillment of the good depends upon how truth is conceived by men to beBy their acts they verify itSo it was said of him at the timeBut what then was the fundamental ground of that teachingOf the many ways that such a question might be answered perhaps the simplest and best is this He expounded the teaching that is peculiar to Buddhas suffering origination cessation and a pathThese four are known as the Four Noble TruthsThis with the cognate teaching of No Self may be said to constitute the fundamental ground of the teaching of Buddhas this is what marks them sets them apart and entitles them to the unique epithet BuddhaThe three discourses here presented display precisely in all its incomparably serene simplicity without assumptions that special fundamental teaching from which all Buddhism branches and to which it all points backThe first discourse displays this fourfold Truth as something to be realized and verified for oneself here and now the second discloses the contradictions which infect all self conceits the third echoes the second from another angleThe circumstances that lead up to the discovery of these four Truths and to the delivery of these discourses were briefly as followsThe Bodhisatta  as he then was before his awakening  was twenty nine when he left the house life where he enjoyed the extreme of luxuryHe went into exile in order to find not a palliative but the true and incontrovertible way out of sufferingHe studied and practiced under two of the foremost teachers of Samadhi and reached the highest meditative attainments possible therebyBut that was not enough He then spent the best part of the next six years in the practice of asceticism trying every sort of extreme selfmortificationDuring this time he was waited on by five ascetics who hoped that if he discovered the deathless state he would be able to communicate his discovery to themThis too failedHe decided to try once more the path of concentration attained through mindfulness of breathing though this time not pushed to the extremity of quiet but guided instead by ordered considerationHe now gave up selfmortification and took normal food again in order to restore to his emaciated body strength sufficient for his purposeThen the five ascetics left him in disgust judging that he had failed and was merely reverting to what he had forsakenBut now in solitude his new balanced effort in the harmony of virtue unified in concentration and guided by the ordered consideration of insight with mindfulness at length brought success in discovery of the way to the goal he had sought for so longFive faculties in perfect balance had brought him to his goal they were the four namely energy mindfulness concentration and understanding with faith in the efficacy of the other four  the five that merge into the DeathlessAccording to tradition the Awakening took place on the night of Vesakha full moon in the fruitful month of MayIt was upon invitation that he resolved to communicate his discovery to othersFor his first audience to whom to divulge it he chose the five ascetics who had shared his selfmortification but had later left himThey were now at Benares  Indias eternal city  and so in due course he went there to rejoin themJust two months after his awakening he preached his first sermon  the Setting Rolling of the Wheel of Truth or Bringing into Existence the Blessing of the True Ideal  with the five ascetics for his hearersThe tradition says it was the evening of the Asalha full moon in July the day before the rainy season begins and he began to speak at the moment when the sun was dipping and the full moon simultaneously risingThis his first sermon made one of his listeners the ascetic Kondañña a streamenterer with his attainment of the first of the four progressive stages of realizationThe other four soon followed in his footstepsThe second sermon on the characteristic of NotSelf was preached to the same five and it brought them to the fourth and final stage that of arahatship and then as it is said there were six arahats in the worldThese are the first two discourses presented here and they were the first two sermons ever uttered by the BuddhaThe third the Fire Sermon was delivered some months later to an audience of a thousand ascetics converted from the heavenbent practice of fireworshipAll three discourses deal only with understanding among the faculties mentioned above as required to be balancedBut understanding in order to reach perfection has indeed to be aided by the others or in other words to be founded upon virtue and to be fortified by concentrationThus and no otherwise can it reach its goal of unshakable liberationNow the hearers of all these three discourses were like the Buddha himself all ascetics already expert in the techniques and refinements of both virtue and concentrationSo the Buddha had thus no need to tell them about what they already knew very wellSimilarly he had no need to expound the doctrine of action and its ripening with which they were thoroughly acquainted through the ancient teachingsWhat he had to do was first to show how it is possible to go astray towards the opposite extremes of sensual indulgence and selftorment and second to describe the facts to show how things are clearly and succinctly enough to stir his hearers to the additional spontaneous movement of understanding essential and indispensable for the final discovery of deliverance each for himselfNow let the discourses speak for themselvesTheir incalculable strength lies in their simplicity and in their actualityThe profound truth is there discoverable even through the misty medium of translationThus I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThere he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of fiveBhikkhus these two extremes ought not to be cultivated by one gone forth from the houselifeWhat are the twoThere is devotion to indulgence of pleasure in the objects of sensual desire which is inferior low vulgar ignoble and leads to no good and there is devotion to selftorment which is painful ignoble and leads to no goodThe middle way discovered by a Perfect One avoids both these extremes it gives vision it gives knowledge and it leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbanaAnd what is that middle wayIt is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThat is the middle way discovered by a Perfect One which gives vision which gives knowledge and which leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbanaSuffering as a noble truth is this Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering association with the loathed is suffering dissociation from the loved is suffering not to get what one wants is suffering  in short suffering is the five categories of clinging objectsThe origin of suffering as a noble truth is this It is the craving that produces renewal of being accompanied by enjoyment and lust and enjoying this and that in other words craving for sensual desires craving for being craving for nonbeingCessation of suffering as a noble truth is this It is remainderless fading and ceasing giving up relinquishing letting go and rejecting of that same cravingThe way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this It is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationSuffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThis suffering as a noble truth can be diagnosed Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThis suffering as a noble truth has been diagnosed Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThe origin of suffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision This origin of suffering as a noble truth can be abandoned Such was the vision This origin of suffering as a noble truth has been abandoned Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeCessation of suffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision This cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be verified Such was the vision This cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been verified Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeThe way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this Such was the vision This way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be developed Such was the vision This way leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been developed Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me beforeAs long as my knowing and seeing how things are was not quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths I did not claim in the world with its gods its Maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans with its princes and men to have discovered the full awakening that is supremeBut as soon as my knowing and seeing how things are was quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths then I claimed in the world with its gods its Maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans its princes and men to have discovered the full awakening that is supremeKnowing and seeing arose in me thus My hearts deliverance is unassailableThis is the last birthNow there is no renewal of being That is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus of the group of five were glad and they approved his wordsNow during this utterance there arose in the venerable Kondañña the spotless immaculate vision of the True Idea Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessationWhen the Wheel of Truth had thus been set rolling by the Blessed One the earthgods raised the cry At Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana the matchless Wheel of truth has been set rolling by the Blessed One not to be stopped by monk or divine or god or deathangel or high divinity or anyone in the worldOn hearing the earthgods cry all the gods in turn in the six paradises of the sensual sphere took up the cry till it reached beyond the Retinue of High Divinity in the sphere of pure formAnd so indeed in that hour at that moment the cry soared up to the World of High Divinity and this tenthousandfold worldelement shook and rocked and quaked and a great measureless radiance surpassing the very nature of the gods was displayed in the worldThen the Blessed One uttered the exclamation Kondañña knowsKondañña knows and that is how that venerable one acquired the name AññaKondañña  Kondañña who knowsThus I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThere he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five Bhikkhus  Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus form is notselfWere form self then this form would not lead to affliction and one could have it of form Let my form be thus let my form be not thus And since form is notself so it leads to affliction and none can have it of form Let my form be thus let my form be not thusBhikkhus feeling is notselfBhikkhus perception is notselfBhikkhus determinations are notselfBhikkhus consciousness is not selfWere consciousness self then this consciousness would not lead to affliction and one could have it of consciousness Let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thus And since consciousness is notself so it leads to affliction and none can have it of consciousness Let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thusBhikkhus how do you conceive it is form permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable Sir  Now is what is impermanent painful or pleasant  Painful venerable Sir  Now is what is impermanent what is painful since subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this is I this is my self No venerable sirIs feeling permanent or impermanentIs perception permanent or impermanentAre determinations permanent or impermanentIs consciousness permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable sir  Now is what is impermanent pleasant or painful  Painful venerable sir  Now is what is impermanent what is painful since subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this is I this is my self No venerable sirSo bhikkhus any kind of form whatever whether past future or presently arisen whether gross or subtle whether in oneself or external whether inferior or superior whether far or near must with right understanding how it is be regarded thus This is not mine this is not I this is not myselfAny kind of feeling whateverAny kind of perception whateverAny kind of determination whateverAny kind of consciousness whatever whether past future or presently arisen whether gross or subtle whether in oneself or external whether inferior or superior whether far or near must with right understanding how it is be regarded thus This is not mine this is not I this is not my selfBhikkhus when a noble follower who has heard sees thus he finds estrangement in form he finds estrangement in feeling he finds estrangement in perception he finds estrangement in determinations he finds estrangement in consciousnessWhen he finds estrangement passion fades outWith the fading of passion he is liberatedWhen liberated there is knowledge that he is liberatedHe understands Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what can be done is done of this there is no more beyond That is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were glad and they approved his wordsNow during this utterance the hearts of the bhikkhus of the group of five were liberated from taints through clinging no moreThus I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Gaya at Gayasisa together with a thousand bhikkhusThere he addressed the bhikkhusBhikkhus all is burningAnd what is the all that is burningThe eye is burning forms are burning eyeconsciousness is burning eyecontact is burning also whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with eyecontact for its indispensable condition that too is burningBurning with whatBurning with the fire of lust with the fire of hate with the fire of delusionI say it is burning with birth aging and death with sorrows with lamentations with pains with griefs with despairsThe

eyecontact and whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainful norpleasant that arises with eyecontact for its indispensable condition in that too he finds estrangementHe finds estrangement

liberatedHe understands Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what can be done is done of this there is no more beyond That is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were glad and they approved his wordsNow during his utterance the hearts of those thousand bhikkhus were liberated from taints through clinging no moreTHUS I HEARD Words spoken by Ananda Thera at the First Council when all the Discourses were recited three months after the Buddhas ParinibbanaPERFECT ONE The Pali word Tathagata has several alternative explanations including tatha agato tatha gato and tathalakkhanam agatoNIBBANA Pali nibbana Sanskrit nirvanaThe meaning is extinction that is of the fires of lust hate and delusion or more briefly of craving and ignorance and so nibbana is a name for the third Truth as liberationThe word is made up of the prefix nir and vana probably the origin was a smiths fire which goes out or becomes extinguished if no longer blown on by the bellows but the simile most used is that of a lamps extinguishment through exhaustion of wick and oilNOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH The members of the path are defined in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta and elsewhere as followsRight Intention governed by renunciation nonillwill and noncrueltyRight Speech in abstention from lying slander abuse and gossipRight Action in abstention from killing stealing and sexual misconductRight Livelihood for bhikkhus as that allowed by the Rules of the Discipline and for laymen as avoidance of trading in weapons living beings meat intoxicants and poisonsRight Effort to avoid unarisen and to abandon arisen evil and to arouse unarisen and to develop arisen goodRight Mindfulness of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness as given in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta  that is contemplation of the body as a body of feelings as feelings of states of consciousness as states of consciousness and of ideas as ideasRight Concentration as the four jhana meditationsCollectively the first two members are called Understanding the next three Virtue and the last three ConcentrationThe Noble Eightfold Path is developed in four progressive stages namely those of streamentry oncereturn nonreturn and Arahatship this being the end of craving which causes sufferingSUFFERING the Pali word dukkha made up of dur and kha extends its meaning from the actual suffering present in physical pain or mental grief to any unwelcome state of insecurity no matter how vagueTRUTH Pali sacca from the root sa and so literally a thereisness in the sense of a state that unlike a mirage does not deceive or disappointThe common sense use of truth is by no means consistent and the word and the notion must therefore be handled with some care taking it here only as treated by the BuddhaAs to individual philosophers and divines individual factional truths  that is to say The world is eternal or The world is not eternal or The world is finite or the world is infinite The soul is what the body is or The soul is one the body is another After death a Perfect One is or After death a Perfect One is not or After death a Perfect One both is and is not or After death a Perfect One neither is nor is not  when a bhikkhu has cast off all of these has renounced and rejected banished abandoned and relinquished them all he thus becomes one who has cast off all factional truthsBut how is truth to be found which is not factionalThere are five ideas that ripen here and now in two waysWhat fiveFaith preference hearsaylearning arguing upon evidence and liking through pondering a viewNow something may have faith well placed in it and yet be hollow empty and false and again something may have no faith placed in it and yet be factual true and no other than it seems and so with preference and the restIf a man has faith then he guards truth when he says My faith is thus but on that account draws no unreserved conclusion Only this is true the other is wrong In this way he guards the truth but there is as yet no discovery of truthAnd so with preference and the restHow is truth discoveredHere a bhikkhu lives near some village or townThen a householder or his son goes to him in order to test him in three kinds of ideas in ideas provocative of greed of hate and of delusion wondering Are there in this venerable one any such ideas whereby his mind being obsessed he might not knowing say I know unseeing say I see or to get others to do likewise which would be long for their harm and suffering While thus testing him he comes to find that there are no such ideas in him and he finds that The bodily and verbal behavior of that venerable one are not those of one affected by lust or hate or delusionBut the True Idea that this venerable one teaches is profound hard to see and discover yet it is the most peaceful and superior of all out of reach of logical ratiocination subtle for the wise to experience such a True Idea cannot be taught by one affected by lust or hate or delusionIt is as soon as by testing him he comes to see that he is purified from ideas provocative of lust hate and delusion that he then plants his faith in himWhen he visits him he respects him when he respects him he gives ear one who gives ear hears the True Idea he remembers it he investigates the meaning of the ideas rememberedWhen he does that he acquires a preference by pondering the ideasThat produces interestOne interested is actively committedSo committed he makes a judgmentAccording to his judgment he exerts himselfWhen he exerts himself he comes to realize with the body the ultimate truth and he sees it by the penetrating of it with understandingThat is how there is discovery of truthBut there is as yet no final arrival at truthHow is truth finally arrived atFinal arrival at truth is the repetition the keeping in being the development of those same ideasThat is how there is final arrival at truthThis undeceptive truth so arrived at is the Four Noble Truths of which it is saidThese four noble truths are what is real not unreal not other that is why they are called Noble Truths SaccaSamyuttaBesides this essential static unity of the four truths as undeceptiveness the dynamic structure of the transfiguration which they operate in combination is expressed as followsWho sees suffering sees also the origin of suffering and the cessation of suffering and the way leading to cessation of suffering Sacca SamyuttaOf these four noble truths there is noble truth to be diagnosed there is noble truth to be abandoned there is noble truth to be verified and there is noble truth to be developed Sacca SamyuttaCATEGORIES this represents the Pali word khandha which is often rendered by aggregate The five are as given in the second DiscourseThey are headings that comprise all that can be said to arise and that form the object of clingingThe clinging is neither the same of these five categories which are its objects nor is it something apart from them it is will and lust in regard to these five categories of clingings objects that is the clinging there The five are respectively compared to a lump of froth a bubble a mirage a coreless plantainstem and a conjuring trickCLINGING an unsatisfactory and inadequate but accepted rendering for the Pali upadanaThe word means literally taking up By first metaphor it is used for the assumption and consumption that satisfies craving and produces existenceAs such it is the condition sine qua non for beingWhat is consumed is the categoriesThe word clinging has to represent this meaningClingings ending is nibbanaCRAVING though the word tanha doubtless once meant thirst it is never used in Pali in that senseWith ignorance it is regarded as a basic factor in the continuity of existenceCraving draws creatures on through greed and drives them on through hate while ignorance prevents their seeing the truth of how things are or where they are goingDenial is as much an activity of craving as assertion isDenial maintains the deniedCESSATION nirodha meaning the cessation of suffering through the cessation of craving is regardable as the removal of a poison the curing of a disease not as the mere denial of it opposed to the assertion of it or the obstruction of it in conflict with the favoring of it since both assertion and denial confirm and maintain alike the basic idea or state that is required to be curedCessation therefore is not to be confounded with mere negativism or nihilismAny pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on the world is gratification that the world is impermanent painhaunted and inseparable from the idea of change is the disappointment in the world the removal of desire and lust is the cure in the world The cure or escape is Cessation the Buddha would not claim awakening till he had diagnosed how these three things came to beKNOWING AND SEEING HOW THINGS ARE the force of the Pali word yathabhuta come to be how is how exist lies in the direct allusion to the absolutely relative conditionedness of all beingIt is given specially thus Seeing such is form such its origin such its going out and so with the other four categoriesTHE VENERABLE KONDAA one of the five bhikkhusSee IntroductionFORM Pali rupaAs the first of five categories it is defined in terms of the four Great entities namely earth water fire and air along with the negative aspect of space from all of which are derived the secondary phenomena such as persons features shapes etc these are regarded as secondary because while form can appear without any of them they cannot appear without formIt is also defined as that which is being worn away thus underlining its general characteristics of instabilityNOTSELF Together with the four truths this is taught only by BuddhasAnatta is shown as a general characteristic without exceptionThe characteristic of impermanence does not become apparent because when rise and fall are not given attention it is concealed by continuity the characteristic of pain does not become apparent because when continuous oppression is not given attention it is concealed by the postures the characteristic of notself does not become apparent because when resolution into the various elements is not given attention it is concealed by compactness Visuddhimagga ChXXISelfidentification and hunger for permanence and bliss form the principal manifestations of craving guided by view that is wrong because it is not in conformity with undeceptive truthWhen confronted with the contradictions and the impossibility of selfidentification with any of the five Categories of Clingings objects craving seeks to satisfy this need by imagining a soul but since no such soul however conceived can escape falling within the five Categories of Clingings objects this solution is always foredoomed to failureSimilarly any attempt to identify self with nibbana must always fail for the same reasonNibbana conceived as identical or as apart from it or inside it or nibbana conceived as mine is misconceivedThis does not prevent a Perfect One from using the speech that is current in the world in order to communicate though he does so without misapprehending it it as is shown in the Dhammapada Dhammapada Verses Similarly with the expression in oneself in the Second Discourse this is simply a convenient convention for the focus of the individual viewpoint not to be misapprehendedA bhikkhu heard the Buddha saying as in the Second Discourse here that the five Categories are not mine etc and he wondered So it seems form is notself feeling perception determinations and consciousness are notselfWhat self then will the action done by the notself affect He was severely rebuked by the Buddha for forgetting the conditionedness of all arisen thingsIt is impossible that anyone with right view should see any idea as self and Whatever philosophers and divines see self in its various forms they see only the five Categories or one or other of them FEELING this is always confined strictly to the affective feelings of pleasure and pain with the normally ignored neutral feeling of neitherpainnor pleasure These can be subdivided in various waysPERCEPTION means simply recognitionDETERMINATIONS a great many different renderings of this term are current the next best of which is certainly formations The Pali word sankhara means literally a construction and is derived from the prefix sam plus the verb karoti compare the Latin conficere from con plus facere which gives the French confectionThe Sanskrit means ritual acts with the purpose of bringing about good rebirthAs used in Pali by the Buddha it covers any aspects having to do with action willing making planning using choice etc and contact is often placed at the head of lists defining itOtherwise defined as bodily verbal and mental actionCONSCIOUSNESS is here the bare being conscious left for consideration when the other four categories have been dealt withIt is only describable in individual plurality in terms of the other four Categories as fire is individualized only by the fuel it burnsOtherwise it is regardable as an infiniteness dependent upon the contemplation of it as suchIt is only impermanent etc because however it arises it can only do so in dependence on the other Categories that is on conditions themselves impermanent painful and notselfIt never arises unless accompanied by conascent perception and feelingIt has six doors for cognizing its objective fields but no moreESTRANGEMENT the Pali noun nibbida and its verb nibbindati are made up of the prefix nir in its negative sense of out and the root vidNibbada is thus a finding outWhat is thus found out is the intimate hidden contradictoriness in any kind of selfidentification based in any way on these thingsElsewhere the Buddha saysWhatever there is there of form feeling perception determinations or consciousness such ideas he sees as impermanent as subject to pain as a sickness as a tumor as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as an alienation as a disintegration as a void as notselfHe averts his heart from those ideas and for the most peaceful the supreme goal he turns his heart to the deathless element that is to say the stilling of all determinations the relinquishment of all substance the exhaustion of craving the fading of passion cessation extinctionThe stuff of life can also be seen thusNormally the discovery of a contradiction is for the unliberated mind a disagreeable oneSeveral courses are then openIt can refuse to face it pretending to itself to the point of full persuasion and belief that no contradiction is there or one side of the contradiction may be unilaterally affirmed and the other repressed and forgotten or a temporary compromise may be found or else the contradiction may be faced in its truth and made the basis for a movement towards liberationSo too on finding estrangement thus two main courses are open either the search leaving craving for selfidentification intact can be continued for sops to allay the symptoms of the sickness or else a movement can be started in the direction of a cure for the underlying sickness of craving and liberation from the everlasting hunt for palliatives whether for oneself or othersIn this sense alone Self protection is the protection of others and protection of others selfprotectionEYE etc the six beginning with the eye and ending with the mind are called the six Bases for Contact in oneself and are also known as the six Doors of perceptionTheir corresponding objects are called external bases since the emphasis here is on the subjective faculty of seeing etc not the associated piece of flesh seen in someone else or in the lookingglass which in so far as it is visible is not seeing but form as the external object of the seeing eye in oneself and insofar as it is tangible is the object of the bodybase in oneself and insofar as it is apprehended as a bodily feature is the object of the mindbase in oneselfHere the eye should be taken simply as the perspectivepointinginwardtoacenter in the otherwise uncoordinated visual field consisting of colors which makes them cognizable by eyeconsciousness and which is misconceivable as I The six Bases in Oneself are compared to an empty village and the six External Bases to villageraiding robbersFORMS the first of the six External Bases respective objective fields or objects of the six Bases in OneselfThe Pali word rupa is used for the eyes object as for the first of the five Categories but here in the pluralColors the basis for the visual perspective of the eye are intended primarily see also under FORM aboveCONTACT the Pali word phassa comes from the verb phusati from which also comes the word photthabbaBut here it is generalized to mean contact in the sense of presence of object to subject or presence of cognized to consciousness in all forms of consciousnessIt is defined as follows Eyeconsciousness arises dependent on eye and on forms the coincidence of the three is contact and likewise in the cases of the ear nose tongue body and mindFailing it no knowledge no consciousness of any sort whatever can arise at all This fundamental idea is sometimes placed at the head of lists of things defining DeterminationsBODY the Pali word kaya is used both for the physical body and for any group as the English word body isIn Pali it is also used in the sense for the physical frame namely this body with its consciousness in a general sense sometimes called old action and then it forms the subject of body contemplation as set forth in the Satipatthana Sutta the aim of which is to analyze this conglomeration into its motley constituentsOr else it is used in a strict sense as here namely that door of the subjective bodysensitivity or tactile sense the perspectivepointinginwardstoacenter in the otherwise uncoordinated tactile field of tangibles consisting of the hard the hotorcold and the distendedandmovableMIND the Pali word mano belongs to the root meaning to measure compare coordinateHere it is intended as that special door in which the five kinds of consciousness arising in the other five doors combine themselves with their objective fields into a unitive perspectivepointinginwardstoacenter together with certain objects apprehendable in this minddoor such as infiniteness of space etcWhatever is cognized in this door is cognized as an ideaAnd in the presence of ignorance it is misconceived as I It is thus the fusing of this heterogeneous stuff of experience into a coherent pattern when it also has the function of giving temporal succession and flow to that pattern by its presenting all ideas for cognition as preceded In the Abhidhamma but not in the Suttas the form which is the support for the mind is mentioned but not further specifiedThis would place mind on a somewhat similar basis to the eyeseeing as meant here in its relation to the objective piece of fleshLater notions coupled it with the heartNow fashion identifies it with the brain but such identifications are not easy to justify unilaterally and if they in any way depend upon a prior and always philosophically questionable assumption of a separate bodysubstance and a mindsubstance they will find no footing in the Buddhas teaching where substances are not assumedMINDCONSCIOUSNESS if it is remarked that each of the six pairs of Bases the five consisting of eye ear nose tongue and body being coordinated by mind are open to any ones selfinspection and that consciousness is considered here as arising dependently upon each of these six pairs of Bases and in no other way whatsoever then this notion of mindconsciousness should present no special difficultyIDEA the word dhamma is gerundive from the verb dharati thus it means literally a carryable a rememberable In this context of the six pairs of Bases it means the rememberables which form the minds special object as distinct from the forms seen only with the eye the sounds heard with the ear the odors smelt with the nose the flavors tasted with the tongue and the tangibles touched with the body ideas are what are apprehended through the minddoorThese six cover all that can be knownBut while the first are uncoordinated between themselves and have no direct access to each other in the minddoor the five find a common denominator and are given a coordinating perspective together with the minds own special objectsSo the idea as a rememberable is the aspect of the known apprehended by the mind whether coordinating the five kinds of consciousness or apprehending the ideas peculiar to it or whether apprehending its own special objectsThis must include all the many other meanings of the word dhammaNibbana in so far as it is knowable  describable  is an object of the mind and is thus an ideaAll ideas are notself What is inherently unknowable has no place in the TeachingThe first of these three discourses sets out the vision of the truth peculiar to Buddhas with its foundation of SufferingThe second then takes the five Categories given in the definition of Suffering in the first and it shows how in this comprehensive analysis every component can be diagnosed rightly that is to say in conformity with truthIt is this treatment that elicits the characteristic of NotselfThe two characteristics of Impermanence and Suffering in the world were well recognized in ancient indian philosophies and have never been peculiar to BuddhismThis exposure of the inherent contradiction in the very nature of the idea of selfidentity to which craving cleaves with the wouldbe selfpreserving stranglehold of a drowning man upon his rescuer is here made the very basis for the movement to liberationCraving is cured through coming to understand how things are while truth is being guardedThe consequent fading of lust is brought about by this discovery of truth and the understanding that there is no more of this beyond is the result of the final arrival at Truth by keeping it in being through developmentIn the third discourse the very same ground is gone over but described in different termsThe comprehensive analysis in terms of the five categories with their general rather than individual emphasis is replaced by the equally comprehensive and complementary analysis in terms of the six pairs of Bases which analyze the individual viewpoint without which no consciousness can ariseAnd instead of the dispassionate term Notself everything that could possibly be identified as self is without mentioning the term presented to the same effect in the colors of a conflagration of passion behind a mirage of deceptionOnly a Buddha whose heart is cooled by compassion can have the courage to venture so far in the search for truth and discover thereby the true state of peaceThe Buddhas in the past accomplished and fully awakened those the Blessed Ones maintained the efficacy of action and of certain action to be done and so will those do in the future and so do I nowThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe instruction of the Kalamas is justly famous for its encouragement of free inquiry the spirit of the sutta signifies a teaching that is exempt from fanaticism bigotry dogmatism and intoleranceThe reasonableness of the Dhamma the Buddhas teaching is chiefly evident in its welcoming careful examination at all stages of the path to enlightenmentIndeed the whole course of training for wisdom culminating in the purity of the consummate one is intimately bound up with examination and analysis of things internal the eye and visible objects the ear and sounds the nose and smells the tongue and tastes the body and tactile impressions the mind and ideasThus since all phenomena have to be correctly understood in the field of Dhamma insight is operative throughoutIn this sutta it is active in rejecting the bad and adopting the good way in the extracts given below in clarifying the basis of knowledge of conditionality and arhatshipHere it may be mentioned that the methods of examination in the Kalama Sutta and in the extracts cited here have sprung from the knowledge of things as they are and that the tenor of these methods are implied in all straight thinkingFurther as penetration and comprehension the constituents of wisdom are the result of such thinking the place of critical examination and analysis in the development of right vision is obviousWhere is the wisdom or vision that can descend all of a sudden untouched and uninfluenced by a critical thoughtThe Kalama Sutta which sets forth the principles that should be followed by a seeker of truth and which contains a standard things are judged by belongs to a framework of the Dhamma the four solaces taught in the sutta point out the extent to which the Buddha permits suspense of judgment in matters beyond normal cognitionThe solaces show that the reason for a virtuous life does not necessarily depend on belief in rebirth or retribution but on mental wellbeing acquired through the overcoming of greed hate and delusionMore than fifty years ago Moncure DConway the author of My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East visited ColomboHe was a friend of Ponnambalam Ramanathan and together with him Conway went to the Vidyodaya Pirivena to learn something of the Buddhas teaching from Hikkaduve Siri Sumangala Nayaka Thera the founder of the institutionThe Nayaka Thera explained to them the principles contained in the Kalama Sutta and at the end of the conversation Ramanathan whispered to Conway Is it not strange that you and I who come from far different religions and regions should together listen to a sermon from the Buddha in favor of that free thought that independence of traditional and fashionable doctrines which is still the vital principle of human development  Conway Yes and we with the princes pronounce his doctrines goodFriend Savittha apart from faith apart from liking apart

done and there is no more of this to comeSamyuttanikaya Salyatanavagga Navapuranavagga Sutta NoI heard thusOnce the Blessed One while wandering in the Kosala country with a large community of bhikkhus entered a town of the Kalama people called KesaputtaThe Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta Reverend Gotama the monk the son of the Sakyans has while wandering in the Kosala country entered KesaputtaThe good repute of the Reverend Gotama has been spread in this way Indeed the Blessed One is thus consummate fully enlightened endowed with knowledge and practice sublime knower of the worlds peerless guide of tamable men teacher of divine and human beings which he by himself has through direct knowledge understood clearlyHe set forth the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle good in the end possessed of meaning and the letter and complete in everything and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly pureSeeing such consummate ones is good indeedThen the Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta went to where the Blessed One wasOn arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side some exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable talk sat down on one side some saluted him raising their joined palms and sat down on one side some announced their name and family and sat down on one side some without speaking sat down on one sideThe Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting on one side said to the Blessed One There are some monks and brahmans venerable sir who visit KesaputtaThey expound and explain only their own doctrines the doctrines of others they despise revile and pull to piecesSome other monks and brahmans too venerable sir come to KesaputtaThey also expound and explain only their own doctrines the

has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIf we contemplate even a minute sector of lifes vast range we are faced with a variety of living forms so tremendous that it defies all descriptionYet three basic features can be discerned as common to everything that has animate existence from the microbe to man from the simplest sensations to the thoughts of a creative geniusThese three basic facts were first found and formulated over years ago by the Buddha who was rightly called the Knower of the WorldThey are designated in Buddhist terminology the three characteristics  the invariable marks or signs of everything that springs into being the signata stamped upon the very face of life itselfOf the three the first and third apply directly to inanimate existence as well as to the animate for every concrete entity by its very nature undergoes change and is devoid of substanceThe second feature suffering is of course only an experience of the animateBut the Buddha applies the characteristic of suffering to all conditioned things in the sense that for living beings everything conditioned is a potential cause of experienced suffering and is at any rate incapable of giving lasting satisfactionThus the three are truly universal marks pertaining even to what is below or beyond our normal range of perceptionThe Buddha teaches that life can be correctly understood only if these basic facts are understoodAnd this understanding must take place not only logically but in confrontation with ones own experienceInsightwisdom which is the ultimate liberating factor in Buddhism consists in just this experiential understanding of the three characteristics as applied to ones own bodily and mental processes and deepened and matured in meditationTo see things as they really are means to see them consistently in the light of the three characteristicsNot to see them in this way or to deceive oneself about their reality and range of application is the defining mark of ignorance and ignorance is by itself a potent cause of suffering knitting the net in which man is caught  the net of false hopes of unrealistic and harmful desires of delusive ideologies and of perverted values and aimsIgnoring or distorting the three basic facts ultimately leads only to frustration disappointment and despairBut if we learn to see through deceptive appearances and discern the three characteristics this will yield immense benefits both in our daily life and in our spiritual strivingOn the mundane level the clear comprehension of impermanence suffering and nonself will bring us a saner outlook on lifeIt will free us from unrealistic expectations bestow a courageous acceptance of suffering and failure and protect us against the lure of deluded assumptions and beliefsIn our quest for the supramundane comprehension of the three characteristics will be indispensableThe meditative experience of all phenomena as inseparable from the three marks will loosen and finally cut the bonds binding us to an existence falsely imagined to be lasting pleasurable and substantiveWith growing clarity all things internal and external will be seen in their true nature as constantly changing as bound up with suffering and as unsubstantial without an eternal soul or abiding essenceBy seeing thus detachment will grow bringing greater freedom from egoistic clinging and culminating in Nibbana minds final liberation from sufferingThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated

Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseVenerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya was one of the great personalities of Theravada Buddhism in the twentieth century and it is testimony to his vast store of past merits that his life span stretched clear across this century from its beginning almost to its endIn the course of his exemplary life this outstanding Mahathera has held some of the most prestigious academic and ecclesiastical posts in the countryYet such honor and fame hardly touched him inwardly at heart he always remained a simple monk whose greatest joy was quiet study and meditation at his small village temple near the town of BalangodaFor me it is a personal honor to be able to name VenAnanda Maitreya as my own ordination teacher the one who brought me into the Sangha and guided my first steps in the life of a bhikkhuThe background story to my meeting with the Mahanayaka Thera goes back to the yearAt that time I was living at a Vietnamese Buddhist meditation center in Los AngelesI had been ordained as a samanera in the Vietnamese Mahayana Order and was lecturing in world religions at a local universityOne day our center received notice that a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka would be arriving in Los AngelesWe invited him to stay with us and give a series of lectures on Theravada Buddhism at our centerThat Buddhist monk was none other than VenPiyadassi Nayaka Thera of VajiraramaI served as VenPiyadassis host during his stay drove him around town over Los Angeless forbidding maze of freeways and accompanied him to the airport when it was time for him to leaveWhen we parted VenPiyadassi suggested to me that some day I should come to Sri Lanka where he could arrange for me to stay at a Buddhist monasteryThe next year the decision had crystallized in my mind to go to Asia to take ordination as a Theravada Buddhist monkI wrote to VenPiyadassi to remind him of his invitation and he wrote back giving me the name of a senior prelate who he said had previously ordained WesternersThe name was that of VenBalangoda Ananda MaitreyaI wrote to the Mahanayaka Thera telling him of my background and of my desire to come to Sri Lanka to ordain as a bhikkhu and to study Pali and BuddhismThe Venerable promptly replied extending me a warm welcome and assuring me that he could oversee my ordination and my instruction in the DhammaIt was at the end of October that I at last arrived in Sri Lanka and a week later I made the trip out to BalangodaI was accompanied on this trip by the late VenBaddegama Vimalavamsa Nayaka Thera who had been my host in Colombo and by VenPimbure Sorata Nayaka Thera in whose vehicle we traveled to BalangodaThough both spoke highly of the excellent qualities of my prospective guru all along the way I felt somewhat apprehensive about my impending meeting with the Venerable OneAgain and again the doubts plagued my mind Would I make my prostrations in the correct mannerWould I fumble hopelessly for wordsWould I make some blunder that would immediately convince the Mahathera that I was unsuited for ordination as a monkWe arrived in Balangoda in the middle of the afternoon and headed for the Sri Dhammananda Pirivena where we were to meet VenAnanda MaitreyaAs we approached the room where he was awaiting us my mind was torn between a keen desire to see my chosen teacher and the anxious thoughts that played havoc with my good intentionsMy anxiety increased even to the point where I wanted to flee  back to the familiar smogdrenched roadways of Los Angeles which I had left a few months earlier  abandoning this noble quest for the Dhamma as a foolish figment of youthful idealismBut there was no turning back the two Nayaka Theras had already entered the room and now it was my turnAs soon as I crossed the threshold and set eyes on the VenAnanda Maitreya all my fears were dispelled like the morning mist before the rising sunIt was no stern cold ascetic glare that met my questioning eyes but a bright radiant kindness a natural simplicity and a twinkling immediacy of presence which instantly put me at easeAt once I felt delighted that my kamma and the good offices of VenPiyadassi had brought me into contact with such a luminous beingMy fears of bowing in the wrong way were also laid to restAs soon as I came up close to the Mahanayaka Thera to begin my bow he waved me towards a chair as though he thought he should not impose Asian monastic formalities on a visitor from urbane AmericaOf course I did not accept his invitation but made the customary triple prostration  with no fear at all that a pair of censorious eyes would be watching to see where I would trip upLater that afternoon after tea and light talk the two Nayaka Theras who had so kindly brought me out to Balangoda departed and the VenAnanda Maitreya a few novices a lay attendant and the American postulant piled into the quaint ancient Britishmade car that was to take us to Sri Nandaramaya the Mahanayaka Theras temple in Udumulla a village about km from Balangoda townA light rain had started to fall and after several stopovers along the way we entered the rough dirt road that led to UdumullaBy this time darkness was thickly descending and thus when we reached the temple I could barely see farther than the small area illuminated by the kerosene lantern I was givenOver the next few days I had the chance to explore the full extent of Sri NandaramayaEarlier while living in the US I had heard worrisome reports about the comfortable living standards that Sri Lankan prelates were inclined to stake out for themselvesThough VenPiyadassi had already warned me that I must be ready to rough it at Udumulla on my first morning there I had still been halfexpecting a monastic palace to emerge from the mistWell one quick walk around the Mahanayaka Theras temple was enough to pull the ground away from any bold generalizations about luxuryloving prelatesThe temple was in a sense an external reflection of the Mahanayaka Theras own character simple stripped to bare essentials without ostentation revealing an almost complete indifference even oblivion to the perks and privileges of high officeThe main part of the temple the pansala or monks residence was a simple wooden structure with tile roof mudandcowdung floor a plain verandah with a chipped wooden lattice facade and a few cells for the monksThese contained little more than beds book cases and wooden tables it was in one of these that VenAnanda Maitreya was living at the timeA primitive alms hall in the back could accommodate about ten monks none very comfortablyBehind the temple was a hill on which two kutis or cottages had recently been built and were still drying out one lower down on the hill was a wattleanddaub structure intended for myself the other higher up was made of concrete and was to be occupied by the Mahanayaka TheraOver the next few months I came to learn as a hard lesson that the diet at Sri Nandaramaya conformed to the same austere standards as the temples physical structuresNo gourmets delight hereBreakfast generally consisted of thin rice gruel with a few cream crackers and occasionally a couple of small bananasThe midday meal was usually country rice with a dhal curry and a single vegetable and a local confection for dessertOccasionally a piece of papaya provided a special treatFor a year before I came to Sri Lanka I had already been a vegetarian but the fare at Udumulla was still too spartan for my needsI soon enough learned how to go on alms round to the surrounding hamlets where I collected a variety of nutritious curries and could supply the monks in the temple with my surplusFor two and a half years I lived with VenAnanda Maitreya at Sri NandaramayaDuring this happy period I received regular instruction from him in Pali Suttanta and Abhidhamma fields in which his erudition was impeccableThe guidance he gave me so generously at that time has continued to benefit me right up to the presentIn this early stage of my monks life I faced considerable confusion trying to find the proper key to understand the Dhamma correctlyWestern interpreters of Buddhism are often prone to invent their own versions of the Buddhas teachings which they then hail as the sole valid interpretation of the DhammaWithout a reliable guide it is easy to get lost in the jungles of speculation and opinion littered with the landmines of pride contention and conceitDuring this period the Mahanayaka Thera always reminded me of the importance of relying on the Theravada commentarial tradition in order to understand the Pali Dhamma correctlyHe implanted in my mind a profound respect for the Atthakathas and Tikas the Commentaries and Subcommentaries an attitude which inspired and guided my study of the Suttas and the AbhidhammaAlthough I subsequently came to see the need to distinguish among the various strata in the evolution of Theravada Buddhist thought this early advice from my teacher helped to steer me away from fruitless interpretations often rooted in little more than the pride and cleverness of the expositorMy meetings with the Mahanayaka Thera in those days were not all devoted to religious instructionVenAnanda Maitreya was widely read had a rich store of experience and was an original thinker and writerThus every so often we would lay the books aside and he would dilate on his theories ranging from the origins of Christianity to the scientific basis for extrasensory perceptionDuring this period I also discovered one of the secrets to the Venerables health and vigour long walksAt this time he was already  years of age yet several times per month armed with a load of books we would make the km walk from his temple to the Balangoda pirivena and then after a short break at the pirivena would make another km walk back to the templeI myself was some fifty years his junior but even then I had to hasten to keep up with him on these walksWriters who have eulogized the Mahanayaka Thera after his death have often extolled his lofty titles his numerous writings and his extensive missionary work all over the worldA very different image of the Mahanayaka Thera remains fixed in my mind as a summation of his character and attitude towards lifeThe image stems from a scene I witnessed one afternoon about years agoWe were on our way back to Sri Nandaramaya from the pirivena and the Venerable decided to stop off at the Thumbagoda temple near the approach road to UdumullaHe often liked to stop off here on his way back to his own temple  to rest enjoy a cup of tea and chat with the incumbent monk a close friend of his for many yearsOn this particular afternoon the weather had been cool and rainy so the break was especially welcomeI sat out on the verandah sipping my tea while the Mahanayaka Thera and his friend spoke insideAbout an hour later they still had not emergedDarkness was starting to set in and the rain clouds were rumbling so I thought I should remind the Venerable of the timeI did not find the Mahanayaka in the main part of the temple though the incumbent monk was milling about there so I went all the way back into the kitchenThere I found him sitting on a small stool next to the fireplace chatting amiably with the temple servant who was sitting on a mat on the groundI could not help being struck by the utter simplicity the lack of any sense of selfimportance the utterly unpretentious kindness of this man  the highest ranking prelate in the Amarapura Nikaya the most learned scholarmonk on the island yet never thinking for a moment he was too good or too high to sit almost on the same level with a simple kitchen hand extending to him the same gracious friendliness that he extended to everyone else who sought his guidance and helpIn recent years I did not have frequent personal contact with VenAnanda MaitreyaHe had spent long periods abroad and when he was in Sri Lanka he was residing at Balangoda while I have been in Kandy looking after the late VenNyanaponika Mahathera and supervising the publications programme of the Buddhist Publication SocietyBut from the reports of newspapers and friends and from my own occasional meetings with him I often heard of the Venerables successful missions abroadI was especially glad to know that he had become a virtual Sangha father to the Western Bhikkhu Sangha based at the Amaravati and Chithurst monasteries in BritainI was fortunate to have three delightful meetings with the Mahanayaka Thera in the past three yearsDuring the Vassa of which he spent at Giriulla about halfway between Kandy and Colombo I went out with a friend to visit himI was both amused and impressed to see how assiduously he had taken to the computer a skill he had learned at the ripe age of and in which he had become quite adeptIt was altogether in character for him not to think he was too old to learn something new and to achieve an effortless mastery over it in minimal timeWe even exchanged views on the relative merits of different software programmes and computersAt this meeting he told us he had a strong intuition that he would live to the age ofSo sure was I that his intuition was correct that when I heard he was seriously ill in Colombo this past July I had no doubt that he would recoverA second meeting took place almost exactly a year before his deathWith a group of friends I had gone to Colombo on VenPiyadassis rd birthday to share a birthday dana with himI had earlier heard that VenAnanda Maitreya was staying at his temple at Maharagama and I wanted to visit him tooI had a special reason for this visitAbout a month earlier a group of Buddhists from Malaysia had called on me and presented me with a twovolume work they had published for free distribution The Great Chronicle of Buddhas by the VenMingun Sayadaw of MyanmarThe work describes in detail the spiritual path of the bodhisattva and since I knew VenAnanda Maitreya followed this ideal the thought occurred to me to present him with this pair of booksFortunately we were able to meet him and I could offer him the books which he started perusing even before we concluded our meetingJust a few months earlier he had received Myanmars highest ecclesiastical honor the title of Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru and he told us about his trip to that country to receive the honorWhen we left his room we found to our astonishment a line of about thirty people waiting to see himIt seemed to us his room was like a doctors office but these people waiting so patiently were seeking medicine for the spirit not for the bodyMy third meeting with the Mahanayaka Thera took place only a month before his deathOn a trip down to Colombo this time to visit an ailing VenPiyadassi I had heard that VenAnanda Maitreya was also in the hospital warded on account of a buildup of phlegm in the lungs that had developed during a trip to Taiwan and Thailand that he made in MayTogether with a few friends I went to the hospital to see himOn our arrival there we were told that the Venerable had been discharged that same morning and was now at his temple in MaharagamaWe set out for the temple at once and found him in apparent good health though still complaining of a little phlegm trouble He told us about his trip and gave us an illuminating explanation of his approach to insight meditationWe expected him to be returning to Balangoda before the rains retreat and I was hoping to go out to Balangoda after the rainy season to spend a longer period with him at his templeHe seemed so fit so clearminded so full of vitality that we never doubted he would live on for at least a few more yearsYet that little phlegm trouble was to become the agent that only one month later would snatch him from our midst leaving us with only the pain of loss and the consolation of pleasant memoriesAs I drove out to Balangoda with some friends to attend the Venerables cremation when our southbound road linked up with the crosscountry road leading to Balangoda I had a surprise that brought a knot to my throat and tears of joy to my eyesAll along the road for about km from Avissawela onwards every town was decked out in yellow and orange banners inscribed with words of homage to the Mahanayaka TheraAlmost every house and shop flew a yellow flag or strips of yellow clothBalangoda itself was ablaze with yellow and orange banners some with pictures of VenAnanda Maitreya most with inscriptionsWhen I saw this and when I saw the long lines of people that turned out to pay final respects to the body and the huge crowd that attended the cremation I realized how powerful an impact this simple monk had made on the people of this nation on people of all communities ethnic groups and religions whom he always regarded without the least discriminationThough gross materialism has made its inroads here with alarming force though a futile ethnic conflict has raged on for over fifteen years though crime and social problems escalate daily the massive public expression of solidarity with this humble monk showed where peoples sympathies and affections really lie  when they are given the right exampleMay the great Mahathera the light of Sri Lankas Sangha in the second half of the twentieth century quickly attain the highest goal and shed the radiance of his wisdom and compassion over the entire worldThe Most Venerable Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru Agga

expected to participate in the funeral on ThursdayVenAnanda Maitreya was born in Kirindigala Balangoda on August and entered the Bhikkhu Sangha at the age ofHe held the post of Vice Chancellor of Vidyodaya University and was appointed as the first President of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Mahasangha Sabha inIn recognition of his laudable service at the Chattha Sangayana the Great Council held in Myanmar in Myanmar conferred on him the title Agga MahapanditaLast year Myanmar conferred on him the highest Sangha title Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru which is equivalent to Sangharaja in honor of his unique service to the SasanaVenAnanda Maitreya visited Yangon to receive the ecclesiastical title in March last yearA disciplined Buddhaputra he was well versed in the doctrine and disciplineHe has written nearly books on Sutra Vinaya and Abhidhamma and on Pali and Sanskrit grammarHis book Sakyasimhavadanaya hevat Buddha Carita is considered a textbook on the subjectThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe word love  one of the most compelling in the English language  is commonly used for purposes so widely separated so gross and so rarefied as to render it sometimes nearly meaninglessYet rightly understood love is the indispensable and essential foundation no less for the growth and purification of the individual as for the construction of a peaceful progressive and healthy societyNow love can be considered in two principal moods that of lovers for each other and that of a mother for her childIn its spiritualised form love can draw its inspiration from either the one or the otherSpiritual love idealizing the love of lovers is often conceived as a consuming flame and then it sometimes aspires to purification through torture and the violence of martyrdomBut spiritual love that looks for guidance to the love of a mother for her child uplifts itself to the ideal of the pure fount of all safety welfare and spiritual healthIt is this latter kind which the Buddha takes as the basis for his teaching of universal loveWhere Greek distinguishes between sensual eros and spiritual agape English makes do with only the one word love But the Pali language like the Sanskrit has many words covering many shades of meaningThe word chosen by the Buddha for this teaching is metta from mitta a friendMetta in the Buddhas teaching finds its place as the first of four kinds of contemplation designed to develop a sound pacific relationship to other living beingsThe four are metta which will be rendered henceforward by lovingkindness karuna which is compassion or pity mudita which is gladness at others success and upekkha which is onlooking equanimity These four are called Divine Abidings perhaps because whoever can maintain any one of them in being for even a moment has lived for that moment as do the Highest GodsIn the Buddhas teaching these four Divine Abidings the greatest of all worldly merit if practiced alone without insight into the true nature of existence can lead to rebirth in the highest heavensBut all heavenly existence is without exception impermanent and at the end of the heavenly lifespan  no matter how long it may last  the being dies and is reborn according to his past actionsThis is because some craving for existence and some sort of view of existence that is not in conformity with truth still remain latent in him to burst out again when the result of the good actions is spentAnd where he will be reborn after that is unpredictable though it is certain that he will be rebornThe Buddhas teaching of Insight is  in as few words as possible  the training in knowledge and seeing of how it is that anything whatever it may be whether objective or subjective comes to be how it acquires existence only through dependence on conditions and is impermanent because none of the conditions for its existence is permanent and how existence always complex and impermanent is never safe from pain and is in need of a self  the willothewisp idea the rainbow mirage which lures it on and which it can never find for the comforting illusion has constantly to be renewedAnd that teaching also shows how there is a true way out from fear of painIn its concise form this is expressed as the Four Noble Truths the truth of suffering the truth of sufferings origin the truth of sufferings cessation and the truth of the way leading to sufferings cessationThese four truths are called the teaching peculiar to Buddhas since the discovery of them is what distinguishes BuddhasThe way is also called the Middle Way because it avoids the two extremes of sensual indulgence and of selfmortificationIts eight members are right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThe practice of lovingkindness alone will give effect in some measure to all the members except the first but it is only with right view that Nibbana can be reachedRight View gives insight into the real nature of existence of being and nonbeing with all its mirages and deceptions and it is only with its help that the practice of lovingkindness is perfected lifted out of the impermanence of even the highest heavens and directed to the true cessation of sufferingThat true cessation comes with the elimination of deception by wrong views and with the exhaustion of the stream of craving in its two forms of lust and hateThis extinction of lust hate and delusion is called NibbanaThe discourses that follow show the wretchedness of all anger and hate the rewards of lovingkindness the practice of lovingkindness as a meditation and contemplation its result in rebirth the seeing of all things and all existence as impermanent suffering and notself that is needed in order to have a vision in conformity with truth without which the first stage of unshakable deliverance cannot be reached and lastly the attainment of arahantship by which all lust hate and delusion are overcome lust for being and even for nonbeing cured and rebirth ended for goodBut first before coming to these discourses some details from the meditation manual the Visuddhimagga or Path of Purification will not be out of placeMetta is defined as follows Lovingkindness has the mode of friendliness for its characteristicIts natural function is to promote friendlinessIt is manifested as the disappearance of illwillIts footing is seeing with kindnessWhen it succeeds it eliminates illwillWhen it fails it degenerates into selfish affectionate desireThe Visuddhimagga recommends going to some quiet place where one can sit down in a comfortable positionThen before starting the actual meditation it is helpful to consider the dangers in hate and the benefits offered by forbearance for it is a purpose of this meditation to displace hate by forbearance and besides one cannot avoid dangers one has not come to see or cultivate benefits one does not yet knowThen there are certain types of persons towards whom lovingkindness should not be developed in the first stagesThe attempt at the outset to regard a disliked person as dear to one is fatiguing and likewise trying to regard a dearly loved friend with neutrality and when an enemy is recalled anger springs upAgain it should not be directed towards members of the opposite sex to begin with for this may arouse lustRight at the start the meditation of lovingkindness should be developed towards oneself repeatedly in this way May I be happy and free from suffering or May I keep myself free from hostility and trouble and live happilyIt is by cultivating the thought May I be happy with oneself as example that one begins to be interested in the welfare and happiness of other living beings and to feel in some sense their happiness as if it were ones own Just as I want happiness and fear pain just as I want to live and not to die so do other beings So one should first become familiar with pervading oneself as example with lovingkindnessOnly then should one choose someone who is liked and admired and much respectedThe meditation can then be developed towards him remembering endearing words or virtues of his and thinking such thoughts about him as may he be happy When this has become familiar one can begin to practice lovingkindness towards a dearly beloved companion and then towards a neutral person as very dear or towards an enemy as neutralIt is when dealing with an enemy that anger can arise and all means must be tried in order to get rid of itAs soon as this has succeeded one will be able to regard an enemy without resentment and with lovingkindness in the same way as one does the admired person the dearly loved friend and the neutral personThen with repeated practice jhana absorption should be attained in all casesLovingkindness can now be effectively maintained in being towards all beings or to certain groups of beings at a time or in one direction at a time to all or to certain groups in successionLovingkindness ought to be brought to the point where there are no longer any barriers set between persons and for this the following example is given Suppose a man is with a dear a neutral and a hostile person himself being the fourth then bandits come to him and say we need one of you for human sacrifice Now if that man thinks Let then take this one or that one he has not yet broken down the barriers and also if he thinks Let them take me but not these three he has not broken down the barriers eitherWhy notBecause he seeks the harm of him who he wishes to be taken and the welfare of only the other threeIt is only when he does not see a single one among the four to be chosen in preference to the other three and directs his mind quite impartially towards himself and the other three that he has broken down the barriersLovingkindness has its enemy within in lust which easily gains entry in its wake and it must be well guarded against thisThe remedy for lust is the contemplation of ugliness as in the Satipattana SuttaIts enemy without is its opposite illwill which finds its opportunities in the intervals when lovingkindness is not being actively practicedIn many discourses the Buddha lays emphasis on the need to balance contemplative concentration with understandingThe one supplies the deficiencies of the otherConcentration alone lacks direction understanding alone is dry and tiringIn the discourses that follow the simile of a mothers love for her child is givenNow the incomparable value of a mothers love which sets it above all other kinds lies in the fact that she understands her childs welfare  her love is not blindNot love alone nor faith alone can ever bring a man all the way to the cessation of suffering and that is why the Buddha as the Supreme Physician prescribes the development of five faculties in balanced harmony the faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and understandingSo concentration of love in its highest form  the form that only the Buddha and no one else has given  seen as a means to the end becomes absolutely purified in one who has gained personal experience of the supreme safety from bondage which is Nibbana as the ultimate welfare of beingsFor he knows from his own experience that their welfare is only assured permanently when suffering has been diagnosed its origin abandoned its cessation realized and the way maintained in beingThen he has verified the Four Noble Truths for himself and can properly evaluate beings welfareBhikkhus it is through not discovering not penetrating to four truths that both you and I have been trudging and traveling through the roundabout of rebirths for so longFor the benefit of all those who have not yet done this the way has been discovered and pointed out by the Buddha and its practicability attested by the arahantsThe last discourse given in this collection in fact shows how this personal discovery and penetration to the Four Noble Truths can be achieved by using lovingkindness as the vehicleReferences to the Anguttara Nikaya are to nipata followed by the number of the suttaThe reference to Samyutta Nikaya is to samyutta followed by the number of the suttaBhikkhus seven things gratifying and helpful to an enemy befall one who is angry whether a woman or a manWhat are the sevenHere bhikkhus an enemy wishes thus for his enemy Let him be ugly Why is thatNo enemy relishes an enemys beautyNow when this person is angry a prey to anger ruled by anger be he ever so well bathed and well anointed with hair and beard trimmed and

arises in himWhat are the fiveLovingkindness can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed this is how annoyance with him can be removedCompassion can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed this too is how annoyance with him can be removedOnlooking equanimity can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed this too is how annoyance with him can be removedThe forgetting and ignoring of a person with whom you are annoyed can be practiced this too is how annoyance with him can be removedOwnership of deeds in a person with whom you are annoyed can be concentrated upon thus This good person is owner of his deeds heir to his deeds his deeds are the womb from which he is born his deeds are his kin for whom he is responsible his deeds are his refuge he is heir to his deeds be they good or bad This too is how annoyance with him can be removedThese are the five ways of removing annoyance by which annoyance can be entirely removed in a bhikkhu when it arises in himBhikkhus there are five modes of speech that others may use when they address youTheir speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh for good or harm and may be accompanied by thoughts of lovingkindness or by inner hateSuppose a man came with a hoe and a basket and he said I shall make this great earth to be without earth and he dug here and there and strewed here and there and spat here and there and relieved himself here and there saying Be without earth be without earth What do you think bhikkhus would that man make this great earth to be without earth No venerable sirWhy is thatBecause this great earth is deep and measureless it cannot possibly be made to be without earthSo the man would reap weariness and disappointmentSuppose a man came with lak or gamboge or indigo or carmine and he said I shall draw pictures I shall make pictures appear on this empty space What do you think bhikkhus would that man draw pictures would he make pictures appear on that empty space No venerable sirWhy is thatBecause that empty space is formless and invisible he cannot possibly draw pictures make pictures appear thereSo the man would reap weariness and disappointmentSo too bhikkhus there are these five modes of speech that others may use when they address youTheir speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh for good or for harm and may be accompanied by thoughts of lovingkindness or by inner hateNow this is how you should train yourselves here Our minds will remain unaffected we shall utter no bad words we shall abide friendly and compassionate with thoughts of lovingkindness and no inner hateWe shall abide with lovingkindness in our hearts extending to that person and we shall dwell extending it to the entire world as our object with our hearts abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill That is how you should train yourselvesEven were bandits savagely to sever you limb from limb with a twohandled saw he who entertaineth hate on that account in his heart would not be one who carried out my teachingBhikkhus you should keep this instruction on the Simile of the Saw constantly in mindBhikkhus whatever kinds of worldly merit there are all are not worth one sixteenth part of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness in shining and beaming and radiance the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness far excels themJust as whatever light there is of stars all is not worth one sixteenth part of the moons in shining and beaming and radiance the moons light far excels it and just as in the last month of the Rains in the Autumn when the heavens are clear the sun as it climbs the heavens drives all darkness from the sky with its shining and beaming and radiance and just as when night is turning to dawn the morning star is shining and beaming and radiating so too whatever kinds of worldly merit there are all are not worth one sixteenth part of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness in shining and beaming and radiance the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness far excels themBhikkhus when the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being made much of used as ones vehicle used as ones foundation established consolidated and properly managed then eleven blessings can be expectedWhat are the elevenA man sleeps in comfort he wakes in comfort he dreams no evil dreams he is dear to human beings he is dear to nonhuman beings the gods guard him no fire or poison or weapon harms him his mind can be quickly concentrated the expression of his face is serene he dies without falling into confusion and even if he fails to penetrate any further he will pass on to the world of High Divinity to the Brahma worldBhikkhus just as clans with many women and few men are readily ruined by robbers and bandits so too any bhikkhu who has not maintained in being and made much of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is readily ruined by nonhuman beingsAnd just as clans with few women and many men are not readily ruined by robbers and bandits so too any bhikkhu who maintains in being and makes much of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is not readily ruined by nonhuman beingsSo bhikkhus you should train in this way The heartdeliverance of lovingkindness will be maintained in being and made much of by us used as our vehicle used as our foundation established consolidated and properly managedThat is how you should trainBhikkhus if a bhikkhu cultivates lovingkindness for as long as a fingersnap he is called a bhikkhuHe is not destitute of jhana meditation he carries out the Masters teaching he responds to advice and he does not eat the countrys alms food in vainSo what should be said of those who make much of itHere friends a bhikkhu might say When the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being and made much of by me used as my vehicle used as my foundation established consolidated and properly managed illwill nevertheless still invades my heart and remains He should be told Not soLet the worthy one not say soLet him not misrepresent the Blessed OneIt is not good to misrepresent the Blessed OneThe Blessed One would not express it thus Friends it is impossible it cannot happen that when the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being and made much of used as ones vehicle used as ones foundation established consolidated and properly managed illwill can invade the heart and remain for this that is to say the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is the escape from illwillThe heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified extension with specified extension and with directional extensionThat with unspecified extension is practiced in five ways as follows May all beings be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to blissMay all breathing things all creatures all persons May all those who are embodied be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to blissThat with specified extension is practiced in seven ways as follows May all women be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to blissMay all men all Noble Ones all who are not Noble Ones all deities all human beings may all those in the states of deprivation be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to blissThat with directional extension is practiced in ten ways as followsMay all beings in the eastern direction be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to blissMay all beings in the western direction in the northern direction in the southern direction in the eastern intermediate direction in the western intermediate direction in the northern intermediate direction in the southern intermediate direction in the downward direction May all those in the upward direction be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to blissMay all breathing thingsMay all creaturesMay all personsMay all who are embodiedMay all womenMay all menMay all Noble OnesMay all who are not Noble OnesMay all deitiesMay all human beingsMay all those in the states of deprivation in the eastern direction be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss May all those in states of deprivation in the upward direction be freed from enmity distress anxiety and may they guide themselves to blissAnd how does a bhikkhu abide with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one directionJust as he would feel friendliness on seeing a dearly beloved person so he extends lovingkindness to all creaturesMaster Gotama I have heard it said that the Monk Gotama teaches the path to the retinue of the High DivinityIt would be good if Master Gotama would teach me thatThen listen and attend carefully to what I shall sayEven so sir the student Subha Todeyyaputta repliedThe Blessed One said thisAnd what is the path to the retinue of the High DivinityHere a bhikkhu abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing worldWhile this heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being in this way no action restricted by limited measurement is found there none persists thereJust as a vigorous trumpeter could easily make himself heard in the four directions so too when the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being in this way no action restricted by limited measurement is found there none persists thereThis is a path to the retinue of the High DivinityHere bhikkhus a certain person abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing worldHe finds gratification in that finds it desirable and looks to it for his wellbeing steady and resolute thereon he abides much in it and if he dies without losing it he reappears among the gods of a High Divinitys retinueNow the gods of a High Divinitys retinue have a lifespan of one aeonAn ordinary person stays there for his lifespan but after he has used up the whole lifespan enjoyed by those gods he leaves it all and he may go down even to hell or to an animal womb or to the ghost realmBut one who has given ear to the Perfect One stays there for his lifespan and after he has used up the whole lifespan enjoyed by those gods he eventually attains complete extinction of lust hate and delusion in that same kind of heavenly existenceIt is this that distinguishes that differentiates the wise hearer who is ennobled from the unwise ordinary man when that is to say there is a destination for reappearanceHere bhikkhus a certain person abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over the allencompassing worldNow whatever therein exists classifiable as form classifiable as a feeling classifiable as perception classifiable as determinative acts or classifiable as consciousness such ideas he sees as impermanent as liable to suffering as a disease as a cancer as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as alien as being worn away as void as notselfOn the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the retinue of the Gods of the Pure AbodesAnd this kind of reappearance is not shared by ordinary menThus I heardOn one occasion the venerable Nandaka was living at Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery Migaras Mothers PalaceThen Migaras grandson Salha and Pekhuniyas grandson Rohana went to the venerable Nandaka and after salutation they sat down at one sideWhen they had done so the venerable Nandaka said to Migaras grandson SalhaCome Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with tradition or with legendary lore or with what has come down in scriptures or with conjecture or with logical inference or with weighing evidence or with a liking for a view after pondering it or with someone elses ability or with the thought The monk is our teacher When you know in yourself These things are unprofitable liable to censure condemned by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to harm and suffering then you should abandon themWhat do you thinkIs there greed  Yes

undeluded abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing worldHe abides with his heart imbued with compassion gladness equanimity extending over the allencompassing worldNow he understands this state of contemplation in this way There is thisThere is what has been abandonedThere is a superior goalAnd there is an ultimate escape from this whole field of perceptionWhen he knows and sees in this way his heart is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignoranceWhen liberated there comes thereafter the knowledge that it is liberatedHe knows that birth is ended that the Divine Life has been lived out that what had to be done is done and that there is no more of this to comeHe understands thus Formerly there was greed which was bad and now there is none which is goodFormerly there was hate which was bad and now there is none which is goodFormerly there was delusion which was bad and now there is none which is good So here and now in this very life he is parched no more extinguished and cooled out experiencing bliss he abides divinely pure in himselfThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseFour sublime states of mind have been taught by the BuddhaIn Pali the language of the Buddhist scriptures these four are known under the name of BrahmaviharaThis term may be rendered by excellent lofty or sublime states of mind or alternatively by Brahmalike godlike or divine abodesThese four attitudes are said to be excellent or sublime because they are the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beingsThey provide in fact the answer to all situations arising from social contactThey are the great removers of tension the great peacemakers in social conflict and the great healers of wounds suffered in the struggle of existenceThey level social barriers build harmonious communities awaken slumbering magnanimity long forgotten revive joy and hope long abandoned and promote human brotherhood against the forces of egotismThe Brahmaviharas are incompatible with a hating state of mind and in that they are akin to Brahma the divine but transient ruler of the higher heavens in the traditional Buddhist picture of the universeIn contrast to many other conceptions of deities East and West who by their own devotees are said to show anger wrath jealousy and righteous indignation Brahma is free from hate and one who assiduously develops these four sublime states by conduct and meditation is said to become an equal of BrahmaIf they become the dominant influence in his mind he will be reborn in congenial worlds the realms of BrahmaTherefore these states of mind are called Godlike BrahmalikeThey are called abodes because they should become the minds constant dwellingplaces where we feel at home they should not remain merely places of rare and short visits soon forgottenIn other words our minds should become thoroughly saturated by themThey should become our inseparable companions and we should be mindful of them in all our common activitiesAs the Metta Sutta the Song of Lovingkindness saysThese four  love compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity  are also known as the boundless states because in their perfection and their true nature they should not be narrowed by any limitation as to the range of beings towards whom they are extendedThey should be nonexclusive and impartial not bound by selective preferences or prejudicesA mind that has attained to that boundlessness of the Brahmaviharas will not harbor any national racial religious or class hatredBut unless rooted in a strong natural affinity with such a mental attitude it will certainly not be easy for us to effect that boundless application by a deliberate effort of will and to avoid consistently any kind or degree of partialityTo achieve that in most cases we shall have to use these four qualities not only as principles of conduct and objects of reflection but also as subjects of methodical meditationThat meditation is called Brahmaviharabhavana the meditative development of the sublime statesThe practical aim is to achieve with the help of these sublime states those high stages of mental concentration called jhana meditative absorption The meditations on love compassion and sympathetic joy may each produce the attainment of the first three absorptions while the meditation on equanimity will lead to the fourth jhana only in which equanimity is the most significant factorGenerally speaking persistent meditative practice will have two crowning effects first it will make these four qualities sink deep into the heart so that they become spontaneous attitudes not easily overthrown second it will bring out and secure their boundless extension the unfolding of their allembracing rangeIn fact the detailed instructions given in the Buddhist scriptures for the practice of these four meditations are clearly intended to unfold gradually the boundlessness of the sublime statesThey systematically break down all barriers restricting their application to particular individuals or placesIn the meditative exercises the selection of people to whom the thought of love compassion or sympathetic joy is directed proceeds from the easier to the more difficultFor instance when meditating on lovingkindness one starts with an aspiration for ones own wellbeing using it as a point of reference for gradual extension Just as I wish to be happy and free from suffering so may that being may all beings be happy and free from suffering Then one extends the thought of lovingkindness to a person for whom one has a loving respect as for instance a teacher then to dearly beloved people to indifferent ones and finally to enemies if any or those dislikedSince this meditation is concerned with the welfare of the living one should not choose people who have died one should also avoid choosing people towards whom one may have feelings of sexual attractionAfter one has been able to cope with the hardest task to direct ones thoughts of lovingkindness to disagreeable people one should now break down the barriers Without making any discrimination between those four types of people one should extend ones lovingkindness to them equallyAt that point of the practice one will have come to the higher stages of concentration with the appearance of the mental refleximage access concentration will have been reached and further progress will lead to the full concentration of the first jhana then the higher jhanasFor spatial expansion the practice starts with those in ones immediate environment such as ones family then extends to the neighboring houses to the whole street the town country other countries and the entire worldIn pervasion of the directions ones thought of lovingkindness is directed first to the east then to the west north south the intermediate directions the zenith and nadirThe same principles of practice apply to the meditative development of compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity with due variations in the selection of peopleDetails of the practice will be found in the textsThe ultimate aim of attaining these Brahmaviharajhanas is to produce a state of mind that can serve as a firm basis for the liberating insight into the true nature of all phenomena as being impermanent liable to suffering and unsubstantialA mind that has achieved meditative absorption induced by the sublime states will be pure tranquil firm collected and free of coarse selfishnessIt will thus be well prepared for the final work of deliverance which can be completed only by insightThe preceding remarks show that there are two ways of developing the sublime states first by practical conduct and an appropriate direction of thought and second by methodical meditation aiming at the absorptionsEach will prove helpful to the otherMethodical meditative practice will help love compassion joy and equanimity to become spontaneousIt will help make the mind firmer and calmer in withstanding the numerous irritations in life that challenge us to maintain these four qualities in thoughts words and deedsOn the other hand if ones practical conduct is increasingly governed by these sublime states the mind will harbor less resentment tension and irritability the reverberations of which often subtly intrude into the hours of meditation forming there the hindrance of restlessness Our everyday life and thought has a strong influence on the meditative mind only if the gap between them is persistently narrowed will there be a chance for steady meditative progress and for achieving the highest aim of our practiceMeditative development of the sublime states will be aided by repeated reflection upon their qualities the benefits they bestow and the dangers from their oppositesAs the Buddha says What a person considers and reflects upon for a long time to that his mind will bend and inclineHere monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with lovingkindness likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with lovingkindness abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distressHere monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with compassion likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with compassion abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distressHere monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with sympathetic joy likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with sympathetic joy abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distressHere monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with equanimity likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with equanimity abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distress Digha Nikaya Love without desire to possess knowing well that in the ultimate sense there is no possession and no possessor this is the highest loveLove without speaking and thinking of I knowing well that this socalled I is a mere delusionLove without selecting and excluding knowing well that to do so means to create loves own contrasts dislike aversion and hatredLove embracing all beings small and great far and near be it on earth in the water or in the airLove embracing impartially all sentient beings and not only those who are useful pleasing or amusing to usLove embracing all beings be they nobleminded or lowminded good or evilThe noble and the good are embraced because love is flowing to them spontaneouslyThe lowminded and evilminded are included because they are those who are most in need of loveIn many of them the seed of goodness may have died merely because warmth was lacking for its growth because it perished from cold in a loveless worldLove embracing all beings knowing well that we all are fellow wayfarers through this round of existence  that we all are overcome by the same law of sufferingLove but not the sensuous fire that burns scorches and tortures that inflicts more wounds than it cures  flaring up now at the next moment being extinguished leaving behind more coldness and loneliness than was felt beforeRather love that lies like a soft but firm hand on the ailing beings ever unchanged in its sympathy without wavering unconcerned with any response it meetsLove that is comforting coolness to those who burn with the fire of suffering and passion that is lifegiving warmth to those abandoned in the cold desert of loneliness to those who are shivering in the frost of a loveless world to those whose hearts have become as if empty and dry by the repeated calls for help by deepest despairLove that is a sublime nobility of heart and intellect which knows understands and is ready to helpLove that is strength and gives strength this is the highest loveLove which by the Enlightened One was named the liberation of the heart the most sublime beauty this is the highest loveAnd what is the highest manifestation of loveTo show to the world the path leading to the end of suffering the path pointed out trodden and realized to perfection by Him the Exalted One the BuddhaThe world suffersBut most men have their eyes and ears closedThey do not see the unbroken stream of tears flowing through life they do not hear the cry of distress continually pervading the worldTheir own little grief or joy bars their sight deafens their earsBound by selfishness their hearts turn stiff and narrowBeing stiff and narrow how should they be able to strive for any higher goal to realize that only release from selfish craving will effect their own freedom from sufferingIt is compassion that removes the heavy bar opens the door to freedom makes the narrow heart as wide as the worldCompassion takes away from the heart the inert weight the paralyzing heaviness it gives wings to those who cling to the lowlands of selfThrough compassion the fact of suffering remains vividly present to our mind even at times when we personally are free from itIt gives us the rich experience of suffering thus strengthening us to meet it prepared when it does befall usCompassion reconciles us to our own destiny by showing us the life of others often much harder than oursBehold the endless caravan of beings men and beasts burdened with sorrow and painThe burden of every one of them we also have carried in bygone times during the unfathomable sequence of repeated birthsBehold this and open your heart to compassionAnd this misery may well be our own destiny againHe who is without compassion now will one day cry for itIf sympathy with others is lacking it will have to be acquired through ones own long and painful experienceThis is the great law of lifeKnowing this keep guard over yourselfBeings sunk in ignorance lost in delusion hasten from one state of suffering to another not knowing the real cause not knowing the escape from itThis insight into the general law of suffering is the real foundation of our compassion not any isolated fact of sufferingHence our compassion will also include those who at the moment may be happy but act with an evil and deluded mindIn their present deeds we shall foresee their future state of distress and compassion will ariseThe compassion of the wise man does not render him a victim of sufferingHis thoughts words and deeds are full of pityBut his heart does not waver unchanged it remains serene and calmHow else should he be able to helpMay such compassion arise in our heartsCompassion that is sublime nobility of heart and intellect which knows understands and is ready to helpCompassion that is strength and gives strength this is highest compassionAnd what is the highest manifestation of compassionTo show to the world the path leading to the end of suffering the path pointed out trodden and realized to perfection by Him the Exalted One the BuddhaNot only to compassion but also to joy with others open your heartSmall indeed is the share of happiness and joy allotted to beingsWhenever a little happiness comes to them then you may rejoice that at least one ray of joy has pierced through the darkness of their lives and dispelled the gray and gloomy mist that enwraps their heartsYour life will gain in joy by sharing the happiness of others as if it were yoursDid you never observe how in moments of happiness mens features change and become bright with joyDid you never notice how joy rouses men to noble aspirations and deeds exceeding their normal capacityDid not such experience fill your own heart with joyful blissIt is in your power to increase such experience of sympathetic joy by producing happiness in others by bringing them joy and solaceLet us teach real joy to menMany have unlearned itLife though full of woe holds also sources of happiness and joy unknown to mostLet us teach people to seek and to find real joy within themselves and to rejoice with the joy of othersLet us teach them to unfold their joy to ever sublimer heightsNoble and sublime joy is not foreign to the Teaching of the Enlightened OneWrongly the Buddhas Teaching is sometimes considered to be a doctrine diffusing melancholyFar from it the Dhamma leads step by step to an ever purer and loftier happinessNoble and sublime joy is a helper on the path to the extinction of sufferingNot he who is depressed by grief but one possessed of joy finds that serene calmness leading to a contemplative state of mindAnd only a mind serene and collected is able to gain the liberating wisdomThe more sublime and noble the joy of others is the more justified will be our own sympathetic joyA cause for our joy with others is their noble life securing them happiness here and in lives hereafterA still nobler cause for our joy with others is their faith in the Dhamma their understanding of the Dhamma their following the DhammaLet us give them the help of the DhammaLet us strive to become more and more able ourselves to render such helpSympathetic joy means a sublime nobility of heart and intellect which knows understands and is ready to helpSympathetic joy that is strength and gives strength this is the highest joyAnd what is the highest manifestation of sympathetic joyTo show to the world the path leading to the end of suffering the path pointed out trodden and realized to perfection by Him the Exalted One the BuddhaEquanimity is a perfect unshakable balance of mind rooted in insightLooking at the world around us and looking into our own heart we see clearly how difficult it is to attain and maintain balance of mindLooking into life we notice how it continually moves between contrasts rise and fall success and failure loss and gain honor and blameWe feel how our heart responds to all this with happiness and sorrow delight and despair disappointment and satisfaction hope and fearThese waves of emotion carry us up and fling us down and no sooner do we find rest than we are in the power of a new wave againHow can we expect to get a footing on the crest of the wavesHow can we erect the building of our lives in the midst of this ever restless ocean of existence if not on the Island of EquanimityA world where that little share of happiness allotted to beings is mostly secured after many disappointments failures and defeatsa world where only the courage to start anew again and again promises successa world where scanty joy grows amidst sickness separation and deatha world where beings who were a short while ago connected with us by sympathetic joy are at the next moment in want of our compassion  such a world needs equanimityBut the kind of equanimity required has to be based on vigilant presence of mind not on indifferent dullnessIt has to be the result of hard deliberate training not the casual outcome of a passing moodBut equanimity would not deserve its name if it had to be produced by exertion again and againIn such a case it would surely be weakened and finally defeated by the vicissitudes of lifeTrue equanimity however should be able to meet all these severe tests and to regenerate its strength from sources withinIt will possess this power of resistance and selfrenewal only if it is rooted in insightWhat now is the nature of that insightIt is the clear understanding of how all these vicissitudes of life originate and of our own true natureWe have to understand that the various experiences we undergo result from our kamma  our actions in thought word and deed  performed in this life and in earlier livesKamma is the womb from which we spring and whether we like it or not we are the inalienable owners of our deedsBut as soon as we have performed any action our control over it is lost it forever remains with us and inevitably returns to us as our due heritageNothing that happens to us comes from an outer hostile world foreign to ourselves everything is the outcome of our own mind and deedsBecause this knowledge frees us from fear it is the first basis of equanimityWhen in everything that befalls us we only meet ourselves why should we fearIf however fear or uncertainty should arise we know the refuge where it can be allayed our good deedsBy taking this refuge confidence and courage will grow within us  confidence in the protecting power of our good deeds done in the past courage to perform more good deeds right now despite the discouraging hardships of our present lifeFor we know that noble and selfless deeds provide the best defense against the hard blows of destiny that it is never too late but always the right time for good actionsIf that refuge in doing good and avoiding evil becomes firmly established within us one day we shall feel assured More and more ceases the misery and evil rooted in the pastAnd this present life  I try to make it spotless and pureWhat else can the future bring than increase of the good And from that certainty our minds will become serene and we shall gain the strength of patience and equanimity to bear with all our present adversitiesThen our deeds will be our friendsLikewise all the various events of our lives being the result of our deeds will also be our friends even if they bring us sorrow and painOur deeds return to us in a guise that often makes them unrecognizableSometimes our actions return to us in the way that others treat us sometimes as a thorough upheaval in our lives often the results are against our expectations or contrary to our willsSuch experiences point out to us consequences of our deeds we did not foresee they render visible halfconscious motives of our former actions which we tried to hide even from ourselves covering them up with various pretextsIf we learn to see things from this angle and to read the message conveyed by our own experience then suffering too will be our friendIt will be a stern friend but a truthful and wellmeaning one who teaches us the most difficult subject knowledge about ourselves and warns us against abysses towards which we are moving blindlyBy looking at suffering as our teacher and friend we shall better succeed in enduring it with equanimityConsequently the teaching of kamma will give us a powerful impulse for freeing ourselves from kamma from those deeds which again and again throw us into the suffering of repeated birthsDisgust will arise at our own craving at our own delusion at our own propensity to create situations which try our strength our resistance and our equanimityThe second insight on which equanimity should be based is the Buddhas teaching of noselfThis doctrine shows that in the ultimate sense deeds are not performed by any self nor do their results affect any selfFurther it shows that if there is no self we cannot speak of my own It is the delusion of a self that creates suffering and hinders or disturbs equanimityIf this or that quality of ours is blamed one thinks I am blamed and equanimity is shakenIf this or that work does not succeed one thinks My work has failed and equanimity is shakenIf wealth or loved ones are lost one thinks What is mine has gone and equanimity is shakenTo establish equanimity as an unshakable state of mind one has to give up all possessive thoughts of mine beginning with little things from which it is easy to detach oneself and gradually working up to possessions and aims to which ones whole heart clingsOne also has to give up the counterpart to such thoughts all egoistic thoughts of self beginning with a small section of ones personality with qualities of minor importance with small weaknesses one clearly sees and gradually working up to those emotions and aversions which one regards as the center of ones beingThus detachment should be practicedTo the degree we forsake thoughts of mine or self equanimity will enter our heartsFor how can anything we realize to be foreign and void of a self cause us agitation due to lust hatred or griefThus the teaching of noself will be our guide on the path to deliverance to perfect equanimityEquanimity is the crown and culmination of the four sublime statesBut this should not be understood to mean that equanimity is the negation of love compassion and sympathetic joy or that it leaves them behind as inferiorFar from that equanimity includes and pervades them fully just as they fully pervade perfect equanimityHow then do these four sublime states pervade and suffuse each otherUnbounded love guards compassion against turning into partiality prevents it from making discriminations by selecting and excluding and thus protects it from falling into partiality or aversion against the excluded sideLove imparts to equanimity its selflessness its boundless nature and even its fervorFor fervor too transformed and controlled is part of perfect equanimity strengthening its power of keen penetration and wise restraintCompassion prevents love and sympathetic joy from forgetting that while both are enjoying or giving temporary and limited happiness there still exist at that time most dreadful states of suffering in the worldIt reminds them that their happiness coexists with measureless misery perhaps at the next doorstepIt is a reminder to love and sympathetic joy that there is more suffering in the world than they are able to mitigate that after the effect of such mitigation has vanished sorrow and pain are sure to arise anew until suffering is uprooted entirely at the attainment of NibbanaCompassion does not allow that love and sympathetic joy shut themselves up against the wide world by confining themselves to a narrow sector of itCompassion prevents love and sympathetic joy from turning into states of selfsatisfied complacency within a jealouslyguarded petty happinessCompassion stirs and urges love to widen its sphere it stirs and urges sympathetic joy to search for fresh nourishmentThus it helps both of them to grow into truly boundless statesCompassion guards equanimity from falling into a cold indifference and keeps it from indolent or selfish isolationUntil equanimity has reached perfection compassion urges it to enter again and again the battle of the world in order to be able to stand the test by hardening and strengthening itselfSympathetic joy holds compassion back from becoming overwhelmed by the sight of the worlds suffering from being absorbed by it to the exclusion of everything elseSympathetic joy relieves the tension of mind soothes the painful burning of the compassionate heartIt keeps compassion away from melancholic brooding without purpose from a futile sentimentality that merely weakens and consumes the strength of mind and heartSympathetic joy develops compassion into active sympathySympathetic joy gives to equanimity the mild serenity that softens its stern appearanceIt is the divine smile on the face of the Enlightened One a smile that persists in spite of his deep knowledge of the worlds suffering a smile that gives solace and hope fearlessness and confidence Wide open are the doors to deliverance thus it speaksEquanimity rooted in insight is the guiding and restraining power for the other three sublime statesIt points out to them the direction they have to take and sees to it that this direction is followedEquanimity guards love and compassion from being dissipated in vain quests and from going astray in the labyrinths of uncontrolled emotionEquanimity being a vigilant selfcontrol for the sake of the final goal does not allow sympathetic joy to rest content with humble results forgetting the real aims we have to strive forEquanimity which means evenmindedness gives to love an even unchanging firmness and loyaltyIt endows it with the great virtue of patienceEquanimity furnishes compassion with an even unwavering courage and fearlessness enabling it to face the awesome abyss of misery and despair which confront boundless compassion again and againTo the active side of compassion equanimity is the calm and firm hand led by wisdom  indispensable to those who want to practice the difficult art of helping othersAnd here again equanimity means patience the patient devotion to the work of compassionIn these and other ways equanimity may be said to be the crown and culmination of the other three sublime statesThe first three if unconnected with equanimity and insight may dwindle away due to the lack of a stabilizing factorIsolated virtues if unsupported by other qualities which give them either the needed firmness or pliancy often deteriorate into their own characteristic defectsFor instance lovingkindness without energy and insight may easily decline to a mere sentimental goodness of weak and unreliable natureMoreover such isolated virtues may often carry us in a direction contrary to our original aims and contrary to the welfare of others tooIt is the firm and balanced character of a person that knits isolated virtues into an organic and harmonious whole within which the single qualities exhibit their best manifestations and avoid the pitfalls of their respective weaknessesAnd this is the very function of equanimity the way it contributes to an ideal relationship between all four sublime statesEquanimity is a perfect unshakable balance of mind rooted in insightBut in its perfection and unshakable nature equanimity is not dull heartless and frigidIts perfection is not due to an emotional emptiness but to a fullness of understanding to its being complete in itselfIts unshakable nature is not the immovability of a dead cold stone but the manifestation of the highest strengthIn what way now is equanimity perfect and unshakableWhatever causes stagnation is here destroyed what dams up is removed what obstructs is destroyedVanished are the whirls of emotion and the meanderings of intellectUnhindered goes the calm and majestic stream of consciousness pure and radiantWatchful mindfulness has harmonized the warmth of faith with the penetrative keenness of wisdom it has balanced strength of will with calmness of mind and these five inner faculties have grown into inner forces that cannot be lost againThey cannot be lost because they do not lose themselves any more in the labyrinths of the world in the endless diffuseness of lifeThese inner forces emanate from the mind and act upon the world but being guarded by mindfulness they nowhere bind themselves and they return unchangedLove compassion and sympathetic joy continue to emanate from the mind and act upon the world but being guarded by equanimity they cling nowhere and return unweakened and unsulliedThus within the arahant the Liberated One nothing is lessened by giving and he does not become poorer by bestowing upon others the riches of his heart and mindThe arahant is like the clear wellcut crystal which being without stains fully absorbs all the rays of light and sends them out again intensified by its concentrative powerThe rays cannot stain the crystal with their various colorsThey cannot pierce its hardness nor disturb its harmonious structureIn its genuine purity and strength the crystal remains unchangedJust as all the streams of the world enter the great ocean and all the waters of the sky rain into it but no increase or decrease of the great ocean is to be seen  even so is the nature of holy equanimityHoly equanimity or  as we may likewise express it  the arahant endowed with holy equanimity is the inner center of the worldBut this inner center should be well distinguished from the numberless apparent centers of limited spheres that is their socalled personalities governing laws and so onAll of these are only apparent centers because they cease to be centers whenever their spheres obeying the laws of impermanence undergo a total change of their structure and consequently the center of their gravity material or mental will shiftBut the inner center of the arahants equanimity is unshakable because it is immutableIt is immutable because it clings to nothingSays the MasterFor one who clings motion exists but for one who clings not there is no motionWhere no motion is there is stillnessWhere stillness is there is no cravingWhere no craving is there is neither coming nor goingWhere no coming nor going is there is neither arising nor passing awayWhere neither arising nor passing away is there is neither this world nor a world beyond nor a state betweenThis verily is the end of sufferingThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Buddha declares that he teaches the Dhamma for the sole purpose of leading beings to freedom from sufferingIf moved by that teaching we resolve to make an end of suffering it is of prime importance that we understand the problem of suffering clearly in its true width and depthIf our grasp of the problem is too glaringly incomplete our endeavors to eliminate it will also be incomplete incapable of garnering the strength needed to yield fully satisfactory resultsWhen asked Why end suffering the obvious answer is that one wishes to end suffering because it is the natural innermost urge of ones being to be free from afflictionHowever in aspiring to the extinction of suffering we should think not only of our own affliction but also of the pain and sorrow we inflict upon others as long as we have not reached the perfect harmlessness of a passionfree heart and the clear vision of a liberated mindIf we regularly recollect the fact that on our way through samsaric existence we inevitably add to the suffering of others too we shall feel an increased urgency in our resolve to enter earnestly the path leading to our own liberationThe suffering we may inflict upon our fellowbeings includes first those cases where other beings become passive objects of our harmful actionsOur greed robs impoverishes deprives and detracts soils and violatesOur hate kills and destroys hurts and rouses fearThe turbid waters of our interfering ignorance flood and devastate the neighbors peaceful shores our misjudgments lead him astray and leave him in calamityThen there is a second and even more detrimental way our defilements may cause harm to othersOur evil or impure actions often provide in others a harmful response that entangles them still more in the meshes of their defilementsOur own greed increases the competitive greed of others our own lust rouses in others lustful desires which might have slumbered had we not awakened themOur own hate and anger provoke hostility in return starting thus the endless round of mutual revengeOur prejudices become infectiousBy our own illusions we deceive others who by believing them lend them increased weight and influenceOur wrong judgments false values and erroneous views sometimes only casually expressed are taken up and expanded by others into extensive systems of deceptive and perverted notions working untold harm on peoples mindsIn all these cases a good part of the responsibility will be oursHow careful we must be in what we speak and writeA third way we may cause suffering to others is due to the limited and varying lifetime of our emotionsOur own love towards a certain person may die a natural death while the person whom we loved still loves us and thus suffers under our neglectOr in reverse while the others love for us has died our own still lives and constantly urges him encroaches upon his need for freedom disturbs his peace and tears at his heart causing him sorrow because he cannot help usThese are quite common situations in human relationships and their consequences are often tragicWe feel their poignancy particularly strongly because no moral guilt seems to be involved only the stern impassive law of impermanence impressing its painful stamp upon this scene of lifeYet here too a moral principle applies though it is a matter of definition whether we use the word guilt Understood rightly the situation presents a case of lust attachment or craving causing pain through lack of fulfillmentLooking at this case in this light how clear will become the second noble truth Craving is the origin of suffering And so too that seeming paradox From what is dear to us suffering arises When deeply contemplating that little specimen of lifes suffering as presented here we shall feel indeed Truly this alone is enough to turn away from all forms of existence to become disenchanted with them to become detached from themWe still have not exhausted all the ways our own imperfections may draw others into the whirlpool of sufferingBut it may suffice here to add a fourth and last pointOur own passions and ignorance whether they involve another directly or only as an observer may contribute to his harm by destroying his trust in man his belief in high ideals and his will to contribute to the fund of goodness in the worldOur own imperfections may thus induce him to become egocentric out of disappointment a cynic or a misanthrope out of personal or impersonal resentmentOwing to our own imperfections the forces of Good will again have been weakened not only in us but in others tooThere are many who will reply to the Buddhist doctrine of suffering by saying We are well aware that happiness and beauty joy and pleasure have to be paid for by a certain amount of sufferingBut we are willing to pay the price without grumbling even the last price death and we think it is worth the price and that it adds zest to our enjoyment Before those who speak thus we may place the facts indicated above and ask them Are you aware that the price you are speaking of is paid not only by your own suffering but also by the suffering of othersDo you think that it is right and fair for you to make others pay for your happinessWill you still find added zest if you look at your happiness from that angle And our partner  provided he is honest and nobleminded  will pensively say I did not think of thatIt is true I must not make others pay for my shortcomingsIf I consider it unfair and ignoble to do so in my everyday dealings should it not likewise be so in relation to these higher problems of life We may then be sure that we have planted the seed in his mind and conscience which will sprout in due timeWe return now to our initial line of thoughtWe have seen how our actions may affect others through many channels how our shortcomings may drag others into suffering entanglement and guiltThus our constantly accumulating responsibility for much of the suffering and unhappiness in the world should be an additional and powerful incentive for us to become holy and whole for the sake of others tooCertainly our own wholeness and health will not cure others at least not directly and not in all casesOur own harmlessness will only rarely keep others from doing harmBut by winning to spiritual health we shall diminish at least by one the sources of infection in the world and our own harmlessness will lessen the fuel nourishing the fires of hate which ravage this earthBy remaining conscious of the suffering we cause and the suffering we might prevent we add two powerful motives to those already urging us to enter the liberating path the challenging sense of manly responsibility and the fullness of motherly love and compassionThese complementary ideals of duty and love which we may call the male and the female principles will help to keep us unswervingly on the pathLove and compassion towards those who might become the victims of our own imperfections will urge us to fulfill our duty towards them in the only way possible by fulfilling our duty towards ourselvesThe above lines of thought are tersely expressed by a saying of the Buddha that is much too little knownIn the light of the observations made above these simple yet profound words of the Master will become still more translucent charged with a magical power stirring the very depth of our beingBy contemplating how our own defiled actions can have detrimental effects upon others we shall still better understand that both statements in this passage are complementary by guarding ourselves we are doing our best to protect others wishing to protect others against the suffering we ourselves can cause we shall do our utmost to guard ourselvesTherefore for our own sake and for the sake of our fellowbeings we have to be watchful of every step we takeOnly by a high degree of mindfulness shall we succeedThus it is said in the same discourse that the method of practicing that twofold protection is the firm establishing of mindfulness which here too proves to be the sole wayI shall protect myself thus the establishing of mindfulness has to be cultivatedI shall protect others thus the establishing of mindfulness has to be cultivatedThe same idea and method is expressed in a passage of the Buddhas Advice to RahulaAfter reflecting again and again actions by deed word and thought should be done Before doing such actions by deed word and thought while doing them and after doing them one should reflect thus Does this action lead to the harm of myself to the harm of others to the harm of both After reflecting again and again one should purify ones actions by deed word and thoughtThus O Rahula should you train yourselfAgain it is saidThus O monks should you train yourselves Considering ones own welfare this is sufficient to strive untiringlyConsidering the welfare of others this is sufficient to strive untiringlyConsidering the welfare of both this is sufficient to strive untiringlyThese three sayings of the Master will illuminate each otherBy reminding us of the right motives of our quest and supplying us with the right methods for accomplishing our task they will be infallible guides in treading the pathThe Buddhist Publication Society is an

great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe present treatise by ProfDrHGlasenapp has been selected for reprint particularly in view of the excellent elucidation of the Anatta Doctrine which it containsThe treatise in its German original appeared in in the Proceeding of the Akademie der Wissenschaften and LiteraturThe present selection from that original is based on the abridged translations published in The Buddhist VolXXI NoPartial use has also been made of a different selection and translation which appeared in The Middle Way VolXXXI NoThe author of this treatise is an eminent Indologist of Western Germany formerly of the University of Koenigsberg now occupying the indological chair of the University of TuebingenAmong his many scholarly publications are books on Buddhism Hinduism Jainism and on comparative religion Buddhist Publication SocietyVedanta and Buddhism are the highlights of Indian philosophical thoughtSince both have grown in the same spiritual soil they share many basic ideas both of them assert that the universe shows a periodical succession of arising existing and vanishing and that this process is without beginning and endThey believe in the causality which binds the result of an action to its cause and in rebirth conditioned by that nexusBoth are convinced of the transitory and therefore sorrowful character of individual existence in the world they hope to attain gradually to a redeeming knowledge through renunciation and meditation and they assume the possibility of a blissful and serene state in which all worldly imperfections have vanished for everThe original form of these two doctrines shows however strong contrastThe early Vedanta formulated in most of the older and middle Upanishads in some passages of the Mahabharata and the Puranas and still alive today as the basis of several Hinduistic systems teaches an ens realissimum as the primordial cause of all existence from which everything has arisen and with which it again merges either temporarily or for everWith the monistic metaphysics of the Vedanta contrasts the pluralistic Philosophy of Flux of the early Buddhism of the Pali texts which up to the present time flourishes in Ceylon Burma and SiamIt teaches that in the whole empirical reality there is nowhere anything that persists neither material nor mental substances exist independently by themselves there is no original entity or primordial Being in whatsoever form it may be imagined from which these substances might have developedOn the contrary the manifold world of mental and material elements arises solely through the causal cooperation of the transitory factors of existence which depend functionally upon each other that is the material and mental universe arises through the concurrence of forces that according to the Buddhists are not reducible to something elseIt is therefore obvious that deliverance from the Samsara ie the sorrowladen round of existence cannot consist in the reabsorption into an eternal Absolute which is at the root of all manifoldness but can only be achieved by a complete extinguishing of all factors which condition the processes constituting life and worldThe Buddhist Nirvana is therefore not the primordial ground the eternal essence which is at the basis of everything and form which the whole world has arisen but the reverse of all that we know something altogether different which must be characterized as a nothing in relation to the world but which is experienced as highest bliss by those who have attained to itVedantists and Buddhists have been fully aware of the gulf between their doctrines a gulf that cannot be bridged overAccording to Majjhima Nikaya Sutta a doctrine that proclaims The same is the world and the selfThis I shall be after death imperishable permanent eternal was styled by the Buddha a perfectly foolish doctrineOn the other side the KathaUpanishad does not see a way to deliverance in the Buddhist theory of dharmas He who supposes a profusion of particulars gets lost like rain water on a mountain slope the truly wise man however must realize that his Atman is at one with the Universal Atman and that the former if purified from dross is being absorbed by the latter just as clear water poured into clear water becomes one with it indistinguishablyVedanta and Buddhism have lived side by side for such a long time that obviously they must have influenced each otherThe strong predilection of the Indian mind for a doctrine of universal unity has led the representatives of Mahayana to conceive Samsara and Nirvana as two aspects of the same and single true reality for Nagarjuna the empirical world is a mere appearance as all dharmas manifest in it are perishable and conditioned by other dharmas without having any independent existence of their ownOnly the indefinable Voidness to be grasped in meditation and realized in Nirvana has true realityThis socalled Middle Doctrine of Nagarjuna remains true to the Buddhist principle that there can be nowhere a substance in so far as Nagarjuna sees the last unity as a kind of abyss characterized only negatively which has no genetic relation to the worldAsanga and Vasubandhu however in their doctrine of Consciousness Only have abandoned the Buddhist principle of denying a positive reality which is at the root all phenomena and in doing so they have made a further approach to VedantaTo that mahayanistic school of Yogacaras the highest reality is a pure and undifferentiated spiritual element that represents the non relative substratum of all phenomenaTo be sure they thereby do not assert as the Vedanta does that the ens realissimum is identical with the universe the relation between the two is rather being defined as being neither different nor not different It is only in the later Buddhist systems of the Far East that the undivided absolute consciousness is taken to be the basis of the manifold world of phenomenaBut in contrast to the older Vedanta it is never maintained that the world is an unfoldment from the unchangeable eternal blissful Absolute suffering and passions manifest in the world of plurality are rather traced back to worldly delusionOn the other hand the doctrines of later Buddhist philosophy had a farreaching influence on VedantaIt is well known that Gaudapada and other representatives of later Vedanta taught an illusionistic acosmism for which true Reality is only the eternally pure eternally awakened eternally redeemed universal spirit whilst all manifoldness is only delusion the Brahma has therefore not developed into the world as asserted by the older Vedanta but it forms only the worlds unchangeable background comparable to the white screen on which appear the changing images of an unreal shadow playIn my opinion there was in later times especially since the Christian era much mutual influence of Vedanta and Buddhism but originally the systems are diametrically opposed to each otherThe Atman doctrine of the Vedanta and the Dharma theory of Buddhism exclude each otherThe Vedanta tries to establish an Atman as the basis of everything whilst Buddhism maintains that everything in the empirical world is only a stream of passing Dharmas which therefore has to be characterized as Anatta ie being without a persisting self without independent existenceAgain and again scholars have tried to prove a closer connection between the early Buddhism of the Pali texts and the Vedanta of the Upanishads they have even tried to interpret Buddhism as a further development of the Atman doctrineThere are eg two books which show that tendency The Vedantic Buddhism of the Buddha by JGJennings and in German language The Soul Problem of Early Buddhism by Herbert GuentherThe essential difference between the conception of deliverance in Vedanta and in Pali Buddhism lies in the following ideas Vedanta sees deliverance as the manifestation of a state which though obscured has been existing from time immemorial for the Buddhist however Nirvana is a reality which differs entirely from all dharmas as manifested in Samsara and which only becomes effective if they are abolishedTo sum up the Vedantin wishes to penetrate to the last reality which dwells within him as an immortal essence or seed out of which everything has arisenThe follower of Pali Buddhism however hopes by complete abandoning of all corporeality all sensations all perceptions all volitions and acts of consciousness to realize a state of bliss which is entirely different from all that exists in the SamsaraAfter these introductory remarks we shall now discuss systematically the relation of original Buddhism and VedantaFirst of all we have to clarify to what extent a knowledge of Upanishadic texts may be assumed for the canonical Pali scripturesThe five old prose Upanishads are on reasons of contents and language generally held to be preBuddhisticThe younger Upanishads in any case those beginning from Maitrayana were certainly written at a time when Buddhism already existedThe number of passages in the Pali canon dealing with Upanishadic doctrines is very smallIt is true that early Buddhism shares many doctrines with the Upanishads but these tenets were so widely held in philosophical circles of those times that we can no longer regard the Upanishads are the direct source from which the Buddha has drawnThe special metaphysical concern of the Upanishads the identity of the individual and the universal Atman has been mentioned and rejected only in a few passages in the early Buddhist texts for instance in the saying of the Buddha quoted earlierNothing shows better the great distance that separates the Vedanta and the teachings of the Buddha than the fact that the two principal concepts of Upanishadic wisdom Atman and Brahman do not appear anywhere in the Buddhist texts with the clear and distinct meaning of a primordial ground of the world core of existence ens realissimum or similarlyAs this holds likewise true for the early Jaina literature one must assume that early Vedanta was of no great importance in Magadha at the time of the Buddha and the Mahavira otherwise the opposition against if would have left more distinct traces in the texts of these two doctrinesIt is of decisive importance for examining the relation between Vedanta and Buddhism clearly to establish the meaning of the words atta and anatta in Buddhist literatureThe meaning of the word attan divides into two groups in daily usage attan serves for denoting ones own person and has the function of a reflexive pronounThis usage is for instance illustrated in the th Chapter of the DhammapadaAs a philosophical term attan denotes the individual soul as assumed by the Jainas and other schools but rejected by the BuddhistsThis individual soul was held to be an eternal unchangeable spiritual monad perfect and blissful by nature although its qualities may be temporarily obscured through its connection with matterStarting from this view held by the heretics the Buddhists further understand by the term self any eternal unchangeable individual entity in other words that which Western metaphysics calls a substance something existing through and in itself and not through something else nor existing attached to or inherent in something else In the philosophical usage of the Buddhists attan is therefore any entity of which the heretics wrongly assume that it exists independently of everything else and that it has existence on its own strengthThe word anattan is a noun and means notself in the sense of an entity that is not independentThe word anatman is found in its meaning of what is not the Soul also in brahmanical Sanskrit sourcesIts frequent use in Buddhism is accounted for by the Buddhist characteristic preference for negative nounsPhrases like rupam anatta are therefore to be translated corporeality is a notself or corporeality is not an independent entityAs an adjective the word anattan changes from the consonantal to the adeclension anatta eg Samyutta PTS III p anattam rupam anatte sankare na pajanatiThe word anatta is therefore to be translated here by not having the nature of a self nonindependent without a self without an substance etcThe passage anattam rupam anatta rupan ti yathabhutam na pajanati has to be rendered With regard to corporeality having not the nature of a self he does not know according to truth Corporeality is a notself The noun attan and the adjective anatta can both be rendered by without a self without an independent essence without a persisting core since the Buddhists themselves do not make any difference in the use of these two grammatical formsThis becomes particularly evident in the case of the word anatta which may be either a singular or a plural nounIn the wellknown phrase sabbe sankhara anicca sabbe dhamma anatta all conditioned factors of existence are transitory all factors existent whatever are without a self it is undoubtedly a plural noun for the Sanskrit version has sarve dharma anatmanahThe fact that the Anatta doctrine only purports to state that a dharma is void of a self is evident from the passage in the Samyutta Nikaya where it is said rupa sunna attena va attaniyenava forms are void of a self and of anything pertaining to a selfWhere Guenther has translated anattan or anatta as not the self one should use a self instead of the self because in the Pali canon the word atman does not occur in the sense of universal soulIt is not necessary to assume that the existence of indestructible monads is a necessary condition for a belief in life after deathThe view that an eternal immortal persisting soul substance is the conditio sine qua non of rebirth can be refuted by the mere fact that not only in the older Upanishads but also in Pythagoras and Empedocles rebirth is taught without the assumption of an imperishable soul substanceGuenther can substantiate his view only through arbitrary translations which contradict the whole of Buddhist traditionThis is particularly evident in those passages where Guenther asserts that the Buddha meant the same by Nirvana and atman and that Nirvana is the true nature of man For in Udana Nirvana is expressly described as anattam which is rightly rendered by Dhammapalas commentary as attavirahita and in Vinaya V p Nirvana is said to be just as the conditioned factors of existence without a selfNeither can the equation atmannirvana be proved by the wellknown phrase attadipa viharatha dhammadipa for whether dipa here means lamp or island of deliverance this passage can after all only refer to the monks taking refuge in themselves and in the doctrine and attan and dhamma cannot possibly be interpreted as NirvanaIn the same way too it is quite preposterous to translate Dhammapada atta hi attano natho as Nirvana is for a man the leader for the chapter is concerned only with the idea that we should strive hard and purify ourselvesOtherwise Guenther would have to translate in the following verse attana va katam papam attajam attasambhavam By Nirvana evil is done it arises out of Nirvana it has its origin in Nirvana It is obvious that this kind of interpretation must lead to manifestly absurd consequencesAs far as I can see there is not a single passage in the Pali canon where the word atta is used in the sense of the Upanishadic AtmanThis is not surprising since the word atman current in all Indian philosophical systems has the meaning of universal soul ens realissimum the Absolute exclusively in the panentheistic and theopantistic Vedanta but in that sense it is alien to all other brahmanical and nonBuddhist doctrinesWhy then should it have a Vedantic meaning in BuddhismAs far as I know no one has ever conceived the idea of giving to the term atman a Vedantic interpretation in the case of Nyaya Vaisesika classical Sankhya Yoga Mimamsa or JainismThe fact that in the Pali canon all worldly phenomena are said to be anatta has induced some scholars of the West to look for an Atman in BuddhismFor instance the following great syllogism was formulated by George Grimm What I perceive to arise and to cease and to cause suffering to me on account of that impermanence cannot be my egoNow I perceive that everything cognizable in me and around me arises and ceases and causes me suffering on account of its impermanenceTherefore nothing cognizable is my ego From that Grimm concludes that there must be an eternal egosubstance that is free from all suffering and above all cognizabilityThis is a rash conclusionBy teaching that there is nowhere in the world a persisting Atman the Buddha has not asserted that there must be a transcendental AtmanThis kind of logic resembles that of a certain Christian sect which worships its masters as Christs on earth and tries to prove the simultaneous existence of several Christs from Mark where it is said False Christs and false prophets shall arise for if there are false Christs there must also be genuine ChristsThe denial of an imperishable Atman is common ground for all systems of Hinayana as well as Mahayana and there is therefore no reason for the assumption that Buddhist tradition unanimous on that point has deviated from the original doctrine of the BuddhaIf the Buddha contrary to the Buddhist tradition had actually proclaimed a transcendental Atman a reminiscence of it would have been preserved somehow by one of the older sectsIt is remarkable that even the Pudgalavadins who assume a kind of individual soul never appeal to texts in which an Atman in this sense is proclaimedHe who advocates such a revolutionary conception of the Buddhas teachings has also the duty to show evidence how such a complete transformation started and grew suddenly or graduallyBut non of those who advocate the Attatheory has taken to comply with that demand which is indispensable to a historianIn addition to the aforementioned reasons there are other grounds too which speak against the supposition that the Buddha has identified Atman and NirvanaIt remains quite incomprehensible why the Buddha should have used this expression which is quite unsuitable for Nirvana and would have aroused only wrong associations in his listenersThough it is true that Nirvana shares with the Vedantic conception of Atman the qualification of eternal peace into which the liberated ones enter forever on the other hand the Atman is in brahmanical opinion something mental and conscious a description which does not hold true for NirvanaFurthermore Nirvana is not like the Atman the primordial ground or the divine principle of the world nor is it that which preserves order in the world it is also not the substance from which everything evolves nor the core of all material elementsSince the scholarly researches made by Otto Rosenberg ThStcherbatsky and the great work of translation done by Louis de la Vallee Poussin Abhidharmakosa there cannot be any doubt about the basic principle of Buddhist philosophyIn the light of these researches all attempts to give to the Atman a place in the Buddhist doctrine appear to be quite antiquatedWe know now that all Hinayana and Mahayana schools are based on the anatmadharma theoryThis theory explains the world through the causal cooperation of a multitude of transitory factors arising in mutual functional dependenceThis theory maintains that the entire process of liberation consists in the tranquilization of these incessantly arising and disappearing factorsFor that process of liberation however is required apart from moral restraint and meditative concentration the insight that all conditioned factors of existence are transitory without a permanent independent existence and therefore subject to grief and sufferingThe Nirvana which the saint experiences already in this life and which he enters for ever after death is certainly a reality but as it neither arises nor vanishes it is not subject to suffering and is thereby distinguished from all conditioned realitiesNirvana being a dharma is likewise anatta just as the transitory conditioned dharmas of the Samsara which as caused by volitions  are themselves also called samskaraLike them Nirvana is no individual entity which could act independentlyFor it is the basic idea of the entire system that all dharmas are devoid of Atman and without cogent reasons we cannot assume that the Buddha himself has thought something different from that which since more than two thousand years his followers have considered to be the quintessence of their doctrineThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThese translations are adapted from the translations and notes in The Light of the Dhamma by the Venerable Narada TheraThe introductory notes to the last three texts have been supplied by the editor of this seriesSigala was the son of a Buddhist family residing at RajagahaHis parents were devout followers of the Buddha but the son was indifferent to religionThe pious father and mother could not by any means persuade their son to accompany them to visit the Buddha or his disciples and hear the noble DoctrineThe son thought it practically useless to pay visits to the Sangha as such visits may entail material lossHe was only concerned with material prosperity to him spiritual progress was to no availConstantly he would say to his father I will have nothing to do with monksPaying homage to them would make my back ache and my knees stiffI should have to sit on the ground and soil and wear out my clothesAnd when at the conversations with them after so sitting one gets to know them one has to invite them and give them offerings and so one only loses by itFinally as the father was about to die he called his son to his deathbed and enquired whether he would at least listen to his parting adviceMost assuredly dear father I shall carry out any order you may be pleased to enjoin on me he repliedWell then dear son after your morning bath worship the six quarters The father asked him to do so hoping that one day or other while the son was so engaged the Buddha or his disciples would see him and make it an occasion to preach an appropriate discourse to himAnd since deathbed wishes are to be remembered Sigala carried out his fathers wish not however knowing its true significanceNow it was the custom of the Buddha to rise from his sleep at four oclock and after experiencing Nibbanic Bliss for an hour to pervade the whole world with his boundless thoughts of lovingkindnessIt is at this hour that he surveys the world with his great compassion to find out what fellow being he could be of service on that dayOne morning Sigala was caught in the net of the Buddhas compassion and with his vision the Buddha seeing that Sigala could be shown a better channel for his acts of worship decided This day will I discourse to Sigala on the laymans VinayaThat discourse will be of benefit to many folkThere must I go The Buddha thereon came up to him on his way for alms to Rajagaha and seeing him engaged in his worship of the six quarters delivered this great discourse which contains in brief the whole domestic and social duty of the laymanCommenting on this Sutta the Venerable Buddhaghosa says Nothing in the duties of a householder is left unmentionedThis Sutta is called the Vinaya of the householderHence in one who practices what he has been taught in it growth is to be looked for not decay And MrsRhys Davids adds The Buddhas doctrine of love and goodwill between man and man is here set forth in a domestic and social ethics with more comprehensive detail than elsewhereAnd truly we may say even now of this Vinaya or code of discipline so fundamental are the human interests involved so sane and wide is the wisdom that envisages them that the utterances are as fresh and practically as binding today and here as they were then at RajagahaHappy would have been the village or clan on the banks of the Ganges where the people were full of the kindly spirit of fellowfeeling the noble spirit of justice which breathes through these naive and simple sayings Not less happy would be the village or the family on the banks of the Thames today of which this could be saidThus have I heardOn one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary near RajagahaNow at that time young Sigala a householders son rising early in the morning departing from Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worshipped with joined hands the various quarters  the East the South the West the North the Nadir and the ZenithThen the Exalted One having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and robe and entered Rajagaha for almsNow he saw young Sigala worshipping thus and spoke to him as followsWherefore do you young householder rising early in the morning departing from Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these various quarters  the East the South the West the North the Nadir and the ZenithMy father Lord while dying said to me The six quarters dear son you shall worshipAnd I Lord respecting revering reverencing and honoring my fathers word rise early in the morning and leaving Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these six quartersIt is not thus young householder the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the nobleHow then Lord should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of the nobleIt is well Lord if the Exalted One would teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the nobleWell young householder listen and bear it well in mind I shall speak  Very good Lord responded young SigalaAnd the Exalted One spoke as followsInasmuch young householder as the noble disciple has eradicated the four vices in conduct inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways inasmuch as he pursues not the six channels for dissipating wealth he thus avoiding these fourteen evil things covers the six quarters and enters the path leading to victory in both worlds he is favored in this world and in the world beyondUpon the dissolution of the body after death he is born in a happy heavenly realmWhat are the four vices in conduct that he has eradicatedThe destruction of life householder is a vice and so are stealing sexual misconduct and lyingThese are the four vices that he has eradicatedThus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againIn which four ways does one commit no evil actionLed by desire does one commit evilLed by anger does one commit evilLed by ignorance does one commit evilLed by fear does one commit evilBut inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire anger ignorance and fear he commits no evilThus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againWhat are the six channels for dissipating wealth which he does not pursueThere are young householder these six evil consequences in indulging in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessnessThere are young householder these six evil consequences in sauntering in streets at unseemly hoursThere are young householder these six evil consequences in frequenting theatrical showsHe is ever thinkingThere are young householder these six evil consequences in indulging in gamblingThere are young householder these six evil consequences in associating with evil companions namely any gambler any libertine any drunkard any swindler any cheat any rowdy is his friend and companionThere are young householder these six evil consequences in being addicted to idlenessHe does no work sayingLiving in this way he leaves many duties undone new wealth he does not get and wealth he has acquired dwindles awayThus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againOne is a bottle friend one says friend friend only to ones face one is a friend and an associate only when it is advantageousSleeping till sunrise adultery irascibility malevolence evil companions avarice  these six causes ruin a manThe man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways to ruin does he fall in both worlds  here and the nextDice women liquor dancing singing sleeping by day sauntering at unseemly hours evil companions avarice  these nine causes ruin a manWho plays with dice and drinks intoxicants goes to women who are dear unto others as their own lives associates with the mean and not with elders  he declines just as the moon during the waning halfWho is drunk poor destitute still thirsty whilst drinking frequents the bars sinks in debt as a stone in water swiftly brings disrepute to his familyWho by habit sleeps by day and keeps late hours is ever intoxicated and is licentious is not fit to lead a household lifeWho says it is too hot too cold too late and leaves things undone the opportunities for good go past such menBut he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and who does his duties manfully does not fall away from happinessThese four young householder should be understood as foes in the guise of friendsIn four ways young householder should one who appropriates be understood as a foe in the guise of a friendIn four ways young householder should one who renders lipservice be understood as a foe in the guise of a friendIn four ways young householder should one who flatters be understood as a foe in the guise of a friendIn four ways young householder should one who brings ruin be understood as a foe in the guise of a friendThus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againThese four young householder should be understood as warmhearted friendsIn four ways young householder should a helpmate be understood as a warmhearted friendIn four ways young householder should one who is the same in happiness and sorrow be understood as a warmhearted friendIn four ways young householder should one who gives good counsel be understood as a warmhearted friendIn four ways young householder should one who sympathises be understood as a warmhearted friendThus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againAnd how young householder does a noble disciple cover the six quartersThe following should be looked upon as the six quartersThe parents should be looked upon as the East teachers as the South wife and children as the West friends and associates as the North servants and employees as the Nadir ascetics and brahmans as the ZenithIn five ways young householder a child should minister to his parents as the EastIn five ways young householder the parents thus ministered to as the East by their children show their compassionIn these five ways do children minister to their parents as the East and the parents show their compassion to their childrenThus is the East covered by them and made safe and secureIn five ways young householder a pupil should minister to a teacher as the SouthIn five ways young householder do teachers thus ministered to as the South by their pupils show their compassionThe teachers thus ministered to as the South by their pupils show their compassion towards them in these five waysThus is the South covered by them and made safe and secureIn five ways young householder should a wife as the West be ministered to by a husbandThe wife thus ministered to as the West by her husband shows her compassion to her husband in five waysIn these five ways does the wife show her compassion to her husband who ministers to her as the WestThus is the West covered by him and made safe and secureIn five ways young householder should a clansman minister to his friends and associates as the NorthThe friends and associates thus ministered to as the North by a clansman show compassion to him in five waysThe friends and associates thus ministered to as the North by a clansman show their compassion towards him in these five waysThus is the North covered by him and made safe and secureIn five ways should a master minister to his servants and employees as the NadirThe servants and employees thus ministered to as the Nadir by their master show their compassion to him in five waysThe servants and employees thus ministered to as the Nadir show their compassion towards him in these five waysThus is the Nadir covered by him and made safe and secureIn five ways young householder should a householder minister to ascetics and brahmans as the ZenithThe ascetics and brahmans thus ministered to as the Zenith by a householder show their compassion towards him in six waysIn these six ways do ascetics and brahmans show their compassion towards a householder who ministers to them as the ZenithThus is the Zenith covered by him and made safe and secure Thus spoke the Exalted OneAnd when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet againWhen the Exalted One had spoken thus Sigala the young householder said as followsExcellent Lord excellentIt is as if Lord a man were to set upright that which was overturned or were to reveal that which was hidden or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness so that those who have eyes may seeEven so has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted OneI take refuge Lord in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaMay the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower as one who has taken refuge from this very day to lifes endThis famous text cherished highly in all Buddhist lands is a terse but comprehensive summary of Buddhist ethics individual and socialThe thirtyeight blessings enumerated in it are an unfailing guide on lifes journeyRightly starting with avoidance of bad company which is basic to all moral and spiritual progress the Blessings culminate in the achievement of a passionfree mind unshakable in its serenityTo follow the ideals set forth in these verses is the sure way to harmony and progress for the individual as well as for society nation and mankindThe Mahamangala Sutta shows that the Buddhas instructions do not always take negative forms that they are not always a series of classifications and analysis or concerned exclusively with monastic moralityHere in this sutta we find family morality expressed in most elegant versesWe can imagine the happy blissful state household life attained as a result of following these injunctionsThus have I heardOn one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindikas monastery in Jetas Grove near SavatthiNow when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted him and stood at one sideStanding thus he addressed the Exalted One in verseNot to associate with the foolish but to associate with the wise and to honor those who are worthy of honor  this is the greatest blessingTo reside in a suitable locality to have done meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right course  this is the

freed from defilements cleansed from fear liberated  this is the greatest blessingThose who thus abide ever remain invincible in happiness establishedThese are the greatest blessingsWhile the Mangala Sutta deals with the way of life conducive to progress and happiness the Parabhava Sutta supplements it by pointing out the causes of downfallHe who allows himself to become tarnished by these blemishes of conduct blocks his own road to worldly moral and spiritual progress and lowers all that is truly noble and human in manBut he who is heedful of these dangers keeps open the road to all those thirtyeight blessings of which human nature is capableThus have I heardOnce the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindikas monastery in the Jeta Grove near SavatthiNow when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted Him and stood at one sideStanding thus he addressed the Exalted One in verseHaving come here with our questions to the Exalted One we ask thee O Gotama about mans declinePray tell us the cause of downfallThe BuddhaEasily known is the progressive one easily known he who declinesHe who loves Dhamma progresses he who is averse to it declinesThus much do we see this is the first cause of ones downfallPray tell us the second causeThe BuddhaThe wicked are dear to him with the virtuous he finds no delight he prefers the creed of the wicked  this is a cause of ones downfallBeing fond of sleep fond of company indolent lazy and irritable  this is a cause of ones downfallThough being welltodo not to support father and mother who are old and past their youth  this is a cause of ones downfallTo deceive by falsehood a brahman or ascetic or any other mendicant  this is a cause of ones downfallTo have much wealth and ample gold and food but to enjoy ones luxuries alone  this is a cause of ones downfallTo be proud of birth of wealth or clan and to despise ones own kinsmen  this is a cause of ones downfallTo be a rake a drunkard a gambler and to squander all one earns  this is a cause of ones downfallNot to be contented with ones own wife and to be seen with harlots and the wives of others  this is a cause of ones downfallBeing past ones youth to take a young wife and to be unable to sleep for jealousy of her  this is a cause of ones downfallTo place in authority a woman given to drink and squandering or a man of a like behavior  this is a cause of ones downfallTo be of noble birth with vast ambition and of slender means and to crave for rulership  this is a cause of ones downfallKnowing well these causes of downfall in the world the noble sage endowed with insight shares a happy realmIn this sutta the Buddha instructs rich householders how to preserve and increase their prosperity and how to avoid loss of wealthWealth alone however does not make a complete man nor a harmonious societyPossession of wealth all too often multiplies mans desires and he is ever in the pursuit of amassing more wealth and powerThis unrestrained craving however leaves him dissatisfied and stifles his inner growthIt creates conflict and disharmony in society through the resentment of the underprivileged who feel themselves exploited by the effects of unrestrained cravingTherefore the Buddha follows up on his advice on material welfare with four essential conditions for spiritual welfare confidence virtue liberality and wisdomThese four will instill in man a sense of higher valuesHe will then not only pursue his own material concern but also be aware of his duty towards societyTo mention only one of the implications a wisely and generously employed liberality will reduce tensions and conflicts in societyThus the observing of these conditions of material and spiritual welfare will make for an ideal citizen in an ideal societyThus have I heardOnce the Exalted One was dwelling amongst the Koliyans in their market town named KakkarapattaThen Dighajanu a Koliyan approached the Exalted One respectfully saluted Him and sat on one sideThus seated he addressed the Exalted One as followsWe Lord are laymen who enjoy worldly pleasureWe lead a life encumbered by wife and childrenWe use sandalwood of KasiWe deck ourselves with garlands perfume and unguentsWe use gold and silverTo those like us O Lord let the Exalted One preach the Dhamma teach those things that lead to weal and happiness in this life and to weal and happiness in future lifeFour conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householders weal and happiness in this very lifeWhich fourThe accomplishment of persistent effort the accomplishment of watchfulness good friendship and balanced livelihoodWhat is the accomplishment of persistent effortHerein Vyagghapajja by whatsoever activity a householder earns his living whether by farming by trading by rearing cattle by archery by service under the king or by any other kind of craft  at that he becomes skillful and is not lazyHe is endowed with the power of discernment as to the proper ways and means he is able to carry out and allocateThis is called the accomplishment of persistent effortWhat is the accomplishment of watchfulnessHerein Vyagghapajja whatsoever wealth a householder is in possession of obtained by dint of effort collected by strength of arm by the sweat of his brow justly acquired by right means  such he husbands well by guarding and watching so that kings would not seize it thieves would not steal it fire would not burn it water would not carry it away nor illdisposed heirs remove itThis is the accomplishment of watchfulnessWhat is good friendshipHerein Vyagghapajja in whatsoever village or market town a householder dwells he associates converses engages in discussions with householders or householders sons whether young and highly cultured or old and highly cultured full of faith full of virtue full of charity full of wisdomHe acts in accordance with the faith of the faithful with the virtue of the virtuous with the charity of the charitable with the wisdom of the wiseThis is called good friendshipWhat is balanced livelihoodHerein Vyagghapajja a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his incomeJust as the goldsmith or an apprentice of his knows on holding up a balance that by so much it has dipped down by so much it has tilted up even so a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his incomeIf Vyagghapajja a householder with little income were to lead an extravagant life there would be those who say  This person enjoys his property like one who eats woodapple If Vyagghapajja a householder with a large income were to lead a wretched life there would be those who say  This person will die like a starvelingThe wealth thus amassed Vyagghapajja has four sources of destruction Debauchery drunkenness gambling friendship companionship and intimacy with evildoersJust as in the case of a great tank with four inlets and outlets if a man should close the inlets and open the outlets and there should be no adequate rainfall decrease of water is to be expected in that tank and not an increase even so there are four sources for the destruction of amassed wealth  debauchery drunkenness gambling and friendship companionship and intimacy with evildoersThere are four sources for the increase of amassed wealth abstinence from debauchery abstinence from drunkenness nonindulgence in gambling friendship companionship and intimacy with the goodJust as in the case of a great tank with four inlets and four outlets if a person were to open the inlets and close the outlets and there should also be adequate rainfall an increase in water is certainly to be expected in that tank and not a decrease even so these four conditions are the sources of increase of amassed wealthThese four conditions Vyagghapajja are conducive to a householders weal and happiness in this very lifeFour conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householders weal and happiness in his future lifeWhich fourThe accomplishment of faith the accomplishment of virtue the accomplishment of charity and the accomplishment of wisdomWhat is the accomplishment of faithHerein a householder is possessed of faith he believes in the Enlightenment of the Perfect One Thus indeed is that Blessed One he is the pure one fully enlightened endowed with knowledge and conduct wellgone the knower of worlds the incomparable leader of men to be tamed the teacher of gods and men allknowing and blessedThis is called the accomplishment of faithWhat is the accomplishment of virtueHerein a householder abstains from killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and from intoxicants that cause infatuation and heedlessnessThis is called the accomplishment of virtueWhat is the accomplishment of charityHerein a householder dwells at home with heart free from the stain of avarice devoted to charity openhanded delighting in generosity attending to the needy delighting in the distribution of almsThis is called the accomplishment of charityWhat is the accomplishment of wisdomHerein a householder is wise he is endowed with wisdom that understands the arising and cessation he is possessed of the noble penetrating insight that leads to the destruction of sufferingThis is called the accomplishment of wisdomThese four conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householders weal and happiness in his future lifeThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseMost writings on the doctrine of kamma emphasize the strict lawfulness governing kammic action ensuring a close correspondence between our deeds and their fruitsWhile this emphasis is perfectly in place there is another side to the working of kamma  a side rarely noted but highly importantThis is the modifiability of kamma the fact that the lawfulness which governs kamma does not operate with mechanical rigidity but allows for a considerably wide range of modifications in the ripening of the fruitIf kammic action were always to bear fruits of invariably the same magnitude and if modification or annulment of kammaresult were excluded liberation from the samsaric cycle of suffering would be impossible for an inexhaustible past would ever throw up new obstructive results of unwholesome kammaHence the Buddha saidIf one says that in whatever way a person performs a kammic action in that very same way he will experience the result  in that case there will be no religious life and no opportunity would appear for the complete ending of sufferingBut if one says that a person who performs a kammic action that is variably experienceable will reap its results accordingly  in that case there will be a religious life and an opportunity for making a complete end of sufferingLike any physical event the mental process constituting a kammic action never exists in isolation but in a field and thus its efficacy in producing a result depends not only on its own potential but also upon the variable factors of its field which can modify it in numerous waysWe see for example that a particular kamma either good or bad may sometimes have its result strengthened by supportive kamma weakened by counteractive kamma or even annulled by destructive kammaThe occurrence of the result can also be delayed if the conjunction of outer circumstances required for its ripening is not complete and that delay may again give a chance for counteractive or destructive kamma to operateIt is however not only these extraneous conditions which can cause modificationThe ripening also reflects the kammas internal field or internal conditions  that is the total qualitative structure of the mind from which the action issuesTo one rich in moral or spiritual qualities a single offense may not entail the weighty results that the same offence will have for one who is poor in such protective virtuesAlso analogously to human law a first offenders punishment will be milder than that of a reconvicted criminalOf this type of modified reaction the Buddha speaks in the continuation of the discourse quoted aboveNow take the case when a minor evil deed has been committed by a certain person and it takes him to hellBut if the same minor offense is committed by another person its result might be experienced during his lifetime and not even the least will appear not to speak about a majorNow what is the kind of person whom a minor offense takes to hellIt is one who has not cultivated the body not cultivated virtue and thought nor has he developed any wisdom he is narrowminded of low character and even for trifling things he suffersIt is such a person whom even a minor offense may take to hellAnd what is the person by whom the result of the same small offense will be experienced in his lifetime without the leastHe is one who has cultivated the body who has cultivated virtue and thought and who has developed wisdom he is not limited by is a great character and he lives unboundedIt is such a person who experiences the result of the same small offense during his lifetime without the least future residueNow suppose a man throws a lump of salt into a small cup of waterWhat do you think monks would that small quantity of water in the cup become salty and undrinkable through that lump of salt  It would Lord  And why so  The water in the cup is so little that a lump of salt can make it salty and undrinkable  But suppose monks that lump of salt is thrown into the river GangesWould it make the river Ganges salty and undrinkable  Certainly not Lord  And why not  Great Lord is the mass of water in the GangesIt will not become salty and undrinkable by a lump of saltFurther O monks suppose a person has to go to jail for a matter of a halfpenny a penny or a hundred pence and another man does not have to go to jail on that accountNow what is the kind of person that has to go to jail for a matter of a halfpenny a penny or a hundred penceIt is one who is poor without means or propertyBut he who is rich a man of means and property does not have to go to jail for such a matterHence we must say that it is an individuals accumulation of good or evil kamma and also his dominating character traits good or evil which affect the kammic resultThey determine the greater or lesser weight of the result and may even spell the difference between whether or not it occurs at allBut even this does not exhaust the existing possibilities of modifications in the weight of kammic reactionA glance into the life histories of people we know may well show us a person of good and blameless character living in secure circumstances yet a single mistake perhaps even a minor one suffices to ruin his entire life  his reputation his career and his happiness  and it may also lead to a serious deterioration of his characterThis seemingly disproportionate crisis might have been due to a chainreaction of aggravating circumstances beyond his control to be ascribed to a powerful counteractive kamma of his pastBut the chain of bad results may have been precipitated by the persons own action  decisively triggered by his initial mistake and reinforced by subsequent carelessness indecision or wrong decisions which of course are unskillful kamma in themselvesThis is a case when even a predominantly good character cannot prevent the ripening of bad kamma or soften the full force of the resultsThe good qualities and deeds of that person will certainly not remain ineffective but their future outcome might well be weakened by any presently arisen negative character changes or actions which might form a bad counteractive kammaConsider too the converse situation A person deserving to be called a thoroughly bad character may on a rare occasion act on an impulse of generosity and kindnessThis action may turn out to have unexpectedly wide and favorable repercussions on his lifeIt might bring about a decisive improvement in his external circumstances soften his character and even initiate a thorough change of heartHow complex indeed are situations in human life even when they appear deceptively simpleThis is so because the situations and their outcome mirror the still greater complexity of the mind their inexhaustible sourceThe Buddha himself has said The minds complexity surpasses even the countless varieties of the animal kingdom For any single individual the mind is a stream of everchanging mental processes driven by the currents and crosscurrents of kamma accumulated in countless past existencesBut this complexity already great is increased still very much more by the fact that each individual lifestream is interwoven with many other individual lifestreams through the interaction of their respective kammasSo intricate is the net of kammic conditioning that the Buddha declared kammaresult to be one of the four unthinkables and warned against creating it as a subject of speculationBut though the detailed workings of kamma escape our intellection the practically important message is clear the fact that kammic results are modifiable frees us from the bane of determinism and its ethical corollary fatalism and keeps the road to liberation constantly open before usThe potential openness of a given situation however also has a negative side the element of risk and danger a wrong response to the situation might open a downward pathIt is our own response which removes the ambiguity of the situation for better or worseThis reveals the kamma doctrine of the Buddha as a teaching of moral and spiritual responsibility for oneself and othersIt is truly a human teaching because it corresponds to and reflects mans wide range of choices a range much wider than that of an animalAny individuals moral choice may be severely limited by the varying load of greed hatred and delusion and their results which he carries around yet every time he stops to make a decision or a choice he has the opportunity to rise above all the menacing complexities and pressures of his unfathomable kammic pastIndeed in one short moment he can transcend aeons of kammic bondageIt is through right mindfulness that man can firmly grasp that fleeting moment and it is mindfulness again that enables him to use it for making wise choicesEvery kammic action as soon as it is performed first of all affects the doer of the deed himselfThis holds with as much truth for bodily and verbal deeds directed towards others as it does for volitional thoughts that do not find outward expressionTo some extent we can control our own response to our actions but we cannot control the way others respond to themTheir response may turn out to be quite different from what we expect or desireA good deed of ours might be met with ingratitude a kind word may find a cold or even hostile receptionBut though these good deeds and kind words will then be lost to the recipient to his own disadvantage they will not be lost to the doerThe good thoughts that inspired them will ennoble his mind even more so if he responds to the negative reception with forgiveness and forbearance rather than anger and resentmentAgain an act or word meant to harm or hurt another may not provoke him to a hostile reaction but only meet with selfpossessed calmnessThen this unaccepted present will fall back to the giver as the Buddha once told a brahmin who had abused himThe bad deed and words and the thoughts motivating them may fail to harm the other but they will not fail to have a damaging effect on the character of the doer and it will affect him even worse if he reacts to the unexpected response by rage or a feeling of resentful frustrationHence the Buddha says that beings are the responsible owners of their kamma which is their inalienable propertyThey are the only legitimate heirs of their actions inheriting their legacy of good or bad fruitsIt will be a wholesome practice to remind oneself often of the fact that ones deeds words and thoughts first of all act upon and alter ones own mindReflecting thus will give a strong impetus to true selfrespect which is preserved by protecting oneself against everything mean and evilTo do so will also open a new practical understanding of a profound saying of the BuddhaIn this fathomlong body with its perceptions and thoughts there is the world the origin of the world the ending of the world and the path leading to the ending of the world ANThe world of which the Buddha speaks is comprised in this aggregate of bodyandmindFor it is only by the activity of our physical and mental sense faculties that a world can be experienced and known at allThe sights sounds smells tastes and bodily impressions which we perceive and our various mental functions conscious and unconscious  this is the world in which we liveAnd this world of ours has its origin in that very aggregate of physical and mental processes that produces the kammic act of craving for the six physical and mental sense objectsIf Ananda there were no kamma ripening in the sphere of the senses would there appear any sensesphere existence  Surely not Lord ANThus kamma is the womb from which we spring the true creator of the world and of ourselves as the experiencer of the worldAnd through our kammic actions in deed word and thought we unceasingly engage in building and rebuilding this world and worlds beyondEven our good actions as long as they are still under the influence of craving conceit and ignorance contribute to the creation and preservation of this world of sufferingThe Wheel of Life is like a treadmill set in perpetual motion by kamma chiefly by its three unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusionThe end of the world cannot be reached by walking on a treadmill this only creates the illusion of progressIt is only by stopping that vain effort that the end can be reachedIt is through the elimination of greed hatred and delusion that the concatenation of kamma comes to an endAnd this again can happen nowhere else than in the same aggregate of bodyandmind where suffering and its causes originateIt is the hopeful message of the third noble truth that we can step out of the weary round of vain effort and miseryIf despite our knowledge of the possibility of release we keep walking on the treadmill of life that is because of an ageold addiction hard to break the deeply rooted habit of clinging to the notions of I mine and self But here again there is the hopeful message in the fourth noble truth with its Noble Eightfold Path the therapy that can cure the addiction and gradually lead us to the final cessation of sufferingAnd all that is required for the therapy is again found in our own body and mindThe treatment proper starts with correctly understanding the true nature of kamma and thereby our situation in the worldThis understanding will provide a strong motivation for ensuring a prevalence of good kamma in ones lifeAnd as it deepens by seeing the human condition still more clearly this same understanding will become the spur for breaking the chains of kammic bondageIt will impel one to strive diligently along the path and to dedicate all ones actions and their fruits to the greatest end of action  the final liberation of oneself and all sentient beingsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Buddha repeatedly discouraged any excessive veneration paid to him personallyHe knew that an excess of purely emotional devotion can obstruct or disturb the development of a balanced character and thus may become a serious obstacle to progress on the path to deliveranceThe history of religion has since proved him right as illustrated by the extravagancies of emotional mysticism in East and WestThe suttas relate the story of the monk Vakkali who full of devotion and love for the Buddha was ever desirous to behold him bodilyTo him the Buddha said What shall it profit you to see this impure bodyHe who sees the Dhamma sees meShortly before the Buddha passed away he said If a monk or a nun a devout man or a devout woman lives in accordance with the Dhamma is correct in his life walks in conformity with the Dhamma  it is he who rightly honors reverences venerates holds sacred and reveres the Perfect One with the worthiest homageA true and deep understanding of the Dhamma together with a conduct that is in conformity with that understanding  these are vastly superior to any external homage or mere emotional devotionThat is the instruction conveyed by these two teachings of the MasterIt would be a mistake however to conclude that the Buddha disparaged a reverential and devotional attitude of mind when it is the natural outflow of a true understanding and a deep admiration of what is great and nobleIt would also be a grievous error to believe that the seeing of the Dhamma is identical with a mere intellectual appreciation and purely conceptual grasp of the doctrineSuch a onesided abstract approach to the very concrete message of the Buddha all too often leads to intellectual smugnessIn its barrenness it will certainly not be a substitute for the strong and enlivening impulse imparted by a deepfelt devotion to what is known as great noble and exemplaryDevotion being a facet and natural accompaniment of confidence is a necessary factor in the balance of faculties required for final deliveranceConfidence in all its aspects including the devotional is needed to resolve any stagnation and other shortcomings resulting from a onesided development of the intellectual facultiesSuch development often tends to turn around in circles endlessly without being able to effect a breakthroughHere devotion confidence and faith  all aspects of the Pali term saddha  may be able to give quick and effective helpThough the Buddha refused to be made the object of an emotional personality cult he also knew that respect and homage paid to those who are worthy of it is a great blessing The Buddha made this statement in the very first stanza of one of his principal ethical injunctions the Discourse on BlessingsMentioning the value of a respectful reverential attitude together with the blessings avoiding fools and associating with the wise the Buddha obviously regarded such an attitude as fundamental for individual and social progress and for the acquisition of any further higher benefitsOne who is incapable of a reverential attitude will also be incapable of spiritual progress beyond the narrow limits of his present mental conditionOne who is so blind as not to see or recognize anything higher and better than the little mudpool of his petty self and environment will suffer for a long time from retarded growthAnd one who out of a demonstrative selfassertion scorns a reverential attitude in himself and in others will remain imprisoned in his selfconceit  a most formidable bar to a true maturity of character and to spiritual growthIt is by recognizing and honoring someone or something higher that one honors and enhances ones own inner potentialitiesSince respect reverence and devotion are partial aspects of the Buddhist concept of confidence one will now understand why confidence has been called the seed of all other beneficial qualitiesThe nobler the object of reverence or devotion the higher is the blessing bestowed by itThose who have joyous confidence in the highest the highest fruit will be theirsThe supreme objects of a Buddhists reverence and devotion are his Three Refuges also called the Three Jewels or Ideals the Buddha his Teaching and the Community of saintly monks and nunsHere too the Buddha is revered not as a personality of such a name nor as a deity but as the embodiment of EnlightenmentA text often recurring in the Buddhist scriptures says that a devout lay disciple has confidence he believes in the Enlightenment of the Perfect One This confidence however is not the outcome of blind faith based on hearsay but is derived from the devotees reasoned conviction based on his own understanding of the Buddha Word which speaks to him clearly with a voice of unmistakable EnlightenmentThis derivation of his assurance is emphasized by the fact that along with confidence wisdom also is mentioned among the qualities of an ideal lay followerWe may now ask Is it not quite natural that feelings of love gratitude reverence and devotion seek expression through the entire personality through acts of body and speech as well as through our thoughts and unexpressed sentimentsWill one for instance hide ones feelings towards parents and other loved onesWill one not rather express them by loving words and deedsWill one not cherish their memory in suitable ways as for instance by preserving their pictures in ones home by placing flowers on their graves by recalling their noble qualitiesIn such a way one who has become critical of the devotional aspects of religion may seek to understand the outward acts of homage customary in Buddhist lands when with reverential gesture flowers and incense are placed before a Buddha image and devotional texts are recited not as prayers but as meditationProvided that such practice does not deteriorate into a thoughtless routine a follower of the Dhamma will derive benefit if he takes up some form of a devotional practice adapting it to his personal temperament and to the social customs of his environmentBuddhism however does not in the least impose upon its followers a demand to observe any outward form of devotion or worshipThis is entirely left to the choice of individuals whose emotional devotional and intellectual needs are bound to differ greatlyNo Buddhist should feel himself forced into an ironcast mould be it of a devotional or a rationalistic shapeAs a follower of the middle way he should however also avoid onesided judgment of others and try to appreciate that their individual needs and preferences may differ from his ownMore important and of greater general validity than outward forms of devotion is the basic capacity for respect and reverence discussed at the beginning of this essay and also the practice of meditations or contemplations of a devotional characterMany benefits accrue from these and hence it was for good reasons that the Enlightened One strongly and repeatedly recommended the meditative recollection of the Buddha along with other kindred devotional recollectionsHere again the reference is to the embodied ideal thus the Buddha as a being freed from all traces of vanity and egotism could venture to recommend to his disciples a meditation on the BuddhaWhat then are the benefits of such devotional meditationsTheir first benefit is mental purificationThey have been called by the Buddha efficacious procedures for purifying a defiled mindWhen a noble disciple contemplates upon the Enlightened One at that time his mind is not enwrapped in lust nor in hatred nor in delusionAt such a time his mind is rightly directed it has got rid of lust is aloof from it is freed from itLust is here a name for the five sense desiresBy cultivating this contemplation many beings become purifiedIf by practicing that devotional meditation one endeavors to live as it were in the Masters presence one will feel ashamed to do speak or think anything unworthy one will shrink back from evil and as a positive reaction one will feel inspired to high endeavor in emulation of the Masters great exampleImages and not abstract concepts are the language of the subconsciousIf therefore the image of the Enlightened One is often created within ones mind as the embodiment of man perfected it will penetrate deeply into the subconscious and if sufficiently strong will act as an automatic brake against evil impulsesIn such a way the subconscious normally so often the hidden enemy in gaining selfmastery may become a powerful ally of such an endeavorFor that purpose of educating the subconscious it will be helpful to use a Buddha image or picture as an aid in visualizationIn that way concentration of mind may be attained fairly soonFor evoking and deeply absorbing some features of the Buddhas personality his qualities should be contemplated for instance in the way described in the VisuddhimaggaThe recollection of the Buddha being productive of joy is an effective way of invigorating the mind of lifting it up from the states of listlessness tension fatigue and frustration which occur during meditation as well as in ordinary lifeThe Buddha himself advised If in contemplation of the body bodily agitation including sense desires or mental lassitude or distraction should arise then the meditator should turn his mind to a gladdening elevating subjectAnd here the teachers of old recommend especially the recollection of the BuddhaWhen those hindrances to concentration vanish under its influence the meditator will be able to return to his original meditation subjectFor a beginner especially attempts at gaining concentration are often frustrated by an uneasy selfconsciousness the meditator as it were squints back upon himselfHe becomes disturbingly aware of his body with its little discomforts and of his mind struggling against obstacles which only grow stronger the more he strugglesThis may happen when the subject of meditation is ones one physical or mental processes but it may also occur with other subjectsIn such a situation it will be profitable to follow the advice given earlier and to turn ones attention from ones own personality to the inspiring visualization of the Buddha and the contemplation of his qualitiesThe joyful interest thus produced may bring about that selfforgetfulness which is such an important factor for gaining concentrationJoy produces calm calm leads to ease and ease to concentrationThus devotional meditation can serve as a valuable aid in attaining mental concentration which is the basis of liberating insightThis function of devotional meditation cannot be better described than in the words of the MasterWhen a noble disciple contemplates upon the Enlightened One at that time his mind is not enwrapped in lust nor in hatred nor in delusionAt such a time his mind is rightly directed towards the Perfect OneAnd with a rightly directed mind the noble disciple gains enthusiasm for the goal enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains the delight derived from the DhammaIn him thus delighted joy arises to one who is joyful body and mind become calm calmed in body and mind he feels at ease and if at ease the mind finds concentrationSuch a one is called a noble disciple who among humanity gone wrong has attained to what is right who among a humanity beset by troubles dwells free of troubles ANThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for

discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseFaith involves not merely a belief in the existence of a thing or in the truth of a creedal formula but also confidence in the power of its objectReligious faith is the belief and confidence in the power of the Supreme Good and Buddhist faith in particular the belief in the incomparable power of the Noble Eightfold Path the confidence in its purifying and liberating efficacyAmong those calling themselves believers or religious people or in our case Buddhists there are still too few who have that kind of genuine faith in the actual power of the Good to transform and elevate the life of the individual and of society to secure them against the resistance of the evil in themselves and in the world outsideToo few dare to entrust themselves to the powerful current of the Good too many secretly believe in spite of a vague sort of faith that the power of the evil in themselves and the world is stronger  too strong to be contended withMany politicians everywhere in the world seem to believe the same particularly those who call themselves realists obviously implying that only the evil is real They think that of necessity they have to submit to its greater powerIf they are not willing to put it to the test it is no wonder that they cannot achieve much goodTo be sure in face of the great forces of evil and stupidity this kind of genuine faith in the Good requires a certain amount of courageBut no progress of any kind is possible without courageProgress means to overcome the natural inertia of present unsatisfactory conditions in the individual and in societyIt certainly requires courage to take the first step in breaking through that resistance of the natural inertia and the selfpreserving tendency of things and mindsBut just that courage is the preliminary condition of successThe ancient teachers of the Buddhist doctrine were well aware that courage is an essential feature of true faithThey therefore compared faith to a strong and courageous hero who plunges ahead into the turbulent waters of a stream to lead safely across the weaker people who timidly stop at the shore or excitedly and in vain run up and down the bank engaged in useless arguments about the proper place to crossThis simile can be applied to the social as well as to the inner lifeIn the case of social life the weaker people are those who are willing to follow and support a leader but who cannot make a start by themselvesIn the case of the inner life the weaker people are those qualities necessary for spiritual progress which are either undeveloped or isolated from their supplementary virtuesTwo factors of inner progress which supplement support and balance each other are intellect and faithIf intellect remains without the confidence devotion and zeal of faith it will stop short at a mere theoretical understanding and intellectual appreciation of teachings meant to be lived and not only thought or talked aboutIn the words of our simile intellect if not helped by the hero of faith will merely run up and down the bank of the stream an activity with a very busy and important appearance but with few actual resultsIntellect separated from faith will lack the firm belief in its own power to be the guide on the path of lifeWithout this inner conviction it will hesitate to follow in earnest its own conclusions and commands it will lack the courage to make an actual start on the task of crossing overFaith as a supplementary quality supported by the vigor and endurance of energy will give wings to the intellect enabling it to rise above the barrenness of unapplied knowledge and the futile wordy wars of conceptual thoughtIn exchange intellect will give to faith discriminative judgment and reliable guidanceIt will prevent faith from becoming exhausted from wasting its energies by ineffective emotional effusions and misdirected effortsTherefore faith and intellect should always be harmonizedWith right mindfulness keeping them balanced the two together will prove to be ideal companions able to meet by their combined efforts any dangers and difficulties

still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseSince my presentation is entitled A Buddhist Response to Contemporary Dilemmas of Human Existence I should begin by spelling out what I mean by the expression contemporary dilemmas of human existence By this phrase I do not refer explicitly to the momentous social and political problems of our time  global poverty ethnic hostility overpopulation the spread of AIDS the suppression of human rights environmental despoliation etcI recognize fully well that these problems are of major concern to contemporary religion which has the solemn responsibility of serving as the voice of conscience to the world which is only too prone to forsake all sense of conscience in blind pursuit of selfinterestHowever I see many of these particular problems as symptoms or offshoots of a more fundamental dilemma which is essentially spiritual in nature and it is this I am particularly concerned to addressOur root problem it seems to me is at its core a problem of consciousnessI would characterize this problem briefly as a fundamental existential dislocation a dislocation having both cognitive and ethical dimensionsThat is it involves both a disorientation in our understanding of reality and a distortion or inversion of the proper scale of values the scale that would follow from a correct understanding of realityBecause our root problem is one of consciousness this means that any viable solution must be framed in terms of a transformation of consciousnessIt requires an attempt to arrive at a more accurate grasp of the human situation in its full depth and breadth and a turning of the mind and heart in a new direction a direction commensurate with the new understanding one that brings light and peace rather than strife and distressBefore I discuss some of the responses that religion might make to the outstanding dilemmas of our age I propose to offer a critique of the existential dislocation that has spread among such significant portion of humankind todayThrough most of this century the religious point of view has been defensiveIt may now be the time to take the offensive by scrutinizing closely the dominant modes of thought that lie at the base of our spiritual malaiseI see the problem of existential dislocation to be integrally tied to the ascendancy world wide of a type of mentality that originates in the West but which today has become typical of human civilization as a wholeIt would be too simple to describe this frame of mind as materialism first because those who adopt it do not invariably subscribe to materialism as a philosophical thesis and second because obsession with material progress is not the defining characteristic of this outlook but a secondary manifestationIf I were to coin a single a single expression to convey its distinctive essence I would call it the radical secularization of human lifeThe underlying historical cause of this phenomenon seems to lie in an unbalanced development of the human mind in the West beginning around the time of the European RenaissanceThis development gave increasing importance to the rational manipulative and dominative capacities of the mind at the expense of its intuitive comprehensive sympathetic and integrative capacitiesThe rise to dominance of the rational manipulative facets of human consciousness led to a fixation upon those aspects of the world that are amenable to control by this type of consciousness  the world that could be conquered comprehended and exploited in terms of fixed quantitative unitsThis fixation did not stop merely with the pragmatic efficiency of such a point of view but became converted into a theoretical standpoint a standpoint claiming validityIn effect this means that the material world as defined by modern science became the founding stratum of reality while mechanistic physics its methodological counterpart became a paradigm for understanding all other types of natural phenomena biological psychological and socialThe early founders of the Scientific Revolution in the seventeenth century  such as Galileo Boyle Descartes and Newton  were deeply religious men for whom the belief in the wise and benign Creator was the premise behind their investigations into lawfulness of natureHowever while they remained loyal to the theistic premises of Christian faith the drift of their thought severely attenuated the organic connection between the divine and the natural order a connection so central to the premodern world viewThey retained God only as the remote Creator and lawgiver of Nature and sanctioned moral values as the expression of the Divine Will the laws decreed for man by his MakerIn their thought a sharp dualism emerged between the transcendent sphere and the empirical worldThe realm of hard facts ultimately consisted of units of senseless matter governed by mechanical laws while ethics values and ideals were removed from the realm of facts and assigned to the sphere of an interior subjectivityIt was only a matter of time until in the trail of the socalled Enlightenment a wave of thinkers appeared who overturned the dualistic thesis central to this world view in favor of the straightforward materialismThis development was not a following through of the reductionistic methodology to its final logical consequencesOnce sense perception was hailed as the key to knowledge and quantification came to be regarded as the criterion of actuality the logical next step was to suspend entirely the belief in a supernatural order and all it impliedHence finally an uncompromising version of mechanistic materialism prevailed whose axioms became the pillars of the new world viewMatter is now the only ultimate reality and divine principle of any sort dismissed as sheer imaginationThe triumph of materialism in the sphere of cosmology and metaphysics had the profoundest impact on human selfunderstandingThe message it conveyed was that the inward dimensions of our existence with its vast profusion of spiritual and ethical concerns is mere adventitious superstructureThe inward is reducible to the external the invisible to the visible the personal to the impersonalMind becomes a higher order function of the brain the individual a node in a social order governed by statistical lawsAll humankinds ideals and values are relegated to the status of illusions they are projections of biological drives sublimated wishfulfillmentEven ethics the philosophy of moral conduct comes to be explained away as a flowery way of expressing personal preferencesIts claim to any objective foundation is untenable and all ethical judgments become equally validThe ascendancy of relativism is completeI have sketched the intellectual background to our existential dislocation in a fair degree of detail because I think that any attempt to comprehend the contemporary dilemmas of human existence in isolation from this powerful cognitive underpinning would be incomplete and unsatisfactoryThe cognitive should not be equated with the merely theoretical abstract and ineffectualFor the cognitive can in subtle ways that defy easy analysis exercise a tremendous influence upon the affective and practical dimensions of our lives doing so behind the back as it were of our outwardly directed consciousnessThus once the world view which extols the primacy of the external dimension of reality over the internal gained widespread acceptance on the cognitive front it infiltrated the entire culture entailing consequences that are intensely practical and personalPerhaps the most characteristic of these might be summed up in the phrase I used at the outset of this paper the radical secularization of lifeThe dominance of materialism in science and philosophical thought penetrated into the religious sphere and sapped religious beliefs and values of their binding claims on the individual in public affairsThese beliefs and values were relegated to the private sphere as matters of purely personal conscience while those spheres of life that transcend the narrowly personal were divested of religious significanceThus in an early stage the evolution of modern society replicated the dualism of philosophical theory the external sphere becomes entirely secular while ethical value and spirituality are confined to the internalIn certain respects this was without doubt a major step in the direction of human liberation for it freed individuals to follow the dictates of personal conscience and reduced considerably the pressures placed upon them to conform to the prevailing system of religious beliefsBut while this advantage cannot be underestimated the triumph of secularism in the domain of public life eventually came to throw into question the cogency of any form of religious belief or commitment to a transcendent guarantor of ethical values and this left the door open for widespread moral deterioration often in the name of personal freedomWhile a dualistic division of the social order characterized the early phase of the modern period as in the case of philosophy dualism does not have the last wordFor the process of secularization does not respect even the boundaries of the private and personalOnce a secular agenda engulfs the social order the entire focus of human life shifts from the inward to the outward and from the Eternal to the Here and NowSecularization invades the most sensitively private arenas of our lives spurred on by a social order driven by the urge for power profits and uniformityOur lives become devoured by temporal mundane preoccupations even to the extent that such notions as redemption enlightenment and deliverance  the watchwords of spirituality  at best serve as evokers of a sentimental pietyThe dominant ends of secular society create a situation in which any boundary line of inward privacy comes to be treated as a barrier that must be surmountedHence we find that commercial interests and political organizations are prepared to explore and exploit the most personal frontiers of desire and fantasy in order to secure their advantage and enhance their wealth and powerThe ascendancy of secularization in human life in no way means that most people in secular society openly reject religion and acknowledge the finality of thisworldly aimsFar from itThe human mind displays an astounding ability to operate simultaneously on different levels even when those levels are sustained by opposing principlesThus in a given culture the vast majority will still pay homage to God or to the Dhamma they will attend church or the temple they will express admiration of religious ideals they will conform to the routine observances expected of them by their ancestral faithAppeals to religious sentiment will be a powerful means of stirring up waves of emotion and declarations of loyalty even of mobilizing whole sections of the population in support of sectarian stands on volatile issuesThis affirmation of allegiance to religious ideals is not done out of sheer hypocrisy but from a capacity for inward ambivalence that allows us to live in a state of selfcontradictionPeople in secular society will genuinely profess reverence for religion will vigorously affirm religious beliefsBut their real interests lie elsewhere riveted tightly to the temporalThe ruling motives of human life are no longer purification but production no longer the cultivation of character but the consumption of commodities and the enjoyment of sense pleasuresReligion may be permitted to linger at the margins of the mind indeed may even be invited into the inward chamber so long as it does not rudely demand of us that we take up any crossesThis existential dislocation has major repercussions on a variety of frontsMost alarming in its immediate impact on our lives is the decline in the efficacy of timehonored moral principles as guides to conductI do not propose painting our picture of the past in rosy colorsHuman nature has never been especially sweet and the books of history speak too loudly of mans greed blindness and brutalityOften I must sadly add organized religion has been among the worst offendersHowever while aware of this I would also say that at least during certain past epochs our ancestors esteemed ethical ideals as worthy of emulation and sanctioned moral codes as the proper guidelines of lifeFor all its historical shortcomings religion did provide countless people in any given culture with a sense of meaning to their existence a sense that their lives were rooted in the Ultimate Reality and were directed towards that Reality as their final goalNow however that we have made the radical turn away from the Transcendent we have lost the polestar that guided our daily choices and decisionsThe result is evident in the moral degeneration that proliferates at a frightening rate through every socalled civilized part of the worldIn the selfstyled Developed World the cities have become urban jungles the use of liquor and drugs spreads as an easy escape route from anxiety and despair sexually provocative entertainment takes on more and more degrading forms the culture of the gun hooks even middleclass youths itching to break the tedium of their lives with murder and mayhemMost lamentably the family has lost its crucial function of serving as the training ground where children learn decency and personal responsibilityInstead it has become merely a convenient and fragile arrangement for the personal gratification of its members who too often seek their gratification at the expense of each otherWhile such trends have not yet widely inundated Sri Lanka we can already see their germs beginning to sprout and as modernization spreads extraordinary vigilance will be required to withstand themAs humanity moves ever closer to the st century the existential rift at the heart of our inner life remainsIts pain is exacerbated by our repeated failures to solve so many of the social political and economic problems that seem on the surface as though they should be easily manageable by our sophisticated technological capabilitiesThe stubborn persistence of these problems  and the constant emergence of new problems as soon as the old ones recede  seems to make a mockery of all our wellintentioned attempts to establish a utopian paradise on utterly secular premisesI certainly do not think that the rediscovery of the religious consciousness is in itself a sufficient remedy for these problems which spring from a wide multiplicity of causes far too complex to be reduced to any simplistic explanationBut I do believe that the religious crisis of modern humanity is intimately connected to these diverse social and political tragedies at many levelsSome of these levels I would add lie far beyond the range of rational comprehension and defy analysis in terms of linear causalityI would see the connection as that of coarisen manifestations of a corrosive sickness in the human soul  the sickness of selfishness and craving  or as karmic backlashes of the three root defilements pinpointed by Buddhism  greed hatred and delusion  which have become so rampant todayI therefore think that any hopes we may cherish towards healing our community our planet and our world must involve us in a deep level process of healing ourselvesAnd since this healing in my view can only be successfully accomplished by reorienting our lives towards the Ultimate Reality and Supreme Good the process of healing necessarily takes on a religious dimensionIt is hardly within my capacity as a very limited individual to delineate in this paper all the elements that would be required to restore the religious dimension to its proper role in human lifeBut I will first briefly mention two religious approaches that have sprung up in response to our existential dislocation but which I consider to be inadequate even false bypathsThen I will sketch in a tentative and exploratory manner several responses religion must make if it is to answer the deep yearnings that stir in the hearts of presentday humanityThe two religious phenomena that in my view are false detours which must finally be rejected are fundamentalism and spiritual eclecticismBoth have arisen as reactions to the pervasive secularism of our time both speak to the widespread hunger for more authentic spiritual values than our commercial sensualist culture can offerYet neither I would argue provides a satisfactory solution to our needsFundamentalism no doubt bears the character of a religious revivalHowever in my opinion it fails to qualify as a genuinely spiritual type of religiosity because it does not meet the criterion of true spiritualityThis criterion I would describe in broad terms as the quest to transcend the limitations of the egoconsciousnessAs I understand fundamentalism it draws its strength from its appeal to human weakness by provoking the egoconsciousness and the narrow volatile interests of the small selfIts psychological mood is that of dogmatism it polarizes the human community into the opposed camps of insiders and outsiders it dictates a policy of aggression that entails either violence against the outsiders or attempts to proselytize themIt does not point us in the direction of selflessness understanding acceptance of others based on love the ingredients of true spiritualitySpiritual eclecticism  omnipresent in the West today  is governed by the opposite logicIt aims to amalgamate to draw into a whole a sundry variety of quasireligious disciplines yoga spiritualism channeling astrology faith healing meditation I Ching special diets Cabbala etcThese are all offered to the seeker on a pickandchoose basis everything is valid anything goesThis eclecticism often reveals a longing for genuine spiritual experience for a vision of reality more encompassing than pragmatic materialismIt fails because it tears profound disciplines out from their context in a living faith and blends them together into a shapeless mixture without spine or substanceIts psychological mood is that of a romantic promiscuous yearning for easy gratification rather than that of serious commitmentOwing to its lack of discrimination it often shades off into the narcissistic and the occult occasionally into the diabolicalI believe that a viable solution to humanitys spiritual hunger can arise only from within the fold of the great classical religious traditionsI must also state frankly that I am convinced that the religious tradition that best addresses the crucial existential problems of our time is Buddhism especially in its early form based on the Pali canonHowever to speak in terms of a more general application I would maintain that if any great religion is to acquire a new relevance it must negotiate some very delicate very difficult balancesIt must strike a happy balance between remaining faithful to the seminal insights of its Founder and ancient masters and acquiring the skill and flexibility to formulate these insights in ways that directly link up with the pressing existential demands of oldageIt is only too easy to veer towards one of these extremes at the expense of the other either to adhere tenaciously to ancient formulas at the expense of present relevance or to bend fundamental principles so freely that one drains them of their deep spiritual vitalityThe middle way which fuses fidelity to tradition and relevance to contemporary concerns is always the most difficultAbove all I think any religion today must bear in mind an important lesson impressed on us so painfully by past history the task of religion is to liberate not to enslaveIts purpose should be to enable its adherents to move towards the realization of the Ultimate Good and to bring the power of this realization to bear upon life in the worldThe purpose is not to subordinate the individual to the institution to multiply the numbers of the faithful and to sacrifice the individual conscience upon the altar of the EstablishmentDespite the vast differences between the belief systems of the major religions I think there are vitally important areas of common concern which unite them in this Age of ConfusionWith the world torn between senseless violence and vulgar frivolity it is critically necessary that representatives of the great religions meet to exchange insights and to seek to understand each other more deeplyCooperation between the great religions is certainly necessary if they are to contribute a meaningful voice towards the solution of the momentous spiritual dilemmas that confront usHere I will mention several challenges that confront the major religious traditions today and I will also sketch very briefly the ways such challenges may be met from within the horizons of the religion which I follow Theravada BuddhismI leave it to the Christian scholars involved in this dialogue to decide for themselves whether these points are of sufficient gravity to merit their own attention and to work out solutions from the perspective of their own faithThe first challenge I will discuss is primarily philosophical in scope though with profound and farreaching practical implicationsThis is the task of overcoming the fundamental dichotomy which scientific materialism has posited between the realm of real fact ie impersonal physical processes and the realm of valueBy assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity the materialistic world view as I mentioned earlier threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for moralityThe result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness todayTo counter this tendency I do not think mere moral exhortation is sufficientIf morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct it cannot be propounded as a selfjustifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal orderReligion must affirm in the clearest terms that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion not subjective superstructure but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of realityIn the Buddhas teaching the objective foundation for morality is the law of kamma and its corollary the teaching of rebirthAccording to the principle of kamma our intentional actions have a builtin potential for generating consequences for ourselves that correspond to the moral quality of the deedsOur deeds come to fruition sometimes in this life sometimes in future lives but in either case an inescapable impersonal law connects our actions to their fruits which rebound upon us exactly in the way we deserveThus our morally determinate actions are the building blocks of our destiny we must ultimately reap the fruits of our own deeds and by our moral choices and values we construct our happiness and suffering in this life and in future livesIn the Buddhas teaching the law of kamma is integral to the very dynamics of the universeThe Buddhist texts speak of five systems of cosmic law each perfectly valid within its own domain the laws of inorganic matter the laws of living organisms the laws of consciousness the laws of kamma or moral deeds and their fruits and the laws of spiritual developmentThe science that dominates the West has flourished through its exclusive attention to the first two systems of lawAs a Buddhist I would argue that a complete picture of actuality must take account of all five orders and that by arriving at such a complete picture we can restore moral and spiritual values to their proper place within the wholeA second challenge closely related to the first is to propose concrete guidelines to right conduct capable of lifting us from our morass of moral confusionWhile the first project I mentioned operates on the theoretical front this one is more immediately practical in scopeHere we are not so much concerned with establishing a valid foundation for morality as with determining exactly what guidelines to conduct are capable of promoting harmonious and peaceful relations between peopleOn this front I think that the unsurpassed guide to the ethical good is still the Five Precepts taught by BuddhismAccording to the Buddhist texts these precepts are not unique to the Buddha Sasana but constitute the universal principles of morality upheld in every culture dedicated to virtueThe Five Precepts can be considered in terms of both the actions they prohibit and the virtues they inculcateAt the present time I think it is necessary to place equal stress on both aspects of the precepts as the Buddha himself has done in the SuttasThese precepts areThe rule to abstain from stealing which implies honesty respect for the possessions of others and concern for the natural environmentThe rule to abstain from sexual misconduct which implies responsibility and commitment in ones marital and other interpersonal relationshipsThe rule to abstain from lying which implies a commitment to truth in dealing with othersThe rule to abstain from alcoholic drinks drugs and intoxicants which implies the virtues of sobriety and heedfulnessIn presenting the case for these precepts it should be shown that quite apart from their longterm karmic effect which is a matter of faith they conduce to peace and happiness for oneself right here and now as well as towards the welfare of those whom ones actions affectA third project for religion is to formulate on the basis of its fundamental doctrinal traditions an incisive diagnosis of the contemporary human conditionFrom the Buddhist perspective I think the analysis that the Buddha offered in his Four Noble Truths still remains perfectly validNot only does it need not the least revision or reinterpretation but the course of twentyfive centuries of world history and the presentday human situation only underscores its astuteness and relevanceThe core problem of human existence the First Truth announces is sufferingThe canonical texts enumerate different types of suffering  physical psychological and spiritual in the present age we should also highlight the enormous volume of social suffering that plagues vulnerable humanityThe cause of suffering according to the Second Truth lies nowhere else than in our own minds  in our craving and ignorance in the defilements of greed hatred and delusionThe solution to the problem is the subject of the Third Noble Truth which states that liberation from suffering must also be effected by the mind through the eradication of the defilements responsible for sufferingAnd the Fourth Truth gives us the method to eradicate the defilements the Noble Eightfold Path with its three stages of training in moral discipline meditation and wisdomThe next point is a practical extension of the thirdOnce a religion has offered us a diagnosis of the human condition which reveals the source of suffering in the mind it must offer us concrete guidance in the task of training and mastering the mindThus I think that a major focus of presentday religion must be the understanding and transformation of the mindThis requires experiential disciplines by which we can arrive at deeper insight into ourselves and gradually effect very fundamental inward changesBuddhism provides a vast arsenal of timetested teachings and methods for meeting this challengeIt contains comprehensive systems of psychological analysis and potent techniques of meditation that can generate experiential confirmation of its principlesIn the present age access to these teachings and practices will cease to remain the exclusive preserve of the monastic order but will spread to the lay community as well as has already been occurring throughout the Buddhist world both in the East and in the WestThe spirit of democracy and the triumph of the experimental method demand that the means of minddevelopment be available to anyone who is willing to make the effortThe experiential dimension of religion is an area where Christianity can learn a great deal from Buddhism and I believe that Christianity must rediscover its own contemplative heritage and make available deeper transformative disciplines to both its clergy and its lay followers if it is to retain its relevance to humanity in the futureThe last challenge I will discuss is the need for religions to reaffirm and to actively demonstrate those values that are particularly critical for the human race to attain the status of an integrative harmonious communityThey must translate into concrete programs of action the great virtues of love and compassionBecause the world has become more closely knit than ever before we have to recognize the enormous responsibility that we each bear for the welfare of the wholeWhat all religions need to stress in the face of so much cruelty and violence is the development of a sense of global responsibility a concern for the welfare and happiness of all living beings as well as for the protection of our natural environmentLove and compassion must issue forth in active endeavor to alleviate the sufferings of others and to ensure that the oppressed and afflicted are granted all the opportunities that have hitherto been denied themThis is an area where Christianity with its Social Gospel has shown far greater initiative than Buddhism which too often has subscribed to a false fatalistic interpretation of the karma doctrine that stifles social actionBut the foundation for a socially oriented expression of Buddhism is already found in the Dhamma especially in its formula of the four Brahma Viharas or Divine Abodes as the ideal social virtues loving kindness towards all beings compassion for those who suffer altruistic joy for those who are well and equanimity as freedom from arbitrary discriminationAlready a socially engaged form of Buddhism has emerged and no doubt it will become an important development in the future of the religionI wish to conclude this talk by drawing attention to the fact that religion today has two crucial tasks to accomplish in responding to the vital problems of our timeOne is to help the individual fathom the ultimate truth about his or her own personal existence to move in the direction of the Ultimate Good the Unconditioned Reality wherein true liberation is to be foundThe other task is to address the problem of the Manifest Good the problem of the human community of promoting peace harmony and fellowshipThe urgency of combining these two tasks was beautifully summed up by the Buddha in a short discourse in the Satipatthana SamyuttaThere the Blessed One saidHe then explains that the expression protecting oneself one protects others refers to the practice of meditation which purifies the mind of its defilements and gives insight into the real nature of the worldBy protecting others one protects oneself he means the development of the virtues of patience loving kindness and compassion by which one safeguards others from harm and sufferingI believe that a commitment to these two great principles  pañña and karuna in Buddhist terms gnosis and love in Christian terms  is essential if religion today is to guide humanity from the brink of darkness and despair to the realm of spiritual light and freedomQuite contradictory views have been expressed in Western literature on the attitude of Buddhism toward the concept of God and godsFrom a study of the discourses of the Buddha preserved in the Pali canon it will be seen that the idea of a personal deity a creator god conceived to be eternal and omnipotent is incompatible with the Buddhas teachingsOn the other hand conceptions of an impersonal godhead of any description such as worldsoul etc are excluded by the Buddhas teachings on Anatta nonself or unsubstantialityIn Buddhist literature the belief in a creator god is frequently mentioned and rejected along with other causes wrongly adduced to explain the origin of the world as for instance worldsoul time nature etcGodbelief however is placed in the same category as those morally destructive wrong views which deny the kammic results of action assume a fortuitous origin of man and nature or teach absolute determinismThese views are said to be altogether pernicious having definite bad results due to their effect on ethical conductTheism however is regarded as a kind of kammateaching in so far as it upholds the moral efficacy of actionsHence a theist who leads a moral life may like anyone else doing so expect a favorable rebirthHe may possibly even be reborn in a heavenly world that resembles his own conception of it though it will not be of eternal duration as he may have expectedIf however fanaticism induces him to persecute those who do not share his beliefs this will have grave consequences for his future destinyFor fanatical attitudes intolerance and violence against others create unwholesome kamma leading to moral degeneration and to an unhappy rebirthAlthough belief in God does not exclude a favorable rebirth it is a variety of eternalism a false affirmation of permanence rooted in the craving for existence and as such an obstacle to final deliveranceAmong the fetters that bind to existence theism is particularly subject to those of personalitybelief attachment to rites and rituals and desire for finematerial existence or for a heaven of the sense sphere as the case may beAs an attempt at explaining the universe its origin and mans situation in his world the Godidea was found entirely unconvincing by the Buddhist thinkers of oldThrough the centuries Buddhist philosophers have formulated detailed arguments refuting the doctrine of a creator godIt should be of interest to compare these with the ways in which Western philosophers have refuted the theological proofs of the existence of GodBut for an earnest believer the Godidea is more than a mere device for explaining external facts like the origin of the worldFor him it is an object of faith that can bestow a strong feeling of certainty not only as to Gods existence somewhere out there but as to Gods consoling presence and closeness to himselfThis feeling of certainty requires close scrutinySuch scrutiny will reveal that in most cases the Godidea is only the devotees projection of his ideal  generally a noble one  and of his fervent wish and deeply felt need to believeThese projections are largely conditioned by external influences such as childhood impressions education tradition and social environmentCharged with a strong emotional emphasis brought to life by mans powerful capacity for imageformation visualization and the creation of myth they then come to be identified with the images and concepts of whatever religion the devotee followsIn the case of many of the most sincere believers a searching analysis would show that their Godexperience has no more specific content than thisYet the range and significance of Godbelief and Godexperience are not fully exhausted by the preceding remarksThe lives and writings of the mystics of all great religions bear witness to religious experiences of great intensity in which considerable changes are effected in the quality of consciousnessProfound absorption in prayer or meditation can bring about a deepening and widening a brightening and intensifying of consciousness accompanied by a transporting feeling of rapture and blissThe contrast between these states and normal conscious awareness is so great that the mystic believes his experience to be manifestations of the divine and given the contrast this assumption is quite understandableMystical experiences are also characterized by a marked reduction or temporary exclusion of the multiplicity of senseperceptions and restless thoughts and this relative unification of mind is then interpreted as a union or communion with the One GodAll these deeply moving impressions and the first spontaneous interpretations the mystic subsequently identifies with his particular theologyIt is interesting to note however that the attempts of most great Western mystics to relate their mystical experiences to the official dogmas of their respective churches often resulted in teachings which were often looked upon askance by the orthodox if not considered downright hereticalThe psychological facts underlying those religious experiences are accepted by the Buddhist and wellknown to him but he carefully distinguishes the experiences themselves from the theological interpretations imposed upon themAfter rising from deep meditative absorption the Buddhist meditator is advised to view the physical and mental factors constituting his experience in the light of the three characteristics of all conditioned existence impermanency liability to suffering and absence of an abiding ego or eternal substanceThis is done primarily in order to utilize the meditative purity and strength of consciousness for the highest purpose liberating insightBut this procedure also has a very important sideeffect which concerns us here the meditator will not be overwhelmed by any uncontrolled emotions and thoughts evoked by his singular experience and will thus be able to avoid interpretations of that experience not warranted by the factsHence a Buddhist meditator while benefiting by the refinement of consciousness he has achieved will be able to see these meditative experiences for what they are and he will further know that they are without any abiding substance that could be attributed to a deity manifesting itself to the mindTherefore the Buddhists conclusion must be that the highest mystic states do not provide evidence for the existence of a personal God or an impersonal godheadBuddhism has sometimes been called an atheistic teaching either in an approving sense by freethinkers and rationalists or in a derogatory sense by people of theistic persuasionOnly in one way can Buddhism be described as atheistic namely in so far as it denies the existence of an eternal omnipotent God or godhead who is the creator and ordainer of the worldThe word atheism however like the word godless frequently carries a number of disparaging overtones or implications which in no way apply to the Buddhas teachingThose who use the word atheism often associate it with a materialistic doctrine that knows nothing higher than this world of the senses and the slight happiness it can bestowBuddhism is nothing of that sortIn this respect it agrees with the teachings of other religions that true lasting happiness cannot be found in this world nor the Buddha adds can it be found on any higher plane of existence conceived as a heavenly or divine world since all planes of existence are impermanent and thus incapable of giving lasting blissThe spiritual values advocated by Buddhism are directed not towards a new life in some higher world but towards a state utterly transcending the world namely NibbanaIn making this statement however we must point out that Buddhist spiritual values do not draw an absolute separation between the beyond and the here and nowThey have firm roots in the world itself for they aim at the highest realization in this present existenceAlong with such spiritual aspirations Buddhism encourages earnest endeavor to make this world a better place to live inThe materialistic philosophy of annihilationism is emphatically rejected by the Buddha as a false doctrineThe doctrine of kamma is sufficient to prove that Buddhism does not teach annihilation after deathIt accepts survival not of an eternal soul but of a mental process subject to renewed becoming thus it teaches rebirth without transmigrationAgain the Buddhas teaching is not a nihilism that gives suffering humanity no better hope than a final cold nothingnessOn the contrary it is a teaching of salvation or deliverance which attributes to man the faculty to realize by his own efforts the highest goal Nibbana the ultimate cessation of suffering and the final eradication of greed hatred and delusionNibbana is far from being the blank zero of annihilation yet it also cannot be identified with any form of Godidea as it is neither the origin nor the immanent ground or essence of the worldBuddhism is not an enemy of religion as atheism is believed to beBuddhism indeed is the enemy of noneA Buddhist will recognize and appreciate whatever ethical spiritual and cultural values have been created by Godbelief in its long and checkered historyWe cannot however close our eyes to the fact that the Godconcept has served too often as a cloak for mans will to power and the reckless and cruel use of that power thus adding considerably to the ample measure of misery in this world supposed to be an allloving Gods creationFor centuries free thought free research and the expression of dissident views were obstructed and stifled in the name of service to GodAnd alas these and other negative consequences are not yet entirely things of the pastThe word atheism also carries the innuendo of an attitude countenancing moral laxity or a belief that manmade ethics having no divine sanction rest on shaky foundationsFor Buddhism however the basic moral law is inherent in life itselfIt is a special case of the law of cause and effect needing neither a divine lawgiver nor depending upon the fluctuating human conceptions of socially conditioned minor moralities and conventionsFor an increasing section of humanity the belief in God is breaking down rapidly as well as the accustomed motivations for moral conductThis shows the risk of basing moral postulates on divine commandments when their alleged source rapidly loses credence and authorityThere is a need for an autonomous foundation for ethics one that has deeper roots than a social contract and is capable of protecting the security of the individual and of human institutionsBuddhism offers such a foundation for ethicsBuddhism does not deny that there are in the universe planes of existence and levels of consciousness which in some ways may be superior to our terrestrial world and to average human consciousnessTo deny this would indeed be provincial in this age of space travelBertrand Russell rightly says It is improbable that the universe contains nothing better than ourselvesYet according to Buddhist teachings such higher planes of existence like our familiar world are subject to the law of impermanence and changeThe inhabitants of such worlds may well be in different degrees more powerful than human beings happier and longerlivedWhether we call those superior beings gods deities devas or angels is of little importance since it is improbable that they call themselves by any of those namesThey are inhabitants of this universe fellowwanderers in this round of existence and though more powerful they need not be wiser than manFurther it need not be denied that such worlds and such beings may have their lord and rulerIn all probability they doBut like any human ruler a divine ruler too might be inclined to misjudge his own status and power until a greater one comes along and points out to him his error as our texts report of the BuddhaThese however are largely matters beyond the range and concern of average human experienceThey have been mentioned here chiefly for the purpose of defining the Buddhist position and not to serve as a topic of speculation and argumentSuch involvement can only divert attention and effort from what ought to be our principal object the overcoming of greed hatred and delusion where they are found in the here and nowAn ancient verse ascribed to the Buddha in the Questions of King Milinda saysThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseTo present to the reading public a treatise on Buddhist meditation needs no word of apology todayIn wide circles of the West Buddhist meditation is no longer regarded as a matter of purely academic or exotic interestUnder the stress and complexity of modern life the need for mental and spiritual regeneration is now widely felt and in the field of the minds methodical development the value of Buddhist meditation has been recognized and tested by manyIt is in particular the Buddhas Way of Mindfulness that has been found invaluable because it is adaptable to and beneficial in widely different conditions of lifeThe present treatise is based on this method of cultivating mindfulness and awareness which ultimately aims at the minds final liberation from greed hatred and delusionThe author of this treatise the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw is a Buddhist monk of contemporary Burma and an eminent meditation masterA brief sketch of his life is included in this volumeThe path of meditation described in these pages was and still is taught by him in his meditation center called Thathana Yeiktha in Rangoon and is also set forth in his lectures and books in the Burmese languageThe framework of the treatise is provided by the classical seven stages of purification just as in Acariya Buddhaghosas famous VisuddhimaggaOn gradually reaching these stages various phases of insight knowledge are developed leading on to the stages of ultimate liberationThe approach followed is that of bare insight where by direct observation ones own bodily and mental processes are seen with increasing clarity as being impermanent liable to suffering and without a self or soulThe meditational practice begins with a few selected subjects of bodycontemplation which are retained up to the very end of the roadWith the gradually increasing strength of mindfulness and concentration the range widens and the vision deepens until the insight knowledges unfold themselves in due order as a natural outcome of the practiceThis approach to the ultimate goal of Buddhist meditation is called bare insight because insight into the three characteristics of existence is made use of exclusively here dispensing with the prior development of full concentrative absorptionNevertheless and it hardly needs mention here too a high degree of mental concentration is required for perseverance in the practice for attaining to insight knowledge and for reaping its fruitsAs stated in the treatise itself it is not the authors purpose to give a detailed introduction to the practice for the use of beginnersThe foremost concern in this work is with a stage where after diligent preliminary practice the insight knowledges have begun to emerge leading up to the highest crest of spiritual achievement arahantshipOf the basic exercises the treatise gives only a brief indication at the beginning of Chapter Detailed instruction about these may be gathered by the student from the authors Practical Insight Meditation or the translators book The Heart of Buddhist MeditationAlso a knowledge of the Buddhas original Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness will be indispensableThis treatise was first written in the Burmese language and later in a Pali version of it was composed by the authorAs the treatise deals chiefly with the advanced stages of the practice it was originally not intended for publicationHandwritten or typed copies of the Burmese or Pali version were given only to those who with some measure of success had concluded a strict course of practice at the meditation centerFor the use of meditators from foreign countries only a few cyclostyled sheets in English briefly describing the phases of insight knowledge were issued instead of the treatise itselfThis was done to enable the meditator to identify his personal experience with one or other of the stages described so that he might direct his further progress accordingly without being diverted or misled by any secondary phenomena that may have appeared during his practiceIn the Venerable Author agreed to a printed edition of the Pali version in Burmese script and after this first publication he also permitted at the translators request the issue of an English versionHe had the great kindness to go carefully through the draft translation and the Notes with the linguistic help of an experienced Burmese lay meditator U Pe Thin who for many years had ably served as an interpreter for meditators from foreign countriesThe translators gratitude is due to both his Venerable Meditation Master the author and to U Pe ThinHomage to Him the Great Omniscient Sage Who spread the net of rays of His Good LawThese rays of His Good Law  His very message true  Long may they shed their radiance oer the worldThis treatise explains the progress of insight together with the corresponding stages of purificationIt has been written in brief for the benefit of meditators who have obtained distinctive results in their practice so that they may more easily understand their experienceIt is meant for those who in their practice of insight have taken up as their main subject either the tactile bodily process of motion evident in the rising and falling movement of the abdomen or the tactile bodily process based on three of the primary elements of matter evident in the sensation of touchIt is meant for those who by attending to these exercises have gained progressive insight as well into the whole bodyandmind process arising at the six sense doors and have finally come to see the Dhamma to attain to the Dhamma to understand the Dhamma to penetrate the Dhamma who have passed beyond doubt freed themselves from uncertainty obtained assurance and achieved independence of others in the Masters dispensationPurification of conduct means here in the case of male and female devotees the acceptance of the precepts and the proper guarding and protecting of their observance  whether it be the Five Precepts the Eight Uposatha Precepts or the Ten PreceptsIn the case of bhikkhus purification of conduct is the wellkept purity of the fourfold conduct incumbent upon monks beginning with restraint according to the disciplinary rules of bhikkhus called the PatimokkhaOf that fourfold conduct the restraint according to the Patimokkha rules is of first importance because only when that restraint is pure will one be able to accomplish the development of meditationThere are two kinds of meditation development tranquillity and insightA person who of these two has first developed tranquillity and after having established himself in either access concentration or full concentration subsequently contemplates the five groups of grasping is called a samathayanika one who has tranquillity as his vehicleAs to his method of attaining insight the Papañcasudani commenting on the Dhammadayada Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya says Herein a certain person first produces access concentration or full concentration this is tranquillityHe then applies insight to that concentration and to the mental states associated with it seeing them as impermanent etc this is insight In the Visuddhimagga too it is said He whose vehicle is tranquillity should first emerge from any finematerial or immaterial jhana except the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he should then discern according to characteristic function etc the jhana factors consisting of applied thought etc and the mental states associated with themHe however who has neither produced access concentration nor full concentration but from the very start applies insight to the five groups of grasping is called suddhavipassanayanika one who has pure insight as his vehicle As to his method of attaining insight it is said in the same Commentary to the Dhammadayada Sutta There is another person who even without having produced the aforesaid tranquillity applies insight to the five groups of grasping seeing them as impermanent etc In the Visuddhimagga too it is said thus One who has pure insight as his vehicle contemplates the four elementsIn the Susimaparibbajaka Sutta of the Nidanavagga Samyutta too it is said by the Buddha First arises the knowledge comprehending the actual happening of things and afterwards arises the knowledge realizing NibbanaWhen purification of conduct has been established the meditator who has chosen pure insight as his vehicle should endeavor to contemplate the bodyandmindIn doing so he should contemplate according to their characteristics the five groups of grasping that is the bodily and mental processes that become evident to him in his own lifecontinuityInsight must in fact be developed by noticing according to their specific and general characteristics the bodily and mental processes that become evident at the six sense doorsAt the beginning however it is difficult to follow and to notice clearly all bodily and mental processes that incessantly appear at the six sense doorsTherefore the meditator who is a beginner should first notice the perfectly distinct process of touch perceived through the door of bodily sensitivity because the Visuddhimagga says that in insight meditation one should take up what is distinctWhen sitting there occurs the bodily process of touch by way of the sitting posture and through touch sensitivity in the bodyThese processes of tactile sensitivity should be noticed as Sitting  touching  and so forth in due successionFurther at the seated meditators abdomen the tactile process of bodily motion which has breathing as its condition is perceptible continuously as the rise and fall of the abdomenThat too should be noticed as rising falling and so forthWhile the meditator is thus engaged in noticing the element of motion which impinges continuously on the door of bodily sensitivity in the abdomen it becomes evident to him in its aspects of stiffening of vibrating and of pushing and pullingHere the aspect of stiffening shows the motion elements characteristic nature of supporting the aspect of vibrating shows its essential function of movement and the aspect of pushing and pulling shows its manifestation of impellingHence the meditator noticing the tactile bodily process of rise and fall of the abdomen accomplishes the observation of the bodily process by getting to know the characteristic nature etc of the element of motionLater when he has accomplished the observation of mind and the observation of both body and mind he will also come to know the general characteristics of the processes concerned  their impermanence liability to suffering and their being void of a selfBut while he is engaged in just noticing the rising and falling of the abdomen and other tactile processes there will appear thoughts of desire etc feelings of pleasure etc or acts such as adjusting various parts of the bodyAt that time these activities must be noticed tooAfter noticing them he should turn again to the continuous noticing of the tactile process of the rising and falling of the abdomen which is the basic object of mindfulness in this practiceThis is a brief sketch of the methodical practice of insightIt is not the place here to treat it in detail because this is a brief essay on the progress of insight through the stages of purification it is not a treatise explaining in detail the methodical practice of insightDuring the early part of the methodical practice as long as the meditators mind is not yet fully purified wandering thoughts arisen by his thinking of objects of sense desire etc will also appear intermittently between thoughts of noticingSometimes the beginning meditator will perceive occurrence and sometimes he will notBut even if he perceives them it will be only after a short time has elapsed after their appearanceFor then the momentary concentration of his mind is still very tender and weakSo these wandering thoughts continue to hinder his mind while it is occupied in developing the practice of noticingHence these wandering thoughts are called hindering thoughtsWhen however the momentary concentration of his mind has become strong the thought process of noticing becomes well concentratedHence when attending to the objects to be noticed  the abdominal movement sitting touching bending stretching seeing hearing etc his noticing thoughts now appear as if falling upon these objects as if striking at them as if confronting them again and againThen as a rule his mind will no longer go elsewhereOnly occasionally and in a slight degree will this happen and even in those cases he will be able to notice any such stray thought at its very arising as expressed in common speech or to be exact he will notice the stray thought immediately after its actual arisingThen that stray thought will subside as soon as it is noticed and will not arise againImmediately afterwards he will also be able to resume continuous noticing of any object as it becomes evident to himThat is why his mind at that time is called unhinderedWhile the meditator is thus practicing the exercise of noticing with unhindered mind the noticing mind will close in upon and fix on whatever object is being noticed and the act of noticing will proceed without breakAt that time there arises in him in uninterrupted succession the concentration of mind lasting for a moment directed to each object noticedThis is called purification of mindThough that concentration has only momentary duration its power of resistance to being overwhelmed by opposition corresponds to that of access concentrationIn the Commentary to the Visuddhimagga in the explanation of the chapter relating to mindfulness of breathing it is said thus  Momentary unification of mind means the concentration of mind lasting only for a momentFor that too when it occurs uninterruptedly with its respective object in a single mode and is not overcome by opposition fixes the mind immovably as if in absorptionIt occurs uninterruptedly with its respective object refers to the uninterrupted continuity of the thoughts engaged in noticing after noticing one object one attends in the same manner to another that follows immediately again having noticed that object one turns to the next one and so onIn a single mode means though the objects to be noticed as they present themselves are numerous and varied yet the force of concentration of the mind uninterruptedly engaged in noticing remains virtually on the same levelFor what is meant here is just as the first object was noticed with a certain degree of concentration so the second third and other subsequent objects are noticed in each case with the same degree of concentrationIs not overcome by opposition this means that the momentary concentration in its uninterrupted flow is not overwhelmed by the mental hindrancesAs if in absorption this means that the strength of the momentary concentration is similar to that of concentration which has reached full mental absorptionHowever such similarity of momentary concentration with fully absorbed concentration will become evident when the methodical practice of insight reaches its culminationBut is it not said in the Commentaries that the term purification of mind applies only to access concentration and fully absorbed concentrationThat is true but one has to take this statement in the sense that momentary concentration is included in access concentrationFor in the Commentary to the Satipatthana Sutta it is said The remaining twelve exercises are subjects of meditation leading only to Access Concentration Now in the case of the subjects dealt with in the sections of the Satipatthana Sutta on postures clear comprehension and elements the concentration of one who devotes himself to these exercises will be definitely only momentary concentrationBut as the latter is able to suppress the hindrances just as access concentration does and since it is the neighbourhood of the noblepath attainment concentration therefore that same momentary concentration is spoken of by the name of access and also the meditation subjects that produce that momentary concentration are called meditation subjects leading to access concentration Hence it should be understood that momentary concentration having the capacity to suppress the hindrances has also the right to the name access and purification of mind Otherwise purification of mind could not come about in one who has made bare insight his vehicle by employing only insight without having produced either access concentration or fully absorbed concentrationEndowed with purification of mind and continuing the practice of noticing the meditator now comes to know bodyandmind analytically as follows The rising of the abdomen is one process the falling is another sitting is another touching is another etcIn this way he comes to know how to distinguish each bodily process that he noticesFurther he realizes The knowing of the rising movement is one process the knowing of the falling movement is another In that way he comes to know each mental act of noticingFurther he realizes The rising movement is one process the knowing of it is anotherThe falling movement is one process the knowing of it is another and so onIn that way he comes to know how to distinguish each bodily and mental processAll that knowledge comes from simply noticing not from reasoning that is to say it is knowledge by direct experience arrived at by the mere act of noticing and not knowledge derived from ratiocinationThus when seeing a visual object with the eye the meditator knows how to distinguish each single factor involved The eye is one the visual object is another seeing is another and knowing it is another The same manner applies in the case of the other sense functionsFor at the time in each act of noticing the meditator comes to know analytically the mental processes of noticing and those of thinking and reflecting knowing them for himself through direct knowledge by his experience thus They have the nature of going towards an object inclining towards an object cognizing an object On the other hand he knows analytically the material processes going on in the whole body  which are here described as the rising and falling movements of the abdomen sitting etc knowing them thus These have not the nature of going or inclining towards an object or of cognizing an object Such knowing is called knowing matter by its manifestation of nondetermining For it is said in the MulaTika the Principal Subcommentary to the Abhidhamma Vibhanga In other words nondetermining should be understood as having no faculty of cognizing an objectSuch knowledge as this which analyzes in each act of noticing both the bodily process noticed and the mental process engaged in noticing according to their true essential nature is called analytical knowledge of body and mindWhen that knowledge has come to maturity the meditator understands thus At the moment of breathing in there is just the rising movement of the abdomen and the knowing of the movement but there is no self besides at the moment of breathing out there is just the falling movement of the abdomen and the knowing of the movement but there is no self besides Understanding it thus in these and other instances he knows and sees for himself by noticing thus There is here only that pair a material process as object and a mental process of knowing it and it is to that pair alone that the terms of conventional usage being person or soul I or another man or woman referBut apart from that dual process there is no separate person or being I or another man or womanThis is called purification of viewWhen purification of view has come to maturity the conditions necessary for the bodily and mental processes observed will also become evidentFirstly the consciousness that is the condition of the bodily process will be evidentHowFor instance when bending the arms or legs the consciousness intending to bend these limbs is evidentSo the meditator first notices that consciousness and next he notices the act of bending and so onThen he understands by direct experience When there is consciousness intending to bend a limb the bodily process of bending arises when there is consciousness intending to stretch a limb the bodily process of stretching arises And in the same way he understands other instances too by direct experienceAgain he also understands by direct experience the condition for the mental process in the following manner In the case of consciousness desirous of running off the track there arises first a corresponding consciousness giving initial attentionIf that consciousness is not noticed then there arises a consciousness that runs off the trackBut if the consciousness of initial attention to the distracting object is noticed and known no stray thought will ariseIt is similar in the case of otherWhen both the sense door of the eye and a visual object are present there arises visual consciousness otherwise visual consciousness will not arise and so it is in the case of the other sense doorsIf there is a noticeable or recognizable object then there arises consciousness engaged in noticing or thinking or reasoning or understanding as the case may be otherwise no such consciousness arisesSimilarly he understands what occurs in every other instanceAt that time the meditator will generally experience many different painful feelings arising in his bodyNow while one of these feelings is being noticed another feeling will arise elsewhere and while that is being noticed again another will appear elsewhereThus the meditator follows each feeling as it arises and notices itBut though he is engaged in noticing these feelings as they arise he will only perceive their initial phase of arising and not their final phase of dissolutionAlso many mental images of various shapes will then appearThe shape of a dagoba a monk a man a house a tree a park a heavenly mansion a cloud and many other such images will appearHere too while the meditator is still engaged in noticing one of these mental images another will show itself while still noticing that yet another will appearFollowing thus the mental images as they arise he goes on noticing themBut though he is engaged in noticing them he will perceive only their initial phase not the final phaseHe now understands Consciousness arises in accordance with each object that becomes evidentIf there is an object there arises consciousness if there is no object no consciousness arisesBetween sequences of noticing he also by considering inferentially comes to know thus It is due to the presence of such causes and conditions as ignorance craving kamma etc that bodyandmind continueSuch discernment through direct experience and through inference as described when noticing bodyandmind with their conditions is called knowledge of discerning conditionalityWhen that knowledge has come to maturity the meditator perceives only bodyandmind processes occurring in strict accordance with their particular and appropriate conditions and he comes to the conclusion Here is only a conditioning bodyandmind process and a conditioned bodyandmind processApart from these there is no person who performs the bending of the limbs etc or who experiences feelings of pain etcThis is called purification by overcoming doubtWhen this purification by overcoming doubt has reached maturity the meditator will discern distinctly the initial middle and final phases of any object noticed by himThen in the case of various objects noticed he will discern distinctly that only after each earlier process has ceased does there arise a subsequent processFor instance only when the rising movement of the abdomen has come to an end does there arise the falling movement only when that has ended is there again a rising movementSo also in the case of walking only when the lifting of the foot has come to an end does there arise the carrying forward of the foot only when that has been completed does there follow the placing of the foot on the groundIn the case of painful feelings only after each single feeling occurring at its particular place has ceased will another new feeling arise at another placeOn noticing the respective painful feeling repeatedly twice thrice or more the meditator will see that it gradually grows less and at last ceases entirelyIn the case of the variously shaped images that enter the minds field it is only after each single image noticed has vanished that another new object will come into the minds focusOn noticing them attentively twice thrice or more he will see well that these mental objects which are being noticed move from one place to another or they become gradually smaller and less distinct until at last they disappear entirelyThe meditator however does not perceive anything that is permanent and lasting or free from destruction and disappearanceSeeing how each object even while being noticed comes to destruction and disappearance the meditator comprehends it as impermanent in the sense of undergoing destructionHe further comprehends it as suffering in the sense of breaking up after each arisingHaving seen how various painful feelings arise in continuous succession  how if one painful feeling ceases another arises and when that has ceased again another arises  having seen that he comprehends the respective objects as just a conglomeration of sufferingFurther he comprehends the object as consisting of mere impersonal phenomena without a master in the sense of not arising of themselves but arising subject to conditions and then breaking upThis comprehension of an object noticed as being impermanent painful and without a self through knowing its nature of impermanency etc by means of simply noticing without reflecting and reasoning is called knowledge by comprehension through direct experienceHaving thus seen the three characteristics once or several times by direct experience the meditator by inference from the direct experience of those objects noticed comprehends all bodily and mental processes of the past present and future and the whole world by coming to the conclusion They too are in the same way impermanent painful and without a self This is called knowledge of comprehension by inferenceAlluding to this very knowledge it is said in the Patisambhidamagga Whatever there is of materiality past present or future internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all materiality he defines as impermanentThat is one kind of comprehension and so onAlso in the Commentary to the Kathavatthu it is said Even if the impermanence of only a single formation is known there may be consideration of the rest by induction thus All formations are impermanent The words All formations are impermanent refer to an understanding by induction and not to an understanding by perceiving a object at the same momentAlso in the Commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya it is said Because in the case of the realm of neitherperceptionnornonperception the insight into the sequence of mental factors belongs to the Buddhas alone and not to the disciples he said thus thereby indicating the insight by groups When the meditator in the exercise of noticing is able to keep exclusively to the present bodyandmind process without looking back to past processes or ahead to future ones then as a result of insight a brilliant light will appear to himTo one it will appear like the light of a lamp to others like a flash of lightning or like the radiance of the moon or the sun and so onWith one it may last for just one moment with others it may last longerThere will also arise in him strong mindfulness pertaining to insightAs a result all the successive arisings of bodily and mental processes will present themselves to the consciousness engaged in noticing as if coming to it of themselves and mindfulness too seems as if alighting on the processes of itselfTherefore the meditator then believes There is no bodyandmind process in which mindfulness fails to engageHis knowledge consisting in insight here called noticing will be likewise keen strong and lucidConsequently he will discern clearly and in separate forms all the bodily and mental processes noticed as if cutting to pieces a bamboo sprout with a wellsharpened knifeTherefore the meditator then believes There is no bodyandmind process that cannot be noticed When examining the characteristics of impermanence etc or other aspects of reality he understands everything quite clearly and at once and he believes it to be the knowledge derived from direct experienceFurther strong faith pertaining to insight arises in himUnder its influence the meditators mind when engaged in noticing or thinking is serene and without any disturbance and when he is engaged in recollecting the virtues of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha his mind quite easily gives itself over to themThere arise in him the wish to proclaim the Buddhas Teaching joyous confidence in the virtues of those engaged in meditation the desire to advise dear friends and relatives to practice meditation grateful remembrance of the help received from his meditation master his spiritual mentor etcThese and many other similar mental processes will occurThere arises also rapture in its five grades beginning with minor raptureWhen purification of mind is gained that rapture begins to appear by causing gooseflesh tremor in the limbs etc and now it produces a sublime feeling of happiness and exhilaration filling the whole body with an exceedingly sweet and subtle thrillUnder its influence he feels as if the whole body had risen up and remained in the air without touching the ground or as if it were seated on an air cushion or as if it were floating up and downThere arises tranquillity of mind with the characteristic of quietening the disturbances of consciousness and its mental concomitants and along with it appear mental agility etcWhen walking standing sitting or reclining there is under the influence of these mental qualities no disturbance of consciousness and its mental concomitants nor heaviness rigidity unwieldiness sickness or crookednessRather his consciousness and its mental concomitants are tranquil through having reached the supreme relief in nonactionThey are agile in always functioning swiftly they are pliant in being able to attend to any object desired they are wieldy in being able to attend to an object for any length of time desired they are quite lucid through their proficiency that is through the ease with which insight penetrates the object they are also straight through being directed inclined and turned only towards wholesome activitiesThere also arises a very sublime feeling of happiness suffusing all his bodyUnder its influence he becomes exceedingly joyous and he believes Now I am happy all the time or Now indeed I have found happiness never felt before and he wants to tell others of his extraordinary experienceWith reference to that rapture and happiness which are aided by the factors of tranquillity etc it was said Dhammapada vvThere arises in him energy that is neither too lax nor too tense but is vigorous and acts evenlyFor formerly his energy was sometimes lax and so he was overpowered by sloth and torpor hence he could not notice keenly and continuously the objects as they became evident and his understanding too was not clearAnd at other times his energy was too tense and so he was overpowered by agitation with the same result of being unable to notice keenly etcBut now his energy is neither too lax nor too tense but is vigorous and acts evenly and so overcoming these shortcomings of sloth torpor and agitation he is able to notice the objects present keenly and continuously and his understanding is quite clear tooThere also arises in him strong equanimity associated with insight which is neutral towards all formationsUnder its influence he regards with neutrality even his examination of the nature of these formations with respect to their being impermanent etc and he is able to notice keenly and continuously the bodily and mental processes arising at the timeThen his activity of noticing is carried on without effort and proceeds as it were of itselfAlso in adverting to the objects there arises in him strong equanimity by virtue of which his mind enters as it were quickly into the objects of advertenceThere arises further a subtle attachment of a calm nature that enjoys the insight graced with the brilliant light and the other qualities here describedThe meditator however is not able to discern it as a corruption but believes it to be just the very bliss of meditationSo meditators speak in praise of it thus Only now do I find full delight in meditationHaving felt such rapture and happiness accompanied by the brilliant light and enjoying the very act of perfect noticing which is ably functioning with ease and rapidity the meditator now believes Surely I must have attained to the supramundane path and fruitionNow I have finished the task of meditation This is mistaking what is not the path for the path and it is a corruption of insight which usually takes place in the manner just describedBut even if the meditator does not take the brilliant light and the other corruptions as an indication of the path and fruition still he feels delight in themThis is likewise a corruption of insightTherefore the knowledge consisting in noticing even if quick in its functioning is called the early stage of knowledge of arising and passing away if it is beset and corrupted by those corruptionsFor the same reason the meditator is at that time not in a position to discern quite distinctly the arising and passing away of bodily and mental processesWhile engaged in noticing the meditator either by himself or through instructions from someone else comes to this decision The brilliant light and the other things experienced by me are not the pathDelight in them is merely a corruption of insightThe practice of continuously noticing the object as it becomes evident  that alone is the way of insightI must go on with just the work of noticing This decision is called purification by knowledge and vision of what is path and notpathAfter noticing these manifestations of brilliant light and the others or after leaving them unheeded he goes on continuously as before with the act of noticing the bodily and mental processes as they become evident at the six sense doorsWhile thus engaged in noticing he gets over the corruptions relating to brilliant light rapture tranquillity happiness attachment etc and his knowledge remains concerned exclusively with the arising and passing away of the processes noticedFor then at each act of noticing he sees The noticed object having arisen disappears instantly It also becomes clear to him that each object disappears just where it arises it does not move on to another placeIn that way he understands by direct experience how bodily and mental processes arise and break up from moment to momentIt is such knowledge and understanding resulting from the continuous noticing of bodily and mental processes as they arise and dissolve moment after moment and the discernment in separate sections of the arising and passing away of each of them while being free from the corruptions that is called final knowledge of contemplation of arising and passing away This is the beginning of purification by knowledge and vision of the course of practice which starts from this insight and extends to adaptation knowledgeNoticing the bodily and mental processes as they arise he sees them part by part link by link piece by piece fraction by fraction Just now it arises just now it dissolves When that knowledge of arising and passing away becomes mature keen and strong it will arise easily and proceed uninterruptedly as if borne onward of itself also the bodily and mental processes will be easily discernibleWhen keen knowledge thus carries on and formations are easily discernible then neither the arising of each bodily and mental process nor its middle phase called presence nor the continuity of bodily and mental processes called occurrence as unbroken flux is apparent to him nor are the shape of the hand the foot the face the body and so on apparent to himBut what is apparent to him is only the ceasing of bodily and mental processes called vanishing or passing away or dissolutionFor instance while noticing the rising movement of the abdomen neither its initial nor middle phase is apparent but only the ceasing or vanishing which is called the final phase is apparent and so it is also with the falling movement of the abdomenAgain in the case of bending an arm or leg while noticing the act of bending neither the initial nor the middle phase of bending is apparent nor is the form of the limb apparent but only the final phase of ceasing and vanishing is apparentIt is similar in the other cases of stretching a limb and so onFor at that time each object that is being noticed seems to him to be entirely absent or to have become nonexistentConsequently at this stage of knowledge it seems to him as if he were engaged in noticing something which has already become absent or nonexistent by having vanished and the consciousness engaged in noticing appears to have lost contact with the object that is being noticedIt is for that reason that a meditator may here think I have lost the insight but he should not think soFor formerly his consciousness normally took delight in conceptual objects of shapes etc and even up to the knowledge of arising and passing away the idea of formations with their specific features was always apparent to himHence his mind took delight in a plainly distinguishable object consisting of formations with its particular structure and its particular featureideaBut now that his knowledge has developed in the way described no such idea of the formations features or structure appears to him still less any other cruder conceptAt such a stage the arising of formations that is the first phase of the process is not apparent but there is apparent only the dissolution that is the final phase having the nature of vanishingTherefore the meditators mind does not take delight in it at first but he may be sure that soon after becoming familiar his mind will delight in the cessation too which is called their dissolutionWith this assurance he should again turn to the practice of continuous noticingWhen thus engaged he perceives that in each act of noticing there are always present two factors an objective factor and a subjective one  the object noticed and the mental state of knowing it  which dissolve and vanish by pairs one pair after the otherFor in each single instance of a rising movement of the abdomen there are in fact numerous physical processes constituting the rising movement which are seen to dissolve seriallyIt is like seeing the continuous successive vanishing of a summer mirage moment by moment or it is like the quick and continuous bursting of bubbles produced in a heavy shower by thick rain drops falling on a water surface or it is like the quick successive extinction of oillamps or candles blown out by the wind as these lights are being offered at a shrine by devoteesSimilar to that appears the dissolving and vanishing moment by moment of the bodily processes noticedAnd the dissolution of consciousness noticing those bodily processes is apparent to him along with the dissolution of the bodily processesAlso while he is noticing other bodily and mental processes their dissolution too will be apparent to him in the same mannerConsequently the knowledge will come to him that whatever part of the whole body is noticed that object ceases first and after it the consciousness engaged in noticing that object follows in its wakeFrom that the meditator will understand very clearly in the case of each successive pair the dissolution of any object whatsoever and the dissolution of the consciousness noticing that very objectIt is the perfectly clear understanding of the dissolution of the two things pair by pair  that is of the visual or other object appearing at any of the six sense doors and of the consciousness noticing that very object  that is called knowledge of dissolutionWhen that knowledge of dissolution is mature there will gradually arise just by seeing the dissolution of all objectandsubjectformations awareness of fearfulness and other knowledges together with their respective aspects of fear and so onHaving seen how the dissolution of two things  that is any object noticed and the insightthought engaged in noticing it  takes place moment by moment the meditator also understands by inference that in the past too every conditioned thing has broken up in the same way that just so it will break up also in the future and that at the present it breaks up tooAnd just at the time of noticing any formations that are evident these formations will appear to him in their aspect of fearfulnessTherefore during the very act of noticing the meditator will also come to understand These formations are indeed fearfulSuch understanding of their fearfulness is called knowledge of the awareness of fearfulness it has also the name knowledge of fear At that time his mind itself is gripped by fear and seems helplessWhen he has realized the fearfulness through the knowledge of fear and keeps on noticing continuously then the knowledge of misery will arise in him before longWhen it has arisen all formations everywhere  whether among the objects noticed or among the states of consciousness engaged in noticing or in any kind of life or existence that is brought to mind  will appear insipid without a vitalizing factor and unsatisfyingSo he sees at that time only suffering only unsatisfactoriness only miseryTherefore this state is called knowledge of miserySeeing thus the misery in conditioned things his mind finds no delight in those miserable things but is entirely disgusted with themAt times his mind becomes as it were discontented and listlessEven so he does not give up the practice of insight but spends his time continuously engaging in itHe therefore should know that this state of mind is not dissatisfaction with meditation but is precisely the knowledge of disgust that has the aspect of being disgusted with the formationsEven if he directs his thought to the happiest sort of life and existence or to the most pleasant and desirable objects his mind will not take delight in them will find no satisfaction in themOn the contrary his mind will incline and lean and tend only towards NibbanaTherefore the following thought will arise in him between moments of noticing The ceasing of all formations that are dissolving from moment to moment  that alone is happinessWhen through this knowledge he feels disgust with regard to every formation noticed there will arise in him a desire to forsake these formations or to become delivered from themThe knowledge relating to that desire is called knowledge of desire for deliverance At that time usually various painful feelings arise in his body and also an unwillingness to remain long in one particular bodily postureEven if these states do not arise the comfortless nature of the formations will become more evident than everAnd due to that between moments of noticing he feels a longing thus Oh may I soon get free from thatOh may I reach the state where these formations ceaseOh may I be able to give up these formations completely At this juncture his consciousness engaged in noticing seems to shrink from the object noticed at each moment of noticing and wishes to escape from itBeing thus desirous of escaping from the formations the meditator makes stronger effort and continues the practice of noticing these very formations with the single purpose of forsaking them and escaping from themFor that reason the knowledge arising at that time is called knowledge of reobservation The term reobservation has the same meaning as renoticing or recontemplation Then the nature of the formations  their being impermanent suffering and without a self  will be clearly evident to him and among these three the aspect of suffering will be particularly distinctAt this stage too there will usually arise in his body various kinds of pains which are severe sharp and of growing intensityHence his whole bodily and mental system will seem to him like an unbearable mass of sickness or a conglomeration of sufferingAnd a state of restlessness will usually manifest itself making him incapable of keeping to one particular posture for any length of timeFor then he will not be able to hold any one position long but will soon want to change itThis state however simply manifests the unbearable nature of the formationsThough he wants to change his bodily posture still he should not give in easily to that wish but should endeavor to remain motionless for a longer period in the same posture and continue to carry on the practice of noticingBy doing so he will be able to overcome his restlessnessNow his insight knowledge is quite strong and lucid and by virtue of it even his painful feelings will at once cease as soon as they are firmly noticedEven if a painful feeling does not cease completely he will perceive that it is dissolving part by part from moment to momentThat is to say the ceasing vanishing and disappearing of each single moment of feeling will become apparent separately in each corresponding act of noticingIn other words now it will not be as it was at the time of the knowledge of comprehension when the constant flow or continuity of feelings of the same kind was apparent as a single unitBut if without abandoning the practice that feeling of pain is firmly and continuously noticed it will entirely cease before longWhen it ceases in that way it does so for good and will not arise againThough in that way the insight knowledge may have become strong and perfectly lucid still he is not satisfied with that muchHe will even think My insight knowledge is not clear He should however dismiss such thoughts by applying the act of noticing to them and he should go on with his task of continuously noticing the bodily and mental formations as they occurIf he perseveres thus his noticing will become more and more clear as the time passes in minutes hours and daysThen he will overcome the painful feelings and the restlessness in being unable to remain long in one particular posture and also the idea that his insight knowledge is not yet clear enoughHis noticing will then function rapidly and at every moment of noticing he will understand quite clearly any of the three characteristics of impermanence etcThis understanding of any of the three characteristics of impermanence etc through the act of noticing which functions with promptness in quick succession is called strong knowledge of reobservationWhen this knowledge of reobservation is mature there will arise knowledge perceiving evident bodily and mental processes in continuous succession quite naturally as if borne onward of itselfThis is called knowledge of equanimity about formationsNow in the act of noticing effort is no longer required to keep formations before the mind or to understand themAfter the completion of each single act of noticing the object to be noticed will then appear of itself and insight knowledge too will of itself notice and understand itIt is as if no further effort need be made by the meditatorFormerly owing to seeing the dissolution of formations there arose in successive order the aspect of fearfulness the perception of misery the aspect of disgust the desire for deliverance and dissatisfaction with the knowledge so far acquiredBut now these mental states no longer arise even though in the present state too the breaking up of formations which are dissolving more rapidly is closely perceivedEven if a painful feeling arises in the body no mental disturbance arises and there is no lack of fortitude in bearing itGenerally however at this stage pains will be entirely absent that is they do not arise at allEven if the meditator thinks about something fearful or sad no mental disturbance will arise be it in the form of fear or of sorrowThis firstly is the abandoning of fear at the stage of equanimity about formationsAt the earlier stage on attaining knowledge of arising and passing away great joy had arisen on account of the clarity of insightBut now this kind of joy does not arise even though there is present the exceedingly peaceful and sublime clarity of mind belonging to equanimity about formations Though he actually sees desirable objects conducive to joy or though he thinks about various enjoyable things no strong feeling of joy will ariseThis is the abandoning of delight at the stage of equanimity about formationsHe cherishes no desire nor hate with regard to any object desirable or undesirable that comes into the range of his sense doors but taking them as just the same in his act of noticing he understands themThis is equable vision at the stage of equanimity about formationsOf these three qualities just mentioned it is said in the Path of Purification Having discarded fear and delight he is impartial and neutral towards all formationsIf he resumes the practice of noticing with the thought Now I will do it vigorously again then before long the noticing will function efficiently as if borne onward of itselfFrom now onwards there is no need for the meditator to make further effortThough he does not make a effort his noticing will proceed in a continuous and steady flow for a long time it will go on even for two or three hours without interruptionThis is the state of longlasting  of equanimity about formationsReferring to this it is said in the Patisambhidamagga  The wisdom lasting long is the knowledge present in the mental states of equanimity about formations The Great Commentary to the Path of Purification explains as follows This is said with reference to knowledge functioning in a continuous flowNow when noticing functions spontaneously as if borne onward of itself the mind even if sent out towards a variety of objects generally refuses to go and even if it does go it will not stay long but will soon return to the usual object to be noticed and will resume continuous noticingIn this connection it was said He shrinks recoils and retreats he does not go forth to itSo through knowledge of equanimity about formations which is endowed with many virtues blessings and powers he notices the formations as they occurWhen this knowledge is mature having become keen strong and lucid on reaching its culmination point it will understand any of the formations as being impermanent or painful or without self just by seeing their dissolutionNow that act of noticing any one characteristic out of the three which is still more lucid in its perfect understanding manifests itself two or three times or more in rapid successionThis is called insight leading to emergenceThereupon immediately after the last consciousness in the series of acts of noticing belonging to this insight leading to emergence the meditators consciousness leaps forth into Nibbana which is the cessation of all formations taking it as its objectThen there appears to him the stilling of all formations called cessationThis mode of realization of Nibbana has been mentioned in many discourses of the Master for example The vision of truth arose whatsoever has the nature of arising is bound to cease Herein the words bound to cease indicate the aspect of realizing the stilling and ceasing of all formations which have the nature of arisingAlso in the Questions of King Milinda it is said His consciousness while carrying on the practice of bringing to mind passes beyond the continuous occurrence of phenomena and alights upon nonoccurrenceOne who having practiced in the correct manner has alighted upon nonoccurrence O king is said to have realized NibbanaThe meaning is this the meditator who wishes to realize Nibbana should repeatedly bring to mind through the practice of noticing every bodily and mental process that appears at any of the six sense doorsWhen he brings them to mind thus his consciousness engaged in noticing  here called bringing to mind  will until adaptation knowledge is reached fall at every moment upon the bodily and mental formations called here continuous occurrence because they go on occurring over and over again in an unbroken flow like a rivers currentBut in the last phase instead of falling upon that continuous occurrence consciousness passes beyond it and alights upon nonoccurrence which is the very opposite of the bodily and mental formations called here occurrence In other words it arrives at nonoccurrence that is to say it reaches as if it alights upon cessation which is the stilling of the formationsWhen the meditator having already before practiced correctly and without deviation by way of the knowledge of arising and passing away and the other knowledges has in this manner arrived at nonoccurrence he is said to have realized Nibbana He is called one who has made Nibbana a direct experience and has actually seen itHere the knowledge by way of noticing that occurs last in the series constituting insight leading to emergence is called knowledge of adaptationThis is the end of the purification by knowledge and vision of the course of practiceImmediately afterwards a type of knowledge manifests itself that as it were falls for the first time into Nibbana which is void of formations since it is the cessation of themThis knowledge is called maturity knowledgeIt is followed immediately by knowledge that abides in that same Nibbana which is void of formations since it is the cessation of themThis is called path knowledge It is also called purification by knowledge and visionThat again is immediately followed by knowledge that belongs to the final stage and continues in the course of its predecessorIt abides in that same Nibbana which is void of formations since it is the cessation of themThis is called fruition knowledgeThe duration of that threefold knowledge of maturity path and fruition is however not longIt is very short and lasts for just an instant like the duration of a single thought of noticingSubsequently there arises knowledge of reviewing Through that knowledge of reviewing the meditator discerns that the insight leading to emergence came along with the very rapid function of noticing and that immediately after the last phase of noticing the path consciousness entered into the cessationThis is knowledge reviewing the pathHe also discerns that the consciousness abided in that same state of cessation during the intervening period between the path and reviewingThis is knowledge reviewing fruitionHe further discerns that the object just experienced is void of all formationsThis is knowledge reviewing NibbanaIn this connection it is said in the Path of Purification  By that path indeed I have come thus he reviews the pathThat blessing was obtained thus he reviews the fruitionThat state has been penetrated as an object by me thus he reviews the Deathless NibbanaSome meditators but not all have reviewing of defilementsAfter having reviewed in this way the meditator still continues the practice of noticing bodily and mental processes as they become evidentBut while he is thus engaged in noticing the bodily and mental processes appear to him quite coarse not subtle as before at the time of the knowledge of equanimity about formationsWhy is this soThis is so because the knowledge present now has the nature of the knowledge of arising and passing awayFor when the noble disciples resume the practice of insight the knowledge of arising and passing away usually arises at the beginningThis is the usual course of order in this respectHowever when some meditators emerge from the attainment of path and fruition great faith happiness rapture and tranquillity produced by virtue of the attainment arise flooding the whole bodyOwing to that they are unable to carry out the practice of noticing anything apparent at that timeEven if they make double effort and attempt to proceed with the practice of insight they fail to discern the phenomena clearly and separately at the moment of their occurrenceThey continue to experience only rapture tranquillity and happiness which occur with great forceThis state of mind which is extraordinarily serene through the strong faith prevailing lasts for one hour two hours or more without breakBecause of this meditators feel as if they were in some such place as a wide open space suffused with radiance and most delightfulThe rapture and happiness of a serene character that then arise are praised by meditators thus Surely I have never before felt and experienced such happiness After two or three hours have passed that faith happiness rapture and tranquillity will fadeThe meditators can once again proceed with noticing the bodily and mental processes as they occur distinguishing them separately and they will be able to discern them clearlyBut at that time too first the knowledge of arising and passing away will appearWhile he is thus engaged in noticing his insight knowledge will gradually grow and soon will again reach the stage of equanimity about formationsIf his power of concentration is still short of perfection only the equanimity about formations will go on repeating itselfBut if his concentration has reached perfection then in the case of one who does the insight practice of noticing with a view of attaining only to the first path and fruition the fruition consciousness of the first path alone reaches cessation of formations by way of the attainment of fruitionThis occurs in precisely the same way as the path and fruition consciousness that occurred earlier in the consciousnesssequence belonging to the initial attainment of the first pathThe only difference here is the capacity of the fruition attainment to last longOne should also set ones mind resolutely upon the further tasks to be able to repeat the achievement of fruition attainment to achieve it rapidly and at the time of achievement to abide in it a long time say for six ten fifteen or thirty minutes or for an hour or moreIn one who applies himself to achieving the attainment of fruition knowledge of arising and passing away will arise at the beginningAdvancing from there in the due sequence soon the knowledge of equanimity about formations is reachedBut when skill in the practice has been acquired the knowledge of equanimity about formations will arise quickly even after four or five acts of noticingIf the power of concentration has reached perfection the fruition consciousness will repeatedly become absorbed in cessation by way of fruition attainmentThe mind can thus reach absorption even while one is walking up and down or while taking a meal and the fruition attainment can remain for any length of time resolved uponDuring the fruition attainment the mind will abide only in the cessation of formations and will not be aware of anything elseWhen the meditator has thus become skilled in achieving the fruition attainment he should resolutely set his mind upon the task of attaining to the higher paths and fruitionsWhat should now be done by one who has set himself that taskJust as before he should carry out the practice of noticing at the six sense doorsHence the meditator should notice any bodily and mental process that becomes evident to him at the six sense doorsWhile he is thus engaged he will see at the stage of knowledge of arising and passing away that the first objects consisting of formations appear to him rather coarse and that his mind is not well concentratedThe development of insight belonging to the higher paths is in fact not as easy as that of insight belonging to the fruition attainment already achieved by the meditatorIt is in fact somewhat difficult due to the fact that insight has to be developed anewIt is however not so very difficult as it was at the first time when beginning the practiceIn a single day or even in a single hour he can gain the knowledge of equanimity about formationsThis statement is made here basing it on the experience usually gained by persons of the present day who had to be given guidance from the start and who did not possess particularly strong intelligenceHere it is applied by inference to similar types of persons in generalBut although equanimity about formations has been attained if the spiritual faculties have not yet reached full maturity it just goes on repeating itselfThough he who has won fruitions may be able to enter into it several times within one hour yet if his spiritual faculties are immature he cannot attain the next higher path within as much as one day two three or more daysHe abides merely in equanimity about formationsIf however he then directs his mind to reach the fruition already attained he will reach it perhaps in two or three minutesWhen however the spiritual faculties are mature one who carries out the practice of insight for attaining to a higher path will find that immediately after equanimity about formations has reached its culmination the higher path and fruition arise in the same way as before that is to say it is preceded by the stages of adaptation and maturityAfter the fruition the stages of reviewing etc that follow are also the same as beforeAnything else concerning the method of practice for insight and the progress of knowledge right up to arahantship can be understood in precisely the same way as describedHence there is no need to elaborate it any furtherNow the present treatise on the Progress of Insight through the Stages of Purification has been written in a concise form so that meditators can easily comprehend itHence complete details have not been given hereAnd since it was written with a view to making it easily intelligible in many passages of this treatise relevant canonical references have not been quoted and there are repetitions and other faults of literary compositionBut these shortcomings of presentation and the incompleteness of canonical references may here be overlooked by the readerOnly the meaning and purpose should be heeded well by the wiseIt is to this that I would invite the readers attentionThough in the beginning it was mentioned that this treatise has been written for those who have already obtained distinctive results in their practice others may perhaps read it with advantage tooNow these are my concluding good wishes for the latter type of readers Just as a very delicious appetizing tasty and nutritious meal can be appreciated fully only by one who has himself eaten it and not without partaking of it in the same way the whole series of knowledges described here can be understood fully only by one who has himself seen it by direct experience and not otherwiseSo may all good people reach the stage of indubitable understanding of this whole series of knowledgesMay they also strive to attain itThe Eight Uposatha Precepts are abstention from killing stealing all sexual intercourse lying intoxicants partaking of solid food and certain liquids after noon abstention from dance song music shows from perfumes ornaments etc luxurious bedsThis set of

Sayadaw the Venerable U Sobhana Mahathera was the son of U Kan Htaw and Daw Shwe Ok of Seikkhun village which is about seven miles to the west of Shwebo Town a onetime capital of the founder of the last Burmese dynastyHe was born on the third waning of the month of second Waso in the year of the Burmese EraAt the age of six he began his studies at a monastic school in the same village and at the age of twelve he was ordained a samaneraOn reaching the age of twenty he was ordained a bhikkhu on the fifth waning of the month of Tazaungmon in the year of the Burmese EraHe then passed the Government Pali examinations in all the three classes of Pathamange Pathamalat and Pathamagyi in the following three successive yearsIn the fourth year after his bhikkhu ordination he proceeded to Mandalay  a former capital of Burma  where he continued his further studies in the Khinmagan Kyaung Taik under various monks of high scholastic fameIn the fifth year he went to Moulmein where he took up the work of teaching the Buddhist scriptures at a monastery known as Taung Waing Galay Taik KyaungIn the eighth year after his ordination he and another monk left Moulmein equipped with the bare necessities of a bhikkhu and went in search of a clear and effective method in the practice of meditationAt Thaton he met the wellknown meditation instructor the Venerable U Narada who is also known as Mingun Jetawun Sayadaw the First He then placed himself under the guidance of the Sayadaw and at once proceeded with an intensive course of meditationAfter this practical course of meditation he returned to Moulmein and continued with his original work of teaching Buddhist scripturesHe sat for the Pali Lecturership Examination held by the Government of Burma in June and succeeded in passing completely at the first attemptHe was awarded the title of Sasanadhaja Siri Pavara DhammacariyaIn the year of the Burmese Era and in the eighteenth year of his bhikkhu ordination he returned to his native village and resided at a monastery known as MahaSi Kyaung because a drum of unusually big size is housed thereHe then introduced the systematic practical course of Satipatthana meditationMany people bhikkhus as well as laymen gathered round him and took up the strict practical course and were greatly benefited by his careful instructionsThey were happy because they began to understand the salient features of Satipatthana and had also learned the proper method of continuing the practice by themselvesIn the year BEthe then Prime Minister of Burma U Nu and Sir U Thwin executive members of the Buddha Sasananuggha Association requested the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw to come to Rangoon and give training in meditative practiceIn his twentysixth year of bhikkhu ordination he therefore went to Rangoon and resided at the Thathana Yeiktha the headquarters of the Association where since then intensive training courses have been held up to the present dayOver persons have since been trained in that center alone and altogether over persons have been trained throughout Burma where there are more than branches for the training in the same methodThis method has also spread widely in Thailand and in Sri LankaMahasi Sayadaw was awarded the title of AggaMahaPandita in the yearHe carried out the duties of the Questioner at the Sixth Buddhist Council held at Rangoon for two years culminating in the year of the Buddhist EraTo appreciate fully the importance of this role it may be mentioned that the Venerable MahaKassapa as Questioner put questions at the First Council held three months after the passing away of the BuddhaThen the Venerable Upali and the Venerable Ananda answered the questionsAt the Sixth Council it was Tipitakadhara Dhammabhandagarika Ashin Vicittasarabhivamsa who answered the questions put by the Venerable Mahasi SayadawThe Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was also a member of the committee that was responsible as the final authority for the codification of all the texts passed at the Sixth CouncilHe has written several books on meditation and the following notable works may be mentionedBurmese translation of the Mahasatipatthana Sutta with notesVisuddhiñanakathaBurmese translation of the Visuddhimagga with notesBurmese translation of the Visuddhimagga MahaTika with notes  volumesPaticcaSamuppada  volumesA large number of his discourses based on the Pali Suttas have been translated into English and published by the Buddha Sasananuggha Association Mahasi Sayadaw passed away on August following a brief illnessThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe nucleus of the present book is a medieval compendium of Buddhist philosophy entitled the Abhidhammattha SangahaThis work is ascribed to Acariya Anuruddha a Buddhist savant about whom so little is known that even his country of origin and the exact century in which he lived remain in questionNevertheless despite the personal obscurity that surrounds the author his little manual has become one of the most important and influential textbooks of Theravada BuddhismIn nine short chapters occupying about fifty pages in print the author provides a masterly summary of that abstruse body of Buddhist doctrine called the AbhidhammaSuch is his skill in capturing the essentials of that system and in arranging them in a format suitable for easy comprehension that his work has become the standard primer for Abhidhamma studies throughout the Theravada Buddhist countries of South and Southeast AsiaIn these countries particularly in Burma where the study of Abhidhamma is pursued most assiduously the Abhidhammattha Sangaha is regarded as the indispensable key to unlock this great treasurestore of Buddhist wisdomAt the heart of the Abhidhamma philosophy is the Abhidhamma Pitaka one of the divisions of the Pali canon recognized by Theravada Buddhism as the authoritative recension of the Buddhas teachingsThis canon was compiled at the three great Buddhist councils held in India in the early centuries following the Buddhas demise the first at Rajagaha convened three months after the Buddhas Parinibbana by five hundred senior monks under the leadership of the Elder Mahakassapa the second at Vesali a hundred years later and the third at Pataliputta two hundred years laterThe canon that emerged from these councils preserved in the Middle Indian language now called Pali is known as the Tipitaka the three baskets or collections of the teachingsThe first collection the Vinaya Pitaka is the book of discipline containing the rules of conduct for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis  the monks and nuns  and the regulations governing the Sangha the monastic orderThe Sutta Pitaka the second collection brings together the Buddhas discourses spoken by him on various occasions during his active ministry of fortyfive yearsAnd the third collection is the Abhidhamma Pitaka the basket of the Buddhas higher or special doctrineThis third great division of the Pali canon bears a distinctly different character from the other two divisionsWhereas the Suttas and Vinaya serve an obvious practical purpose namely to proclaim a clearcut message of deliverance and to lay down a method of personal training the Abhidhamma Pitaka presents the appearance of an abstract and highly technical systemization of the doctrineThe collection consists of seven books the Dhammasangani the Vibhanga the Dhatukatha the Puggalapaññatti the Kathavatthu the Yamaka and the PatthanaUnlike the Suttas these are not records of discourses and discussions occurring in reallife settings they are rather fullblown treatises in which the principles of the doctrine have been methodically organized minutely defined and meticulously tabulated and classifiedThough they were no doubt originally composed and transmitted orally and only written down later with the rest of the canon in the first century BC they exhibit the qualities of structured thought and rigorous consistency more typical of written documentsIn the Theravada tradition the Abhidhamma Pitaka is held in the highest esteem revered as the crown jewel of the Buddhist scripturesAs examples of this high regard in Sri Lanka King Kassapa V had the whole Abhidhamma Pitaka inscribed on gold plates and the first book set in gems while another king Vijayabahu used to study the Dhammasangani each morning before taking up his royal duties and composed a translation of it into SinhalaOn a cursory reading however this veneration given to the Abhidhamma seems difficult to understandThe texts appear to be merely a scholastic exercise in manipulating sets of doctrinal terms ponderous and tediously repetitiveThe reason the Abhidhamma Pitaka is so deeply revered only becomes clear as a result of thorough study and profound reflection undertaken in the conviction that these ancient books have something significant to communicateWhen one approaches the Abhidhamma treatises in such a spirit and gains some insight into their wide implications and organic unity one will find that they are attempting nothing less than to articulate a comprehensive vision of the totality of experienced reality a vision marked by extensiveness of range systematic completeness and analytical precisionFrom the standpoint of Theravada orthodoxy the system that they expound is not a figment of speculative thought not a mosaic put together out of metaphysical hypotheses but a disclosure of the true nature of existence as apprehended by a mind that has penetrated the totality of things both in depth and in the finest detailBecause it bears this character the Theravada tradition regards the Abhidhamma as the most perfect expression possible of the Buddhas unimpeded omniscient knowledgeIt is his statement of the way things appear to the mind of a Fully Enlightened One ordered in accordance with the two poles of his teaching suffering and the cessation of sufferingThe system that the Abhidhamma Pitaka articulates is simultaneously a philosophy a psychology and an ethics all integrated into the framework of a program for liberationThe Abhidhamma may be described as a philosophy because it proposes an ontology a perspective on the nature of the realThis perspective has been designated the dhamma theoryBriefly the dhamma theory maintains that ultimate reality consists of a multiplicity of elementary constituents called dhammasThe dhammas are not noumena hidden behind phenomena not things in themselves as opposed to mere appearances but the fundamental components of actualityThe dhammas fall into two broad classes the unconditioned dhamma which is solely Nibbana and the conditioned dhammas which are the momentary mental and material phenomena that constitute the process of experienceThe familiar world of substantial objects and enduring persons is according to the dhamma theory a conceptual construct fashioned by the mind out of the raw data provided by the dhammasThe entities of our everyday frame of reference possess merely a consensual reality derivative upon the foundational stratum of the dhammasIt is the dhammas alone that possess ultimate reality determinate existence from their own side independent of the minds conceptual processing of the dataSuch a conception of the nature of the real seems to be already implicit in the Sutta Pitaka particularly in the Buddhas disquisitions on the aggregates sense bases elements dependent arising etc but it remains there tacitly in the background as the underpinning to the more pragmatically formulated teachings of the SuttasEven in the Abhidhamma Pitaka itself the dhamma theory is not yet expressed as an explicit philosophical tenet this comes only later in the CommentariesNevertheless though as yet implicit the theory still comes into focus in its role as the regulating principle behind the Abhidhammas more evident task the project of systemizationThis project starts from the premise that to attain the wisdom that knows things as they really are a sharp wedge must be driven between those types of entities that possess ontological ultimacy that is the dhammas and those types of entities that exist only as conceptual constructs but are mistakenly grasped as ultimately realProceeding from this distinction the Abhidhamma posits a fixed number of dhammas as the building blocks of actuality most of which are drawn from the SuttasIt then sets out to define all the doctrinal terms used in the Suttas in ways that reveal their identity with the ontological ultimates recognized by the systemOn the basis of these definitions it exhaustively classifies the dhammas into a net of predetermined categories and modes of relatedness which highlight their place within the systems structureAnd since the system is held to be a true reflection of actuality this means that the classification pinpoints the place of each dhamma within the overall structure of actualityThe Abhidhammas attempt to comprehend the nature of reality contrary to that of classical science in the West does not proceed from the standpoint of a neutral observer looking outwards towards the external worldThe primary concern of the Abhidhamma is to understand the nature of experience and thus the reality on which it focuses is conscious reality the world as given in experience comprising both knowledge and the known in the widest senseFor this reason the philosophical enterprise of the Abhidhamma shades off into a phenomenological psychologyTo facilitate the understanding of experienced reality the Abhidhamma embarks upon an elaborate analysis of the mind as it presents itself to introspective meditationIt classifies consciousness into a variety of types specifies the factors and functions of each type correlates them with their objects and physiological bases and shows how the different types of consciousness link up with each other and with material phenomena to constitute the ongoing process of experienceThis analysis of mind is not motivated by theoretical curiosity but by the overriding practical aim of the Buddhas teaching the attainment of deliverance from sufferingSince the Buddha traces suffering to our tainted attitudes  a mental orientation rooted in greed hatred and delusion  the Abhidhammas phenomenological psychology also takes on the character of a psychological ethics understanding the term ethics not in the narrow sense of a code of morality but as a complete guide to noble living and mental purificationAccordingly we find that the Abhidhamma distinguishes states of mind principally on the basis of ethical criteria the wholesome and the unwholesome the beautiful factors and the defilementsIts schematization of consciousness follows a hierarchical plan that corresponds to the successive stages of purity to which the Buddhist disciple attains by practice of the Buddhas pathThis plan traces the refinement of the mind through the progression of meditative absorptions the finematerialsphere and immaterialsphere jhanas then through the stages of insight and the wisdom of the supramundane paths and fruitsFinally it shows the whole scale of ethical development to culminate in the perfection of purity attained with the minds irreversible emancipation from all defilementsAll three dimensions of the Abhidhamma  the philosophical the psychological and the ethical  derive their final justification from the cornerstone of the Buddhas teaching the program of liberation announced by the Four Noble TruthsThe ontological survey of dhammas stems from the Buddhas injunction that the noble truth of suffering identified with the world of conditioned phenomena as a whole must be fully understoodThe prominence of mental defilements and requisites of enlightenment in its schemes of categories indicative of its psychological and ethical concerns connects the Abhidhamma to the second and fourth noble truths the origin of suffering and the way leading to its endAnd the entire taxonomy of dhammas elaborated by the system reaches its consummation in the unconditioned element which is Nibbana the third noble truth that of the cessation of sufferingThe great Buddhist commentator Acariya Buddhaghosa explains the word Abhidhamma as meaning that which exceeds and is distinguished from the Dhamma the prefix abhi having the sense of preponderance and distinction and dhamma here signifying the teaching of the Sutta PitakaWhen the Abhidhamma is said to surpass the teaching of the Suttas this is not intended to suggest that the Suttanta teaching is defective in any degree or that the Abhidhamma proclaims some new revelation of esoteric doctrine unknown to the SuttasBoth the Suttas and the Abhidhamma are grounded upon the Buddhas unique doctrine of the Four Noble Truths and all the principles essential to the attainment of enlightenment are already expounded in the Sutta PitakaThe difference between the two in no way concerns fundamentals but is rather partly a matter of scope and partly a matter of methodAs to scope the Abhidhamma offers a thoroughness and completeness of treatment that cannot be found in the Sutta PitakaAcariya Buddhaghosa explains that in the Suttas such doctrinal categories as the five aggregates the twelve sense bases the eighteen elements and so forth are classified only partly while in the Abhidhamma Pitaka they are classified fully according to different schemes of classification some common to the Suttas others unique to the AbhidhammaThus the Abhidhamma has a scope and an intricacy of detail that set it apart from the Sutta PitakaThe other major area of difference concerns methodThe discourses contained in the Sutta Pitaka were expounded by the Buddha under diverse circumstances to listeners with very different capacities for comprehensionThey are primarily pedagogical in intent set forth in the way that will be most effective in guiding the listener in the practice of the teaching and in arriving at a penetration of its truthTo achieve this end the Buddha freely employs the didactic means required to make the doctrine intelligible to his listenersHe uses simile and metaphor he exhorts advises and inspires he sizes up the inclinations and aptitudes of his audience and adjusts the presentation of the teaching so that it will awaken a positive responseFor this reason the Suttanta method of teaching is described as pariyayadhammadesana the figurative or embellished discourse on the DhammaIn contrast to the Suttas the Abhidhamma Pitaka is intended to divulge as starkly and directly as possible the totalistic system that underlies the Suttanta expositions and upon which the individual discourses drawThe Abhidhamma takes no account of the personal inclinations and cognitive capacities of the listeners it makes no concessions to particular pragmatic requirementsIt reveals the architectonics of actuality in an abstract formalistic manner utterly devoid of literary embellishments and pedagogical expedientsThus the Abhidhamma method is described as the nippariyayadhammadesana the literal or unembellished discourse on the DhammaThis difference in technique between the two methods also influences their respective terminologiesIn the Suttas the Buddha regularly makes use of conventional language and accepts conventional truth truth expressed in terms of entities that do not possess ontological ultimacy but can still be legitimately referred to themThus in the Suttas the Buddha speaks of I and you of man and woman of living beings persons and even self as though they were concrete realitiesThe Abhidhamma method of exposition however rigorously restricts itself to terms that are valid from the standpoint of ultimate truth dhammas their characteristics their functions and their relationsThus in the Abhidhamma all such conceptual entities provisionally accepted in the Suttas for purposes of meaningful communication are resolved into their ontological ultimates into bare mental and material phenomena that are impermanent conditioned and dependently arisen empty of any abiding self or substanceBut a qualification is necessaryWhen a distinction is drawn between the two methods this should be understood to be based on what is most characteristic of each Pitaka and should not be interpreted as an absolute dichotomyTo some degree the two methods overlap and interpenetrateThus in the Sutta Pitaka we find discourses that employ the strictly philosophical terminology of aggregates sense bases elements etc and thus come within the bounds of the Abhidhamma methodAgain within the Abhidhamma Pitaka we find sections even a whole book that depart from the rigorous manner of expression and employ conventional terminology thus coming within the range of the Suttanta methodApart from its strict adherence to the philosophical method of exposition the Abhidhamma makes a number of other noteworthy contributions integral to its task of systemizationOne is the employment in the main books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka of a matika  a matrix or schedule of categories  as the blueprint for the entire edificeThis matrix which comes at the very beginning of the Dhammasangani as a preface to the Abhidhamma Pitaka proper consists of modes of classification special to the Abhidhamma methodOf these twentytwo are triads sets of three terms into which the fundamental dhammas are to be distributed the remaining hundred are dyads sets of two terms used as a basis for classificationThe matrix serves as a kind of grid for sorting out the complex manifold of experience in accordance with principles determined by the purposes of the DhammaFor example the triads include such sets as states that are wholesome unwholesome indeterminate states associated with pleasant feeling painful feeling neutral feeling states that are kamma results productive of kamma results neither and so forthThe dyads include such sets as states that are roots not roots states concomitant with roots not so concomitant states that are conditioned unconditioned states that are mundane supramundane and so forthBy means of its selection of categories the matrix embraces the totality of phenomena illuminating it from a variety of angles philosophical psychological and ethical in natureA second distinguishing feature of the Abhidhamma is the dissection of the apparently continuous stream of consciousness into a succession of discrete evanescent cognitive events called cittas each a complex unity involving consciousness itself as the basic awareness of an object and a constellation of mental factors exercising more specialized tasks in the act of cognitionSuch a view of consciousness at least in outline can readily be derived from the Sutta Pitakas analysis of experience into the five aggregates among which the four mental aggregates are always inseparably conjoined but the conception remains there merely suggestiveIn the Abhidhamma Pitaka the suggestion is not simply picked up but is expanded into an extraordinarily detailed and coherent picture of the functioning of consciousness both in its microscopic immediacy and in its extended continuity from life to lifeA third contribution arises from the urge to establish order among the welter of technical terms making up the currency of Buddhist discourseIn defining each of the dhammas the Abhidhamma texts collate long lists of synonyms drawn mostly from the SuttasThis method of definition shows how a single dhamma may enter under different names into different sets of categoriesFor example among the defilements the mental factor of greed may be found as the taint of sensual desire the taint of existence the bodily knot of covetousness clinging to sensual pleasures the hindrance of sensual desire etc among the requisites of enlightenment the mental factor of wisdom may be found as the faculty and power of wisdom the enlightenment factor of investigation of states the path factor of right view etcIn establishing these correspondences the Abhidhamma helps to exhibit the interconnections between doctrinal terms that might not be apparent from the Suttas themselvesIn the process it also provides a precisionmade tool for interpreting the Buddhas discoursesThe Abhidhamma conception of consciousness further results in a new primary scheme for classifying the ultimate constituents of existence a scheme which eventually in the later Abhidhamma literature takes precedence over the schemes inherited from the Suttas such as the aggregates sense bases and elementsIn the Abhidhamma Pitaka the latter categories still loom large but the view of mind as consisting of momentary concurrences of consciousness and its concomitants leads to a fourfold method of classification more congenial to the systemThis is the division of actuality into the four ultimate realities consciousness mental factors material phenomena and Nibbana the first three comprising conditioned reality and the last the unconditioned elementThe last novel feature of the Abhidhamma method to be noted here  contributed by the final book of the Pitaka the Patthana  is a set of twentyfour conditional relations laid down for the purpose of showing how the ultimate realities are welded into orderly processesThis scheme of conditions supplies the necessary complement to the analytical approach that dominates the earlier books of the AbhidhammaThe method of analysis proceeds by dissecting apparent wholes into their component parts thereby exposing their voidness of any indivisible core that might qualify as self or substanceThe synthetic method plots the conditional relations of the bare phenomena obtained by analysis to show that they are not isolated selfcontained units but nodes in a vast multilayered web of interrelated interdependent eventsTaken in conjunction the analytical method of the earlier treatises of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and the synthetic method of the Patthana establish the essential unity of the twin philosophical principles of Buddhism nonself or egolessness and dependent arising or conditionalityThus the foundation of the Abhidhamma methodology remains in perfect harmony with the insights that lie at the heart of the entire DhammaAlthough modern critical scholarship attempts to explain the formation of the Abhidhamma by a gradual evolutionary process Theravada orthodoxy assigns its genesis to the Buddha himselfAccording to the Great Commentary quoted by Acariya Buddhaghosa What is known as Abhidhamma is not the province nor the sphere of a disciple it is the province the sphere of the Buddhas The commentarial tradition holds moreover that it was not merely the spirit of the Abhidhamma but the letter as well that was already realized and expounded by the Buddha during his lifetimeThe Atthasalini relates that in the fourth week after the Enlightenment while the Blessed One was still dwelling in the vicinity of the Bodhi Tree he sat in a jewel house in the northwest directionThis jewel house was not literally a house made of precious stones but was the place where he contemplated the seven books of the Abhidhamma PitakaHe contemplated their contents in turn beginning with the Dhammasangani but while investigating the first six books his body did not emit raysHowever upon coming to the Patthana when he began to contemplate the twentyfour universal conditional relations of root object and so on his omniscience certainly found its opportunity thereinFor as the great fish Timiratipingala finds room only in the great ocean yojanas in depth so his omniscience truly finds room only in the Great BookRays of six colors  indigo golden red white tawny and dazzling  issued from the Teachers body as he was contemplating the subtle and abstruse Dhamma by his omniscience which had found such opportunityTheravada orthodoxy thus maintains that the Abhidhamma Pitaka is authentic Word of the Buddha in this respect differing from an early rival school the SarvastivadinsThis school also had an Abhidhamma Pitaka consisting of seven books considerably different in detail from the Theravada treatisesAccording to the Sarvastivadins the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka were composed by Buddhist disciples several being attributed to authors who appeared generations after the BuddhaThe Theravada school however holds that the Blessed One himself expounded the books of the Abhidhamma except for the detailed refutation of deviant views in the Kathavatthu which was the work of the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa during the reign of Emperor AsokaThe Pali Commentaries apparently drawing upon an old oral tradition maintain that the Buddha expounded the Abhidhamma not in the human world to his human disciples but to the assembly of devas or gods in the Tavatimsa heavenAccording to this tradition just prior to his seventh annual rains retreat the Blessed One ascended to the Tavatimsa heaven and there seated on the Pandukambala stone at the foot of the Paricchattaka tree for the three months of the rains he taught the Abhidhamma to the devas who had assembled from the ten thousand worldsystemsHe made the chief recipient of the teaching his mother Mahamayadevi who had been reborn as a devaThe reason the Buddha taught the Abhidhamma in the deva world rather than in the human realm it is said is because in order to give a complete picture of the Abhidhamma it has to be expounded from the beginning to the end to the same audience in a single sessionSince the full exposition of the Abhidhamma requires three months only devas and Brahmas could receive it in unbroken continuity for they alone are capable of remaining in one posture for such a length of timeHowever each day to sustain his body the Buddha would descend to the human world to go on almsround in the northern region of UttarakuruAfter collecting almsfood he went to the shore of Anotatta Lake to partake of his mealThe Elder Sariputta the General of the Dhamma would meet the Buddha there and receive a synopsis of the teaching given that day in the deva world Then to him the Teacher gave the method saying Sariputta so much doctrine has been shown Thus the giving of the method was to the chief disciple who was endowed with analytical knowledge as though the Buddha stood on the edge of the shore and pointed out the ocean with his open handTo the Elder also the doctrine taught by the Blessed One in hundreds and thousands of methods became very clearHaving learned the Dhamma taught him by the Blessed One Sariputta in turn taught it to his own circle of pupils and thus the textual recension of the Abhidhamma Pitaka was establishedTo the Venerable Sariputta is ascribed the textual order of the Abhidhamma treatises as well as the numerical series in the PatthanaPerhaps we should see in these admissions of the Atthasalini an implicit acknowledgement that while the philosophical vision of the Abhidhamma and its basic architecture originate from the Buddha the actual working out of the details and perhaps even the prototypes of the texts themselves are to be ascribed to the illustrious Chief Disciple and his entourage of studentsIn other early Buddhist schools too the Abhidhamma is closely connected with the Venerable Sariputta who in some traditions is regarded as the literal author of Abhidhamma treatisesA brief outline of the contents of the seven canonical Abhidhamma books will provide some insight into the plethora of textual material to be condensed and summarized by the Abhidhammattha SangahaThe first book the Dhammasangani is the fountainhead of the entire systemThe title may be translated Enumeration of Phenomena and the work does in fact undertake to compile an exhaustive catalog of the ultimate constituents of existenceOpening with the matika the schedule of categories which serves as the framework for the whole Abhidhamma the text proper is divided into four chaptersThe first States of Consciousness takes up about half of the book and unfolds as an analysis of the first triad in the matika that of the wholesome the unwholesome and the indeterminateTo supply that analysis the text enumerates types of consciousness classified by way of their ethical qualityEach type of consciousness is in turn dissected into its concomitant mental factors which are individually defined in fullThe second chapter On Matter continues the inquiry into the ethically indeterminate by enumerating and classifying the different types of material phenomenaThe third chapter called The Summary offers concise explanations of all the terms in the Abhidhamma matrix and the Suttanta matrix as wellFinally a concluding Synopsis provides a more condensed explanation of the Abhidhamma matrix but omits the Suttanta matrixThe Vibhanga the Book of Analysis consists of eighteen chapters each a selfcontained dissertation dealing in turn with the following aggregates sense bases elements truths faculties dependent arising foundations of mindfulness supreme efforts means to accomplishment factors of enlightenment the eightfold path jhanas illimitables training rules analytical knowledges kinds of knowledge minor points and the heart of the doctrine a psychocosmic topography of the Buddhist universeMost of the chapters in the Vibhanga though not all involve three subsections an analysis according to the methodology of the Suttas an analysis according to the methodology of the Abhidhamma proper and an interrogation section which applies the categories of the matrix to the subject under investigationThe Dhatukatha the Discourse on Elements is written entirely in catechism formIt discusses all phenomena with reference to the three schemata of aggregates sense bases and elements seeking to determine whether and to what extent they are included or not included in them and whether they are associated with them or dissociated from themThe Puggalapaññatti Concepts of Individuals is the one book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka that is more akin to the method of the Suttas than to the Abhidhamma properThe work begins with a general enumeration of types of concepts and this suggests that it was originally intended as a supplement to the other books in order to take account of the conceptual realities excluded by the strict application of the Abhidhamma methodThe bulk of the work provides formal definitions of different types of individualsIt has ten chapters the first deals with single types of individuals the second with pairs the third with groups of three etcThe Kathavatthu Points of Controversy is a polemical treatise ascribed to the Elder Moggaliputta TissaHe is said to have compiled it during the time of Emperor Asoka years after the Buddhas Parinibbana in order to refute the heterodox opinions of the Buddhist schools outside the Theravadin foldThe Commentaries defend its inclusion in the Canon by holding that the Buddha himself foreseeing the errors that would arise laid down the outline of rebuttal which Moggaliputta Tissa merely filled in according to the Masters intentionThe Yamaka the Book of Pairs has the purpose of resolving ambiguities and defining the precise usage of technical termsIt is so called owing to its method of treatment which throughout employs the dual grouping of a question and its converse formulationFor instance the first pair of questions in the first chapter runs thus Are all wholesome phenomena wholesome rootsAnd are all wholesome roots wholesome phenomena The book contains ten chapters roots aggregates sense bases elements truths formations latent dispositions consciousness phenomena and facultiesThe Patthana the Book of Conditional Relations is probably the most important work of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and thus is traditionally designated the Great TreatiseGigantic in extent as well as in substance the book comprises five volumes totalling pages in the Burmesescript Sixth Council editionThe purpose of the Patthana is to apply its scheme of twentyfour conditional relations to all the phenomena incorporated in the Abhidhamma matrixThe main body of the work has four great divisions origination according to the positive method according to the negative method according to the positivenegative method and according to the negativepositive methodEach of these in turn has six subdivisions origination of triads of dyads of dyads and triads combined of triads and dyads combined of triads and triads combined and of dyads and dyads combinedWithin this pattern of twentyfour sections the twentyfour modes of conditionality are applied in due order to all the phenomena of existence in all their conceivable permutationsDespite its dry and tabular format even from a profane humanistic viewpoint the Patthana can easily qualify as one of the truly monumental products of the human mind astounding in its breadth of vision its rigorous consistency and its painstaking attention to detailTo Theravada orthodoxy it is the most eloquent testimony to the Buddhas unimpeded knowledge of omniscienceThe books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka have inspired a voluminous mass of exegetical literature composed in order to fill out by way of explanation and exemplification the scaffoldings erected by the canonical textsThe most important works of this class are the authorized commentaries of Acariya BuddhaghosaThese are three in number the Atthasalini The Expositor the commentary to the Dhammasangani the Sammohavinodani The Dispeller of Delusion the commentary to the Vibhanga and the Pañcappakarana Atthakatha the combined commentary to the other five treatisesTo this same stratum of literature also belongs the Visuddhimagga The Path of Purification also composed by BuddhaghosaAlthough this last work is primarily an encyclopedic guide to meditation its chapters on the soil of understanding lay out the theory to be mastered prior to developing insight and thus constitute in effect a compact dissertation on AbhidhammaEach of the commentaries in turn has its subcommentary by an elder of Sri Lanka named Acariya Ananda and these in turn each have a subsubcommentary by Anandas pupil DhammapalaWhen the authorship of the Commentaries is ascribed to Acariya Buddhaghosa it should not be supposed that they are in any way original compositions or even original attempts to interpret traditional materialThey are rather carefully edited versions of the vast body of accumulated exegetical material that Buddhaghosa found at the Mahavihara in AnuradhapuraThis material must have preceded the great commentator by centuries representing the collective efforts of generations of erudite Buddhist teachers to elucidate the meaning of the canonical AbhidhammaWhile it is tempting to try to discern evidence of historical development in the Commentaries over and beyond the ideas embedded in the Abhidhamma Pitaka it is risky to push this line too far for a great deal of the canonical Abhidhamma seems to require the Commentaries to contribute the unifying context in which the individual elements hang together as parts of a systematic whole and without which they lose important dimensions of meaningIt is thus not unreasonable to assume that a substantial portion of the commentarial apparatus originated in close proximity to the canonical Abhidhamma and was transmitted concurrently with the latter though lacking the stamp of finality it was open to modification and amplification in a way that the canonical texts were notBearing this in mind we might briefly note a few of the Abhidhammic conceptions that are characteristic of the Commentaries but either unknown or recessive in the Abhidhamma Pitaka itselfOne is the detailed account of the cognitive processWhile this conception seems to be tacitly recognized in the canonical books it now comes to be drawn out for use as an explanatory tool in its own rightThe functions of the cittas the different types of consciousness are specified and in time the cittas themselves come to be designated by way of their functionsThe term khana moment replaces the canonical samaya occasion as the basic unit for delimiting the occurrence of events and the duration of a material phenomenon is determined to be seventeen moments of mental phenomenaThe division of a moment into three submoments  arising presence and dissolution  also seems to be new to the CommentariesThe organization of material phenomena into groups though implied by the distinction between the primary elements of matter and derived matter is first spelled out in the Commentaries as is the specification of the heartbase as the material basis for mind element and mindconsciousness elementThe Commentaries introduce many of the categories for classifying kamma and work out the detailed correlations between kamma and its resultsThey also close off the total number of mental factorsThe phrase in the Dhammasangani or whatever other conditionally arisen immaterial phenomena there are on that occasion apparently envisages an openended universe of mental factors which the Commentaries delimit by specifying the orwhatever statesAgain the Commentaries consummate the dhamma theory by supplying the formal definition of dhammas as things which bear their own intrinsic natureThe task of defining specific dhammas is finally rounded off by the extensive employment of the fourfold defining device of characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause a device derived from a pair of old exegetical texts the Petakopadesa and the NettipakaranaAs the Abhidhamma system already massive in its canonical version grew in volume and complexity it must have become increasingly unwieldy for purposes of study and comprehensionThus at a certain stage in the evolution of Theravada Buddhist thought the need must have become felt for concise summaries of the Abhidhamma as a whole in order to provide the novice student of the subject with a clear picture of its main outlines  faithfully and thoroughly yet without an unmanageable mass of detailTo meet this need there began to appear perhaps as early as the fifth century and continuing well through the twelfth short manuals or compendia of the AbhidhammaIn Burma these are called letthan or littlefinger manuals of which there are nineAmong these the work that has dominated Abhidhamma studies from about the twelfth century to the present day is the first mentioned the Abhidhammattha Sangaha The Compendium of Things contained in the Abhidhamma Its popularity may be accounted for by its remarkable balance between concision and comprehensivenessWithin its short scope all the essentials of the Abhidhamma are briefly and carefully summarizedAlthough the books manner of treatment is extremely terse even to the point of obscurity when read alone when studied under a qualified teacher or with the aid of an explanatory guide it leads the student confidently through the winding maze of the system to a clear perception of its entire structureFor this reason throughout the Theravada Buddhist world the Abhidhammattha Sangaha is always used as the first textbook in Abhidhamma studiesIn Buddhist monasteries especially in Burma novices and young bhikkhus are required to learn the Sangaha by heart before they are permitted to study the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and its CommentariesDetailed information about the author of the manual Acariya Anuruddha is virtually nonexistentHe is regarded as the author of two other manuals cited above and it is believed in Buddhist countries that he wrote altogether nine compendia of which only these three have survivedThe Paramatthavinicchaya is written in an elegant style of Pali and attains a high standard of literary excellenceAccording to the colophon its author was born in Kaveri in the state of Kañcipura in South IndiaAcariya Buddhadatta and Acariya Buddhaghosa are also said to have resided in the same area and the subcommentator Acariya Dhammapala was probably a native of the regionThere is evidence that for several centuries Kañcipura had been an important center of Theravada Buddhism from which learned bhikkhus went to Sri Lanka for further studyIt is not known exactly when Acariya Anuruddha lived and wrote his manualsAn old monastic tradition regards him as having been a fellow student of Acariya Buddhadatta under the same teacher which would place him in the fifth centuryAccording to this tradition the two elders wrote their respective books the Abhidhammattha Sangaha and the Abhidhammavatara as gifts of gratitude to their teacher who remarked Buddhadatta has filled a room with all kinds of treasure and locked the door while Anuruddha has also filled a room with treasure but left the door open Modern scholars however do not endorse this tradition maintaining on the basis of the style and content of Anuruddhas work that he could not have lived earlier than the eighth century more probably between the tenth and early twelfth centuriesIn the colophon to the Abhidhammattha Sangaha Acariya Anuruddha states that he wrote the manual at the Mulasoma Monastery which all exegetical traditions place in Sri LankaThere are several ways to reconcile this fact with the concluding stanzas of the Paramatthavinicchaya which state that he was born in KañcipuraOne hypothesis is that he was of South Indian descent but came to Sri Lanka where he wrote the SangahaAnother advanced by GPMalalasekera holds that he was a native of Sri Lanka who spent time at KañcipuraStill a third hypothesis proposed by VenAPBuddhadatta Mahathera asserts that there were two different monks named Anuruddha one in Sri Lanka who was the author of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha another in Kañcipura who wrote the ParamatthavinicchayaOwing to its extreme concision the Abhidhammattha Sangaha cannot be easily understood without explanationTherefore to elucidate its terse and pithy synopsis of the Abhidhamma philosophy a great number of tikas or commentaries have been written upon itIn fact this work has probably stimulated more commentaries than any other Pali text written not only in the Pali language but also in Burmese Sinhala Thai etcSince the fifteenth century Burma has been the international center of Abhidhamma studies and therefore we find many commentaries written on it by Burmese scholars both in Pali and in BurmeseCommentaries on the Sangaha in Pali alone number nineteen of which the following are the most importantThe Abhidhammattha Sangaha contains nine chaptersIt opens by enumerating the four ultimate realities  consciousness mental factors matter and NibbanaThe detailed analysis of these is the project set for its first six chaptersChapter I is the Compendium of Consciousness which defines and classifies the and cittas or types of consciousnessIn scope this first chapter covers the same territory as the States of Consciousness chapter of the Dhammasangani but it differs in approachThe canonical work begins with an analysis of the first triad in the matika and therefore initially classifies consciousness on the basis of the three ethical qualities of wholesome unwholesome and indeterminate then within those categories it subdivides consciousness on the basis of plane into the categories of sense sphere finematerial sphere immaterial sphere and supramundaneThe Sangaha on the other hand not being bound to the matika first divides consciousness on the basis of plane and then subdivides it on the basis of ethical qualityThe second chapter the Compendium of Mental Factors first enumerates the fiftytwo cetasikas or concomitants of consciousness divided into four classes universals occasionals unwholesome factors and beautiful factorsThereafter the factors are investigated by two complimentary methods first the method of association which takes the mental factors as the unit of inquiry and elicits the types of consciousness with which they are individually associated and second the method of inclusion or combination which takes the types of consciousness as the unit of inquiry and elicits the mental factors that enter into the constitution of eachThis chapter again draws principally upon the first chapter of the DhammasanganiThe third chapter entitled Compendium of the Miscellaneous classifies the types of consciousness along with their factors with respect to six categories root feeling function door object and baseThe first three chapters are concerned principally with the structure of consciousness both internally and in relation to external variablesIn contrast the next two chapters deal with the dynamics of consciousness that is with its modes of occurrenceAccording to the Abhidhamma consciousness occurs in two distinct but intertwining modes  as active process and as passive flowChapter IV explores the nature of the cognitive process Chapter V the passive processfreed flow which it prefaces with a survey of the traditional Buddhist cosmologyThe exposition here is largely based upon the Abhidhamma CommentariesChapter VI Compendium of Matter turns from the mental realm to the material worldBased primarily on the second chapter of the Dhammasangani it enumerates the types of material phenomena classifies them in various ways and explains their modes of originationIt also introduces the commentarial notion of material groups which it treats in detail and describes the occurrence of material processes in the different realms of existenceThis chapter concludes with a short section on the fourth ultimate reality Nibbana the only unconditioned element in the systemWith the sixth chapter Acariya Anuruddha has completed his analytical exposition of the four ultimate realities but there remain several important subjects which must be explained to give a complete picture of the AbhidhammaThese are taken up in the last three chaptersChapter VII the Compendium of Categories arranges the ultimate realities into a variety of categorical schemes that fall under four broad headings a compendium of defilements a compendium of mixed categories which include items of different ethical qualities a compendium of the requisites of enlightenment and a compendium of the whole an allinclusive survey of the Abhidhamma ontologyThis chapter leans heavily upon the Vibhanga and to some extent upon the DhammasanganiChapter VIII the Compendium of Conditionality is introduced to include the Abhidhamma teaching on the interrelatedness of physical and mental phenomena thereby complementing the analytical treatment of the ultimate realities with a synthetical treatment laying bare their functional correlationsThe exposition summarily presents two alternative approaches to conditionality found in the Pali canonOne is the method of dependent arising prominent in the Suttas and analyzed from both Suttanta and Abhidhamma angles in the VibhangaThis method examines conditionality in terms of the causeandresult pattern that maintains bondage to samsara the cycle of birth and deathThe other is the method of the Patthana with its twentyfour conditional relationsThis chapter concludes with a brief account of concepts thereby drawing in the Puggalapaññatti at least by implicationThe ninth and final chapter of the Sangaha is concerned not with theory but with practiceThis is the Compendium of Meditation SubjectsThis chapter functions as a kind of summary of the VisuddhimaggaIt concisely surveys all the methods of meditation exhaustively explained in the latter work and it sets forth condensed accounts of the stages of progress in both systems of meditation concentration and insightLike the masterwork it summarizes it concludes with an account of the four types of enlightened individuals and the attainments of fruition and cessationThis arrangement of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha perhaps serves to underscore the ultimate soteriological intent of the AbhidhammaAll the theoretical analysis of mind and matter finally converges upon the practice of meditation and the practice culminates in the attainment of the supreme goal of Buddhism the liberation of the mind by nonclingingThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Satipatthana Sutta the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness is generally regarded as the canonical Buddhist text with the fullest instructions on the system of meditation unique to the Buddhas own dispensationThe practice of Satipatthana meditation centers on the methodical cultivation of one simple mental faculty readily available to all of us at any momentThis is the faculty of mindfulness the capacity for attending to the content of our experience as it becomes manifest in the immediate presentWhat the Buddha shows in the sutta is the tremendous but generally hidden power inherent in this simple mental function a power that can unfold all the minds potentials culminating in final deliverance from sufferingTo exercise this power however mindfulness must be systematically cultivated and the sutta shows exactly how this is to be doneThe key to the practice is to combine energy mindfulness and clear comprehension in attending to the phenomena of mind and body summed up in the four arousings of mindfulness body feelings consciousness and mental objectsMost contemporary meditation teachers explain Satipatthana meditation as a means for generating insightWhile this is certainly a valid claim we should also recognize that satipatthana meditation also generates concentrationUnlike the forms of meditation which cultivate concentration and insight sequentially Satipatthana brings both these faculties into being together though naturally in the actual process of development concentration will have to gain a certain degree of stability before insight can exercise its penetrating functionIn Satipatthana the act of attending to each occasion of experience as it occurs in the moment fixes the mind firmly on the objectThe continuous attention to the object even when the object itself is constantly changing stabilizes the mind in concentration while the observation of the object in terms of its qualities and characteristics brings into being the insight knowledgesTo practice Satipatthana successfully a student will generally require a sound theoretical knowledge of the practice along with actual training preferably under the guidance of a qualified teacherThe best source of theoretical knowledge indeed the indispensable source is the Satipatthana Sutta itselfHowever though the sutta is clear and comprehensible enough as it stands the instructions it offers are extremely concise often squeezing into a few simple guidelines directions that might need several pages to explain in a way adequate for successful practiceFor this reason from an early period the ancient masters of Buddhist meditation began to supply more detailed instructions based on their own practical experienceThese instructions eventually evolved into a lengthy commentary on the Satipatthana Sutta which was then incorporated into the complete commentaries on the two collections in which the sutta appears namely the Digha Nikaya and the Majjhima NikayaThe two commentaries that have come down to us today based on the older Sinhala commentaries are called the Sumangalavilasini and the PapañcasudaniThese commentaries are ascribed to Acariya Buddhaghosa an Indian thera who worked in Sri Lanka in the th century AC but are securely based on the old commentaries which record the explanations devised by the ancient masters of the DhammaThe commentary has in turn been further elucidated by a subcommentary or tika by Acariya Dhammapala who worked in South India near Kancipura perhaps a century or two after the time of BuddhaghosaThis book The Way of Mindfulness contains all the authorized instructions on Satipatthana meditation passed down in the Theravada tradition the Satipatthana Sutta stemming from the Buddha himself the commentary by Buddhaghosa and selections from the tika by DhammapalaWhile the volume of material found here will certainly exceed the amount a beginner needs to start the practice the book will prove itself useful at successive stages and will eventually become a trusted friend and advisor in all its manifold detailsThus the reader should not be intimidated by the detail and the sometimes formidable technical terminology but should continue reading selecting whatever material is found useful and leaving until later whatever presently seems difficult to graspThe book was originally compiled in the late s by VenSoma Thera a bhikkhu of Sri Lanka and has been maintained in print since the early sThe Buddhist Publication Society in Kandy has published the work since in several editionsThis latest version contains several minor changes in terminology authorized by the present writerChristine Chan and her friends in the Buddhist Communities in Malaysia as well as RevSuddhinand Janthagul from Thailand who helped in the proofreading of the Pali texts deserve our congratulations and appreciation for their hard work in transcribing the book and for making it available for free distributionI am sure this book will prove an invaluable road map for anyone who has entered the steep and rugged road of Satipatthana meditation leading to final deliverance from sufferingDirecting attention to the four truly genuine stages of arahantship in this universe the Buddha says Here O Bhikkhus are the First Ascetic the Second Ascetic the Third Ascetic and the Fourth Ascetic empty of Ascetics are the other ways of thoughtResound thus O Bhikkhus your swelling diapason of just rejoicingLater the Buddha states why he affirms that nowhere outside his System of Deliverance are genuine arahants to be foundIt is because the Goal Perfection is One not Multiple and the views of man are manyIn a Buddhas system of Deliverance there are no views instead there is right understanding of things as they really areThe Tathagata O Bhikkhus the arahant the Fully Enlightened One declares himself fully aware of all forms of clinging and he makes known to perfection the science of the sameIn a doctrine and discipline of this sort O Bhikkhus what joy there is in the Buddha is to be proclaimed perfect what joy there is in the Dhamma is to be proclaimed perfect what observance of Virtue there is proclaimed perfect what pleasure and happiness there be amongst fellowdisciples is proclaimed perfectAnd for what reasonBecause truly O Bhikkhus clearly explained leading to the Deliverance conducive to the Peace taught by a Supreme SambuddhaIn the subject now presented to the reader The Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness  the peerless Teacher gives an aspirant details of how to use the weapon of Mind if he wishes to make an end of the Bonds of SufferingThe reader will note a certain abruptness almost jerkiness of expression in the textThis is even more so in the commentaryThis effect is brought about partly by the concise way in which a complex subject of many details is treatedBut actually the text reflects the course of the aspirants progress in watchful thinking even as verses in a gallop rhythm can picture the speeding rider and the steady beat of a horses hoovesHe who begins this practice of Satipatthana finds that indeed he needs must rein in his thoughts sharply and oftenNo racing steed can equal thought which now here looking at the Temple Bo Tree is in a moment at Buddhagayas Shrine and next instant visualizing the poplars in an English parkBut as a rider slides as it were into the way of its doing on a bicycle or a trotting horse  so in this practice the Yogi gradually falls in with its way till after a while its working seems smooth and clearThe Translator is a Bhikkhu well qualified for the taskFor him it was a happy labor of love and a tribute to his Teachers in that secluded manycelled Arama in far Burma where he and another young Bhikkhu from Lanka held out to the last in a long course of instruction in Satipatthana methodA Maha Thera as wellknown there as he was qualified in learning and temperament supervised the courseThe Discipline was strict but just and the Teacher firm compassionate and a seer beyond the normalThe lodging and diet were simple to a degreeThe Maha Theras own teacher of old master of meditation and expert in practical teaching for all that he was a layman was deputed to instruct the yoginsLike all older Burmese he had aforetime himself been a wearer of the yellow robe his experience was vast and his learning profoundThe course started with a crowd of aspirants many of whom were pious lay folk but as the weeks passed and endurance gave way the class of pupils was sadly thinned outSome after a time gave up the effortOthers perhaps through a difference in preparation or temperament completed the course earlyOthers again went on and on with the training until at last the two earnest ones from Lanka were left to face the calm Teacher whose evenness of mind was in no way disturbed by the recurring phenomenon of dwindling enthusiasm or numbers in those courses of hard life and abstruse thoughtThe training was beyond priceKeener at the close than even at the start of that course our Translator today is yet happily and earnestly following that trailThese are indeed difficult times for layman and Bhikkhu alikeThe seven year maximum has not yet passed and indeed we are woefully weak for the Suttas seven days minimum for results  that is arahantship or failing that the Anagami stage of AwakeningYet the strenuous will press on  Theragatha In  while living with my teacher in Burma I had the opportunity of knowing the practice of the Buddhist method of meditation called The Development of InsightThe enthusiasm with which many persons there took up the practice and continued in it and the kindliness and understanding which prevailed among those who had gone through the course of training patiently to the end made me and a fellowbhikkhu from Lanka to take up the practiceMany began to train along with usSome of them gave up the effort in a short time and some continued the practice to the endThe time taken to complete the course varied according to the individualWe were among the last to complete the trainingThe details and the spirit of the method are shown in the commentaryexcerpts translated hereThese were at first intended for the use of a few friendsLater when a group of sympathetic students of the Dhamma decided to get these printed a translation of the Discourse had to be included to make the compilation coherent to the general readerI wish to record here my warm appreciation of the kindness of the members of the Saccanubodha Samiti Nandana Asgiriya Kandy especially MrRichard Abeyasekere the HonSecretary and MrWJSoysa in getting this book published and encouraging me in my humble effort to serve the DhammaThis compilation was begun with the VenBhikkhu Nyanaponika and carried out largely according to his suggestionsTo him and to the VenBhikkhu Kheminda I am deeply thankful for the kindly help they gave me while I was engaged in this workI also wish to record here my sincere thanks to the VenBhikkhu Dhammapala for his valued assistance in reading over the proofs carefully and for the active interest he has taken in my workThe Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness and the excerpts from its commentary given here deal with the method of training for insight according to the Buddhas teachingInsight is the understanding of the true nature of things by which a complete transfiguring of mental life takes place in the seer and by which he is lifted out of the groove of birth and deathThe understanding of the nature of things is the sure knowledge of the transience and subjection to sorrow of all component things and of the emptiness of all things as regards ens self or essenceThis last knowledge of the essential emptiness of all things is called the realization of the supreme voidBy it the conception of a self and the craving and suffering which spring from that conception are abandonedIt marks the limit of the spiritually attainable in the Buddhas DispensationBy it is accomplished emancipation from all bondage to ignorance and the attainment of the highest happinessIn the Way of Analytical Knowledge it is said What is the supreme voidThe quieting of all kammical conformations the giving up of all clinging to rebirth detachment cessation Nibbana  this is the supreme void The Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness is for reaching that summum bonum of the BuddhasMindfulness is said to have nonsuperficiality as its salient characteristic the absence of confusion as its function and the state of being turned towards the object as its manifestationIt is also called the nonnegligence which indicates the state of unremitting alertness of the yogavacara the proficient in spiritual endeavorClear and strong mindfulness is conjoined with wisdom and is called the prudence of mindfulnessIt is then pure cognition the cognition which is free from discrimination that proceeds from delusionIt is such cognition that is indicated in the teaching of the Buddha to Bahiya Daruciriya which says that to one there must be in what is seen just the seen in the heard just the heard in the contacted just the contacted in the apperceived just the apperceived so that one may be free from lust hatred and delusion and from bondage to this or any other worldThis objective way of looking at a thing freed from considerations of the personal reactions to that thing is the pith of the method and constitutes what is called knowing as it isAlso by its quality of reckoning just what is present mindfulness cuts down discursive thought and prepares the mind to take in the actual characteristics of the cognized objectsIn this sense mindfulness lets the objects speak for themselves and unfold their natureThus it predisposes and opens the mind to the impressions of truth induces mental pliancy and the mood of spiritual receptivity the basis of highest intuitionThe Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness sets forth the whole duty of the meditator and provides for every phase of the process of training for insightIt is strenuous wholetime work and only resolute hearts in whom the consciousness of lifes suffering runs deep could hope to pursue it to the end the attainment of arahantshipThe Buddhas Goal of Emancipation is attained with the extirpation of all craving and spiritual ignoranceWho wins it gains lasting mental strength and contentmentIt is the source of real peace and equanimityLack of freedom consists of subjection to hate lust and ignoranceVirtuous conduct wipes out hate the calm of skillful concentration casts out lust and wise understanding of the world within oneself dispels ignoranceThe Way of Mindfulness does all this it is designed for the attainment of fullest inner freedomThis is the only satisfying way for the seeker of truth when the diffuseness of the external world with its thin layer of culture comfort and allurement ceases to be interesting and is found to lack true valueThe seeker knows to a certainty that what he wants is to be found in the realm of the spiritThere alone he feels he would reach the vision of oneness of the enduring by transcending the diversity of changeAnd what he wants is inward integrity intactness inviolability based on the unshakable deliverance of the mind from the sway of all conditioned phenomenaTo this the Way of Mindfulness leads by showing him how to penetrate into the singleness of nature of the Supreme Void Nibbana which is permeated with the one taste of liberationThe Way of Mindfulness reaches the first stage of supramundane fulfillment with what is technically known as entry into the stream or the arrival at the unswerving path to the GoalBefore that there could be serious deviations but not from that point where the First Direct Glimpse of the Goal is obtainedThe Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness deals with the preparatory part the Mundane Way of Mindfulness which is of immediate practical value to worldlings still in the valleys of the spirit far from the supramundane peaksMindfulness is a process an event and an arising and a passing away momentarily like any other mental propertyAlthough it is a basic power a shelter and a refuge of the mind the role it plays in the drama of transition from Ignorance to Knowledge differs considerably according to the other properties of mind with which it worksFor instance in association with Right Understanding and its group which comprises wisdom intense knowledge discrimination research investigation of things consideration close examination pondering over learning skillfulness keenwittedness analysis reflection vision sagacity the discernment that leads aright penetrative insight and clear comprehension it is rationalAnd when it is combined with Right Concentration and its cognates such as mental steadfastness serenity immovability quietude nondistraction and pacification it is intuitiveBut the intuitive or rational role does not preclude mindfulness from communicating its regulative impulse of moderation to the mind at all timesIt is the property which makes for proper proportion in the response of the mind to mental objectsMindfulness as memory is indicated by such terms as annussati  calling to mind patissati  remembrance dharanata  bearing in mind saranata  recollectionIn this connection the process of mindfulness is compared to the Treasurer of a King who reminds the King of the royal possessions in detail daily at night and in the morningThe mindfulness of the aspirant to the Highest Goal of Liberation from Suffering reminds him of Virtue Concentration and Wisdom which constitute the possessions of the Good Life in the Dispensation of the BuddhaThe value of the recollective activity of mindfulness is seen in the increasing awareness of the essentials of holy living in the aspirants mind and the growing strength of purpose for realizing these within himselfAbove that stands mindfulness as the activity that takes care of the mind and protects itIt is compared to a wagon driver who ties the oxen to the wagons yoke greases the axle and drives the wagon making the oxen go gentlyIn this activity mindfulness looks to the smooth working and movement of the mind and takes notice of the processes both skillful and not taking place in the consciousnessIn the more complex forms it is the selective and integrative action of the mindThe selective activity has been compared to the work of the Chief Adviser of a KingAs the Adviser is instrumental in distinguishing the good from the bad and in getting the good and avoiding the bad so mindfulness distinguishes the worthy from unworthy things avoids the unworthy and obtains the worthyThe integrative character of mindfulness is like the Ministerofallwork of a KingHe is wanted in putting through every project of the KingHe is commissioned to organise and combine the workers and execute the tasksMindfulness is also like that MinisterIt is the organizing activity of the mind necessary for the development of wholesome states of consciousnessIt combines the various other qualities which compose those states puts them to their appropriate tasks and keeps them in proper working orderBy the strength of integrating mindfulness a conscious state of skill functions harmoniously and becomes a wellknit unityThis activity of mindfulness makes the work of the aspirant complete at every stage of his progressIntegrating mindfulness sees all lacks and deficiencies brings in the needed qualities and suitably applies themIt is called the highest wisdom of mindfulness and constitutes the core of the Mindfulness that is included in the Real Way of the Way Factor of Mindfulness and of the Enlightenment Factor of MindfulnessIt is Right Mindfulness in the full sense of the termFrom the foregoing it can be seen that it is mindfulness that holds things together in the mental flux brings them up and prevents them from floating away getting submerged forgotten and lostWithout mindfulness there will be no reconstitution of already acquired knowledge and consciousness itself would break in pieces become fragmentary and be unable to do properly the work of cognitionFurther without mindfulness that has become wisdom the highest kind of mindfulness which includes clear comprehension cognition will be superficial there will not be the knowledge of things gained from different relations and different angles  the work of discernment and discrimination peculiar to selective activity  nor any really constructive understanding  the yield of integration  and so penetrative vision into the full significance of spiritual things will not be reachedWhen one is strongly mindful one plants ones consciousness deep in an object like a firm post well sunk in the ground and withstands the tempestuous clamour of the extraneous by a sublime ignoring of nonessentials But this does not mean that in such a one interest is narrow and his outlook wrongly restrictedStrong mindfulness ignores the unnecessary by adhering to the center of the business in hand and extends its view to important peripheral conditions with a widespreading watchfulness resembling that of the sentinel on a tower scanning the horizon for the glint of armour By such a balance between width and depth mindfulness steers clear of the extremes of lopsided vision and practiceIn the sense of overcoming mental conflict and in the sense of getting rid of all unclarity all incapacity to judge aright and indefiniteness due to mental unquiet mindfulness is a controlling facultyThe controlling faculty of mindfulness makes for the absence of confusion and produces lucidity of thought sound judgment and definiteness of outlookMindfulness accompanied by keen understanding appears as the controlling faculty of mindfulnessMindfulness accompanied by sustained energy is mindfulness considered as a spiritual power and is the quality of earnestness which destroys the wavering of negligenceNegligence is the wandering of the mind in objects of fivefold sensepleasure repeatedly it is the absence of thoroughness of perseverance and of steadfastness in doing good the behavior that is stuck in the mire of worldliness the casting aside of the desire to do what is right the casting aside of the duties which belong to one the absence of practice development and increase of wholesome qualities the lack of right resolve and the want of applicationEarnestness is the opposite of all that negligence connotesAccording to meaning earnestness is the nonneglect of mindfulnessIndeed earnestness is the name for mindfulness that is always active constantly at workEarnestness may also be explained as it has been by some as the four mental aggregates of feeling perception consciousness and formations proceeding with application of mindfulness and clear comprehensionAll that the Buddha taught from the time of his enlightenment to his passing away into the Element of Immortality has been summed up in the sentence strive with earnestness the last words of the MasterEarnestness runs through the whole of the Buddhaword and embraces everything thereIt is like the elephants footprint which is able to contain the footprint of any other animalTherefore did the Blessed One say all wholesome things are founded on earnestness converge on earnestness and earnestness is to be considered as the most excellent of themMindfulness in this sense is found to be the chief characteristic of all skillful actions leading to bliss here and hereafter and tending to ones own and to others profitIt is the force which pushes one to right practice after one has given careful thought to the Buddhas TeachingLife as it is understood in the Dispensation of the Buddha is unsatisfactory until one can through moral joy meditative tranquillity and wise understanding reach mental invulnerability to sufferingThe Way of Mindfulness is understanding and tranquillity illumined by a bright moral characterWithout a blameless happy life of virtue it is not possible to tranquilize the heart or make the intellect keen and clear for spiritual perfectionThe spiritual man is a person of so sensitive and heightened a consciousness that he finds even slight moral guilt burdensome and so he cannot help avoiding all traces of it by a strict adherence to virtueOtherwise owing to remorse at his backslidings and preoccupation with them he will not find the right inner environment and climate for developing the placidity and insight which produce the power of perfect equanimity necessary for changing over from mental slavery to freedomThe cheerful joyous atmosphere which virtue gives is more necessary to the aspirant to Nibbana than anything else to keep him spiritually aliveAlthough the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness does not speak of virtue directly in detail and is principally concerned with the calming of the mind and wise understanding the presence of the virtuefoundation is implied since the instruction on mindfulness is intended for the purification of beings and there is no purification in the Dhamma which does not begin with purification of virtue and it is only after purification of virtue that the wise man develops concentration and wisdom and attains liberationFurther there is enough in the commentary and the explanation to it to prove the importance of virtue to the aspirant and to show how tranquillity and understanding help in protecting the preserving and the perfecting of virtueThe Way of Mindfulness moves towards the equanimity of the fully quieted mind along the firm and sure ground of active virtueBecause of this virtuous basis it is a reliable way to highest security free from the bogs swamps and sloughs of vice and the dangerous futility of inactionAnalysis is a salient feature of the method of arriving at knowledge in the BuddhadhammaThe Buddha is the Master of analytic knowledge and his doctrine is called the Teaching of AnalysisThe Way of Mindfulness is therefore naturally replete with the application of the principles of analysisThe sentient being is radically searched through manifold analysis to see if anything in him is unanalysableOnly that which is relative is analysable only that which is conditioned and dependent on something elseThe absolute the unconditioned and the independent are not analysableIs there anything absolute in the sentient being or is everything in the sentient being relativeThe answer has to be found out by the aspirant after being convinced by valid thought and experience in order to reach the first glimpse of the goalBy training to think along the lines indicated in the Way he will be able to conclude with certainty what the nature of sentient individuality really isOn the immovable basis of such correct knowledge rests the final realization of supra mundane perfectionThe aim of analysis in the Way of the Buddha is to attain correct understanding of the component parts of sentient existence and their relations for rightly grasping the unique totality of the individual that emerges from the relationsOnly a Buddha however has the ability to gauge the uniqueness of individual totality consummatelyBut the important thing to be noted here is that a just and generally accurate perception of the significance of the totality as a thing distinct from every other and possessing a character that clearly is not to be merely described or defined by the parts is the result of the teamwork of the forces of wisdom and concentrated visionAnalysis of the parts lays bare the constituent componentsAnalysis of the relations gives a sense of the totalityAll the differences that make for uniqueness are seen as due to subtle distinctions of relationsAnd the uniqueness of the personality individuality and entirety of a living being depends on the countless number of ever changing relations their infinite variety subtle nuances and endless possibilities in each separate lifefluxThe analytic nature of the Way leads one finally to the vision of the sentient being as a uniquely related totality that transcends the parts and has a character all its ownThe sense of totality to which the logic of analysis leads is realized as true in the intensity of the absorptive or unifying activity of concentrative thoughtHere the development of penetrative insight combines with that of tranquilizing concentration and each functions in a way that does not outstrip the otherBoth gain uniformity of forceThrough the overdoing of analysis there could be agitationAnd indolence creeps in through too much of tranquillitySearching analysis is predominantly intellective and is the work of insightWholehearted acceptance is principally intuitive and springs from the placidity of concentrationIn the sense of yoking and of not letting become overwhelming contemplative balance is reachedThat balance is manifested as the sober serene steadfast acceptance of the truth which analysis revealsThis is a middle wayIt does not overlook any valuable knowledge or experience of the spirit and does not edge sideways but goes straight forward intent on the Real free from all biasesThough it looks within it is aware of what is withoutAlong such a way one can transcend the narrow vision of a barricaded individuality and the indefinable looseness of view of a dissipated and disintegrated spiritThis Middle Way of Mindfulness is clearly not based on revelation dogmas nor vacuous beliefs like those in a Supreme Creator God and an Eternal Soul irrational in the extremeWhat is irrational is not the Teaching of the Buddha though it be found in Buddhist ScripturesOn the contrary Whatever is well said is the Word of the Buddha even when it is not the Masters own utterance because the Blessed One acknowledges Truth wherever and by whomsoever spokenTo raise up the person to a keen sense of awareness in regard to an object and to bring into activity to call forth and stir up the controlling faculty the power the enlightenment factor and the way factor of mindfulness is the Arousing of Mindfulness designedEvery Arousing of Mindfulness in regard to body feeling consciousness or a mental object can be considered as a beginning of the road to insightAnd so these arousings are in a sense startingpoints Further with the Arousing of Mindfulness one wakes up heedfulness intentness and carefulness and is in a state of mental preparedness in regard to any work in handThese Arousings of Mindfulness are many as regards objects but are one in the sense of taking place in a single way of quietude charged with insight that leads to NibbanaAll the four different objects of mindfulness body feeling consciousness and mental objects have to be understood before one reaches sanctitudeAccording to character temperament and cognizing slant one can make however only one of these the preliminary object of contemplationIt is often the case that owing to a lack of proper understanding of oneself one has to try all objects before one gets to know what suits one best for the preliminary workThe choice is made more difficult by the fact that most of us have no clearcut natures and are a mixture of a little of every possible human characteristicIn these circumstances there is no alternative to the method of trial and errorBut the earnest ones will find their way with persistence and sustained effortBy character there are two types determined by the excess of sensuous qualities of craving or of the asensuous qualities of abstract beliefs that make up their personalityThe craving type is generally extrovert the other is generally introvertAccording to temperament there are those whose mental functioning is slow those who are languid mentally and those who are mentally keen the nervous typeBut here it must be understood that the terms languid and nervous have no necessary connection with calm and excitementThe nervous often keep cool when the languid flusterThe nervous type is sensitive but strong and vigorous and keenThe nervous think forcefully and clearlyThe languid are sluggish inert and weak unclear discursive and often mixedup in thoughtCognizing slant is either intuitive or intellectiveAccording to character and temperament the bodyobject is recommended for the languid extravert and the feelingobject for the nervous extrovertFor the languid introvert the consciousnessobject is recommended and for the nervous introvert mental objectsAccording to cognizing slant and temperament the bodyobject is pointed out for the mentally slow who belong to the intuitive kind which makes concentration its vehicle for progress and for the mentally keen of this kind the feelingobjectFor the mentally slow who belong to the intellective kind which makes insight its vehicle the consciousnessobject is recommended and to the mentally keen of this kind the mental objectFurther contemplation on the body destroys the delusion of beauty that on feeling destroys the delusion of pleasure contemplation on consciousness dispels the delusion of permanence and that on mental objects the delusion of the soulThe person who wishes to practice meditation according to the instruction of the Buddha on the Arousing of Mindfulness should first read the discourse with the commentary on the synopsis and get a fair idea of the trend of the teachingToday there are still people as of old who learn the discourse by heart as a preparation to practiceSuch memorizing is helpful to certain typesBut it is not essentialWhat is essential is to think long and deep on the instruction until one gets the hang of its application to daily lifeOnly by repeated reflection on all the implications of it can the discourse be made an effective instrument of mental cultureThe core of the instruction is in the sections dealing with the modes of deportment and clear comprehensionThese are intended for all types of aspirantsThe commentary on these sections is very important and should be carefully studiedThe whole practice of mindfulness depends on the correct grasp of the exercises included in the two parts referred to hereOne should then look through the rest of the exercises in the discourse with the help of the commentary to find a preliminary object of concentration or subject of meditation that accords with ones character temperament and cognizing slant mentioned earlierIf for instance one is an extrovert mentally languid or a person whose cognizing slant is intuitive and is temperamentally slow of mind the contemplation on breathing could well suit that one as a preliminary objectIf one finds the explanation given in the commentary to the discourse on mindfulness on any preliminary object one chooses insufficient one should read the exposition of it in the Path of Purification of our commentatorOne may if a teacher of Buddhist meditation can be found also consult him and ask for elucidation of any difficult points connected with meditative practiceNecessary too to be read by all are the portions of the commentary on the contemplation of feeling and consciousness and those on the hindrances the sensebases and the factors of Enlightenment which give information on the obstacles and aids to concentration on the preliminary objectIn concentration of any preliminary object say the breath if any feeling or thought that interferes with concentration arises then one should contemplate on that interfering phenomenon in a manner that accords to the exposition on feeling consciousness the hindrances or the sensebases in the commentary until the interference disappears and then revert to the preliminary objectSimilarly when attending to the preliminary object any overactiveness or slackness present should be overcome by the method taught in the exposition on the factors of Enlightenment in the commentary and then there will be steady work possible on the object of concentrationIt is useful to bear in mind that either the favorable or the unfavorable qualities increase by pondering over them and decrease by the turning away of attention from themIn beginning to practice mindfulness one has to become aware of ones actions speech and thoughts and drive these towards good as a cowherd his charge to healthy pasturesIt is helpful to get into the habit of preparing the mind before proceeding to act and to pause a while before initiating new activitiesBy such practice one learns to act deliberately consciously and with circumspection and not on the spur of the moment and so does everything prepared to face all consequences and with a proper sense of responsibilityWholetime practice of mindfulness consists in the carrying out of each of the three following activities of contemplation at the proper time attention to the preliminary object of concentration reflection on the modes of deportment and clear comprehensionWhen one is not attending to the preliminary object for one good reason or another one should be reflecting on the modes of deportment or be doing clear comprehensionWholetime practice of mindfulness can be carried out by allThere will however be differences to the degree of intensiveness of the practice according to the busyness of the individualThe more one is busy with external activities the less time will be at his disposal for attending to the preliminary object and also for steady reflection on deportment and for penetratively clear comprehensionOne should therefore try to cut and also slow down as much as one can rightly and reasonably ones external activitiesWho reflects on his movements and clearly comprehends states of activity and rest as taught in the commentary has his mind turned towards selfmasteryThe preliminary object however is the basis of the practice and is the resort of the aspirant or the main object and ground of contemplationThe Way of Mindfulness is the objective way of viewing anything whatsoeverIt reckons just what is present and stopping the garrulity of ones own mind lets the objects speak for themselves and unfold their characterAlso by its patient pursuit of the meaning of things its readiness to see every side of any thought or experience and by its breath and tolerance it predisposes the mind to receive the impressions of truth induces inner pliancy and the mood of spiritual receptivity necessary for highest intuitionSince mindfulness is the only way for anyone who wishes inner happiness men of old irrespective of the school of thought to which they belonged underlined the importance of the Buddhas teaching on this pointIn his Friendly Letter Nagarjuna says The Happy One said that the only way to be walked on is mindfulness directed bodywards therefore keep to it resolutely for if mindfulness is lacking all good Dhamma decays And San tideva in his Bodhicaryavatara says If the mind the tusker maddened with passion is bound completely with the rope of mindfulness then all perils disappear and all blessings come into beingIn the Theravada countries of SouthEast Asia the Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness is wellknown and much appreciatedEspecially so is it in Burma today where monk and layman go from time to time into solitude for training along this Way under the guidance of some meditationmaster In Burmese meditation monasteries each meditator is given a separate cellHe is not allowed to speak to any but the meditation master during the time of trainingNo books and no repetition of formulae are permittedThe business of the meditator is to keep mindfulness going during the whole of the waking stateMaking his inhalations and exhalations the basic subject of meditation he has to be mindful of his postures completely aware of his behavior and to attend to his feelings thoughts and ideas as they arise according to the instructions of the meditation masterSeldom does a stretch of hard training extend over a monthThe aim of the meditation master is to lessen the conceptualizing proclivities of the pupil and lead him towards appreciating the nature of the thing This he does by encouraging bare or pure mindfulness and letting transcience and the other characteristics of the mental and bodily objects become clear by dint of concentrated attention because true understanding of reality must in the last resort be based on profound personal experienceOtherwise it cannot change the character of the meditator in that final and irrevocable way of arahantship contemplated by this methodThe meditation master does not load the pupils mind with all the many particulars found in the commentary but selects what is just necessary for each pupils progress and instructs accordinglyContinued practice of the arousings of mindfulness instills into the meditator the habit of systematic or proper attention regarding the details of a thing and accustoms him to test all phenomena for their inherent characteristics of transience and so forthThus he gradually learns to turn away from the worldlings view of things and look at them by way of condition cause dependent origination element etc and becomes in spirit one with the DhammaThe Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness is one among the discourses often repeated by Buddhists and its traditional importance is seen further by its use as the viaticum to support one passing away from this life to anotherThe use of it as a deathbed discourse points out that mindfulness besides being one of the foremost qualities needed for holy living is also a quality that makes for holy dyingTruly a first and last thingThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was living in the Kurus at Kammasadamma a markettown of the Kuru peopleThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus as follows This is the only way O bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of MindfulnessWhat are the fourHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating the feelings in the feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and griefAnd how O bhikkhus does a bhikkhu live contemplating the body in the bodyHere O bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits down bends in his legs crosswise on his lap keeps his body erect and arouses mindfulness in the object of meditation namely the breath which is in front of himMindful he breathes in and mindful he breathes outHe thinking I breathe in long he understands when he is breathing in long or thinking I breathe out long he understands when he is breathing out long or thinking I breathe in short he understands when he is breathing in short or thinking I breathe out short he understands when he is breathing out shortExperiencing the whole body I shall breathe in thinking thus he trains himselfExperiencing the whole body I shall breathe out thinking thus he trains himselfCalming the activity of the body I shall breathe in thinking thus he trains himselfCalming the activity of the body I shall breathe out thinking thus he trains himselfJust as a clever turner or a turners apprentice turning long understands I turn long or turning short understands I turn short just so indeed O bhikkhus a bhikkhu when he breathes in long understands I breathe in long or when he breathes out long understands I breathe out long or when he breathes in short he understands I breathe in short or when he breathes out short he understands I breathe out short He trains himself with the thought Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in He trains himself with the thought Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out He trains himself with the thought Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in He trains himself with the thought Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe outThus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externallyHe lives contemplating originationthings in the body or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in the bodyOr indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought The body exists to the extent necessary just for knowledge and remembrance and he lives independent and clings to naught in the worldThus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the bodyAnd further O bhikkhus when he is going a bhikkhu understands I am going when he is standing he understands I am standing when he is sitting he understands I am sitting when he is lying down he understands I am lying down or just as his body is disposed so he understands itThus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externallyHe lives contemplating originationthings in the body or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in the bodyOr indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought The body exists to the extent necessary just for knowledge and remembrance and he lives independent and clings to naught in the world Thus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the bodyAnd further O bhikkhus a bhikkhu in going forwards in going backwards is a person practicing clear comprehension in looking straight on in looking away from the front is a person practicing clear comprehension in bending and in stretching is a person practicing clear comprehension in wearing the shouldercloak the robes the bowl is a person practicing clear comprehension in regard to what is eaten drunk chewed and savored is a person practicing clear comprehension in defecating and in urinating is a person practicing clear comprehension in walking in standing in sitting in sleeping in waking in speaking and in keeping silence is a person practicing clear comprehensionThus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and clings to naught in the worldThus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the bodyAnd further O bhikkhus a bhikkhu reflects on just this body hemmed by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the hair down thinking thus There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh fibrous threads bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs contents of stomach intestines mesentery feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat solid fat tars fat dissolved saliva mucus synovic fluid urineJust as if O bhikkhus there were a bag having two openings full of grain differing in kind namely hillpaddy paddy greengram cowpea sesamum rice and a man with seeing eyes having loosened it should reflect thinking thus This is hill paddy this is paddy this is greengram this is cowpea this is sesamum this is rice In the same way O bhikkhus a bhikkhu reflects on just this body hemmed in by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the hair down thinking thus There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh fibrous threads bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs contents of the stomach intestines mesentery feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat solid fat tears fat dissolved saliva mucus synovic fluid urineThus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and clings to naught in the worldThus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the bodyAnd further O bhikkhus a bhikkhu reflects on just this body according as it is placed or disposed by way of the modes of materiality thinking thus There are in this body the mode of solidity the mode of cohesion the mode of caloricity and the mode of oscillationO bhikkhus in whatever manner a clever cowbutcher or a cowbutchers apprentice having slaughtered a cow and divided it by way of portions should be sitting at the junction of a fourcrossroad in the same manner a bhikkhu reflects on just this body according as it is placed or disposed by way of the modes of materiality thinking thus There are in this body the mode of solidity the mode of cohesion the mode of caloricity and the mode of oscillationThus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and clings to naught in the worldThus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the bodyAnd further O bhikkhus if a bhikkhu in whatever way sees a body dead one two or three days swollen blue and festering thrown into the charnel ground he thinks of his own body thus This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that bodyThus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and clings to naught in the worldThus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the bodyAnd further O bhikkhus if a bhikkhu in whatever way sees whilst it is being eaten by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or by different kinds of worms a body that had been thrown into the charnel ground he thinks of his own body thus This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got

and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of MindfulnessThus spoke the Blessed OneSatisfied the bhikkhus approved of his wordsEvam me sutam  Thus have I heard the Discourse on the Arousing of MindfulnessI refers to the Elder Ananda cousin of the BuddhaAt the first Buddhist Council held in the Sattapanna Cave at Rajagaha under the presidentship of the Great Disciple of the Buddha the Elder Maha Kassapa the Collection of the Discourses was recited by the Elder AnandaEkam samayam bhagava Kurusu viharati  At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kurus Although the territory of the Kuru Princes their homeland was a single contiguous domain by taking into consideration its many villages and markettowns it was commonly referred to by the use of the plural form KurusIn the time of the legendary king Mandhatu say the commentators inhabitants of the three continents Pubba Videha Apara Goyana and Uttara Kuru having heard that Jambudipa the birthplace of Sammasambuddhas Paccekabuddhas the Great Disciples of the Buddhas Universal Monarchs and other beings of mighty virtue was an exceedingly pleasant excellent continent came to Jambudipa with the Universal Monarch Mandhatu who was making a tour of all the continents in due order preceded by his Wheel TreasureAnd at last when Mandhatu bodily translated himself by means of his psychic virtue to the Tavatimsa devaloka the heaven of the Thirtythree the people of the three continents who accompanied him to Jambudipa begged of his son for territory to live in as they said they had come carried by the great power of Mandhatu and were now unable by themselves to return to their own continentsTheir prayer was heard and lands were granted to each of the groups of people of the three continentsThe places in which these people settled got the names of the original continents from which they had emigratedThe settlement of people from Pubba Videha came to be known as Videha of those from Apara Goyana as Aparanta and of those from Uttara Kuru as KururatthaKammasadammam nama Kurunam nigamo  At Kammasadamma a markettown of the Kuru people Some explain the word Kammasadamma here spelling it with a dh instead of a d Since Kammasa was tamed here it was called Kammasadamma the place of the taming of KammasaKammasa refers to the cannibal of Kammasapada the one with the speckled black and white or gray colored footIt is said that a wound on his foot caused by a stake healed having become like a piece of wood with lines of fibre of a complex patternTherefore he became wellknown as Kammasapada Speckled FootBy whom was Speckled Foot tamedBy the Great Being the BodhisattaIn which Birthstory is it statedCertain commentators say In the Sutasoma Birthstory But the elders of the Great Minister at Anuradhapura the Maha Vihara say that it is stated in the Jayaddisa BirthstoryKammasapada was tamed weaned of his cannibalism by the Great Being in the circumstances mentioned in the Jayaddisa BirthstoryThe following statement occurs in that storySome however explain spelling the word thus KammasadhammaIt is said that the traditional Kuru virtuous practice became stained in that placeTherefore it was called KammasadhammaThe markettown established there too got the same nameWhy was it not said Kammasadamme Kurunam nigame using the locativeBecause it is said there was no monastery at which the Blessed One could stay in that markettownAway from the markettown however there was a huge dense jungle in a delightful region watered wellIn that jungle the Blessed One lived making the markettown his place for gathering almsEkayano ayam bhikkhave maggo  This is the only way O bhikkhus Why did the Blessed One teach this DiscourseBecause of the ability of the people of the Kurus to take in deep doctrineThe inhabitants of the Kuru country  bhikkhus bhikkhunis upasakas upasikas  by reason of their country being blessed with a perfect climate and through their enjoyment of other comfortable conditions were always healthy in body and in mindThey happy with healthy minds and bodies and having the power of knowledge were capable of receiving deep teachingsTherefore the Blessed One perceiving their ability to appreciate this profound instruction proclaimed to them this Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness which is deep in meaning having set up the subject of meditation in arahantship in twentyone placesFor even as a man having got a golden basket should fill it with divers flowers or indeed having got a golden casket should fill it with precious jewels of the seven kinds the Blessed One having got a following of the Kuruland people dispensed it is said deep doctrineLikewise on that very account there in the Kurus the Blessed One taught other deep teachings the Mahanidana Sutta Mahasatipatthana Sutta Saropama Sutta Rukkhupama Sutta Ratthapala Sutta Magandiya Sutta and the Aneñjasappaya SuttaFurther in that territory of the Kuru people the four classes  bhikkhu bhikkhuni upasaka upasika  generally by nature were earnest in the application of the Arousing of Mindfulness to their daily lifeAt the very lowest even servants usually spoke with mindfulnessAt wells or in spinning halls useless talk was not heardIf some woman asked of another woman Mother which Arousing of Mindfulness do you practice and got the reply None at all then that woman who replied so was reproached thus Your life is shameful though you live you are as if dead and was taught one of the kinds of MindfulnessarousingBut on being questioned if she said that she was practicing such and such an Arousing of Mindfulness then she was praised thus Well done well doneYour life is blessed you are really one who has attained to the human state for you the Sammasambuddhas have come to beWith a perfect climate comfortable conditionsThis includes such items as wholesome food and drink essential for maintaining mind and body unimpairedThe only way  The one wayThere are many words for way The word used for way here is ayanaTherefore This is the only way O bhikkhus  means here A single way O bhikkhus is this way it is not of the nature of a double wayOr it is the only way because it has to be trodden by oneself onlyThat is without a companionThe state of being companionless is twofold without a comrade after abandoning contact with the crowd and in the sense of being withdrawn from craving through tranquillity of mindOr it is called ekayana because it is the way of the oneOf the one  of the best of all beings the Blessed One is bestTherefore it is called the Blessed Ones WayAlthough others too go along that way it is the Buddhas because he creates itAccordingly it is said He the Blessed One is the creator of the uncreated path O Brahman It proceeds only in this Doctrineanddiscipline and not in any otherAccordingly the Master declared Subhadda only in this Doctrineanddiscipline is the Eightfold Way to be found And further ekayana means It goes to the one  that is it goes solely to NibbanaAlthough in the earlier stages this method of meditation proceeds on different lines in the latter it goes to just the one NibbanaAnd that is why Brahma Sahampati saidAs Nibbana is without a second that is without craving as accompanying quality it is called the oneHence it is said Truth is one it is without a secondWhy is the Arousing of Mindfulness intended by the word wayAre there not many other factors of the way namely understanding thinking speech action livelihood effort and concentration besides mindfulnessTo be sure there areBut all these are implied when the Arousing of Mindfulness is mentioned because these factors exist in union with mindfulnessKnowledge energy and the like are mentioned in the analytically expository portionIn the synopsis however the consideration should be regarded as that of mindfulness alone by way of the mental disposition of those capable of being trainedSome however construing according to the stanza beginning with the words They do not go twice to the further shore  say One goes to Nibbana once therefore it is ekayana This explanation is not properBecause in this instruction the earlier part of the Path is intended to be presented the preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulness proceeding in the four objects of contemplation is meant here and not the supramundane Way of MindfulnessAnd that preliminary part of the Path proceeds many times or it may be said that there is many a going on it by way of repetition of practiceIn what sense is it a wayIn the sense of the path going towards Nibbana and in the sense of the path which is the one that should be traversed by those who wish to reach NibbanaRegarding the only way there is the following account of a discussion that took place long agoThe Elder Tipitaka Culla Naga said The Way of Mindfulnessarousing is the preliminary partHis teacher the Elder Culla Summa said The Way is a mixed oneThe pupil Reverend Sir it is the preliminary partThe teacher Friend it is the mixed WayAs the teacher was insistent the pupil became silentThey went away without coming to a decisionOn the way to the bathing place the teacher considered the matterHe recited the DiscourseWhen he came to the part where it is said O bhikkhus should any person maintain the Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner for seven years he concluded that after producing the consciousness of the Supramundane Path there was no possibility of continuing in that state of mind for seven years and that his pupil Culla Naga was rightOn that very day which happened to be the eighth of the lunar fortnight it was the elder Culla Nagas turn to expound the DhammaWhen the exposition was about to begin the Elder Culla Summa went to the Hall of Preaching and stood behind the pulpitAfter the pupil had recited the preliminary stanzas the teacher spoke to the pupil in the hearing of others saying Friend Culla Naga The pupil heard the voice of his teacher and replied What is it Reverend Sir The teacher said this To say as I did that the Way is a mixed one is not rightYou are right in calling it the preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulnessarousing Thus the Elders of old were not envious and did not go about holding up only what they liked as though it were a bundle of sugarcaneThey took up what was rational they gave up what was notThereupon the pupil realising that on a point on which experts of the Dhamma like his learned teacher had floundered fellows of the holy life in the future were more likely to be unsure thought With the authority of a citation from the Discoursecollection I will settle this question Therefore he brought out and placed before his hearers the following statement from the Patisambhida Magga The preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulnessarousing is called the only way And in order to elaborate just that and to show of which path or way the instruction in our Discourse is the preliminary part he further quoted the following also from the Patisambhida Magga The Excellent Way is the Eightfold way four are truths dispassion is the best of things belonging to the wise besides that Way there is no other for the purifying of visionWalk along that Way so that you may confound Death and put an end to sufferingSattanam visuddhiya  For the purification of beings For the cleansing of beings soiled by the stains of lust hatred and delusion and by the defilements of covetise called lawless greed and so forthAll reach the highest purity after abandoning mental taintsBy way of physical taints however there is no cleansing of impurities taught in the DhammaAccordingly it is said Mental taints soil beings mental cleansing sanctifies themSokaparidevanam samatikkamaya  For the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation If this Way is developed it will lead to the casting out of sorrow similar to that experienced by the Minister Santati and the casting out of lamentation similar to that of PatacaraWith analytical knowledge did Santati reach arahantship after hearing this stanzaPatacara reached the fruition of the first stage of arahantship after hearing the followingSince there is nothing called spiritual development without laying hold on something whatsoever in material form feeling consciousness and mental objects they too overcame sorrow and lamentation just by this Way of MindfulnessFor the hearers namely the disciples of the Buddha there is no attainment of the Noble Path possible except by practicing the subject of meditation of the Four TruthsSpiritual development usually called meditation is the development of wisdomJust the contemplation of material form of feeling consciousness or mental objects constitutes the cultivation of the Arousing of MindfulnessDukkha domanassanam atthangamaya  For the destruction of suffering and grief For the cessation of bodily suffering and mental griefThis way maintained by contemplation is conducive to the destruction of suffering similar to that of the Elder Tissa and of grief similar to that of SakkaTissa the head of a family at Savatthi renouncing forty crores of gold became a homeless one and dwelt in a forest far from other human beingsHis sisterinlaw sent a robber band of five hundred to scour the forest in order to find him and ordered them to kill him when he was foundShe sent him it is said in five batches of a hundred each in successionAfter entering the forest and searching for the elder they in due course came to the place in which he lived and sat round himWhen the robbers surrounded him the elder spoke thus Lay disciples why have you come They replied To kill you Then the elder said On a security give me my life for just this one night Said the robbers O recluse who will stand surety for you in a place like this The elder thereupon took a big stone broke the bones of his legs and said Lay disciples is the security of value They leaving the elder went to the end of the ambulatory and lighting a fire lay on the groundThe elder contemplating on the purity of his conduct after suppressing his pain attained arahantship at dawn having fulfilled the recluses regimen in the three watches of the nightGiving expression to his feelings he saidThere is another storyThirty bhikkhus taking the subject of meditation from the Blessed One went into residence during the rains in a forestdwelling agreeing amongst themselves to practice the duty of the recluse during all the three watches of the night and to avoid one anothers presenceOne by one those monks who began to doze early in the morning after doing the recluses duty during the three watches of the night were carried away by a tigerNot one of those carried away did even utter the words I am taken by a tiger When thus fifteen bhikkhus had been devoured on uposatha day after it was asked Friends where are the others and it became known that they had been devoured by a tigerIt was agreed that anyone seized by the tiger thereafter should utter the words I am taken Then a certain young bhikkhu was seized by the tiger in the same circumstances in which the others were seized earlierThat young bhikkhu said Tiger Reverend Sir The other bhikkhus carrying sticks and torches went in pursuit of the tigerThe tiger having taken the young bhikkhu up to a rocky place a broken edge over a hollow spot inaccessible to the bhikkhus began to devour its prey from the feet upwardsThe pursuing bhikkhus said Good man there is nothing that can be done by usThe extraordinary spiritual attainment of bhikkhus is to be seen in such a placeThat bhikkhu even prostrate in the tigers mouth suppressed his pain and developing the wisdom of insight attained the four paths and fruits of sanctitude together with analytical knowledgeThen he uttered this ecstatic utteranceAnd then there is the story of the elder Pitamalla who in the time he was a layman took the pennon for wrestling in three kingdomsHe came to Tambapanni Isle had audience of the king and received royal assistanceOnce while going through the entrance to the Screened Sitting Hall he heard the following passage from the Notyours chapter of Scripture Material form o bhikkhus is not yours renounce itThat renunciation will for a long time be for your welfare and happiness And he thought Neither material form indeed nor feeling is ones own and making just that thought a goad he renounced the worldAt the Great Minister the Maha Vihara at Anuradhapura he was in due course given the lower ordination and the higherWhen he had mastered the two Codes of Discipline he went to the Gavaravaliya Shrine with thirty other bhikkhus and did the duty of the recluseWhile meditating in the open at night there once he was moving on his knees on the ambulatory when his feet were unable to carry him and a hunter mistaking him for a deer struck him with a spearThe elder removed the spear which had gone deep into the body and stopping the wound with a wad of grass sat down on a flat stoneMaking of his misfortune an opportunity for setting energy afoot he developed insight and attained arahantship with analytical knowledgeAfter he had reached the state of arahantship in order to apprise his fellowbhikkhus of his achievement he made a sign by clearing his throat and uttered this saying of joy at final liberation from sufferingThen those fellowmonks of the Elder Pitamalla who had come to see him said Reverend Sir if the Buddha were living he would have expressed his approval of your effort by stretching out his hand over the ocean and stroking your headThree kingdoms  Pandu Cola GolaBecause he was in the habit of carrying a yellow pennon about his body and also because he adorned himself with that pennon when taking part in wrestling matches he was wellknown as Pitamalla the yellow wrestlerAfter his renunciation of the world too he was known as the Elder Yellow WrestlerHe came to Tambapanni Isle  Ceylon  having got the information that wrestlers were honored and hospitably received in the islandSo in this manner this way is conducive to the destruction of suffering of those like the Elder TissaSakka king of the gods after seeing the five portents afraid of death and griefstricken came to the Buddha and asked a question at the close of the answering of that question by the Buddha Sakka was established in the first stage of arahantshipEighty thousand other gods were established together with Sakka in the same stage of sanctityAnd the life of Sakka again was restored to just its original state through his rebirth once more as the king of the godsFurther it is said that Subrahma the god was partaking of the delights of paradise in the company of a thousand heavenly nymphsThere five hundred of the nymphs while picking flowers from a tree died and were reborn in a state of woeHe having seen their rebirth in a state of woe and having understood that the end of his own life was approaching and that he too would at death be reborn in that very state of woe was frightenedThen he went to the Buddha with his five hundred remaining nymphs and said this to the LordThe Blessed One replied to him as followsAt the end of the instruction Subrahma and his five hundred nymphs were established in the first stage of awakening and he it is said returned to his paradise having made firm the heavenly fortunate state of life that was his beforeIt should be understood that this way developed in this manner is conducive to the destruction of grief of those like Sakkañayassa adhigamaya  For reaching the right path The Noble Eightfold Path is called the right pathThis preliminary mundane Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness maintained is conducive to the realisation of the Supramundane WayNibbanassa sacchikiriyaya  For the attainment of Nibbana It is said as follows For the attainment the ocular experience by oneself of the deathless which has got the name Nibbana by reason of the absence in it of the lust called cravingCraving sews together or weaves aggregate with aggregate effect with cause and suffering with beingsIn Nibbana there is no vana Or in the man who has attained to Nibbana there is no vanaOcular experience by oneself Sensing without aid from the outsideThis way maintained effects the attainment of Nibbana graduallyAlthough by the phrase For the purification of beings the things meant by the other phrases which follows it are attained the significance of those other phrases that follow the first is not obvious except to a person familiar with the usage of the DispensationSince the Blessed one does not at first make people conversant with the usage of the Dispensation and after that teach the Doctrine to them and as he by various discourses sets forth various meanings he explained the things which the only way effects with the words For the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation and so forthOr it may be said that the Master explained the things accomplished by the only way in this manner in order to show that every thing which leads to the purification of beings by the only way is dependent on the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation that this overcoming is dependent on the destruction of suffering and grief and that the destruction of suffering and grief is dependent on the reaching of the right path which is in turn dependent on the attainment of NibbanaIt is a declaration of the method of deliverance by the only wayFurther this is an expression of praise of the only way Just as the Blessed One by way of eight characteristics expressed praise in the Cha Chakka Sutta and by way of nine characteristics in the Ariyavamsa Sutta just in the same way he expressed praise of this only way through the seven characteristics contained in the words For the purification of beings and so forthWhy did he utter talk of praise of this kindFor the purpose of bringing out the interest of these bhikkhusThe Blessed One thought Having heard the utterance of praise these bhikkhus will believe that his way casts out the four onrushings namely sorrow produced by distress of heart lamentation characterised by confused talk suffering produced by disagreeable bodily feeling and grief produced by disagreeable thought and that it brings the three extraordinary spiritual attainments of purity knowledge and Nibbana and will be convinced that this instruction should be studied imam dhammadesanam uggahetabbam mastered borne in mind and memorized and that this way should be cultivatedCattaro Satipatthana  The Four Arousings of Mindfulness Four in relation to classes of objects of mindfulnessWhy did the Buddha teach just Four Arousings of Mindfulness and neither more nor lessBy way of what was suitable for those capable of being trainedIn regard to the pair of the dullwitted and the keenwitted minds among tamable persons of the craving type and the theorizing type pursuing the path of quietude or that of insight in the practice of meditation the following is stated For the dullwitted man of craving type the Arousing of Mindfulness through the contemplation of the gross physical body is the Path to Purity for the keenwitted of this type the subtle subject of meditation on the feelingAnd for the dullwitted man of the theorizing type the Path to Purity is the Arousing of Mindfulness through a subject not too full of distinctions namely consciousness for the keenwitted of this type the subject which teems with distinctions namely the contemplation on things of the mind  mental objectsFor the dullwitted man pursuing quietude the First Arousing of Mindfulness bodycontemplation is the Path to Purity by reason of the feasibility of getting at the mental reflex for the keenwitted of this type because he does not continue to stay in the coarse the second Arousing of Mindfulness the contemplation on feeling is the Path to PurityAnd for the dullwitted man pursuing the path of insight the subject of meditation without many distinctions the contemplation on consciousness is the Path to Purity and for the keenwitted of this type the contemplation on mental objects which is full of distinctionsOr it may be said that these Four Arousings of Mindfulness are taught for casting out the illusions concerning beauty pleasure permanence and an egoThe body is uglyThere are people led astray by the illusion that it is a thing of beautyIn order to show such people the ugliness of the body and to make them give up their wrong idea the First Arousing of Mindfulness is taughtFeeling is sufferingThere are people subject to the illusion that it gives pleasureIn order to show such people the painfulness of feeling and to make them give up their wrong idea the Second Arousing of Mindfulness is taughtConsciousness is impermanentThere are people who owing to an illusion believe that it is permanentTo show them the impermanence of consciousness and to wean them of their wrong belief the Third Arousing of Mindfulness is taughtMental objects are insubstantial are soulless and possess no entityThere are people who believe by reason of an illusion that these mental things are substantial endowed with an abiding core or a soul or that they form part of a soul an ego or some substance that abidesTo convince such errant folk of the fact of the soullessness or the insubstantiality of mental things and to destroy the illusion which clouds their minds the Fourth Arousing of Mindfulness is taughtDrawing distinctions it is said Body and feeling are the cause of zestFor the rejection of that zest of body by the dullwitted man of the craving type the seeing of the ugly in the body the coarse object which is the basis of craving is convenientTo that type of man the contemplation on corporeality the First Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to PurityFor the abandoning of that zest by the keenwitted man of the craving type the seeing of suffering in feeling the subtle object which is the basis of craving is convenient and for him the contemplation on feeling the Second Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to PurityFor the dullwitted man of the theorizing type it is convenient to see consciousness in the fairly simple way it is set forth in this discourse by way of impermanence and by way of such divisions as mindwithlust in order to reject the notion of permanence in regard to consciousnessConsciousness is a special condition for the wrong view due to a basic belief in permanenceThe contemplation on consciousness the Third Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity of this type of manFor the keenwitted man of the theorizing type it is convenient to see mental objects or things according to the manifold way set forth in this discourse by way of perception senseimpression and so forth in order to reject the notion of a soul in regard to mental thingsMental things are special conditions for the wrong view due to a basic belief in a soulFor this type of man the contemplation on mental objects the Fourth Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to PurityConsciousness and mental objects constitute the outstanding conditions of theorizingConsciousness is such a condition because it is a decisive factor in the belief in permanenceMental objects are such conditions because these are decisive factors in the belief in a soulConsciousness and mental objects are decisive factors of craving as well as of theorizingAnd body and feeling are decisive factors of theorizing as well as of cravingYet to point out that which is stronger in body and feeling namely craving and that which is stronger in consciousness and mental objects namely theorizing distinctions have been drawnBecause he does not continue to stay in the coarse The keenwitted man pursuing the path of quietude lays hold of the gross subject of meditation but he does not stay in thatHe lays hold of feeling the subtle subject of meditation by way of the factors of absorption after attaining to and emerging from the absorption reached with the material body as subjectSince the heart of the man pursuing the path of insight takes to the contemplation of subtle consciousness and mental object these have been spoken of as the Path to Purity for the man dullwitted or keenwitted pursuing insightFurther these Four Arousings of Mindfulness were taught not only for the purpose of casting out the four illusions but for getting rid of the four floods bonds outflowings knots clingings wrong courses and the penetration of fourfold nutriment tooThis is according to the method of exegesis in the NettipakaranaIn the commentary it is said that by way of remembering and of meeting in one thing the Arousing of Mindfulness is only one and that it is fourfold when regarded as a subject of meditationBy way of remembering by way of the reflection of actions of skill and so forth of body speech and thoughtMeeting in one thing  union in the onenatured NibbanaTo a city with four gates men coming from the East with goods produced in the east enter by the east gate men coming from the South men coming from the West and men coming from the North with goods produced in the north enter by the north gateNibbana is like the cityThe Real Supramundane Eightfold Path is like the citygateBody mind feelings and mental objects are like the four chief directions in spaceLike the people coming from the East with goods produced in the east are those who enter Nibbana by means of bodycontemplation through the Real Supramundane Path produced by the power of bodycontemplation practiced in the fourteen waysLike the people coming from the South are those who enter by means of feelingcontemplation practiced in the nine waysLike the people coming from the West are those who enter by means of consciousnesscontemplation practiced in the sixteen waysLike the people coming from the North are those who enter by means of mentalobjectcontemplation practiced in the five waysOn account of the cause or on account of the sameness of entry into the one Nibbana the Arousing of Mindfulness is said to be just one thingThe meeting in the one Nibbana of the various Arousings of Mindfulness is called the meeting in the one thing on account of participation in that one Nibbana or on account of their becoming all of a kindKatame cattaro  What are the four This is a question indicating the desire to expound the teachingIdha  Here In this DispensationBhikkhave  Bhikkhus This is a term for addressing persons who accept the teachingBhikkhu is a term to indicate a person who earnestly endeavors to accomplish the practice of the teachingOthers gods and men too certainly strive earnestly to accomplish the practice of the teaching but because of the excellence of the bhikkhustate by way of practice the Master said Bhikkhu For amongst those who accept the teaching of the Buddha the bhikkhu is the highest owing to fitness for receiving manifold instructionFurther when that highest kind of person the bhikkhu is reckoned the rest too are reckoned as in regard to a royal procession and the like when the king is reckoned by the reckoning of the king the retinue is reckonedAlso the word bhikkhu was used by the Buddha to point out the bhikkhustate through practice of the teaching in this way He who practices this practice of the Arousing of Mindfulness is called a bhikkhu He who follows the teaching be he a shining one or a human is indeed called a bhikkhuAccordingly it is saidKaye  In the body In the corporeal groupThe group of big and small corporeal constituents namely things like hair of the head hair of the body nails and teeth in the sense of a collection similar to a herd of elephants a concourse of chariots according to grammatical methodFrom here the explanation is by way of wordanalysisAnd as in the sense of a collection so also in the sense of the focus of what is filthy and therefore of what is disgusting is it kaya For the body is the birthplace of the disgusting the exceedingly repellentThe birthplace is the place of originSince these originate from that place it is the place of originWhat originatesThe repulsive things like hair of the headTherefore the body is the place of origin of disgusting or contemptible thingsKayanupassi  Contemplating the body Possessed of the character of bodycontemplation or of observing the bodyWhy is the word body used twice in the phrase Contemplating the body in the body For determining the object and isolating it and for the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact nature of things like continuityBecause there is no contemplating of feeling consciousness nor mental objects in the body but just the contemplating of the body only determination through isolation is set forth by the pointing out of the way of contemplating the body only in the property called the bodyIn the body there is no contemplation of a uniform thing apart from the big and small members of the body or of a man or of a woman apart from such things like the hair of the head and the hair of the bodyThere can be nothing apart from the qualities of primary and derived materiality in a bodyIndeed the character of contemplating the collection of the major and the minor corporeal members is like the seeing of the constituents of a cartThe character of contemplating the collection of the hair of the head the hair of the body and the like is comparable to the seeing of the component parts of a city and the character of contemplating the collection of primary and derived materiality is comparable to the separation of the leaf covering of a plantaintrunk or is like the opening of an empty fistTherefore by the pointing out of the basis called the body in the form of a collection in many ways the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact is shownIn this body apart from the above mentioned collection there is seen no body man woman or anything elseBeings engender wrong belief in many ways in the bare groups of things mentioned aboveTherefore the men of old saidWhat he sees  What man or woman he seesWhy is there no seeing of man or a woman with the eyeThere isI see a woman I see a man  these statements refer to what he sees by way of ordinary perceptionThat perception owing to wrong comprehension does not get at the sensebasis in the highest sense philosophically through the falsely determined condition of material formOr the meaning is the absence of perception which is called the seeing of primary and derived materiality beginning with things such as the hair of the head owing to noncognizability of the collective nature of an object like a man or woman by eyeconsciousnessWhat is seen that he does not properly see  He does not see according to reality by the eye of wisdom the sensebasis which exists the collection of primary and derived materiality beginning with hair of the head and the likeNot seeing properly he is shackled  Not seeing this body as it actually is with the eye of wisdom he thinks This is mine this am I this is my self and is bound with the fetter of defilementAnd here by the passage For the determining of the object by isolating it and for the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact nature of things like continuity this too should be understood This person contemplates in this body only the body he does not contemplate anything elseWhat does this meanIn this definitely transient suffering soulless body that is unlovely he does not see permanence pleasure a soul nor beauty after the manner of those animals which see water in a mirageBodycontemplation is only the contemplation of the collection of qualities of transiency suffering soullessness and unlovelinessBecause there is no contemplating of the body with reference to a self or to anything belonging to a self owing to the contemplating even of collections of things like the hair of the head there is the character of contemplating in the body the body which is a collection of things like the hair of the headThe meaning should be understood thus too contemplating the body in the body is the seeing of the body as a group of all qualities beginning with impermanence step by step as taught in the passage of the Patisambhida which begins with In this body he contemplates according to impermanence and not permanenceThe bhikkhu sees the body in the body as something impermanent as something subject to suffering as something that is soulless by way of turning away from it and not by way of delighting in it by freeing himself of passion for it with thoughts making for cessation and not making for origination and not by way of laying hold of it but by way of giving it upViharati  LivesAtapi  Ardent What burns the defilement of the three planes of becoming is ardourArdour is a name for energyAlthough the term burning is applied to the abandoning of defilements here it is also applicable to right view thought speech action livelihood mindfulness and concentrationAs ardour like glow is restricted by use to just energy generally it is said ardour is a name for energy Or because of the occurrence of energy by way of instigating the associated things in the abandoning of opposing qualities that itself is ardour atapaIn this place only energy is referred to by atapa By taking the word ardent the Master points out the one possessed of right energy or exertionSampajano  Clearly comprehending Endowed with knowledge called circumspectionClearly comprehending  Discerning rightly entirely and equallyRightly  CorrectlyEntirely  By knowing in all waysEqually  By reason of proceeding through the conveying of higher and higher spiritual attainmentsSatima  Mindful Endowed with mindfulness that lays hold of the body as a subject of meditation because this yogavacara contemplates with wisdom after laying hold of the object with mindfulnessThere is nothing called contemplation without mindfulnessTherefore the Master said Mindfulness is necessary in all circumstances O bhikkhus I declareNecessary in all circumstances  Everywhere in the state of becoming in every sluggish and unbalanced state of mind it is desirableOr that by the help of which the other proper Factors of Enlightenment are capable of being developed is necessary in all circumstances Here contemplation takes place by means of wisdom that is assisted by mindfulnessTo point out the things by the influence of which the meditation of the yogi prospers is the purpose of the words Ardent clearly comprehending and mindfulTo the nonardent state of mind there is the obstacle of mental lassitudeThe state of mind that is not clearly comprehending commits blunders of judgment in the business of choosing the right means and in avoiding the wrongThe state of mind which is inattentive  the mental state of absence of mindfulness  is incapable of laying hold of the right means and of rejecting the wrong meansWhen the yogi is not ardent not clearly comprehending and not mindful he does not succeed in accomplishing his objectMental lassitude  Inward stagnationIndolence is the meaningRight means  Things like the purification of virtueAfter the pointing out of the things that make up the condition connected with the Arousing of Mindfulness through bodycontemplation there is the pointing out of the things that make up the condition which should be abandoned in this practice with the words having overcome in this world covetousness and grief  Vineyya loke abhijjhadomanassamArousing of MindfulnessHere bare mindfulness is meantTherefore the commentator speaks of the things that make up the condition connected with the Arousing of Mindfulness These things are energy and so forth associated necessarily with mindfulnessCondition  reasonMindfulness denotes concentration too here on account of the inclusion of mindfulness in the aggregate of concentrationOr since the exposition is on mindfulness and as neither the abandoning of defilements nor the attainment of Nibbana is wrought by mindfulness alone and as mindfulness does not also occur separately the pointing out the things that make up the condition connected with the Arousing of Mindfulness is like the pointing out of the condition connected with absorptionCondition is a synonym for constituentInitial application sustained application interest joy and onepointedness of mind are together with absorption as energy and the other qualities are with mindfulnessHaving overcome refers to the discipline of knocking out an evil quality by its opposite good or through the overcoming of evil part by part and through the disciplining or the overcoming of the passions by suppression in absorptionPreliminary practice connected with the mundane path of mindfulness is pointed out by the commentator hereIn this world In just this bodyHere the body is the world in the sense of a thing crumblingAs covetousness and grief are abandoned in feeling consciousness and mental objects too the Vibhanga says Even the five aggregates of clinging are the worldCovetousness stands for sense desire and grief for angerAs sense desire and anger are the principal hindrances the abandoning of the hindrances is stated by the overcoming of covetousness and griefWith covetousness are abandoned the satisfaction rooted in bodily happiness delight in the body and the falling into erroneous opinion which takes as real the unreal beauty pleasure permanence and substantiality of the bodyWith the overcoming of grief are abandoned the discontent rooted in bodily misery the nondelight in the culture of bodycontemplation and the desire to turn away from facing the real ugliness suffering impermanence and insubstantiality of the bodyBy the instruction dealing with the overcoming of covetousness and grief yogic power and yogic skill are shownYogic power is the power of meditationYogic skill is dexterity in yoking oneself in meditationFreedom from satisfaction and discontent in regard to bodily happiness and misery the forbearing from delighting in the body the bearingup of nondelight in the course of bodycontemplation the state of being not captivated by the unreal and the state of not running away from the real  these when practiced produce yogic power and the ability to practice these is yogic skillThere is another method of interpretation of the passage lives contemplating the body in the body ardent and so forthContemplating refers to the subject of meditationLives lives protecting the subject of meditation which here is the bodyIn the passage beginning with ardent Right Exertion is stated by energy the subject of meditation proper in all circumstances or the means of protecting the subject of meditation is stated by mindfulness and clear comprehension or the quietude that is obtained by way of the contemplation on the body is stated by mindfulness insight by clear comprehension and the fruit of inner culture through the overcoming of covetousness and griefThe subject of meditation useful in all circumstances is stated by referring to mindfulness and clear comprehension because through the force of these two qualities there is the protection of the subject of meditation and suitability of attention for its unbroken practiceFurther of these two qualities mindfulness and clear comprehension the following is stated in the commentary to the Atthasalini Mula Tika To all who have yoked themselves to the practice of any subject of meditation to all yogis these two are things helpful at all times for the removal of obstruction and the increase of inner cultureVedanasu Vedananupassi citte cittanupassi dhammesu dhammanupassi viharati  He lives contemplating feeling in the feelings the consciousness in consciousness mental object in mental objects Here the repetition of feelings consciousness and mental objects should be understood according to the reasons given for the repetition of the word body in bodycontemplationFeeling  The three feelings pleasurable painful and the neither pleasurable nor painfulThese are only mundaneThe word feelings is repeated to limit the object by isolating it for the analysis of the apparently compact and for such other purposes in order to prevent any straying from the contemplation on feelings to some other objectErratic contemplation takes place because of the connection of the other nonmaterial aggregates with feelings and because of the dependence of nonmaterial things like feelings on material form in the fiveconstituentexistence or the sensuous plane of becomingBy the repetition of the word the limiting of the object by isolating it is shown through the pointing out of only a doer of feelingcontemplation in the property called feeling as there is no contemplating of the body or consciousness or mental objects in feeling but only the contemplating of feelingAs in this matter of feeling when a pleasurable feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the other two and when a painful feeling or a neither pleasurable nor painful feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the remaining ones so is shown the analysis of the apparently compact the absence of permanence by the pointing out of different feelings after penetrating them severally and not having spoken of the state of feeling in a general wayThrough the noticing of feelings as lasting just for the measure of a moment in time the seeing of impermanence is made clearThrough the same cognizance suffering and soullessness too are seenFor the analysis of the apparently compact and for such other purposesBy the words And for such other purposes the following should be understood This yogavacara contemplates just feelings and not any other thing because he is not one who contemplates by way of the lovely after the manner of a fool who sees a gem in a bubble of water which has not the quality of a gemHe does not see in this foolish way even in the stable instant when he experiences a pleasant feelingMuch more so does he not stray away into fanciful thinking in regard to the two remaining feelings of pain and indifferenceOn the other hand he contemplates along the real way of impermanence soullessness and the unlovely by way of momentary dissolution lack of power to control and the trickling of the dirt of defilement and distinctively contemplates suffering as the pain of vicissitude and of the formations or the constituents of lifeConsciousness is only mundane and mundane too are mental objectsThis statement will be made evident in the analytically expository portionIn the way mentioned above should the repetition of words in the contemplation of consciousness and mental objects be explained tooOnly mundane as connected with the examining of mundane objects of thought in the light of impermanence suffering and soullessnessTo be sure in whatever way feeling is to be exclusively contemplated here the contemplating in that very way is the meaning of the word Contemplating feelings in the feelingsIn the contemplation of consciousness and mental objects too this is the methodHow should feeling be contemplated upon it is asked furtherPleasurable feeling because it is the stuff of suffering as sufferingPainful feeling because it is the condition of bringing out trouble and so forth as a thornAnd the neither pleasurable nor painful feeling because of nonmastery or dependence and so forth as transiencyBy the passage beginning with the words To be sure in whatsoever way the commentator points to the limit of the objectAccordingly the Master saidWho sees pleasure as suffering  Who sees feelings by way of the suffering natural to change with the eye of wisdomWho sees pain as a thorn  Who sees painful feeling as damage causing piercing in and as a thing hard to drive outThe neutral peace  The feeling of indifference is peaceful owing to the absence of grossness as in states of pain and pleasure and by way of a restful natureWho sees feelings with the thought that they are impermanent by reason of their becoming nonexistent after having come to be owing to their being characterised by the qualities of arising and passing away owing to their temporariness and owing to their being in a state of constant negation is he who sees the neutral peace of the neither pleasurable nor painful feelings as fleeting and is indeed the bhikkhu who will rightly know and live become stillRightly  CorrectlyKnow  know feelings as they areFurther just all feelings should be contemplated with the thought These are suffering indeedSuffering is what it is because of the ill natural to the constituents of lifeFor this has been said by the Blessed One All that is felt is in suffering I declare yam kiñci vedayitam tam sabbam dukkhasminti vadamiAll that is in suffering  Everything experienced is plunged included in suffering because the ill natural to the formations the constituents in life cannot be conqueredAnd pleasure should also be contemplated upon as sufferingAll should be explained according as the arahantnun Dhammadinna spoke Pleasant feeling friend Visakha is agreeable while it lasts and is disagreeable when it changes painful feeling is disagreeable while it lasts and agreeable when it changes the neither pleasant nor painful feeling is agreeable when there is a knowledge of its existence and disagreeable when that knowledge is wantingThe three feelings should be contemplated upon as pleasant and painfulWhen the first occurs the second changes and the third is known then feeling is pleasantWhen the first changes the second occurs and the third is not known then feeling is painfulThe feelings should also be seen according to the seven contemplations beginning with that of impermanence mentioned aboveThe remaining division beginning with the worldly and spiritual feelings in the classification of pleasurable feeling and so forth in feelingcontemplation will become clear in the analytical expositionConsciousness and mental objects too should be contemplated upon by way of the diversity of the division of object arammana dominance conascence plane causal action result noncausative functional process and so forth beginning with impermanence and by way of the division of consciousness that is with passion and so forth come down in the portion of analytical expositionOr the divisions of object noncausative functional process and so forthContemplation should be done by way of the division of the blue and so forth pertaining to the variety of objects visual and so forth by way of the division of the spontaneous and nonspontaneous consciousness absorption with initial application and so forth pertaining to the variety of conditions of conascence of knowledge absorption and so forth by way of the division of lofty middling and so forth pertaining to the diverse planes sensuous and so forth by way of the division of conduciveness to devaplanerebirth and so forth pertaining to the diverse kind of moral action of skill and so forth by way of the division of the state of requital which could be perceived in this very present condition of life and so forth pertaining to the variety of dark and bright resultants of evil and good deeds kanha sukka vipaka nanattassa dittha dhamma vedaniyatadi tabbhedassa by way of the division of the three good conditions of rebirth and so forth pertaining to noncausative functional diversity of the sensuous plane and so forthMental objects should be contemplated upon by way of own characteristic of impression and the like by way of general characteristic of impermanence and the like by way of phenomenonemptiness namely by way of the voidnature called soullessness to explain which clearly the instruction of the portion dealing with the void in the Abhidhamma proceeded by means of the statement beginning with At that time indeed there are phenomena there are aggregates without any mention of a soul by way of the seven contemplations of impermanence and so forth and by way of the divisions of what is present and what is absent and so forth in the analytical portionIf in the meditators body called the world covetousness and grief are abandoned in the worlds of his feelings and so forth too these are abandoned owing to the earlier abandoning of these by the yogiStill everywhere the abandoning of the defilements has been stated by way of the different types of persons and by way of the diversity of the thoughtunit in which the development of the different subjects of the Arousing of Mindfulness takes placeOr it should be understood thus It is stated in this manner in order to indicate that the abandoning of the defilements in one object implies the abandoning of the defilements in the remaining objectsTherefore it is not fit to speak again of the abandoning of these for while the defilements are abandoned they are not abandoned separately in one object after another  ie the defilements pertaining to the body for instance are not first abandoned and then those belonging to the feeling and so forth in succession but the defilements of all objects are abandoned when the defilements are abandoned in one objectThat is due to the fact that only the defilements which can arise in the future are capable of being abandoned through the scorching out of the causes by the attainment of the Path or through measures that make the causes temporarily impotent because of the observance of virtue and the development of absorptionPast defilements and those arising in the present are beyond the scope of abandoningThe abandoning of the defilements of one object in the thoughtunit of the Path is indeed the abandoning of the defilements of all objectsIt is right to say that by the Path are the defilements abandonedThe abandoning of the defilements of one person is not necessarily the abandonding of the defilements of another personReference to the different types of persons is made to point this fact of possible difference of method by way of objectThe diversity of the thoughtunitThe mundane thoughtunit is meant as the preliminary path is dealt with hereWhat is abandoned temporarily by mundane meditation in the body is not suppressed in the feelings and the other objectsEven if covetousness and grief should not occur in the feelings and the other objects when it is suppressed in the body it should not be stated that owing to efficient rejection by meditation opposed to covetousness and grief there is no covetousness and grief in the other objects such as feelings and in the case of suppression by meditation therefore it is fit to speak of the rejection of covetousness and grief again in feelings and the other objectsThe defilements abandoned in one object are abandoned in the remaining objects tooThis statement refers to the supramundane meditation of MindfulnessarousingIn the case of mundane meditation the rejection is stated everywhere with reference to bare nonoccurrence of the defilementsIn regard to the four objects of contemplation through the Arousing of Mindfulness it is said in the Vibhanga thus Even the Five Aggregates are the worldNow the Blessed One desirous of bringing about diverse kinds of attainments of distinction in beings by the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness began to teach the analytically explanatory portion with the word And how o bhikkhusHe did that after dividing into four the one mindfulness that is right by way of the contemplation on the body on feelings on consciousness and on mental objectsThe Blessed Ones exposition of the Arousing of Mindfulness is similar to the action of a worker in mat and basket weaving who wishing to make coarse and fine mats boxes cases and the like should make those goods after getting a mammoth bamboo splitting it into four and reducing each of the parts to stripsIdha bhikkhave bhikkhu  Here o bhikkhus a bhikkhuHere In this Dispensation of the Buddha which provides the basis for the person producing bodycontemplation in all modesBy the word here dispensations other than the Buddhas are excluded as they do not teach bodycontemplation in the complete way it is taught in the BuddhadhammaFor this is said Here is the recluse untenanted by recluses are the other opposing ways of thoughtThe person producing bodycontemplation in all modesAs sects outside the Buddhas Dispensation also produce a part of this contemplation by their words the Buddhas disciples complete knowledge or allround grasp of this contemplation when it is practiced by him is toldAraññagato va suññagaragato va  Gone to the forest or to an empty place By this here is the making clear of the getting of an abode appropriate to the meditator for the culture of mindfulnessThe mind of the meditator which for a long time had dwelt on visual and other objects does not like to enter the road of meditation and just like a wild young bull yoked to a cart runs off the roadA cowherd wishing to tame a wild calf nourished entirely on the milk of a wild cow ties that calf after leading it away from the cow to a stout post firmly sunk in the ground at a spot set apart for itThat calf having jumped hither and thither and finding it impossible to run away from here will crouch down or lie down at that very postEven so must the bhikkhu who is desirous of taming the wild mind nourished long on the tasty drink of visible and other objects tie that mind to the post of the object of mindfulnessarousing with the rope of remembrance after leading the mind from visible and other objects and ushering it into a forest to the foot of a tree or into an empty placeThe mind of the bhikkhu will also jump hither and thitherNot obtaining the objects it had long grown used to and finding it impossible to break the rope of remembrance and run away it will finally sit or lie down at that every object by way of partial and full absorptionTherefore the men of old saidIn this way this abode becomes appropriate in the meditatorTherefore it is said This is the making clear of an abode appropriate to the meditator for the culture of mindfulnessBecause the subject of meditation of mindfulness on inandoutbreathing is not easy to accomplish without leaving the neighbourhood of a village owing to sound which is a thorn to absorption and because in a place not become a township it is easy for the meditator to lay hold of this subject of meditation the Blessed One pointing out the abode suitable for that spoke the words Gone to the forest and so forthThe Buddha is like a master of the science of building sites because of the pointing out by him of the suitable abode for yogisAs a master in the science of selecting building sites after seeing a stretch of ground good for building a town and after considering it well from all sides advises Build the town here and when the building of the town is happily completed receives high honor from the royal family so the Buddha having well considered from all points the abode suitable for the meditator advises Here should the subject of meditation be yoked on to When arahantship is gradually reached by the yogi by the expression of the yogis gratitude and admiration with the words Certainly the Blessed One is the Supremely Awakened One the Master receives great honorThe bhikkhu indeed is comparable to a leopard because like the leopard he lives alone in the forest and accomplishes his aim by overcoming those contrary to him namely the passionsJust as a great king of leopards concealed in the forest in grassbush junglebush or hillthicket seizes wild buffaloes elks pigs and other beasts this bhikkhu yoking himself to the subject of meditation gains the Four Real Paths and Fruits one after another in succession and therefore the men of old saidAnd so the Blessed One pointing out the forest abode the fit place for speedy exertion in the practice of meditation said Gone to the forest and so forthNisidati pallankam abhujitva ujum kayam panidhaya parimukham satim upatthapetva so satova assasati sato passasati  Sits down bends in his legs crosswise on his lap keeps is body erect and arouses

during a long stretch of time desire arises in himWith desire he breathes in a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time with desire he breathes out a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time and with desire he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of timeAs with desire he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of time joy arises in himWith joy he breathes in a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time with joy he breathes out a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time and with joy he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of timeAs with joy he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of time the mind turns away from the long inandoutbreathings and equanimity stands firmSabbakayapatisamvedi Assasissami passasissamiti sikkhati  Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in breathe out thinking thus he trains himself He trains himself with the following idea I shall breathe in making known making clear to myself the beginning middle and end of the whole body of breathings in I shall breathe out making known making clear to myself the beginning middle and end of the whole body of breathings outAnd he breathes in and breathes out with consciousness associated with knowledge making known making clear to himself the breathsTo one bhikkhu indeed in the tenuous diffused body of in breathing or body of outbreathing only the beginning becomes clear not the middle or the endHe is able to lay hold of only the beginningIn the middle and at the end he is troubledTo another the middle becomes clear and not the beginning or the endTo a third only the end becomes clear the beginning and the middle do not become clear and he is able only to lay hold of the breath at the endHe is troubled at the beginning and at the middleTo a fourth even all the three stages become clear and he is able to lay hold of all he is troubled nowhereFor pointing out that this subject of meditation should be developed after the manner of the fourth one the Master said Experiencing He trains himselfSince in the earlier way of the practice of this meditation there was nothing else to be done but just breathing in and breathing out it is said He thinking I breathe in understands and since thereafter there should be endeavor for bringing about knowledge and so forth it is said Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe inPassambhayam kayasamkharam assasissamiti passasissamiti sikkhati  Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in breathe out thinking thus he trains himself He thinks  I shall breathe in and I shall breathe out quieting making smooth making tranquil and peaceful the activity of the inandoutbreathing bodyAnd in that way he trains himselfIn this connection coarseness fineness and calm should be understood thus Without contemplative effort the body and the mind of this bhikkhu are distressed coarseWhen the body and the mind are coarse the inandoutbreathings too are coarse and proceed uncalmly the nasal aperture becomes inadequate and he has to breathe through the mouth tooBut when the body and the mind are under control then the body and the mind become placid restfulWhen these are restful the breathings proceed so fine that the bhikkhu doubts whether or not the breathings are going onThe breathing of a man who runs down from a hill puts down a heavy burden from his head and stands still is coarse his nasal aperture becomes inadequate and he breathes through the mouth tooBut when he rids himself of his fatigue takes a bath and a drink of water and puts a wet cloth over his heart and is sitting in the shade his breathing becomes fine and he is at a loss to know whether it exists or notComparable to that man is the bhikkhu whose breaths become so fine after the taking up of the practice of contemplation that he finds it difficult to say whether he is breathing or notWhat is the reason for thisWithout taking up the practice of meditation he does not perceive concentrate on reflect on or think over the question of calming the gross activity of the breathing body the breaths but with the practice of meditation he doesTherefore the activity of the breathbody becomes finer in the time in which meditation is practiced than in the time in which there is no practiceSo the men of old saidHow does he train himself with the thought Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in breathe outWhat are the activities of the bodyThose things of the body of breaths those things bound up with that body are the activities of the bodyCausing the bodyactivities to become composed to become smooth and calm he trains himself He trains himself thinking thus Calming the bodyactivity by way of the bodily activities of bending forwards sidewards all over and backwards and the moving quivering vibrating and quaking of the body I shall breathe in I shall breathe outI shall breathe in and I shall breathe out calming the activity of the body by way of whatsoever peaceful and fine bodyactivities of nonbending of the body forwards sidewards all over and backwards of nonmoving nonquivering nonvibrating and nonquaking of the bodyIndeed to that yogi training in respirationmindfulness according to the method taught thus He thinking I breathe in long understands when he is breathing in long Calming the activity of the body I breathe out thinking thus he trains himself the four absorptions arise in the respiration signIn the respiration sign  In the reflex imageHaving emerged from the absorption he lays hold of either the respiration body or the factors of absorptionThere the meditating worker in respiration examines the body thinking thus Supported by what is respirationSupported by the basisThe basis is the coarse bodyThe coarse body is composed of the Four Great Primaries and the corporeality derived from theseThe worker in respiration examines the respiration while devoting himself to the development of insight through the means of corporealityThe basis namely the coarse body is where the mind and mental characteristics occurThereupon he the worker in respiration cognizes the mind in the pentad of mental concomitants beginning with senseimpressionThe first beginning with senseimpression are senseimpression feeling perception volition and consciousnessThey are taken here as representative of mindThe worker in respiration examines the mind and the body sees the Dependent Origination of ignorance and so forth and concluding that this mind and this body are bare conditions and things produced from conditions and that besides these there is neither a living being nor a person becomes to that extent a person who transcends doubtBesides these phenomena there is neither a living being nor a person refers to vision that is purifiedMindandbody is a bare impersonal processIt is not unrelated to a cause and also not related to a discordant cause like god but is connected with a cause like ignoranceA person who has transcended doubt regarding the past the future and the presentAnd the yogi who has transcended doubt while cultivating insight applies the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and soullessness to the mind and body together with the conditions and gradually reaches arahantshipApplies the three characteristics in order to grasp the qualities of the aggregates according to the method taught in the Anatta Lakkhana Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya beginning with the words Whatsoever formThe worker in absorption namely he who contemplates upon the factors of absorption also thinks thus Supported by what are these factors of absorptionBy the basisThe basis is the coarse bodyThe factors of absorption are here representative of the mindThe coarse body is the bodyHaving determined thus he searching for the reason of the mind and the body seeks it in Conditions Mode beginning with ignorance concludes that this mind and the body comprise just conditions and things produced by conditions and that besides these there is neither a living being nor a person and becomes to that extent a person who transcends doubtAnd the yogi who transcends doubt thus while cultivating insight applies the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and soullessness to the mind and the body together with conditions and gradually reaches arahantshipIti ajjhattam va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally This bhikkhu dwells in contemplation of the body in his own respiration bodyBy way of the practice of quietude however there is no arising of the sign of full absorption in anothers respirationbodyBahiddha va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally Or this bhikkhu dwells in contemplation of the body in anothers respirationbodyOr in anothers respirationbodyThis portion deals with reflection for the growth of insight and has no reference to the growth of full absorption of quietudeAjjhattabahiddha va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally At one time in his own and at another in anothers respirationbody he dwells in contemplation of the bodyBy this there is reference to the time when the yogis mind moves repeatedly back and forth without laying aside the familiar subject of meditationWithout leaving aside at intervals nor from time to time nor occasionallyThe time when the mind moves repeatedly back and forthOr the time when the meditation proceeds incessantly in the internal and external phenomenaBoth cannot occur at onceThis pair of things stated in combination as internal and external cannot be found in the form of an object at one time simultaneouslyIt is not possible to objectify together is the meaningSamudayadhammanupassi va kayasamim viharati  He lives contemplating originationthings in the body Just as the air moves back and forth depending on the smiths bellows skin the bellows spout and appropriate effort so depending on the coarse body nasal aperture and the mind of the bhikkhu the respirationbody moves back and forthThe things beginning with the body are origination kayadayo dhamma samudayoThe person who sees thus is he who lives contemplating originationthings in the bodyVayadhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati  Or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body In whatever way the air does not proceed when the bellows skin is taken off the bellows spout is broken and the appropriate exertion is absent even in that same way when the body breaks up the nasal aperture is destroyed and the mind has ceased to function the respirationbody does not go onThus through the ending of the coarse body the nasal aperture and the mind there comes to be the ending of the respirationsThe person who sees in this way is he who lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the bodySamudayavayadhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati  Or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in the body He lives contemplating origination at one time and dissolution at anotherOrigination is that from which suffering arisesContemplating originationthingsPossessing the character of contemplation connected with the coarse body the nasal aperture and the mind the cause of the respirationsAs the contemplation on originationanddissolutionthings too is split up as regards the scope of the object it is not possible to objectify both origination and dissolution at the same timeAtthi kayoti va panassa sati paccupatthita hoti  Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought The body exists Mindfulness is established for the yogi through careful scrutinyHe thinks There is the body but there is no being no person no woman no man no soul nothing pertaining to a soul no I nothing that is mine no one and nothing belonging to anyoneYavadeva  To the extent necessary It denotes purposeThis is said The mindfulness established is not for another purposeWhat is the purpose for which it is establishedNanamattaya patissatimattaya  For just knowledge and remembrance That is just for the sake of a wider and wider or further and further measure of knowledge and of mindfulnessFor the increase of mindfulness and clear comprehension is the meaningFor the purpose of reaching the knowledge of bodycontemplation to the highest extent is the meaning of To the extent necessary for just knowledgeAnissito ca viharati  And he lives independent He lives emancipated from dependence on craving and wrong viewsWith these words is stated the direct opposition of this meditation to the laying hold on craving and wrong viewsNa ca kiñci loke upadiyati  And clings to naught in the world In regard to no visible shape or consciousness does he think this is my soul or this belongs to my soulEvampi  Thus alsoWith this expression the Blessed One wound up the instruction on the section on breathingIn this section on breathing the mindfulness which examines the respirations is the Truth of SufferingThe precraving which brings about that mindfulness is the Truth of OriginationThe nonoccurrence of both is the Truth of CessationThe Real Path which understands suffering abandons origination and takes cessation as object is the Truth of the WayThus having endeavored by way of the Four Truths a person arrives at peaceThis is the portal to emancipation of the bhikkhu devoted to meditation on breathingThe Buddha after dealing in the aforesaid manner with bodycontemplation in the form of respirationmeditation in detail said And further in order to deal exhaustively with bodycontemplation here according to the meditation on the modes of deportmentGacchanto va gacchamiti pajanati  When he is going understands I am going In this matter of going readily do dogs jackals and the like know when they move on that they are movingBut this instruction on the modes of deportment was not given concerning similar awareness because awareness of that sort belonging to animals does not shed the belief in a living being does not knock out the percept of a soul and neither becomes a subject of meditation nor the development of the Arousing of MindfulnessGoingThe term is applicable both to the awareness of the fact of moving on and to the knowledge of the characteristic qualities of moving onThe terms sitting standing and lying down too are applicable in the general sense of awareness and in the particular sense of knowledge of the characteristic qualitiesHere the particular and not the general sense of awareness is to be takenFrom the sort of mere awareness denoted by reference to canines and the like proceeds the idea of a soul the perverted perception with the belief that there is a doer and an experiencerOne who does not uproot or remove that wrong perception owing to nonopposition to that perception and to absence of contemplative practice cannot be called one who develops anything like a subject of meditationBut the knowledge of this meditator sheds the belief in a living being knocks out the idea of a soul and is both a subject of meditation and the development of the Arousing of MindfulnessIndeed who goes whose going is it on what account is this goingThese words refer to the knowledge of the going of the meditating bhikkhuIn the elucidation of these questions the following is said Who goesNo living being or person whatsoeverWhose going is itNot the going of any living being or personOn account of what does the going take placeOn account of the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activityBecause of that this yogi knows thus If there arises the thought I shall go that thought produces the process of oscillation the process of oscillation produces expressionThe moving on of the whole body through the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called goingThe same is the method of exposition as regards the other postures standing and so forthThere too the yogi knows thus If there arises the thought I shall stand that thought produces the process of oscillationThe process of oscillation produces bodily expressionThe raising upright of the whole body from below owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called standingIf there arises the thought I shall sit that thought produces the process of oscillationThe process of oscillation produces bodily expressionThe bending of the lower part of the body and the raising upright of the upper part of the body owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called sittingIf there arises the thought I shall lie down that thought produces the process of oscillationThe process of oscillation produces bodily expressionThe straightening or the spreading of the whole body horizontally or across owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called lying downThere who goesis a doerquestion of the action of going without first separating efficient cause and action With the words whose going is it the commentator says the same thing in another way after separating efficient cause and action for making clear the absence of a doerconnectionOn what account is itThis is a question for the real reason of the action of going from which the idea of a goer is rejectedGoing is here shown to be one of the particular modes of bare phenomenal movement due to appropriate causeandcondition without attributing it to a fallacious reason such as the one formulated thus The soul comes into contact with the mind the mind with the senseorgans and the senseorgans with the objectNo living being or person because of the proving of the going of only a bare phenomenon and because of the absence of anyone besides that phenomenonNow to show proof of the going of a bare phenomenon the words beginning with on account of the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity were spoken by the commentatorThere mental activity and the diffusion and agitation in the process of oscillation which is mental activity  diffusion of the process of mental activityThe commentator by mentioning mental activity eschews the diffusion of the process of oscillation connected with inanimate things and by the mention of the diffusion of the process of oscillation eschews the class of mental activity producing volitional verbalexpressionBy the terms mental activity and the process of oscillation the commentator makes clear bodily expressionProduces the process of oscillationBrings about the group of materiality with the quality of oscillation in excessThis group of materiality is that of the pure octad consisting of the Four Great Primaries symbolized by earth water fire and air and the four derived from these color smell taste and nutritive essenceExcess is to be taken here by way of capability and not by way of measureThe process of oscillation produces expressionThis was said concerning the process of oscillation arisen from the thought of goingThis process is a condition to the supporting with energy the bearing up and the movement of the conascent body of materialityExpression is that change which takes place together with the intentionOscillation is mentioned by way of a predominant condition and not by way of production through oscillation aloneOtherwise the state of derived materiality pertaining to expression would not be a factHe who knows pursues the line of thinking in the following manner A living being goes A living being stands but there is no living being going or standingThis talk of a living being going or standing is similar to speech in the following way A cart goes A cart stands In fact there is no going cart and no standing cartWhen with bulls a skilled driver is driving one conventionally speaking says A cart goes or A cart stands In the sense of a thing not able to go of itself the body is like the cartMindborn oscillation are like the bullsMind is like the driverWhen the thought I go or the thought I stand arises the process of oscillation producing expression comes to existenceBy the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity going and the other modes of deportment take place and then there are these forms of conventional speech A living being goes A living being stands I go I stand Therefore the commentator saidAccordingly this yogi who considers by way of causes and conditions the states of going standing and so forth knows well that he is going when he is in the state of going that he is standing when he stands that he is sitting when he sits and that he is lying down when he lies down as it is told in the passage in the discourse beginning with the words When he is going a bhikkhu understands I am going Yatha yatha va panassa kayo panihito hoti tatha tatha nam pajanati  Or just as his body is disposed so he understands itIti ajjhattam va  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body examining his own four modes of deportmentBahiddha va  Or externally Or examining the four modes of deportment of anotherAjjhattabahiddha va  Or internally and externally Or examining at one time his own four modes of deportment and at another time anothers four modes of deportment he livesSamudayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationthings Also dissolutionthings are included hereOrigination and dissolution should be dwelt upon by way of the fivefold method beginning with the words He thinking the origination of materiality comes to be through the origination of ignorance in the sense of the origin of conditions sees the arising of the aggregate of materialityIn the same way he sees the arising of the aggregate of materiality through the origination of craving karma and food in the sense of the origin of conditions and also while seeing the sign of birthHe sees the passing away of the aggregate while thinking that the dissolution of materiality comes to be through the dissolution of ignorance in the sense of the dissolution of conditions and through the dissolution of craving karma and food in the same way and while seeing the sign of vicissitudeFor the arising of the materialityaggregate ignorance craving karma and food are the principal reasonsBut these are not allAs it is said that one sees the arising of the materialityaggregate when beholding also the rebirthsign or the bare origination state called the integrationsuccession of the various material forms becoming manifest in the conscious flux owing to ignorance craving karma and nutriment and from consciousness and the process of caloricity the knowledge of arising is fivefoldSimilarly the knowledge of passing away or ceasing is fivefoldThe sign of vicissitude or change is the bare state of dissolution called impermanencyAtthi kayoti va panassa sati paccupatthita hoti  Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought The body exists The exposition of this is to be done in the manner already stated in the preceding sectionHere the mindfulness which examines the four modes of deportment is the Truth of SufferingThe precraving which brings about that mindfulness is the Truth of OriginationThe nonoccurrence of either is the Truth of CessationThe Real Path which understands suffering abandons origination and takes cessation as object is the Truth of the WayThe yogi having endeavored thus by way of the Four Truths arrives at peaceThis is the portal to emancipation up to arahantship of the bhikkhu occupied with the four modes of deportmentAfter explaining bodycontemplation in the form of the meditation on the four modes of deportment the Master said And further to explain bodycontemplation by way of the four kinds of clear comprehensionOn who is clearly comprehending is one who knows according to every way intensively or in a detailed wayClear comprehension is the state of that oneIt is likewise the knowledge of that oneAbhikkante patikkante  In going forwards in going backwards Here the meaning is as follows  Going forwards is called goingGoing backwards is called turning backBoth these are to be found in all the four modes of deportmentGoing here is going after turning back and going after not turning backTurning back is the bare fact of turning backThis dyad is only mutually supported actionFirst in going carrying the body to a position in front  bringing the body along  is called going forwardsTurning back  returning thence  is called turning backAnd in standing one just standing and bending the body to a position in front does what is called going forwards and one bending away behind  drawing back  does what is called going backwardsIn sitting down one sitting and moving on  creeping on sliding on  to front portion comprising the frame and so forth of the seat ie chair stool or similar thing does going forwards and one moving away  sliding back  to the parts comprising the frame and so forth at the back of the chair or stool does what is called turning backIn lying down too the explanation is to be done according to the method stated aboveSampajanakari  Practicing clear comprehension Doing without fail all actions with clear comprehensionOr the doing of only clear comprehensionClear comprehension  comprehending clearlyBoth words mean the same thing their difference is only one of affixDoing without fail all actions with clear comprehension is the character of doing what ought to be done by oneself with clear comprehensionThe doing of only clear comprehension is the character of practicing clear comprehensionFor the yogi practices only clear comprehension and is nowhere bereft of clear comprehension in going forwards and going backwardsThere are these four kinds of comprehension clear comprehension of purpose of suitability of resort and of nondelusionThe discerning of things rightly entirely and equally is clear comprehensionNothing elseThis way of explanation is different from the commentarysAs it provides nondelusion in going forwards and backwards the action of clear comprehension is practice of clear comprehensionWho has that practice of clear comprehension is practicing clear comprehensionWhat takes place together with the aim called growth according to the Dhamma is purposeThe clear comprehension of purpose in going forwards and backwards is clear comprehension of purposeThe clear comprehension of what is suitable fit to oneself is clear comprehension of suitabilityThe clear comprehension of the resort which is called the subject of meditation that is unrelinquished in going backwards and forwards on the alms resort and elsewhere is the clear comprehension of resortClear comprehension of nondelusion is nondelusion that is clearly comprehending and is called nonstupefactionAmong these four kinds of clear comprehension the clear comprehension of purpose is the comprehension of purpose after considering what is worthy and not worthy with the thought Is there any use to one by this going or is there not One does this not having gone immediately just by the influence of the thought at the very moment the thought of going forwards is bornIn this context purpose is growth according to the Dhamma by way of visiting a relic shrine Tree of Enlightenment the Sangha the elders and a place where the dead are cast for seeing the unlovelyBy visiting a relic shrine a Bodhi Tree or the Sangha for producing spiritual interest and by meditating on the waning of that interest one could reach arahantship by visiting elders and by getting established in their instruction one could reach arahantship and by visiting a place where the dead are cast by seeing a corpse there and by producing the first absorption pathamajjhana in that unlovely object one could reach arahantshipSo the visiting of these is purposefulArahantshipThis is mentioned by way of the highest kind of expositionSince the generating of quietude and insight too is growth according to the Dhamma for a bhikkhuSome however say Increase by way of material gain too is purpose since material gain is helpful for the holy lifeSome  Dwellers at the Abhayagiri Vihara at AnuradhapuraMaterial gain  Material requisites like robesClear comprehension of suitability is the comprehension of the suitable after considering what is suitable and notFor instance the visiting of a relic shrine could be quite purposefulBut when a great offering is made to a relic shrine a multitude of people in a ten or twelve yojana area gather and men and women according to their position go about adorned like painted figuresAnd if in that crowd greed could arise for the bhikkhu in an attractive object resentment in a nonattractive one and delusion through prejudice if he could commit the offence of sexual intercourse or if harm could come to the holy life of purity then a place like that relic shrine would not be suitableWhen there could be no such harm it would be suitablePrejudice is the name given to the grasping of an object without wise reflection by way of worldly ignorant complacencyCommit the offence of sexual intercourse by way of bodily contact with a womanHarm come to the life through trampling down by an elephant and so forthpurity through seeing those of the opposite sex and so forthThe visiting of the Savgha is a purpose of worthStill when there is allnight preaching in a big pandal in the inner village and there are crowds and one could possibly come to hurt and harm in the way mentioned earlier that place of preaching is not suitable to go toWhen there is no hurt or harm possible one may go there as it would then be suitableIn visiting elders who are surrounded by a large following suitability and nonsuitability should also be determined in the way stated aboveTo visit a place where the dead are cast for beholding a corpse is fit and to explain the meaning of this the following story has been toldIt is said that a young bhikkhu went with a novice to get wood for toothcleanersThe novice getting out of the road proceeded in front to a place in search of wood and saw a corpseMeditating on it he produced the first absorption and making the factors of the absorption a basis for developing insight realized the first three fruitions of arahantship while examining the conformations and stood having laid hold of the subject of meditation for realizing the path of full arahantshipThe young bhikkhu not seeing the novice called out to himThe novice thought thus From the day I took up the homeless life I have endeavored to let me never be called twice by a bhikkhu so I will produce the further distinction another day and replied to the bhikkhu with the words Whats the matter reverend sir Come said the bhikkhu and the novice returnedThe novice told the bhikkhu as follows Go first by this way then stand facing north at the place I stood for a while and look The young bhikkhu followed the novices instruction and attained just the distinction reached by the noviceThus the same corpse became profitable to two peopleFor the male the female corpse is not suitable and vice versaOnly a corpse of ones own sex is suitableComprehension of what is suitable in this way is called the clear comprehension of suitabilityFurther the going on the alms round of that one who has thus comprehended purpose and suitability after leaving and taking up just that resort  among the thirtyeight subjects of meditation  called the subject of meditation after his own heart is clear comprehension of resortSubject of meditation refers to the object of concentration by way of locality of occurrence of the contemplative action that is being statedResortLiterally pasturing groundThis word is applied to the wandering for alms of a bhikkhu and to the subject of meditation in the sense of the locus sphere range or scope of contemplative actionFor making manifest this clear comprehension of resort the following set of four should be understood In the Dispensation of the Buddha a certain bhikkhu on the journey out for alms takes along with him in the mind the subject of meditation but on the journey back from the work of almsgathering he does not bring it along with him having become unmindful of itAnother does not take it along with him on the outward journey but returns from the almstour with the subject of meditation in his mindStill another neither takes it along with him on the outward journey nor returns with it on the journey homeAnd lastly there is the fourth kind of bhikkhu who both takes the subject of meditation along with him on the journey out for alms and brings it back with him on the journey homeAmong these four kinds there is a certain bhikkhu who lives thus  By day he cleanses his mind of things that becloud  the hindrances  through meditation on the ambulatory and in the sitting postureBy night likewise on the ambulatory and in the sitting posture through meditation in the first watch and in the last watch he cleanses his mind of things that becloud after sleeping in the middle watchQuite early in the day having done the duties connected with the terraces of the relicshrine and the Bhodhitree  sweeping and so forth  he sprinkles the Bodhitree with water places water for drinking and washing and attends to the Khandhaka duties beginning with the duties connected with the teacher and the preceptorThereafter having looked to the needs of his body  that is after bestowing that attention on the body which consists of washing the face and so forth  he enters his dwelling and practices the subject of meditation begun that day at several sittingsThere two or three sittings  two or three sitting turnsWarming up is said concerning the matter of causing warmth to be taken up twice or thriceThe word sitting means sitting by way of the thighbound or locked postureIt is the posture called the lionpose and the firm poseIt is the sitting down of one with the left foot crossed on to the right thigh and the right foot on to the left thigh by way of interlocking through the bending of the thighsWhen it is time to wander for alms he having got up from the sitting meditationpose and takes his bowl and robe with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind leaves his dwelling attending only to the thought of meditationWith just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind  Just with the subject of meditation in the forefront of the mind keeping to the thought of meditationIf when going to his alms collecting place the bhikkhus thought of meditation is contemplation on the Buddhas qualities he on arriving at the relicshrine enters the shrines precincts without having put aside his thought of meditation on the BuddhaBut should his thought of meditation be something other than the Buddhasubject he having stood at the foot of the stairway leading to the shrineterrace put by his thought of meditation as if it were goods handcarried and acquired the joy begotten of the Buddhasubject of meditation goes up the stairwayIf the relicshrine is a big one it should be worshipped at four places when the bhikkhu has gone round it three times to the rightIf it is a small shrine it should be worshipped by the meditator in eight places when he has gone round it three times to the right just as in the case of the big shrineBy a bhikkhu who having worshipped a relicshrine has reached a Bodhitree shrine even the Bodhitree should be worshippedAnd he should worship the Bodhitree showing meek demeanour as though he were in the very presence of the Buddha the BhagavaIn this way that monk having worshipped relicshrine and Boddhitree shrine goes to the place where he had put by his first subject of meditation namely to the bottom of the stairwayThere having taken up the subject of meditation he had put by earlier and robed himself near the village with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind he enters the village for almsThere people after seeing the bhikkhu say Our venerable one has come and having gone forward to meet the bhikkhu taken his bowl conducted him to the sittinghall or to a house and made him take a seat offer gruel to himThereafter they wash and anoint his feet and till rice is ready sit in front of him and ask him questions or become desirous of listening to a talk on the Dhamma from himEven if the people do not ask him to speak to them on the Dhamma the commentators say that a talk on the Dhamma should be given to the people in order to help themThe bhikkhus should expound the Dhamma for the purpose of assisting the folk with the grace of the Dhamma thinking If I do not expound the Dhamma to them who willThere is no Dhammatalk separate from the thought of meditationThis is said to strengthen the dictum of the commentators mentioned aboveTherefore after expounding the Dhamma even with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind after partaking of the food with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind he leaves the village followed by the people who in spite of his requesting them to stop accompanying himThere after turning back those who followed him he takes the road to his dwellingplaceAfter expounding the Dhamma even with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind  After expounding the Dhamma just in accordance with the character of the thought of meditation that is being attended to by oneself by way of sticking to that thoughtThe method of exegesis is the same in regard to the next expression concerning foodAfter giving thanksHere too the governing expression is Even with the thought of meditation uppermost in mindThere just at the place of departure from the villageThe point at which the bhikkhu actually gets out of the villageThen novices and young bhikkhus who had taken their meal outside the village having left the village earlier than this bhikkhu see this bhikkhu comingAnd they after going forward to meet him take his bowl and robeIt is said that bhikkhus of old did this duty without looking at the face of the returning bhikkhu and thinking our preceptor our teacherIn ancient times they did this duty according to the arrivinglimitAs the elder bhikkhu came the younger ones performed this duty not looking to see who the elder wasThose novices and young bhikkhus question the elder thus Reverend Sir who are these people to youAre they relatives on the maternal sideAre they relatives on the paternal side  Having seen what do you query  Their affection and respect for you  Friends what even parents find it hard to do these people do for usOur very robes and bowls are just due to themOwing to these people we know no fear on occasions of fear and know no lack of food on occasions of famineThere are no people so helpful to us as these folk Speaking well of these people thus he goesThis bhikkhu is spoken of as a person who carries forth the subject of meditation when he leaves his dwelling but does not return with the thought of meditationIf to a bhikkhu who performs the duties detailed above betimes if his kammaproduced caloricity becomes very strong pajjalati lit flames up and lays hold of the derived assimilated material of the body owing to the absence of undigested food in the stomach if sweat exudes from his body and if he is unable to concentrate on his subject of meditation he takes his bowl and the robe quite early in the morning worships the relic shrine speedily and enters the village to get gruel just when the village herds go out of their pens for pasturingAfter he gets the gruel he goes to sittinghall and drinks itThen with the swallowing of just two or three mouthfuls the kammaproduced caloricity letting go the material of the body  ie the inner lining of the stomach lays hold of the property of the food taken inAnd that bhikkhu having got to the assuagement of the distress of the caloric process like a man bathed with a hundred pots of cool water having partaken of the gruel with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind washed bowl and mouth attended to the subject of meditation till the later forenoon meal wandered for alms in the remaining places  in the places where he got no gruel and so where he could still go for alms  and taken the meal with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind returns having taken up just that subject of meditation which is thence forward present in his mindThis person is called the one who does not carry forth but returns with the thought of meditationKammaproduced caloricity is an expression referring to the function of that part of the alimentary tract where the bile helps digestion and from which vital heat spreads  the grahani according to AyurvedaIt is stated that the commentator said kammaproduced caloricity concerning the seizure the name of the alimentary function explained aboveBecomes very strong means generates a condition of heatSubject of meditation does not get on to the road of contemplative thought owing to the disappearance of concentration of the wearied body through hungerfatigueWhen in the stomach indeed property like cooked rice is absent kammaproduced caloricity gets hold of the inner lining of the stomachThat causes the utterance of words like the following I am hungry give me foodWhen food is taken kammaproduced caloricity having let go the inner lining of the stomach gets hold of the foodpropertyThen the living being becomes calmTherefore in the commentaries kammaproduced caloricity is spoken of as a shadowdemonAnd bhikkhus like this one who after drinking gruel and exerting themselves in the development of insight reached the state of arahantship in the Buddhas Dispensation are past all numberingIn the Island of the Lion Race alone there is not a seat of sittinghall in the various villages which is not a place where a bhikkhu having sat and drunk gruel attained arahantship tesu tesu gamesu asanasalaya na tam asanam atthi yattha yagum pivitva arahattam patta bhikkhu natthiAnd bhikkhus like this one and so forthWith these words the commentator points out the state of benefit of the bhikkhu attending to the thoughts of meditation even in the way aforesaidBut a bhikkhu who is a loose liver who is a slacker having broken all observances whilst living spiritually frozen through the fivefold bondage of mind having entered the village for alms without having even shown a sign of the fact that there is a thing called a subject of meditation and having walked about and eaten his meal in unbefitting company comes out of the village an empty fellowThis bhikkhu is called a person who neither carries forth nor returns with the thought of meditationWho is spoken of with the words This one carries forth and carries back must be known just through the means of the observance of carrying forth and carrying backJust through the means of the observance of carrying forth and carrying back means By way of whatsoever going for and returning from almsgathering only with the thought of meditationMen of good family desirous of selfimprovement having become homeless ones in the Dispensation of the Buddha when living in a group of ten twenty fifty or a hundred make a covenant of observance with these words Friends you renounced not because you were troubled by creditors not because of fear of punishment from the king and not because of difficulties of subsistence produced by famine and the like but because you were desirous of release hereTherefore you should restrain the defilement that is born when going just in the process of going you should restrain the defilement that is born when standing just in the process of standing you should restrain the defilement that is born when sitting just in the process of sitting and you should restrain the defilement that is born when lying down just in the process of lying downWhen after the making of such a covenant of observance they go on to a village for alms if there are stones by the road at distances of halfanusabha one usabha and one gavuta these bhikkhus proceed attending to the subject of meditation with awareness of those stonesIf in the course of going a defilement of the mind arises in one just in the course of going one restrains or suppresses itIf one fails to do so one stopsThen he who comes behind one stops tooAnd one thinks This bhikkhu here knows the unclean thought that has arisen in you unbecoming is that to you Thus having reproved oneself and developed penetrative insight one steps into the Plane of the Noble OnesIf one is not able to do that one sits down and he who comes behind sits down too it is said that just is the methodShould one be not able to enter into the Plane of the Noble Ones then one having stopped the defilement goes attending to only the subject of meditationOne does not raise the foot with mind bereft of the subject of meditation but should one do so one having turned gets back again even to the earlier stepDesirous of selfimprovement  wishing for personal good and wellbeing  those wishing for the Dhamma is the true meaning  by reason of the fact that the Dhamma is truly good and wellbeingOr to the wise the Dhamma is the self owing to the absence of difference from the self and owing to the state of being included in the living beingThey desire wish for that tam kamenti icchantiNewly  at the time this subcommentary was written  however the reading desirous of attainment by way of good is seen wishing for good that is connected with the Dhamma or wishing for the Dhamma that is goodUnbecoming is that means unbecoming is anothers knowing of ones own defilementThis also should be understood as included even by anothers knowing He makes systematic attention strong on account of the hungry condition of those coming behind pacchato agacchantanam chinna bhatta bhava bhayenapi yoniso manasikaram paribruhetiti idampi parassa jananeneva sangahitanti datthabbamEven to the earlier step means just to the first footprint made with mind separate from the thought of meditationLike the elder Maha Phussa the verandahdwellerWith the stories beginning here the commentator lays low the misgiving about this observance for instance expressed thus Just impossible is that what is pointed out was indeed in this way practiced beforeIt is said that this elder dwelt for nineteen years fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and carrying back Plowmen sowers threshers of grain and other people having seen the elder go in this manner said This elder goes having halted again and againWhy does he do soHas he got confused about the way or has he forgotten somethingThe elder by just doing the recluses duty with mind yoked to the thought of meditation without giving heed to the talk of the people attained arahantship within twenty yearsOn the very day be became an arahant a deva who was living at the end of the elders walking path stood emitting a radiance that came from the fingers of the devaThe Four Regents of the Earth Sakka the devaking and Brahma Sahampati came to serve the elderMaha Tissa the forestdweller also an elder saw that radiance and inquired of the arahant the next day Last night there was a radiance about your reverence what was thatDiverting the talk the arahant said Radiance is that of light of gem and the like But on being pressed repeatedly with the words You are concealing he acknowledged saying Yes and informed Tissa of his attainmentLike the elder Maha Naga of the Black Creeper PavilionHe it is said when fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and back the subject of meditation resolved upon keeping to only the postures of standing and of walking for seven years with the thought I will honor the Blessed Ones great struggle And after fulfilling for sixteen years again the observance of carrying forth and carrying back the subject of meditation he attained arahantshipThis is said of him He raises his foot only with mind yoked to the subject of meditationIf he raises with mind not yoked thus he turns back againAfter standing at such a distance from the village as would raise the doubt Is it indeed a cow or a recluse and robing himself he fills his mouth with a draught of water from the watercarrier slung over the shoulder and hanging under the armpit having washed the bowl with water from the same sourceFor what reason does he fill his mouth soHe does it thinking Let there be no distraction of the mind even by the uttering of the words May you live long to people coming to worship me or give me alms But when he is asked the question Reverend Sir which stage of the halfmonth is today concerning the date or when he is questioned about the number of monks he answers after swallowing the waterIf there is no questioning about the day and so forth he having spat out the water at the village gate at the time of leaving goesLike the fifty bhikkhus who entered upon the rainy season residence at the Monastery of the Galamba Landing PlaceOn the fullmoon day of July they made this covenant of observance  Without attaining arahantship we shall not converse with one anotherThese bhikkhus used to enter the village for alms filling the mouth with a draught of water and when questioned about the date and so forth they acted just according to the method mentioned aboveIn that village people having seen the spots on which mouthfuls of water had been spurted forth by the returning bhikkhus said Today one came today two And those people thought What indeed is the reason that these bhikkhus neither talk with us nor with each otherIf they do not speak with each other surely they are persons who have had a dispute amongst themselves and saying Come we must make them forgive one another went  in a body  to the monasteryThere they saw that no two bhikkhus were in the same placeThen a wise man in that crowd said Good people a place which quarrelsome folk occupy is not like thisThe relicshrine and the Bodhishrine terraces are well sweptThe brooms are well arrangedAnd water for drinking and water for washing are well set Then those people just turned backAnd the bhikkhu of that monastery attained arahantship within three months and performed a Pure Pavarana ceremonyDiverting the talk  Turning away the talk because of unostentatiousness due to RealizationKeeping to only the postures of standing and walking This is said by way of the postures proper to be resolved upon for adherenceOne restricts oneself to these postures not however by way of refusing to practice the propertobepracticed and necessary posture of sitting at mealtime and on such other occasions for by the word only it should be understood that one tops the remaining forms of sitting namely every sittingposture not absolutely necessary of practice and the posture of lying downI will honor the Blessed Ones great struggleAccording to my strength I will do worship to the sixyear asceticism of extreme torture undertaken by the Worlds Redeemer for our sakes since even the honoring of the Master through conduct is the more praiseworthy kind of worshipNot so praiseworthy is the worship with material thingsPure pavaranaThe Pavarana through the state of destruction of the outflowings  arahantshipThus like the elder Maha Naga dweller in the Black Creeper Pavilion and like the bhikkhus who went into rainy season at the Galamba Ford Monastery the bhikkhu raises his foot only with mind yoked to the thought of meditationHaving reached the neighbourhood of the village filled the mouth with a draught of water and looked at the streets he enters the street where there are no quarrelsome drunkards gamesters and such folk or where there are no restive elephants horses and the likeThere wandering for alms he does not go speedily like one in a great hurry since there is no ascetic practice of begging food speedilyHe goes rather having become motionless like a water cart on uneven groundEntering into each house in order spending such time as is suitable for concluding whether there is or not the tendency to offer alms he receives alms and comes to the inner village outer village or even to the monasteryThere he seats himself in a place pleasant and good attends to the thought of meditation with the setting up of the perception of loathsomeness in food and reflects by way of the similes of axlegreasing applying ointment to ulcer and feeding on own childs flesh and eats the food fully followed with awareness of the eight attributes not for sport intoxication adornment or the filling up of those places of his body that have a deficiency of fleshAnd he having eaten washesThen he rests for a while the body that is tired with the business of eatingHe attends to just the thought of meditation in the time after eating as in the time before eating and in the last watch of the night as in the first watchThis person is called one who carries forth and carries back the subject of meditationThe person who fulfills this observance of one who carries forth and carries back called the carrying forth when going out for alms and the bringing back when returning from the almsround reaches arahantship even in the period of youth if he is possessed of the sufficing condition the wherewithal to accomplish the destruction of ignorance and its defilementsIf he fails to reach arahantship in early age then he reaches it in middle age if he fails in middle age then at the time of death if he fails at the time of death then after becoming a deva if he fails as a deva then at a time when no Buddha has appeared on earth he is born as a man and realizes the truth as a Buddha who is not able to communicate the truth to others and if he fails to realize the truth in that way then immediately on meeting a Fully Enlightened Buddha he becomes a person who intuits quickly like the elder Bahiya Daruciriya or a greatly wise one like the elder Sariputta or one of great psychic power like the elder Mogallana the Great or an exponent of ascetic practice like the elder Kassapa the Great or one endowed with clairvoyant power like the elder Anuruddha or an expert in discipline like the elder Upali or an expounder of the Dhamma like the elder Punna Mantaniputta or a forest dweller like the elder Revata or one of great learning like the elder Ananda or one desirous of training like the elder Rahula the Buddhas sonAmongst these four that form the set he who carries forth and carries back the subject of meditation reaches the crest of the clear comprehension of resortFurther nonconfusion in going forwards and so forth is the clear comprehension of nondelusionThat should be understood in the following way  In this Dispensation a monk without confusing himself like a blinded worldling who while going forwards or backwards becomes muddleheaded and believes thus The soul goes forward or The act of going forwards is produced by the soul or I go forwards or The act of going forwards is produced by me and the like thinks When there is the arising in one of the thought I am going forwards just with that thought appears the process of oscillation originating from mind which brings to birth bodily expressionThus by the way of the diffusion of the process of oscillation due to mental activity this skeleton called the body goes forwardIn raising up the foot A two processes extension and cohesion are low weak and the other two processes caloricity and oscillation are high powerful so too in stretching out the foot B and in shifting away the foot CBut in dropping down the raised foot D and likewise in keeping the foot on the ground E and in pressing the foot against the ground F the first two processes are high and powerful and the second low and weakThere the material and mental phenomena in A do not occur in B those in B do not occur in C those in C do not occur in D those in D do not occur in E those in E do not occur in FThese phenomena after coming into existence in the form of several sections links and parts break quickly just in those places crackling like sesamum seeds thrown into a heated panIn this matter who is the one that goes forward or whose going forward is thereIn the highest sense what takes place is the going the standing the sitting down and the lying down of the processesWith material form in the several divisionsLow  Negligible poor in regard to standardSince the process of caloricity with oscillation coming behind it is the condition for upraising caloricity and oscillation are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of upraisingCaloricity is specially conducive to the action of upraising and so in upraising oscillation is subordinate to caloricityThe processes of extension and cohesion are low in the action of upraising owing to their incapacity to raise upSince the process of oscillation with caloricity coming behind it is the condition for stretching out and shifting away oscillation and caloricity are in preponderance by reason of capability in stretching out and shifting awayOscillation is naturally active and because in the actions of stretching out and shifting away its movement is excessive caloricity is subordinate to oscillation in these actionsThe other two processes are low in stretching out and shifting away because of the incapacity of these processes to stretch out and to shift awayRaising up is the lifting of a foot from a place already stepped on toStretching out is the carrying of a foot to the front from the place on which one is standingShifting away is the carrying of a foot sidewards for the purpose of avoiding stake and the like or for avoiding contact with the other foot already set on the groundOr stretching out is the carrying of a foot to the place where the other foot is set and shifting away is the carrying of a foot further to a point beyond the place on which the other foot isSince the process of cohesion with extension coming behind it is the condition for dropping down cohesion and extension are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of dropping downThe nature of cohesion is most gravid and so in the laying down of an upraised foot extension is subordinate to cohesionBecause of their incapacity to drop down what is upraised the processes of caloricity and oscillation are called low in this connectionSince the process of extension with cohesion coming behind it is the condition for the keeping on the ground extension and cohesion are in preponderance by reason of capability in the keeping on the groundIn keeping the foot on the ground too as in the state of something fixed cohesion is subordinate to extension owing to the excessive functioning of the latter processCohesion is subordinate to extension also by way of the contactual action of the process of extension in pressing the foot against the groundAnd here dropping down is lowering by way of relinguishment or laying downThe setting down thence of the foot on the ground and so forth is keeping the foot on the groundAfter keeping the foot on the ground the coming to a complete standstill of the action of going by way of contacting is pressing the foot against the groundThere  In this going forward or among the six aforesaid divisions known as raising up stretching out shifting away dropping down keeping down and pressing againstIn raising up  In the moment of upraisingMaterial and mental phenomena  The material phenomena proceeding in the form of upraising and the mental phenomena originating that materiality do not occur in stretching out by reason of their existing only for a momentThroughout this is the method of exegesis in this passageJust in these places  Wherever in the divisions beginning with upraising phenomena come to be just in those very places they perishTo be sure owing to swift change there is no going over of phenomena to another placeSections  DivisionLinks  JointsParts  PortionsAnd all here is stated concerning the abovementioned divisions of the action of going which take place in the form of a differentiated serial processMore fleet than the group of devas running before the Suns chariot  the group of devas in the shape of horses with keenedged razors attached to their heads and hoofs engaged in and taken to going plunging forwards some above and some below but never knocking against each other though moving close together  is the moment of existence of material phenomenaAs the breakup of sesamum seeds that are roasted takes place almost at once with the sound of crackling the destruction of conditioned phenomena takes place almost at once with phenomenas arisingFor similar to the crackling sound the sign of the breaking up of the sesamum seeds is arising the sign of the breaking up of conditioned phenomena owing to the destruction assuredly of phenomena that have arisenWho is the one that goes forwardJust no oneCould it be said Whose going forward is thereNoWhyIn the highest sense what takes place is the going the standing the sitting down and the lying down of the processesThe passage just mentioned is for dispelling the false idea of a self that goes forward which a confused blinded worldling is apt to possess or the passage is stated by way of objection and refutationWith material form in the several divisions means with material form in the aforesaid sixfold divisionThe conscious state of the thoughtunit that comes into existence when any material form comes into existence runs a course of its own and does not get into close contact with the material form in question nor does it get into repeated contact or relation with that material formTherefore it is said one conscious state arises with material form and quite another ceases when that material form ceasesBy reason of the absence of close or repeated contact of mind with matter this happensTension oscillation or vibration of mind is quicker than that of matter seventeen timesThe words with material form in relation to the first sentence of the stanza mean with whatsoever material form arising simultaneously with a conscious stateAnd the same words in relation to the second sentence of the stanza refer to the material form already arisen and existing at the starting point of the seventeenth thoughtunit that occurs after the ceasingphase of the thoughtunit with which the aforesaid material form arose and which material form arisen already has a total duration from its arising to ceasing of seventeen consecutive thoughtunits and is possessed of the nature of ceasing together with the cessation of the seventeenth thoughtunit mentioned above namely of the seventeenth thoughtunit in its phase of dissolution or ceasingMaterial and mental phenomena would perhaps be taken as things of equal duration if the matter were put in a different way to thisShould these two kinds of phenomena be wrongly considered as things of equal duration then there would be contradiction with such commentarial sayings as Material form is slowchanging is tardy as regards ceasing and with such textual sayings as I do not see a single thing so swiftly changing o bhikkhus as this mindSince the nature of mind and mental characteristics is to cognize or to have objects mind and mental characteristics arise cognizing according to their strength the thing become a condition to mind and mental characteristics in the form of an object or the thing become an objectcondition to mind and mental characteristicsAnd immediately after the accomplishment or the effectuating of that which comprises the nature or quality of mind and mental characteristics and that quality is just the process of cognizing there occurs the ceasing of mind and mental characteristicsMaterial phenomena however do not take objects have no objects they do no cognizingMaterial phenomena have to be cognizedCognizibilitys fulfillment occurs with sixteen thoughtunitsHence the reduction of material phenomena to seventeen thoughtunits together with the one thoughtunit of the past is acknowledged by the commentator it is saidThe swift changeability of mind or consciousness takes place through the mere combination of the other three mental aggregates with variform consciousness and through the mere combination of objects with the same consciousness that is replete with variegationThe state of slow change of material form occurs owing to the condition of sluggishness of the primaries namely of the processes of extension cohesion caloricity and oscillation symbolized by earth water fire and air respectivelyOnly the Tathagata he who has arrived at the Truth by traversing the Ancient Road of the Buddhas has knowledge of the different processes according to realityAnd by means of that knowledge of the Tathagata the condition of prenascence as just a material phenomenon is statedLikewise by that knowledge of the Tathagata the condition of postnascence too is statedBecause of the statement of the prenascent and postnascent conditions the identity of moment of occurrence of mental and material phenomena is just not fitTherefore it was said by the commentator the elder Ananda thus Just according to the method stated should the meaning be understood hereThis matter was stated in this way because it is easy to understand the simultaneity of cessation of mind and bodily or vocal expressionThe meaning should be understood thus Quite another conscious state ceases with the ceasing of the material form arisen at the starting point of the seventeenth thoughtunit which is earlier to the material form together with expression that is physical in short seventeen thoughtunits arise and pass away during the lifetime of all material form except those connected with expressionThe passage should be constructed thus One conscious state ceases and quite another arises  ie the conscious states at the arising and the ceasing of material phenomena are differentIndeed one is the word explanation another is the explanation of the senseWhile the conscious state arisen earlier in ceasing it ceases in just the form of proximitycondition and so forth to another conscious state arising after itThen another conscious state which has just obtained a condition arisesAnd here in a different state by reason of the difference of occasionAlokite  In looking straight on Vilokite  In looking away from the front Here looking straight on  seeing in the direction in front of oneselfLooking away from the front  Looking out in all other directionsAnd other kinds of seeing by way of turning the eye in the direction above in the direction beneath and in the direction behind are called looking upwards looking downwards and looking backwardsHere those are not takenBut just these two  looking straight on and looking away from the front  are taken by way of what is befittingOr by this method it is said all those are also takenBy way of what is fitting  In the form of that which is suitable to a recluseSince looking downwards could happen in such actions as sweeping and plastering the floor with clay and cowdung looking upwards in removing cobwebs and other similar actions and looking backwards in such actions as the avoiding of danger coming from behind it is said that the commentator uttered the passage beginning with the words Or by this methodBy that the commentator points out that the statement is also one of the kind that implies what is not expressed  an elliptical statementHere the comprehending of purpose without having just looked by the force of the thought when the thought I shall look straight on arises is clear comprehension of purposeThat should be understood by making the venerable elder Nanda the example of a person who perceives through experience by the bodyThe following is stated in this connection Should looking straight on in the eastern direction become a thing that must be done by Nanda he looks straight on in the eastern direction having reflected with all his mind thus May no covetous griefproducing mean unskillful mental phenomena flow upon me while I am looking in the eastern direction There he becomes mindful thus Further purposefulness and suitability here too should be understood just according to the manner in which they are explained in connection with the worshipping of a relic shrine and so forthWhen the venerable elder Nanda was working for insight he slid into an unfavorable state of mind beginning with boredom in regard to the holy life and on becoming aware of that state of mind of his he stirred himself saying I shall restrain myself well Then having become energetic and very conscientious regarding guardedness at the doors of the controlling faculties of sense he reached the state of one of great perfection in selfrestraint through the fulfillment of all dutiesBy reason of that perfection the Master placed him in the position of preeminence in regard to the controlling faculty of restraint with the words This one namely Nanda O bhikkhus is the chief among my disciples endowed with the controlling faculty of restraintBecause clear comprehension of resort is just the keeping to the course of meditation looking straight on and looking away from the front should be done just according to each persons meditation with the thought of meditation uppermost in mindWithin it is said there certainly is no self or soul which looks straight on or looks away from the frontStill at the arising of the thought I shall look straight on and with that thought the process of oscillation originating from mind bringing into being bodily expression arisesThus owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity the lower eyelid goes down and the upper eyelid goes upSurely there is no one who opens with a contrivanceThereupon eyeconsciousness arises fulfilling the function of sight it is saidClear comprehension of this kind here is indeed called the clear comprehension of nondelusionFurther clear comprehension of nondelusion should be also understood here through accurate knowledge of the root through the casual state and through the temporary stateFirst by way of the accurate knowledge of the root There in the course of cognition the lifecontinum goes on fulfilling the function of a factor of the rebirthprocess after the turning round of the lifecontinum a barely active mind process fulfilling the function of adverting or attending to an object at the sensedoor of the eye goes on from the cessation of that fulfilling the function of seeing eyeconsciousness goes on from the cessation of that a resultant mind process fulfilling the function of receiving goes on from the cessation of that a resultant mind consciousness process fulfilling the function of considering goes on from the cessation of that a barely active mind consciousness process fulfilling the function of determining goes on from the cessation of that an impulsion impels seven timesNow among the mental states of the lifecontinum and so forth or even in the mental state of the first impulsion there is no looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hatred or ignorance by him who sees in any directionAlso there is no such stained vision by him in the mental state of the second impulsion the third the fourth the fifth sixth or even in the seventh impulsionBut when like soldiers in a battlefield the mental states after breakingup gradually are fallen one atop of another there takes place looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hate and ignorance accompanied by the discriminatory thought This is a woman or This is a man much in the same way as the fallen are distinguished after a battle for in the frenzy of fighting there is no room for recognition of the individuals engaged in the frayThus here in the first instance clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood by way of the accurate knowledge of the rootThe passage beginning with the words Within it is said there certainly is no self or soul is stated to explain that looking straight on or looking away from the front is to be sure just a variety of occurrence of even bare phenomena and that therefore clear comprehension of nondelusion is the knowing of that fact as it really isAccurate knowledge of the root  comprehension of the fundamental reason of impulsion at the minddoorThrough the casual state through the state of one coming as a strangerThrough the temporary state through the state of proceeding only at a certain moment tam khana matta pavattakassa bhavaFulfilling the function of a factor of the rebirthprocess means accomplishing the principal work of a link what is stated by that is this having become substanceThe lifecontinum is indeed the principal factor and the principal basis because of similarity to the relinking mindTherefore it is called the principal factor and basis or it is called so owing to its fulfilling of the function of a ground or reason by way of the causal condition of unbroken procedureThe expression After the turning round of that has been stated by way of general reference to the lifecontinum threefold as regards procedure past thoughtunit of the lifecontinum movement of the lifecontinum and stoppage of the lifecontinumAt this place turning round refers just to the stoppage of the lifecontinumFrom the cessation of that  Owing to the dissolution of that  expressions of reason by way of proximityconditionEven in the first impulsion and so forth ending with the seventh impulsionThis passage has been stated concerning the absence of lust hate and ignorance with the thought This is a woman or This is a man in the course of cognition at the five doors of senseIn this matter indeed owing to the existence of mental states by way of adverting and the rest up to determining without radical reflection on account of reflecting unwisely prior to advertingdetermining impulsion that is with a bare semblance of greed arises in regard to a liked object such as a female form and impulsion that is with a bare semblance of hate arises in regard to an object not likedThere is however no occurrence of lust hate and ignorance in an extreme way with strong moral consequences in the course of sensedoor cognitionOnly in the course of minddoor cognition lust hate and ignorance occur absolutely that is with strong moral consequencesBut impulsion of the course of sensedoor cognition is the root of lust hate and ignorance of minddoor course of cognitionOr even all beginning with the mental state of the lifecontinum can be taken as the root of minddoor impulsionThus accurate knowledge of the root has been stated by way of the rootreason of minddoor impulsionThe casual state and the temporary state indeed on account of the newness of just impulsion of the course of cognition at the five doors of sense and on account of the brevity of the same impulsionAfter breaking up gradually are fallen one atop of another on account of the turning round  changing moving  early and later or before and after or below and above in the form of the arising of the mental state of the lifecontinumLikewise indeed the falling after breaking down of the mental states on account of the arising of the mental state of the lifecontinum tatha bhavanguppada vasena hi tesam bhijjitva patanamBy this indeed the commentator shows by way of the gradual arising of the earlier and the later mental state of the lifecontinum the arising of the impulsion of the minddoor course of cognition which is different to the impulsion of the course of cognition at the five doors of senseBecause of the proceeding of lust and the like by just the way of minddoor impulsion the commentator said even thus There takes place looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hatred and ignoranceOn an object falling within reach of consciousness at the eyedoor impulsion arises right at the very end when from the movement of the lifecontinum onwards the states of adverting seeing receiving considering and determining having arisen have ceasedThat impulsion is like a visitor at the eyedoor which is comparable to a house belonging to the states of adverting and the rest mentioned above born there before the arising of impulsionAs it is not fit for a visitor who has arrived at a strange house for the purpose of getting some assistance from the owners of the house to do any kind of ordering when the owners themselves are silent so it is unfit for impulsion to be involved in lust hate and ignorance at the eyedoor house of adverting and the other states of mind when those states of mind are themselves not lusting hating or bound up with ignoranceClear comprehension of nondelusion should thus be known by way of the casual stateAt the eyedoor the mental states that close with the state of determining arise and break up together with associated phenomena at just those places on which they ariseThey do not see each otherTherefore the mental states that close with determining are brief and temporaryThere as in a house of the dead where here is one more to die just at that very instant it is not proper for that one who is to die to be given to delight in dancing and singing and the like even so at a sensedoor when the states of adverting and the rest with associated phenomena have died just where they arose it is not fit for the remaining impulsion that is to die shortly to take delight in anything by way of lust and the likeClear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood thus by way of the temporary stateLike a visitor  Like someone come specially a strangerVisitors are of two kinds by way of a guest that is a person who comes and goes a person who does not stay permanently in a place and by way of someone who comes specially to a place a strangerIn this connection one who is an acquaintance or one who is known is a guestOne who is not an acquaintance and is unknown is a strangerAccording to the context here a stranger is meantSince to these mental states there is just that duration limited to the process of riseandfall of mental phenomena these states of mind are called temporaryAnd further this clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood by way of the reflection on the aggregates bases processes and conditionsTo be sure here eye and visible object are materialityaggregate seeing is consciousnessaggregate feeling that is associated with seeing is feelingaggregate perceiving is perceptionaggregate and those beginning with senseimpression are formationaggregateThus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these five aggregatesThere who singly looks straight onWho looks away from the frontSeeing  EyeconsciousnessBy reason of knowing the acts of looking straight on and of looking away from the front in that way only as eyeconsciousness adverting and the rest are left out as bare seeing only is in eyeconsciousnessSeparate from that fivefold aggregate who singly looks straight onWho singly looks away from the frontNone singly only by oneself indeed looks straight on and none singly only by oneself looks away from the front  this reply is intended to be given to the questionsIn the same way eye is eyebase visible object is materialitybase seeing is mindbase feeling and so forth the associated things are thingbaseThus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these four basesThere who singly looks straight onWho looks away from the frontLikewise eye is eyeprocess visible object is materialityprocess seeing is eyeconsciousnessprocess and the things beginning with feeling associated with eyeconsciousness are mindprocessThus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these four processesThere who singly looks straight onWho looks away from the frontExactly in the manner already stated eye is supportcondition visible object is objectcondition adverting is condition of proximity contiguity decisivesupport absence and disappearance light is condition of decisivesupport and those beginning with feeling are conascenceconditionThus looking straightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these conditionsThere who singly looks straight onWho looks away from the frontWith the words light is the condition of decisivesupport the conditionality of seeing is stated through the Suttanta method through the way of illustrated discourse discursively indirectlyConascencecondition too belongs to just seeingThis is only an example owing to the obtaining also of conditions of mutuality association presence nondisappearance and so forthHere in this way by reflection on the aggregates bases processes and conditions too clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understoodSammiñjite pasarite  in bending and in stretching In the bending and the stretching of the jointsThe consideration of purpose and lack of purpose in regard to any contemplated act of bending or stretching and the taking up of that which is purposeful after not bending and stretching according to merely the minds inclination is clear comprehension of purposeIn this matter a person who experiences pain every moment due to standing long with bent or stretched hands or feet does not get concentration of mind his subject of meditation entirely falls away and he does not obtain distinctionBut he who bends or stretches his hands and feet for the proper length of time does not experience pain gets concentration of mind develops his subject of meditation and attains distinctionThus the comprehension of purpose and nonpurpose should be knownClear comprehension of suitability is the comprehension of the suitable after considering the suitable and the nonsuitable even in a matter that is purposefulIn this connection the following is the method of explanation It is said that on the terrace of the Great Relic Shrine while young bhikkhus were rehearsing the doctrine young bhikkhunis standing at the back of the bhikkhus were listening to the rehearsalThen a young bhikkhu came into bodily contact with a bhikkhuni while stretching out his hand and by just that fact became a laymanAnother bhikkhu in stretching his foot stretched it into fire and his foot got burnt to the boneAnother stretched his foot on an anthill and was bitten in the foot by a poisonous snakeAnother bhikkhu stretched out his hand till it rested on the pole of a robetent a ribbonsnake on the pole bit the hand of that bhikkhuTherefore the stretching of ones limbs should be done in a suitable and not an unsuitable placeThis should be understood here as clear comprehension of suitabilityJust by the showing of the tribulation of noncomprehension of that the felicity of comprehension is made clear thus here the illustration of these should be understoodIn the terrace of the Great Relic Shrine  In the terrace of the great relic shrine known by the name of Hemamali at Anuradhapura in Lanka built by the king DutthagaminiBy just that fact became a layman  By reason of coming into bodily contact with a female that bhikkhu having become filled with longing for sensedelights turned to the lower life of the worldOn the pole of a robetent  On a pole fixed to the roof of a tent covered with robesIt is said by the commentator that bhikkhus having made a robetent were in that tent rehearsing the doctrine even on the terrace of the Great Relic ShrineIt is said by the commentators the elders Ananda and Dhammapala that the ribbonsnake is a snakespecies found in Lion IslandClear comprehension of resort should indeed be illustrated by the story of the senior bhikkhu called Great ElderIt is said that Great Elder seated in his dayquarters bent his arm quickly whilst talking to his resident pupils and then after putting back his arm to the position in which it first was bent it again slowlyThe resident pupils questioned him thus Reverend Sir why after bending the arm quickly did you having placed it in the position in which it first was bend it slowly Friends until now I did not bend this arm with a mind separate from the subject of meditation ever since I began to attend to the subject of meditationTherefore having put back the arm in the place it was first in I bent GoodReverend SirA bhikkhu should be one who acts thus Here too it should be understood that the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation is clear comprehension of resortSubject of meditation  The subject of meditation of the elements that is according to the method about to be stated with the words Within there is no soul and so forthWithin there is no soul that bends or stretchesBy the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity bending and stretching occurIndeed here it should be understood that the knowing in this way is clear comprehension of nondelusionSanghati patta civara dharane  In wearing the shouldercloak the other robes and the bowlIn this connection purpose is what accrues materially to one on the almsround and what is stated by the Blessed One according to the method beginning with the words for keeping out cold for keeping out heatSuitable to one who is naturally warmbodied is fine clothing and that is suitable to one who is weak tooTo the susceptible to cold is suitable thick clothing made of two pieces of cloth laid one over the other and stitched together Nonsuitable to these is clothing contrary to the kind mentioned aboveA wornout robe is indeed not suitable as that robe will even be hindrancecausing when one patches and sews or darns itLikewise hindrancecausing are robes of silk fine hemp and similar material that stimulate cupidityFor to the lonedweller in the forest such robes are productive of loss of clothing and of lifeWith the words to the lonedweller in the forest such robes are productive of loss of clothing the commentator mentioned in part what constitutes the loss of the life of purity and it is stated so because clothing is properly free to be taken or used by or accessible to thieves and the likeThe robe acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the robe which decreases the good and increases the bad in the one who wears it are irreversibly not suitableJust by that statement the commentator shows that the nonsuitable mentioned earlier is not nonsuitable absolutely because of the possibility of the nonsuitable mentioned earlier becoming suitable to someone at some time owing to this or that reasonThis pair here is however absolutely nonsuitable on account of the absence of suitability to anyone at any timeHere from the foregoing clear comprehension of the suitable and the nonsuitable should be understood as the holding fast to the line of meditative thought by way of the nonabandoning of the line of contemplation which the commentator is going to state clear comprehension of resort should be understoodWithin there is nothing called a soul that robes itselfAccording to the method of exposition adopted already only by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity does the act of robing take placeThe robe has no power to think and the body too has not that powerThe robe is not aware of the fact that it is draping the body and the body too of itself does not think I am being draped round with the robe Mere processes clothe a processheap in the same way that a modelled figure is covered with a piece of clothTherefore there is neither room for elation on getting a fine robe nor for depression on getting one that is not fineWithinIn ones own mental fluxBody tooBody too is only an egoconceptI  Karma produced bodyProcesses  External processes called robesProcessheap  The internal processcollection called the bodySome honor an anthill where a cobra de capello lives a treeshrine and so forth with garlands perfumes incense cloth and similar thingsOthers maltreat these objectsAnthill treeshrine and the like are however neither elated by the good nor depressed by the bad treatmentJust in the same way there should be no elation on receiving a good robe or depression on getting a bad oneClear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood in this connection as the proceeding of reflective thought in this wayAnd in using the bowl clear comprehension of purpose should be understood by way of the benefit obtainable through the action of one who takes the bowl unhurriedly and thinks Going out to beg with this I shall get almsWith the seeing of the purpose the obtaining of food should the bowl be taken by oneIn this way indeed does clear comprehension of purpose ariseTo one with a lean body which is weak a heavy bowl is not suitableAnd not suitable is a damaged bowl that is tied with thread and stopped in four or five places and hard to wash properlyA bowl that is hard to wash well certainly is not fitThere will be inconvenience caused to him who washes that kind of bowlA bowl that is hard to wash well This was said concerning a bowl difficult to wash properly naturally though it may be without mendsA bright bowl which shines like a gem and therefore is capable of stimulating the cupidity of others is not suitable for the same reasons given in regard to robes of silk fine hemp and so forthJust irreversibly unsuitable are the bowl acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the bowl by which good decreases and evils increaseThrough this explanation clear comprehension of suitability in this connection should be understoodAnd by the fact even of the holding fast to the subject of meditation should clear comprehension of resort be understoodWithin there is nothing called a self that is taking the bowlAs stated already by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity there is the taking of the bowlIn this matter of taking the bowl the bowl cannot thinkHands too cannot thinkThe bowl does not cognize that it is taken by the handsHands do not cognize that the bowl is taken by themJust processes take a processheapIt is comparable to the taking of a redhot vessel with a pair of tongsBy way of the proceeding of reflective thought in this way clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood in bowltakingAnd further it is like this When kindly people see in a refuge for the helpless unfortunate persons with hands and feet cut off and with blood pus and many maggots in the open wounds and give to the unfortunate persons bandages and medicine in containers some of the miserable sufferers in the refuge may get thick bandages and containers not shapely others may get thin bandages and shapely containersNone of the sufferers will feel elated or depressed about the kind of bandages and containers they receiveThat is because they merely want cloth to cover their wounds and containers for keeping medicineNow the bhikkhu who regards the robe as a bandage the bowl as a medicinecontainer and almsfood as medicine in the bowl through clear comprehension of nondelusion should be taken as a person endowed with the highest clear comprehensionA person endowed with the highest clear comprehension should be known by way of the discernment of fineness of the characteristic activity of one possessed of the highest clear comprehension and by way of the highest state of the previous practicers of clear comprehensionAs to purpose there is the eightfold purpose referred to with the words Not for sport and so forth in the formula of reflection on the four requisites of a bhikkhuAs such should clear comprehension of purpose be knownNonsuitable to one is the food by which to that one there is discomfort whatever the food may be in quality or taste coarse or fine or bitter or sweet or anything elseSuitable is food that does not cause discomfortJust irreversibly nonsuitable are these the food acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the food by which good decreases and evils increase in one who partakes of itFood which is got by right means and food which does not cause decrease of good and increase of evil in the one taking it are suitableIn this matter of the partaking of food clear comprehension of suitability should be understood according to the explanation given above and the clear comprehension of resort should be understood by way of the nonabandoning of the subject of meditationWithin there is no eater called a selfAs stated already by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only there is the receiving of food in the bowl by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only there is the descent of the hand into the bowl and by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only the making of the food into suitable lumps the raising of the lumps from the bowl and the opening of the mouth take placeNo one opens the jaws with a keyNo one opens the jaws with a contrivanceJust by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity take place the putting of a lump of food in the mouth the pestleaction of the upper row of teeth the mortarwork of the lower row of teeth and the tongues activity comparable to that of the hand collecting together material that is being crushedThus that lump of food in the mouth is mixed together with the thin saliva at the end of the tongue and the thick saliva at the root of the tongueThat food in the mortar of the lower teeth turned by the tongue moistened by the saliva and ground fine by the pestle of the upper teeth is not put into the stomach by anyone with a ladle or a spoonJust by the process of oscillation it goes onThere is no one within who having made a straw mat is bearing each lump that goes inEach lump stands by reason of the process of oscillationThere is no one who having put up an oven and lit a fire is cooking each lump standing thereBy only the process of caloricity the lump of food maturesThere is no one who expels each digested lump with a stick or poleJust the process of oscillation expels the digested foodIt is oscillation that does the taking onward the moving away from side to side and it is oscillation that bears turns round pulverizes causes the removal of liquidity and expelsExtension also does bearing up turning round pulverizing and the removal of liquidityCohesion apodhatu moistens and preserves wetnessCaloricity ripens or digests the food that goes inSpace becomes the way for the entering of the foodConsciousness as a consequence of right kind of action knows in any particular situationAccording to reflection of this sort should the clear comprehension of nondelusion be understood hereTaking onward moving on up to the mouthMoving away from side to side taking forwards from there to the bellyAgain taking onward  carrying beyond the mouthapertureMoving away from side to side  taking what is going bellywards sidewiseBears  causes to stand in the stomachTurns round  causes to turn back and forthPulverizes  causes the complete powdering as if by a pestleExpels  causes the depositing outside the bellyIn regard to the functions of the process of extension too the explanation is similar to that which has been already statedIndeed these  bearing turning pulverizing drying  the process of oscillation is able to do only together with the process of extensionNot singly by itselfTherefore these  bearing turning pulverizing the removal of liquidity or drying  too are stated by way of the function of the process of extensionMoistens  makes humidPreserves wetness Just as there is no very great drying by the process of oscillation and so forth so the process of cohesion preserves wetness by not wetting quiteThe way  the way for entering turning round expellingProcess of consciousness  mindconsciousness process the knowledge in regard to seeking food swallowing and the likeIn any particular situation  in any function of seeking swallowing or other similar actRight kind of actionThe act which even completes a function and becomes a condition for any particular kind of knowledgeThat act causes fulfillment of even the knowledge of the scope of that function by reason of that knowledge not arising without the actKnowsPerceives understands by way of seeking by way of full experience of swallowing by way of the digested the undigested and so forthIt should be understood that as knowledge is always preceded by the adverting or the turning of the mind to a thing knowledge too is included hereFurther the clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood through reflection on the unpleasantness connected with food in the following ten ways By way of the need to go to get it to seek it the process of eating it by way of the receptacle by way of the belly by way of food that is undigested by way of food that is digested by way of the consequences of eating by way of the trickling or oozing of food from the bodys openings in the form of excretions and by way of the pollution due to foodThe detailed exposition of the contemplation on the unpleasantness connected with food is given in the Path of PurityBy way of the need to go for it By way of going towards the almsvillage in the sense of wandering for almsThe return journey is also includedBy way of the need to seek it By way of wandering for alms in the almsvillageEntry into a retiring hall and the like become included in this naturallyBy way of the process of eating it By way of taking in the contemptible food comparable to dogs vomit in a dogs food trough rid of color and odor just when the tongue turns the food which has been reduced to pulp by the pestles of the teethBy way of the receptacle Through the food thus taken in becoming the condition for prime contemptibility by way of the fourfold receptacle placed on the top of the stomachWhat stands exists there in the upper part of the stomach is the staying place the receptacleBy way of the food that is undigested By way of nonpreparation of the food in the stomach and the intestines for absorption by the body through the process of karmaproduced caloricity called the seizer a supposed organ of the body which functions in digestion according to Ayurvedic teaching of ancient IndiaBy way of the food that is digested Digested through just the karmaproduced process of caloricity abovementionedBy way of the consequences of eating By way of effectBy way of the business called the bringing about of carcassproducts like hair and diseases like skin eruptions through the digested and undigested foodThis is stated by the commentator as the fruit of foodBy way of the trickling or oozing of food from the bodys openings in the form of excretions By way of the flowing out from eye ear and several other openings here and thereFor it is said by the AncientsBy way of the pollution due to food By way of the smearing throughout when eating of the hands lips and other members of that kind and after eating of the nine openings or doors of the bodyUccara passavakamme  In defecating and in urinating means When the time is come when the time is proper if one does not defecate or urinate then ones body perspires ones eyes reel ones mind is not collected and illness in the form of sharp pain fistula and so forth arise for oneBut to one who defecates and urinates at the proper time none of these discomforts disadvantages troubles and illnesses ariseThis is the sense in which this matter should be understood and in this sense should clear comprehension of purpose in defecation and urination be takenBy defecating or urinating in an improper place one commits disciplinary offences one goes on getting a bad name and one endangers ones lifeFields occupied or frequented by humans and places occupied or frequented by devas and devasanctuaries are improperAngry men and spirits cause even death to those who defecate or urinate in such placesBy using such places for cleansing the waste of the body bhikkhus and bhikkunis become guilty of the disciplinary offences of minor wrongdoing or of acts expiable by confession according to the circumstancesBut to one evacuating the bowels or the bladder in a place suitable for such evacuation those offences or troubles just mentioned above have no referenceAnd by way of that fitness of place clear comprehension of suitability should be understoodBy the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation clear comprehension of resort should be understoodWithin there is no doer of the act of defecation or urinationOnly by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity defecation and urination occur just as in a matured boil by the bursting of the boil pus and blood come out without any kind of wishing to come out and just as from an overfull waterpot water comes out without any desire for coming out so too the feces and urine accumulated in the abdomen and the bladder are pressed out by the force of the process of oscillationCertainly this fecesandurine coming out thus is neither that bhikkhus own nor anothersIt is just bodily excretionWhen from a watervessel or calabash a person throws out the old water the water thrown out is neither his nor othersIt simply forms parts of a process of cleansingIn the form of reflection proceeding in this way clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understoodNow we come to the explanation of the instruction dealing with clear comprehension in walking in standing in a place in sitting in some position in sleeping in walking in speaking and in keeping silence  Gate thite nisinne sutte jagarite bhasite tunhibhaveBy the words When he is going a bhikkhu understands I am going and so froth postures of long duration are indicatedAnd by the words in going forwards and backwards in bending and in stretching postures of middling duration and by the words in walking in standing In sleeping postures of short brief durationTherefore in these three parts of the instruction the practicing of clear comprehension should be known even by the triple method stated herePostures of long duration postures kept up long or postures existing in a process of going for or of one wayfaring longPostures of middling duration postures proceeding neither too long in time nor involving too long wayfaring namely those connected with wandering for alms and so forthPostures of short duration postures become diminutive by reason of brief duration and proceeding by way of going about and so forth in the monastery or elsewhereThe Elder Tipitaka Maha Siva indeed said Who after walking or exercising long in the ambulatory stands and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of exercises on the ambulatory ended just there on the ambulatory is called a doer of clear comprehension in walkingWhen after standing for a long time in study or answering a question or minding a subject of meditation sits and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of standing ended just at the time of standing is called a doer of clear comprehension in standingWho after sitting for a long time in study or other similar work lies down and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed when sitting ended just at the time of sitting is called a doer of clear comprehension in sittingWho after lying down falls asleep and then after getting up from his sleep reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of sleep ended just during sleep is called a doer of clear comprehension in sleeping and wakingBy reason of proximity of the word waking here the action of lying down is only sleep in the sense of the descent of the mind into the state of the lifecontinumIt is not merely the stretching out of the backThe nonoccurrence of processes which make action or are made of action is sleep the occurrence wakingAction is doing function of body and so forthThe processes which make action produce the function of bodily expression or the function of verbal expressionOr action is the double function of advertingThe things made of or produced from that action or double function are processes made of actionFor by way of adverting when there is the stoppage of the lifecontinum courses of cognition ariseProcesses are things which go on move changing by arising gradually in different waysSomewhere there is the reading of mental states of actionmaking mental states kriyamaya cittanam It should be understood that this is not a reading of the Ancients as it is against the commentary and explanation to the Abhidhamma and other booksImpulsion of either course of cognition is a process made of actionTherefore it is said in the explanation to the Abhiddhamma On account of the condition of processes making action of body and so forth and by reason of the condition of originating action of adverting impulsion of either course of cognition or lust of every process of the six doors gets known as a process which makes or is made of actionNonoccurrence Nonarising at the time of falling asleep is called sleepThus the thing should be understoodOtherwise sleep could be called the proceeding of even all states of doorfree consciousness before and after the sixdoor states of consciousness so it should be understood that the supervention of the lifecontinum at a time other than that of falling asleep is included in wakingHe who whilst speaking thinks This sound arises dependent on the lips teeth tongue palate and the act of the mind that accords to that sound speaks mindful and clearly comprehendingHe who for a long time has studied or expounded the Teaching or recited the words of the subject of meditation or cleared a question and later on becoming silent thinks The bodily and mental things which arose during the time of speaking ended just then is called a doer of clear comprehension in speakingHe who after remaining silent long considering the Teaching or his subject of meditation thinks that the bodily and mental things that existed in the time of silence ended just then that the occurrence of derived material qualities is speech and that the nonoccurrence of these is silence is called a doer of clear comprehension in keeping silenceThis dominance of nondelusion stated by the Elder Maha Siva is intended here in this Discourse on the Arousing of MindfulnessBut in the Discourse on the Fruit of the Homeless Life even the entire fourfold clear comprehension is foundTherefore in a special way here only by way of clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood the state of doing clear comprehensionThe occurrence of the soundbase is speech its nonoccurrence is silenceSince indeed in the exposition of the Elder Maha Siva the state of clear comprehension is considered by way of the vision of the ending then and there of material and mental qualities occurring in posture after posture without a break the state of clear comprehension should be known by way of the insight portion of the clear comprehension of nondelusion come down in the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness not by way of the detailing of the fourfold clear comprehensionTherefore only in the Discourse on the Fruit of the Homeless Life is that fourfold clear comprehension intendedThe dominance of nondelusion refers to the statement to which nondelusion is the dominant or principal thingThis statement of the Elder Maha Siva contains the reason that is found only in the Satipatthana Sutta in this connection namely clear comprehension of nondelusion by way of the insight portion or turn and not the detailing of fourfold clear comprehension as given in the Samaññaphala SuttaIn all statements the meaning of the term clear comprehension should be understood by way of only clear comprehension that is endowed with mindfulnessIndeed in the Book of Classifications these are put just in this way One goes forward mindful and clearly comprehending one goes backwards mindful and clearly comprehendingBy the words only clear comprehension that is endowed with mindfulness both the importance of clear comprehension by way of function and that of mindfulness are takenIndeed it is not the pointing out of merely the condition of mindfulness with clear comprehension for it is said nowhere does knowledge exist without mindfulnessNow in order to reinforce that thing by the Classificatory Method too the words Indeed in the Book of Classifications and so forth were spoken by the commentatorBy this indeed one makes clear the importance even of mindfulness here as of clear comprehensionThere these refers to the synoptical statement beginning with In going forwards and in going backwards he is a doer of clear comprehensionThe reciters of the Middle Collection however and the scholars of the Abhidhamma say thus A certain bhikkhu goes thinking the while of something else considering something else Another goes without causing the abandoning of the subject of meditationIn the same manner a certain bhikkhu thinking the while of something else considering something else is standing sitting or sleeping another sleeps without causing the abandoning of the subject of meditationIndeed the earnest bhikkhu comprehends thus The material and mental qualities which existed at the east end of the ambulatory passed away just there without reaching the west end of the ambulatoryThe material and mental qualities which existed at the west end of the ambulatory too passed away just there without reaching the east end of the ambulatoryThe material and mental qualities which existed at the very center of the ambulatory passed away just there without reaching either end of the ambulatoryThe material and mental qualities which existed in walking passed away without reaching the position of standingThe material and mental qualities which existed in the position of standing passed away just there without reaching the position of sitting of sitting without reaching the position of sleepingComprehending in this way again and again the mind enters the lifecontinum the unconsciousWhen arising he at once takes up the subject of meditationThis bhikkhu is a doer of clear comprehension in walking and so forthIn this way however the subject becomes unclear in sleep the subject of meditation should not be made unclearTherefore the bhikkhu having exercised to the full extent of his ability on the ambulatory stood and sat lies down comprehending thus The body is unconscious the bed is unconsciousThe body does not know I am lying down on the bed The bed also does not know On me the body is lying down He whilst just comprehending again and again thus The unconscious body is lying down on the unconscious bed the mind enters the lifecontinum the unconsciousOn awakening he at once takes up the subject of meditationThis bhikkhu is called a doer of clear comprehension in sleepingIti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus the bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body by way of the laying hold of the fourfold comprehension either in his own body or in anothers body or at one time in his own body and in anothers at another timeAnd here too in contemplating origination and so forth the origin and the dissolution of only the materiality aggregate should in the exposition be taken outThe remainder is to be understood just by the method already stated by the commentatorHere the Truth of Suffering is the mindfulness which lays hold of the fourfold clear comprehension the Truth of Origination is the precraving which originates that mindfulness the nonoccurrence of either is the Truth of Cessation the Real Path already stated is the WaytruthThus the bhikkhu having striven by way of the Four Noble Truths reaches peaceThis is indeed the means of deliverance up to arahantship of one who lays hold of the fourfold clear comprehensionAfter explaining bodycontemplation by way of the fourfold clear comprehension to explain it by way of the reflection of repulsiveness the Master said And further and so forthEverything that should be said in connection with the passage beginning with On just this body and so forth is stated in detail taking into consideration all aspects of the matter in the Path of Purity the Visuddhi Magga and its commentary The Casket of the Highest Thing Paramattha Mañjusa a summary of that account is given hereThis reflection by way of mindfulness directed bodywards called the reflection of repulsiveness is unknown to nonBuddhists in the form of subject of meditation developmentHence it is a thing which comes into being when a Buddha arises not at other timesThis mindfulness directed bodywards leads to the followingThe great tranquillity or security based on effort Great mindfulness and clear comprehension Attainment of insightknowledge Happy living here and now Realization of the fruition of wisdom and freedomThis mindfulness has been explained in the following sections Breathinginandout four kinds of deportment the fourfold clear comprehension the reflection on repulsiveness the reflection on the elements or modes of existence and the nine cemetery contemplationThere are these seven kinds of skill in study to be acquired in regard to this subject of meditation byRepetition of the parts only mentallyDetermining of the hair of the head and so forth according to colorDetermining of the parts according to shapeDetermination of situation of the parts as above or below the navel on the upper or lower side of the body directionallyDetermination of the place in the body acquired by a part that is determination spatiallyDetermination of one part by the position of another to it and by way of dissimilarity of one part to anotherThere are these ten kinds of skill in reflecting on this subject of meditationDoing it not too quicklyDoing it not too slowlyDoing it by warding off mental ramblingPractice by way of going beyond the concept of hair and so forth to the idea of repulsivenessPractice by gradual elimination of the less clear partsPractice by way of the part which is the source of ecstasyPractice by way of the Three Discourses Adhicitta Sitibhava and BojjhangakosallaThe following is the application of the simile Like the bag with the two openings is the body made up of the four great primaries earth water fire and airThe thirtytwo parts beginning with hairofthehead are like the various grains thrown into that bag after mixing themLike a man with seeing eyes is the yogiComparable to the time when after loosening the bag the various grains become clear to one reflecting is the time when the thirtytwo parts become clear to the yogiIti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in his body or in anothersSometimes he contemplates the body in his own body at other times in anothers by way of laying hold on things beginning with the hair of the headFrom here the meaning should be known just in the way already stated by the commentatorHere the mindfulness which lays hold of the thirtytwo parts is the Truth of SufferingHaving interpreted thus the portal to emancipation should be understoodThe Master having explained bodycontemplation in the form of reflection on the repulsiveness of the thirtytwo parts of the body said And further now to set forth bodycontemplation by way of reflection on the modes of materialityThe elaboration of the meaning together with the application of the simile in this connection is as followsJust as if some cowbutcher or a cowbutchers apprentice a man who works for his keep having killed a cow and made it into parts were sitting at a fourcrossroad just so a bhikkhu reflects by way of the modes on the body in any one of the four postures thus There are in this body the modes of extension cohesion caloricity and oscillationThe cowbutcher does not get rid of the cowpercept while feeding the cow driving it to the place of slaughter tying it and putting it up there killing it and even when seeing the dead carcass of the cow not until he cuts it up and divides it into parts does the perception of a cow disappearTo that butcher sitting after cutting up the cow however the perception of a cow disappears and the perception of flesh comes into beingTo him there is not this thought I am selling the cow these people are taking away the cow But to him indeed there occurs this thought I am selling flesh these people indeed are taking away fleshTo the bhikkhu similarly the perception of a being or the perception of a person does not disappear as long as he does not reflect by way of the modes of materiality in this body as it is placed or disposed in whatsoever position after sifting thoroughly the apparently compact aggregationTo him who reflects by way of the modes of materiality however the perception of a being disappears the mind gets established by way of the modes of materialityTherefore the Blessed One declared A bhikkhu reflects on just this body according as it is placed or disposed by way of the mode of materiality thinking thus There are in this body the mode of solidity the mode of cohesion the mode of caloricity and the mode of oscillation O bhikkhus in whatever manner a clever cowbutcher or a cowbutchers apprentice having slaughtered a cow and divided it by way of portions should be sitting at the junction of a crossroad in the same manner a bhikkhu reflects thinking thus There are in this body the mode of solidity And the mode of oscillation  Imameva kayam yatha thitam yatha panihitam dhatuso paccavekkhati atthi imasmim kaye pathavidhatu apodhatu tejodhatu vayodhatutiSeyyathapi bhikkhave dakkho goghatako va goghatakantevasi va gavim vadhitva catummahapathe bilaso pativibhajitva nissinno assa evameva kho bhikkhave bhikkhu imameva kayam paccavekkhati atthi imasmim kaye pathavidhatu vayodhatutiThe yogi is comparable to the cowbutcher the perception of a being is comparable to the perception of a cow the fourfold posture is comparable to the crossroad and the reflection by way of the modes of materiality is comparable to the state of sitting with the cows flesh in front after dividing the cow into partsHere this is the textual explanationDetails of the reflection on the modes of materiality as a subject of meditation however are given in the Path of PurityIti ajjhattam  Thus internally One dwells contemplating the body in the body thus by way of the laying hold of the four modes of materiality in ones own or in anothers body or at one time in ones own body and at another time in anothers bodyFrom here on the exposition should be known just by the method already mentionedThe mindfulness which lays hold of the four modes of materiality is the Truth of SufferingThus the portal to deliverance should be knownBy the word placed there is the elucidation of occasion by way of own function of material things known as the body in various momentsBy the word disposed here the following meaning should be known By way of condition the putting down or settling owing to the arrangement of several conditionsReflects  Considers again and again sees analytically part by part separately after sifting thoroughly with the eye of wisdomAfter explaining bodycontemplation in the form of the modes of materiality the Master said And further in order to explain bodycontemplation through the nine cemetery contemplationsUddhumatam  Swollen By reason of the swelled state of the corpse comparable to a pair of windfilled bellows owing to the gradually uprising bloattedness after deathVinilakam  Blue is stated to be the color of fully differing shadesBlue is that corpse which is reddish in the protuberantly fleshy parts and whitish in the purulent parts while in those parts which are predominantly blue it seems to be as though covered with a blue mantleThis is the descriptive statement of the blue corpseVipubbakajatam  Festering is the corpse that is full of pus flowing from the broken parts or from the nine openings of the bodySo imameva kayam upasamharati ayampi kho kayo evam dhammo evam bhavi evam anatitoti  He thinks of his own body thus This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that body This has been stated By the existence of these three life warmth consciousness this body can endure to stand to walk and do other things by the separation of these three however this body is indeed a thing like that corpse is possessed of the nature of corruption is going to become like that will become swollen blue and festering and cannot escape the state of being like that cannot transcend the condition of swelling up become blue and festeringIti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus by laying hold of the state of swelling and so forth in regard to ones own body or anothers or at one time in regard to ones own and at another in regard to anothers one dwells contemplating the body in the bodyKhajjamanam  Whilst it is being eaten When crows and other creatures after sitting on the belly or another part of the corpse are eating the carcass by picking the flesh of the belly of the lips the corners of the eye and so forthSamamsalohitam  Together with flesh and blood With the flesh and blood still remainingNimmamsalohitam  Bloodbesmeared without flesh When though rid of flesh the blood is still not dryAññena  In a different place In a different directionHatthatthikam  Bone of the hand the sixtyfour kinds of bones of the hand when these are lying in different places separate from one anotherIn the explanation of the bone of the foot and so forth the method is the same as thisTerovassikani  More than a year old beyond a year in a state of exposurePutini  Rotten just those in the open become rotten by being exposed to wind sun and rain for over a yearBones buried in the earth last longerCunnakajatani  Become dust scattered in the form of powderEverywhere according to the method already stated beginning He thinks of his own body thus This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that bodyIti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus through the laying hold of the corpse from the state in which it is being eaten by crows and other creatures to the state when it is dust one dwells contemplating the body in ones own body or in anothers or at one time in ones own body and at another time in anothers bodyFurther having stopped here one should put together the nine cemetery contemplations thusEkahamatam va dvihamatam va tihamatam va  A body dead one two or three day This is the first contemplationKakehi va khajjamanam  Whilst it is being eaten by crows This portion of the Discourse where the devouring of the body of various kinds of animals is stated refers to the second contemplationAtthikasamkhalikam samamsalohitam naharusambandham  A skeleton together with flesh and blood held in by the tendons This is the third contemplationNimmamsalohitamakkhitam naharusambandham  A bloodsmeared skeleton without flesh but held in by the tendons This is the fourthApagatamamsalohitam naharusambandham  A skeleton held in by the tendons but without flesh and not besmeared with blood This is the fifthAtthikani apagatasambandhani  Bones gone loose scattered in all directions This is the sixthAtthikani setani sankhavannupanibhani  Bones white in color like a conch This is the seventhAtthikani puñjakitani terovassikani  Bones more than a year old heaped together This is the eighthAtthikani putini cunnakajatani  Bones gone rotten and become dust This is the ninthEvam kho bhikkhave  Thus indeed o bhikkhus He said this bringing to an end bodycontemplation after pointing out the nine cemetery contemplationsThe mindfulness which lays hold of the nine cemetery contemplations is the Truth of Suffering the previous craving which originates that mindfulness is the Truth of Origin the nonoccurrence of both that mindfulness and the craving is the Truth of CessationThe Real Path that understands suffering casts out the origin and has cessation for its object is the Truth of the WayEndeavoring in this way by means of the Four Truths one arrives at peaceThis is for the bhikkhu who lays hold of the nine cemetery contemplations the portal of deliverance up to arahantshipNow these are the fourteen portions which comprise bodycontemplation The section on breathing in and breathing out on the postures on the four kinds of clear comprehension of reflection on repulsiveness on the modes of materiality and on the nine cemetery contemplationsThere only the sections on breathing in and breathing out and of the reflection on repulsiveness can become meditationsubjects of full absorptionAs the cemetery contemplations are stated by way of consideration of disadvantages dangers or evils all the remaining twelve are only meditationsubjects of partial absorptionThe Blessed One having in this way set forth the Arousing of Mindfulness through the fourteenfold method of bodycontemplation now said And now o bhikkhus in order to expound the ninefold method of contemplation of feelingThere the meaning of pleasant feeling  sukham vedanam is as follows The bhikkhu when experiencing a bodily or mental pleasant feeling knows I experience a pleasant feelingCertainly while they experience a pleasant feeling in sucking the breast and on similar occasions even infants lying on their backs know that they experience pleasureBut this meditators knowledge is differentKnowledge of pleasure possessed by infants lying on their backs and other similar kinds of knowledge of pleasure do not cast out the belief in a being do not root out the perception of a being do not become a subject of meditation and do not become the cultivation of the Arousing of MindfulnessBut the knowledge of this bhikkhu casts out the belief in a being uproots the perception of a being is a subject of meditation and is the cultivation of the Arousing of MindfulnessIndeed the knowledge meant here is concerned with experience that is wisely understood through inquiryWho feelsNo being or personWhose is the feelingNot of a being or personOwing to what is there the feelingFeeling can arise with things  forms sounds smells and so forth  as objectsThat bhikkhu knows therefore that there is a mere experiencing of feeling after the objectifying of a particular pleasurable or painful physical basis or of one of indifferencebecause there is no doer or agent besides a bare processThe word bare indicates that the process is impersonalThe words of the Discourse I experience form a conventional expression indeed for that process of impersonal feelingIt should be understood that the bhikkhu knows that with the objectification of a property or basis he experiences a feelingIt is said that an Elder of Cittala Hill was sick turning over from side to side again and again and groaning with great painTo him a young bhikkhu said Venerable Sir which part of your body is painful  A specially painful place indeed there is not as a result of taking certain things for object there is the experiencing of painful feeling replied the ElderVenerable Sir from the time one knows that is not bearing up befitting said the young bhikkhuI am bearing up friend said the ElderBearing up is excellent Venerable Sir said the young bhikkhuThe Elder bore upThereafter the aerial humor caused injury right up to the heartHis intestines protruded out and lay in a heap on the bedThe Elder pointed that out to the young bhikkhu and said Friend is bearing up so far befitting The young bhikkhu remained silentThe Elder having applied concentration with energy attained arahantship with Analytical Knowledge and passed away into the final peace of Nibbana in the state of consciousness immediately after the course of reflection on the fruit of arahantship thus realizing the highest and passing away nearly at the same timeJust as when experiencing a pleasant feeling so too when experiencing a painful feeling a neitherpleasantnorpainful spiritual feeling he understands I experience a neitherpleasantnorpainful spiritual feelingThus the Blessed One when expounding the noncorporeal subject of meditation after the corporeal subject of meditation expounds it by way of feelingFor twofold is the subject of meditation the subject of meditation of corporeality or materiality and the subject of meditation which is noncorporeal or nonmaterialThis twofold subject of meditation is also spoken of as the laying hold of the mental and the laying hold of the materialWhile the Blessed One is expounding the material subject of meditation by way of brief or lengthy reflection he expounds the discernment of the four modes of materialityBoth those ways of reflection are pointed out fully in the Path of PurityWhile expounding however the mental subject of meditation generally the Master expounds it by way of the contemplation on feelingThreefold indeed is the establishing in the mental subject of meditation by way of senseimpression feeling and mindHowTo some meditator indeed when the material subject of meditation is laid hold of when there is the first impact of mindwithmentalcharacteristics on the object the senseimpression that arises with the contacting of that object becomes clearTo another the feeling that arises with the experiencing of that object becomes clearTo yet another the consciousness that arises with the knowing of that object becomes clearWhen senseimpression becomes clear not only does senseimpression arise together with that senseimpression arise feeling perception volition and consciousnessWhen feeling becomes clear the other four too ariseAlso when consciousness becomes clear the other four ariseThe bhikkhu on reflecting thus Dependent on what is this group of five things knows as follows Dependent on the corporeal baseThat coarse body about which it is said And indeed this consciousness of mine is depending on is bound up with this body that in its actual nature consists of the four great physical things the four great primaries and the physical qualities sourcing from the four great primariesThese physical qualities are called derived materialityHere the bhikkhu sees mind and body thinking The corporeal base aforesaid is body the five beginning with senseimpression are mindIn this connection there are the five aggregates because the body is the aggregate of materiality and the mind the four aggregates of nonmaterial thingsThere is neither a fivefold aggregation separate from the mind and body nor a mind and body separate from the fivefold aggregationThe bhikkhu who tries to find out what the cause of these five aggregates is sees that these are due to ignorance etcHenceforth the bhikkhu lives with thorough knowledge thinking that this thing the fivefold aggregation is only something conditioned and includes what is produced from conditioningIt is a congeries of bare formations indeed of bare processesHe applies to it by way of the mind and body that exist together with conditions according to the gradual succession of insightproducing knowledge the words impermanent subjecttosuffering and soullessAfter getting suitable weather conditions a person of advantage to him spiritually food that agrees with him or fitting doctrinal instructions the bhikkhu desirous of realization says Today today fixed in one posture reaches the acme of insight and stands fast in the fruit of arahantshipFor the three kinds of persons aforesaid the subject of meditation up to arahantship is expounded in this wayHere however the Blessed One speaking of the nonmaterial or mental subject of meditation speaks by way of feelingWhile expounding by way of senseimpression or consciousness the subject of meditation does not become clearIt seems darkBut by way of feeling it becomes clearWhyBecause of the clearness of the arising of feelingIndeed the arising of pleasant or painful feeling is clearWhen pleasant feeling arises spreading through and flowing over the whole body making one to utter the words Ah tis joy it is like causing one to eat fresh clarified butter cooled in very cold water a hundred times after being melted again and again also a hundred times it is like causing one to be massaged with an emollient oil worth a hundred pieces and it is like causing one to be cooled of a burning fever with a thousand pots of cold waterWhen painful feeling arises spreading through and flowing over the whole body making one to bewail with the words Alas what woe it is like the applying on one of a heated plowshare it is like the sprinkling upon one of molten copper and it is comparable to the hurling into dried grass and trees in the forest of bundles of wood firebrandsThus the arising of pleasant or painful feeling becomes clear but the arising of the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is dark and unclearThe neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling becomes clear to one who grasps it methodically thinking At the disappearance of pleasure and pain the neutral neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling occurs which is contrary to the pleasant and the unpleasant To what is it comparableTo a deer hunter following the hoof marks of a deer which midway having gone up a flat rock is fleeingThe hunter after seeing the hoof marks on the hither and thither side of the rock without seeing any trace in the middle knows by inference Here the animal went up and here it went down in the middle on the flat rock possibly it went through this partLike the hoofmark at the place of going up the arising of pleasurable feeling becomes clearLike the hoofmark at the place of descent the arising of painful feeling becomes clearLike the grasping through inference of the part traversed over the rock by the deer is the laying hold of the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling methodically with the thought At the disappearance of pleasure and pain the neutral neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling occurs which is contrary to the pleasant and the unpleasantIn this manner the Blessed One having expounded at first the form subject of meditation later pointed out the formless subject of meditation by way of feeling having taken it out from the fivefold aggregation distinguishinglyNot only here did he point it out thusIn the Cula Tanhasankkhaya the Cula Vedalla the Maha Vedalla the Ratthapala Magandiya Dhatuvibhanga and Aneñjasappaya of the Majjhima Nikaya in the Maha Nidana Sakkapañha and Maha Satipatthana of the Digha Nikaya in the Cula Nidana Rukkhupama and Parivimamsana Suttas of the Samyutta Nikaya in the whole of the Vedana Samyutta of the same Nikaya and in many other discourses did the Master point out the formless subject of meditation by way of feeling having taken out feeling from the fivefold aggregation after first expounding the form subject of meditationThis is another method of understanding understands I experience a pleasant feeling  Sukham vedanam vediyamiti pajanatiBy the absence of painful feeling at the moment of pleasant feeling he knows while experiencing a pleasant feeling I am experiencing a pleasant feeling By reason of that knowledge of the experiencing of pleasant feeling owing to the absence now of whatsoever painful feeling that existed before and owing to the absence of this pleasant feeling before the present time feeling is called an impermanent a not lasting and a changeful thingWhen he knows the pleasant feeling in the pleasant feeling thus there is clear comprehensionFor it is said in the th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya by the Blessed One When one experiences a pleasant feeling Aggivessana then one does not experience a painful feeling or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingOnly the pleasant feeling does one then experienceWhen one experiences a painful feeling Aggivessana then one does not experience a pleasant or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingOnly a painful feeling does one then experienceWhen one experiences a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling then one does not experience a pleasant or a painful feelingOnly a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling does one then experiencePleasant feeling indeed Aggivessana is a thing that is impermanent puttogether dependently originating decaying passing away fading and ceasingSo is painful feeling and the neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingThe learned real disciple Aggivessana seeing thus turns away from the pleasant feeling even as he does from the painful and the neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingsTurning away he detaches himself by absence of attachment he frees himself freed he knows thus I am freed of cravingDestroyed by me is rebirth lived by me is the Highest Life of the Real Way done by me is the work of developing the Real Way that must be developed and there is no more work to be done by mePleasant worldly feeling refers to the six joyful feelings connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilementsPleasant spiritual feeling refers to the six joyful feelings connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesirePainful worldly feeling refers to the six feelings of grief connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilementsPainful spiritual feeling refers to the six feelings of grief connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesireWorldly neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling refers to the six feelings of indifference connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilementsSpiritual neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling refers to the six feelings of indifference connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesireThe division into pleasant worldly feeling and so forth is in the th Sutta of the Majjhima NikayaAjjhattam  Internally The bhikkhu dwells contemplating feelings in the feelings that are his own by laying hold of the pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingOr he dwells contemplating feelings in the feelings of others by laying hold of the pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful feelings in the way told aboveOr at one time he contemplates his own feelings and at another time anothersSamudayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationthings In this contemplation of feeling the bhikkhu dwells seeing the origination and the dissolution of the aggregate of feeling or seeing the origination of feeling at one time and the dissolution of feeling at another time by way of ignorance craving and so forth in the five ways mentioned in the Section on the Modes of DeportmentFrom here on it should be understood that the exposition is just according to the method followed in the explanation of bodycontemplationIndeed the mindfulness that lays hold of feeling is the Truth of SufferingThus the portal of deliverance for the bhikkhu who lays hold of feeling should be understoodAfter explaining the ninefold Arousing of Mindfulness in regard to feeling the Master began the explanation of the contemplation of consciousness in the sixteenfold way with the words And how o bhikkhusIn this section there is no reference to supramundane truth because in the sifting of things thoroughly to see their transient painladen and soulless nature only the mundane things are handled and so there is in this matter of penetrative knowledge of things no bringing together of mundane and supramundane thingsHere follows the elucidation of terms mentioned in this sectionSaragam cittam  The consciousness with lust Karmically unwholesome eight conscious states of the plane of existence of senseexperienceThese are together with greed in the sense of springing from itVitaragam cittam  The consciousness without lust Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousnessThe two spontaneous and nonspontaneous conscious states karmically unwholesome accompanied by grief linked to resentment and springing from hate the conscious state karmically unwholesome accompanied by neither pain nor pleasure linked to doubt and springing from ignorance and the conscious state karmically unwholesome accompanied by neither pain nor pleasure linked to agitation springing from ignorance  these four do not associate with the consciousnesswithlustdivision or the consciousnesswithoutlust divisionSodosam cittam  The consciousness with hate The two conscious states karmically unwholesome accompanied by griefVitadosam cittam  The consciousness without hate Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousnessThe other ten karmically unwholesome conscious states of the plane of existence of senseexperience do not associate with either the consciousnesswithhate division or the consciousnesswithouthate divisionSamoham cittam  The consciousness with ignorance The conscious state karmically unwholesome linked to doubt and the conscious state karmically unwholesome linked to agitationBecause indeed ignorance arises in all karmically bad states the other karmically bad states too should be mentioned hereIn just this division all the twelve karmically bad unwholesome or unskillful conscious states are includedVitamoham cittam  The consciousness without ignorance Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousnessSankhittam cittam  The shrunken state of consciousness The conscious state fallen into sloth and torporThat is called the shrivelled or contracted state of mindVikkhittam cittam  The distracted state of consciousness The conscious state accompanied by agitationThat is called the dissipated mindMahaggatam cittam  The state of consciousness become great The conscious state of the sensuousethereal plane of existence and of the purely ethereal plane of existenceAmahaggatam cittam  The state of consciousness not become great The conscious state of the plane of existence of senseexperienceSauttaram cittam  The state of consciousness with some other mental state superior to it That refers to any conscious state belonging to the plane of senseexperienceAnuttaram cittam  The state of consciousness with no other mental state superior to it That refers to any conscious state belonging to the sensuousethereal or the purely ethereal planeSamahitam cittam  The quieted state of consciousness It refers to the conscious state of him who has full or partial absorptionAsamahitam cittam  The state of consciousness not quieted It refers to the conscious state without either absorptionVimuttam cittam  the freed state of consciousness That refers to the conscious state emancipated partially from defilements through systematic or radical reflection or to the conscious state emancipated through the suppression of the defilements in absorptionBoth these kinds of emancipation are temporaryAvimuttam cittam  The unfreed state of consciousness That refers to any conscious state without either kind of temporary emancipationIn the mundane path of the beginner there is no place for the supramundane kinds of emancipation through extirpation stilling and final releaseIti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness by laying hold on the consciousness with lust and so forth when these states of consciousness proceed in his own flux or in anothers flux or by laying hold of these conscious states at one time as they proceed in his own flux and at another time as they proceed in anothers fluxSamudayavayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationanddissolutionthings Here the arising of the aggregate of consciousness should be explained with the pointing out of the origination of consciousness from the origination of ignorance and so forth in the five ways according to the method shown in the Section on the Modes of DeportmentAnd the passing away of consciousness should also be explained in the same way as it is shown in the Section on the Modes of DeportmentFrom here on there is nothing new in the method of explanationThe mindfulness which lays hold of consciousness is the Truth of SufferingThus the portal of deliverance up to arahantship of the bhikkhu who lays hold of consciousness as a subject of meditation ought to be understoodIn the consciousness with lust lust occurs as a mental concomitant arising and passing away along with a conscious state and sharing with that conscious state the object and basis of consciousnessIn this sense of a conscious state wellknit with lust one speaks of the consciousness with lustThe term consciousness without lust is used as a contrary of the term consciousness with lust not as a contradictoryThat becomes clear when we know that the work to be done in this contemplation of the mind consists of the laying hold of the things of the three planes of cosmic existence for the purpose of developing the conviction based on insight in regard to cosmic impermanence cosmic suffering and cosmic insubstantialityIn no stage of mundane thought can it be said that latency of lust is destroyed and so the term consciousness without lust indicates only a relatively lustfree conscious stateThe grouping of conscious states here it is said may be questionedFor instance in the two states of consciousness with hate is there just absence of lust because these two states are not wellknit together with lustCould there not be in them a trace of lust functioning as a distant condition as when a mans lust for a woman produces hate towards another who stands between him and the possession or enjoyment of his object of lustIf there indeed could not be such a trace of lust in these two conscious states of hate are these seven states of consciousness without lustWhen the commentator said that the four remaining karmically bad states do not associate with either the consciousness with lust or without lust he only wanted to show them just separate from the pair known by the phrases with lust and without lustIf so then would not one fall into partial knowledgeNoBecause of their being included in the pairs Consciousness with ignorance is twofoldIt is either accompanied by doubt or by agitationAs this consciousness in either of its forms is fit to be called a delusion by way of particularity owing to excessive observation and special endowment with ignorance these two forms namely the one linked to doubt and the one linked to agitation are in an outstanding manner with ignoranceBy reason of the mind proceeding slackly in a shrivelled state owing to want of interest in the object and more or less with displeasure there is the shrunken state of consciousnessThis is a name applicable to the five karmically unwholesome sensuous conscious states not marked by spontaneityThere is the conscious state associated with agitation in the sense of agitation having become powerful in the consciousnessAll karmically bad conscious states are indeed accompanied by agitationThe mental state accompanied by agitation is called the distracted mind because it spreads outside its object by way of diffused thinkingBy the ability to suppress the defilements and by the abundance of fruition and by the great length or extent of the series of its particular courses of cognition there is a state of consciousness become greatOr there is a state of consciousness become great by reason of lofty regenerative wish and so forthThe state of consciousness become great is the mind that has reached the ground of the sensuousethereal and the purely ethereal planes of existenceAs there is nothing in the cosmos greater than the sensuousethereal and the purely ethereal the commentator explained the consciousness become great by reference to these two highest planes of existenceThe state of consciousness with some other mental state superior to it refers to the consciousness that has not reached the highest possible planes of attainment in cosmic existence or the consciousness that can become more fine and the state of consciousness with no other mental state superior to it is that which has got to the highest planes of cosmic existence or that which has reached the acme of fineness of mundane states of mindAfter explaining the Arousing of Mindfulness of the sixteenfold contemplation of consciousness the Master said And how o bhikkhus in order to expound the fivefold contemplation of mental objects  things spiritual and materialFurther the laying hold of pure corporeality or materiality was taught by the Blessed One in the instruction on bodycontemplation and in the instruction on the contemplation of feeling and consciousness the laying hold of the purely spiritualNow in order to teach the laying hold of a mixture of the material and the spiritual he said And how o bhikkhus and so forthOr in the contemplation on the body the laying hold of the aggregate of corporeality or materiality was spoken of by the Master in the contemplation on feeling the laying hold of the aggregate of feeling in the contemplation on mind the laying hold of the aggregate of consciousness and now in order to speak of even the laying hold of the aggregates of perception and formations he said And how o bhikkhus and so forthThere in the Discourse the word santam  present It means existing by way of occurrence practice or repeated happeningAsantam  not present Not existing by way of nonoccurrence or because of rejection from the mind by way of reflection or concentrationIn connection with the hindrances it must be known that the hindrance of sensuality arises because of wrong reflection on an object that is sensuously agreeable pleasant favorableSuch an object is either sensuality itself or that which produces sensuality  the sensualityobjectWrong reflection is inexpedient reflection reflection on the wrong trackOr it is reflection which considers the impermanent as permanent pain as pleasure nonsoul as soul the bad as goodSensedesire arises when wrong reflection occurs plentifully in a sensuously good objectTherefore the Blessed One said that the condition for the arising of fresh sensedesire and for the increase and expansion of existing sensedesire is plentiful wrong reflection on a sensuously auspicious or promising objectSensedesire is cast out indeed with right reflection on a sensuously inauspicious or unpromising objectSuch an object itself or the jhana developed through such an object is meant by the term sensuously inauspicious objectRight reflection is expedient reflection reflection going on the right trackIt is reflection that considers the facts of impermanence suffering soullessness and of impurity according to realityWhen there is much right reflection on the sensuously inauspicious or unpromising object sensedesire is knocked outTherefore the Blessed One said that the condition for keeping out new sensedesire and for casting out old sensedesire is abundant right reflection on the sensuously inauspicious or unpromising objectFurther there are six things which lead to the casting out of sensedesire Taking up the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation application for the development of the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation the guarded state of the controlling faculties of sense moderation in food the sympathy and support of good men in the endeavor stimulating talk that helps the accomplishment of the object in viewExplaining these six it is said Taking up refers to the taking up of the tenfold object sensuously inauspicious impure or bad the man who takes it up will cast out sensedesireSensedesire will also be cast out by him who develops the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious object of meditation by him who guards the controlling faculties of sense by closing the six sense doors and by him who knows the measure of food for sustenance and of whom it is saidIt will also be cast out by him who keeps the company of men like the Elder Tissa the worker in the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation sympathetic towards those who endeavor in accomplishing the casting out of sensedesire and by talk connected with the tenfold sensuously inauspicious objectTherefore it is said by the commentator that six things are conducive to the casting out of sensedesireSensedesire cast out by these six things becomes incapable of arising in the future through the attainment of the path of arahantshipHindrances have to be cast out first in the course of proper trainingWith the casting out of the hindrances there is induced jhana the means of attaining quietudeThus indeed is bodycontemplation surely taught with quietude precedingAfterwards is given the higher instruction in regard to all divisions beginning with what should be understood  the aggregations and the sensebase which ought to be understood and the factors of enlightenment which should be developedTherefore here too the development of quietude is desired so far as it is for the sake of insightIt is said The instruction on the Arousing of Mindfulness has insight as the chief thing abounds in insightSince there is no state of yoking together of the good and the bad moral qualities similar to the yoking of two bulls to a cart  since the good and the bad do not exist together  from the absence of sensuality at the time of seeing ones mind through knowledge it is said by way of occurrenceAt the moment of seeing wisely the occurrence of sensedesire there is no sensedesire as good and bad states of mind cannot exist togetherExisting means When it is found in ones own mental fluxSensuously inauspicious or unpromising objects are the ten inanimate things The corpse that is swollen Blue Festering Fissured Mangled Dismembered Cut and dismembered With blood Wormy Become a skeletonDetails of these may be found in The Path of Purity in the exposition of the subject of meditation on the foulAnd the perception of hair of the head and so forth because it is called in the Girimananda Sutta the perception of the sensuously inauspicious or impure is taken as the sensuously inauspicious animate thingThe jhana on the sensuously inauspicious object occurs in an inanimate or animate sensuously inauspicious thingAnd the indication of the four kinds of wrong reflection and the four kinds of right reflection in regard to the sensuously inauspicious object is for the purpose of pointing out fully the subjectThe four kinds of consideration of the impure as pure the impermanent as permanent suffering as pleasure and nonsoul as soul are the four kinds of wrong reflection and the four kinds of consideration of the impure as impure and so forth are the four kinds of right reflectionThe taking up of the practice of considering the repulsiveness of any of the eleven kinds of the sensuously inauspicious or the practice of contemplation on the sensuously inauspicious object is taking up or upholdingThe application to the development of the thought bent on the sensuously inauspicious object which brings partial and full concentration is application for the development of the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditationCertain teachers say that as there is no opportunity for sensedesire in him who knows the proper measure of food to be taken through absence of trouble owing to that knowledge from sloth and torpor sensedesire is cast out in such a personJust this reason is given in even the expository portion The person who practices moderation in food brings about the perception of impurity bound up with that food for instance through the alteration of food by way of bodily excretions and dwells on other similar thoughts as well as on the idea of corporeal subjection to foodSuch a person casts out sensedesireThe Elder Tissa referred to in the commentary above is the Elder Maha Tissa who saw the teeth of a woman and who by doing right reflection on their bony nature cast out sensedesire through jhanaAccording to the Abhidhamma method of instruction even the whole world is the hindrance of sensedesireTherefore the commentator said through the attainment of the path of arahantshipIndeed wrong reflection on an object of resentment produces angerIn this connection anger itself as well as the object which causes anger is called the resentmentobject or the sign of resentmentWrong reflection has just the same character everywhere and when it occurs much in the resentmentobject or the resentmentsign anger arisesTherefore the Blessed One said that intense wrong reflection on an object of resentment is the cause of fresh anger and of the increase and expansion of anger already existingBy right reflection of the liberating thought of love the thought of love that frees the heart indeed anger gets cast outThe term love here is applicable both to partial concentration and full concentrationHeartliberating love is only full concentrationRight reflection has the same character throughoutWhen it occurs strong in the thought of love anger is removed from the heartTherefore the Master said There is o bhikkhus the liberation of the mind through loveIntense right reflection on love is the condition for keeping out new anger and for throwing out anger that is already in the heartAnd it is said that these six things help to cast anger out Taking up the practice of the love subject of meditation applying oneself to the development of jhana on the thought of love reflection on ones action as ones own property abundance of wise consideration sympathetic and helpful companionship of the good and stimulating talk that assists the development of the thought of love and the overthrow of angerIn explanation the commentator said Anger will be put down in one who takes up the love subject of meditation by way of spreading it particularly or separatelyOr if one takes up the love subject of meditation by way of spreading it generally without particularization or directional restriction in space then too anger will be put down in oneAnger vanishes also through the development of jhana by spreading love restrictedly with differentiation on seven or twentyeight ways or by spreading it unrestrictedly without differentiation in five or twenty ways or by spreading it directionally towards the ten points in spaceAnger vanishes in one who reflects thus too What will you do to him by becoming angry Will you be able to destroy things like his virtue Have you not been born here just by your own actions and will you not also by your own actions get reborn hereafter Getting angry with another is comparable to the state of him who wishes to strike another with glowing coals redhot crowbar excreta and such other damaging things after taking them up in his bare hands And what can another who is angry with you do to you Can he destroy your virtue or any other similar thing of yours He too has been born here as a result of his actions and will be reborn hereafter just according to his actions Like a present not accepted is that anger of his and like a handful of dust thrown against the wind that anger of his alights on his own head In this way one reflects on ones own action as ones own property and also another persons action as that persons own and puts out angerTo one remaining in an abundance of wise consideration after reflecting on action as ones or anothers own property anger vanishesAnd it vanishes in him who is in the company of a sympathetic friend who delights in developing the jhana of the thought of love like the Elder Assagutta and through stimulating talk on the thought of love when in any one of the four posturesTherefore it is said Six things are conducive to the casting out of angerThe anger cast out by these six things however is finally destroyed by the attainment of the state of the Anagami the neverreturnerThe thought of love is a sublime state of mind it is ones own state of freedom from hatredA detailed description of the way of developing love as a subject of meditation is given in the Path of PurityThe following summary of hints gathered from different comments and the Path of Purity will be helpful to a beginnerThe lovethought of meditation is different from worldly attachmentIt is based on wishing well to all beingsThe idea of possession of the loved object is foreign to itIt is not a state of mind that encourages exclusivenessThe aim of the meditation is finally to include in the ambit of ones goodwill all beings equally without distinctionThe liberation of the mind through love refers only to full concentrationWithout reaching full concentration there is no effective freedom from angerThe beginner who works at this subject of meditation is not to practice the thought of love at firstOn a dead person as the practice would be futileOn an enemy as anger might ariseOn an indifferent person as the practice might prove wearisomeOn one who is very dear as the arousing of friendly thoughts without attachment towards such a one would be tiring and as mental agitation might occur should even some slight trouble overtake that oneTaking up the practice of the love subject of meditation is the generating the bringing about of the characteristic sign or mark of the love thought of meditation of him who through lovingkindness gathers together all beings with goodwillThe reflection on the thought of love itself is the sign of the love thought of meditation because the reflection arisen first is the reason of the later reflectionSpreading it particularly Consecutively in the following order to oneself to a friend an indifferent person and an enemySpreading it generally By breaking down all barriers limits and reservations which separate oneself from all others and extending the same kind of friendly thought to allDirectionally Extending the thought of love towards one point of the compass for instance the eastThese three kinds of spreading of the thought of love refer to the stage of meditation of taking up the practice of the thought of love which covers the training from the beginning to the attainment of partial concentrationIn regard to this state of meditation the following is stated Spreading the thought of love after particularizing the direction by way of a monastery a street village and so forth is one way and spreading the thought of love towards a direction in space generally by way of the eastern direction and so forth without specifying a monastery and so forth is another way of practiceThe development of the jhana on the thought of love is the practice again and again of the thought of love that has got partial concentrationThe development is done in three ways The spreading of the love thought universallyThis is done by wishing that all living beings all breathing things all beings born all persons all who have reached a state of individuality be without hatred disease and grief and be happy taking care of themselvesSpreading the thought of love by way of a restricted group of beingsThis is done by wishing that all females all males all purified ones all nonpurified ones all divine beings all humans all beings fallen to states of woe be without hatred disease and grief and happy taking care of themselvesSpreading the thought of love directionally in spaceThis is done by restricting the thought of love towards each of the ten directions in space the cardinal points the intermediate points and the zenith and nadirAnd it is also done by wishing that the beings in each of the directions taken up according to the divisions and groups given above be without hatred and so forth according to the formula already mentionedThrough wrong reflection on a state of boredom and the like sloth and torpor come to beBoredom is just dissatisfactionLassitude is bodily lazinessLanguidity of body is the bending of the body torpidly in getting up and in similar actionsLethargy after a meal is a dizziness or slight faint which is due to eating a principal mealIt is also called the discomfort which follows such a mealThe minds sluggishness is the dullness of the mindAn abundance of wrong reflection on boredom and similar states of mind produces sloth and torporTherefore the Blessed One said that much wrong reflection on boredom lassitude languidity of body lethargy after a meal and the minds sluggishness is a condition for the production of fresh sloth and torpor and the increase and expansion of sloth and torpor already come into beingThrough right reflection in inceptive energy and similar states of mind is brought about the overthrow of sloth and torporInceptive energy is the effort first set afootExertion is more powerful than the inceptive energy because it leaves indolence behindAnd because of its assailing further and further of the destructive condition progressive endeavor is more powerful than exertionBy the exercise of right reflection intensely on this threefold strenuousness sloth and torpor are cast outTherefore the Blessed One said that the condition for keeping out new sloth and torpor and for casting out sloth and torpor that is old is abundant right reflection on the element of inceptive energy of exertion and of progressive endeavorThere are six things which lead to the casting out of sloth and torpor The seeing of the reason of sloth and torpor in the fact of eating too much or gluttony the changing of the postures completely reflection on the perception of light staying in the open sympathetic and helpful companionship of the good and stimulating talk that assists in dispelling sloth an torporThere is the following explanation of these six things The bhikkhu who has eaten gluttonously is assailed by sloth and torpor while doing his recluse duty of meditation in his day or night quarters as by a mighty elephant pressing down on him but that one who practices moderation in food is not troubled thus with these hindrancesIn one who thus sees the characteristic of sloth and torpor in gluttony there is the casting out of sloth and torporSloth and torpor disappear in him who changes over from the posture which induces sloth and torpor to another in him who reflects on the brightness or the light of the moon a lamp or a torch by night and on the light or brightness of the sun by day in him who lives in the open in him who associates with sympathetic and helpful companions like the Elder Maha Kassapa who have dispelled sloth and torpor and by stimulating talk connected with a strict recluseregimenTherefore it is said Six things lead to the casting out of sloth and torporThe yogi understands thus sloth and torpor cast out by these six things are stopped from arising forever in the future by the attainment of the path of arahantshipThe bhikkhu who has eaten gluttonously after the manner of the wellknown types of Brahmanical gormandizers mentioned in ancient Indian booksThere are five kinds of these greedy eaters He who eats until he has to be raised up by the hand from his seatHe who lies rolling just where he has eaten and eats as long as he likesHe who eats until he slips off his waist clothHe who fills himself with food in such a way that it seems as if a crow could peck at the food in himHe who having filled his belly full and vomitted eats more food again or he who eats until he vomitsOn the light or brightness of the sun by day The meaning should be understood thus Sloth and torpor vanish in him too who at night is reflecting on the image of the perception of the brightness of the sun he got by dayHere it may be helpful to state the eight ways of dealing with torpor taught by the Master to the Elder Maha Moggallana One should neglect to mind the thought which says that drowsiness is descending on one or one should reflect on the Dhamma or repeat or recite the Dhamma or pull both earlobes and rub or massage the limbs with the hands or getting up from the sitting position apply water on and rub the eyes and look into the distance at the constellations in the starry sky or reflect on the thought of light or fix the thought on the ambulatory aware of the ends of it with the controlling faculties of sense turned inwards and the mind kept in or sleep conscious of the time of waking and on awaking get up quickly thinking that one will not give oneself to the comforts of lying down reclining and languor when all other seven ways failWrong reflection on mental agitation brings about flurry and worryMental agitation is inner turbulenceActually it is flurry and worry onlyIntense wrong reflection on that mental agitation produces flurry and worryTherefore the Blessed One said that wrong reflection on mental agitation when plentifully done produces fresh flurry and worry and increases and expands flurry and worry already in existenceThe casting out of agitation and worry occurs through right reflection on mental tranquillity called concentration and an abundance of right reflection on mental tranquillity says the Blessed One is a condition for the keeping out of fresh mental agitation and worry and the dispelling of agitation and worry already in the mindSix things are conducive to the casting out of agitation and worry Knowledge questioning understanding of disciplinary rules association with those more experienced and older than oneself in the practice of things like virtue sympathetic and helpful companionship and stimulating talk that helps the rejection of mental agitation and worryIn explanation it is said as follows Agitation and worry disappear in him who learns in the spirit and in the letter one two three four or five collections of ScriptureThis is how one gets over agitation and worry by knowledgeQuestioning means inquiring much about what is befitting and not according to the practice of the SanghaIn him who does this too agitation and worry disappearThen these twin evils disappear in him who has got the mastery of the Discipline due to practical application of and conversance with the nature of the Rule of the SanghaThis is the understanding of the disciplinary rulesAssociation with those more experienced and so forth the going to the presence of and the conversing with virtuous elders in the SanghaBy such visits mental agitation and worry disappear in oneSympathetic and helpful companionship association with experts of the Disciplinary Rules like the Elder Upali the first of the great masters of the Discipline in the SanghaIn such company mental agitation and worry disappearStimulating talk in this connection refers particularly to matters of disciplinary practice by which one comes to know what is befitting and what is notBy this agitation and worry vanish in oneTherefore is it said that six things lead to the rejection of agitation and worry but the agitation cast out by these things finally ceases to arise in the future through the attainment of the path of arahantship and the worry cast out by these things finally ceases to arise in the future through the attainment of the path of the nonreturnerIn their own state or actually as they are individually mental agitation and worry are two different thingsStill as worry in the form of repentance or remorse for ill done and good undone is similar to agitation which is characterized by distraction and disquiet of mind mental agitation is called flurry and worryMental agitation does not overtake the intelligent wellread man who probes into things by way of what is written in books and by way of the significance and import of the things themselvesTherefore it is said that by way of knowledge not merely of the Disciplinary Rules but by way of knowledge of the ninefold Buddhaword beginning with the Discourses according to the principles of the method already stated and by the application of the proper remedies mentioned by way of questioning and so forth remorse and regret for ill done and good undone do not take placeBy associating with elders who are older than oneself in the practice of the precepts of virtue and similar good things who are restrained aged matured seniors there is brought to one a measure of restraint matured bearing dignity and calm and mental agitation and worry are cast outGood companionship refers to association with those versed in the Discipline who are able to dispel worry as regards any doubt concerning what is proper and improper practiceWrong reflection on things which are founded on doubt brings about the arising of doubtThings which are founded on doubt are known as just doubt owing to the state of being the reason of doubt again and againTherefore the Blessed One said that wrong reflection on things founded on doubt is the condition for fresh doubt and for the increase and expansion of doubt already arisenBy right reflection on wholesome things karmically and the like there is the casting out of doubtTherefore the Blessed One said that right reflection on things which are karmically wholesome and not things blameful and blameless things to be practiced and not to be practiced things of low and high value things dark and fair the counterparts of bad and good done intensely keeps out fresh doubt and casts out doubt that has already come into existenceThere are these six things which help to throw out doubt The state of being learned in the Buddhas teaching of inquiring about the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha of understanding thoroughly the nature of the Discipline of being decided about the truth of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha sympathetic and helpful companionship and stimulating talk that helps to dispel doubtThe first has been explained earlierIt is the knowledge of the Suttas generally both in the letter and the spiritThe second is obviousThe third indicates a state of mastery of the Discipline through practical application and great conversance with it at first handThe fourth is the strong inclination towards or reliance on the Triple Gem called the faith that is capable of settling in the object of the virtues of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThe fifth is association with good companions like the Elder Vakkali bent inclined sliding towards faith mentallyThe sixth is stimulating talk on the Triple Gem at all times possible in every state of behaviorOne can cast away doubt by means of these six things but the doubt cast out by these six things does not ever arise in the future only when it is destroyed by the attainment of the first stage of the arahantThings which are founded on doubt are things which stand or proceed on doubtTaking doubt itself one sees that the doubt arisen first is the particular reason by way of a common cause of the doubt arisen afterwardsSurely by the knowledge of the Dhamma and by inquiry all doubts are cast outIti ajjhattam  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating the mental objects by laying hold of the five hindrances amongst the mental objects of his own mind or amongst the mental objects in anothers mind or at one time amongst the mental objects of his own mind and at another time amongst the mental objects of anothers mindHere origination and dissolution only refer to the origination of the five hindrances by way of wrong reflection on sensuously attractive or beautiful objects etc and the dissolution of the five hindrances by wise reflection on the impurity of the sensuous objects etcHere the mindfulness which lays hold of the hindrances is the Truth of SufferingThus the portal of deliverance of the bhikkhu who lays hold of the hindrances should be understoodHaving expounded the contemplation of mental objects by way of the five hindrances the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to explain the contemplation of mental objects by way of the fivefold aggregationPañcasu upadanakkhandhesu  In the five aggregates of clinging The five aggregates of clinging are the groups that grasp lifeThe congeries of mental objects become the condition of clinging is the meaningThis is a brief indication of these aggregatesFor the statement about the aggregates at length the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity should be readIti rupam  Thus is material form So far is there material form and no furtherIn this way the bhikkhu perceives material form according to natureIn regard to feeling and the things that come afterwards the same is the method of exegesisThis is the brief indication of meaning of the matters referred to hereFor the lengthy explanation on these things one should read the talk on the aggregates in the Path of PurityIti rupassa samudayo  Thus is the arising of material form The arising of material form and the other aggregates should be known according to the fivefold way through the arising of ignorance and so forthIti rupassa atthangamo  Thus is the disappearance of material form The disappearance of material form and the other aggregates should be known according to the fivefold way through the passing away of ignorance and so forthOne should read the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity for further explanationIti ajjhattam  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating mental objects by laying hold of the fivefold aggregation of clinging amongst his own mental objects or amongst the mental objects of another or at one time in his own and at another time in anothers mental objectsThe origination and dissolution of the fivefold aggregate should be brought forward and connected by way of the fifty characteristics of the five groups with the extended application of the words From the arising of ignorance the arising of material form comes to beFrom here on according to the method already stated by the commentator should the exposition beAccording to nature means according to the nature of breakingup according to the nature of the eye color and the like in regard to material form and according to the nature of experiencing the nature of pleasure and the like in regard to feelingIn this way all other connected things should be interpretedAfter explaining the contemplation of mental objects by way of the aggregates the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to explain the contemplation of mental objects by way of the sensebasesChasu ajjhattika bahiresu ayatanesu  In the six internal and the six external sensebases The eye the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mind are the six internal sensebases and material form mind smell tastes tactual object and mental object are the six external sensebasesCakkhum pajanati   understands the eye He understands the sensory apparatus of the eye by way of its own distinct function and salient characteristicRupe pajanati   understands material form that are visible He understands material form arising from the four producers of corporeality namely karma consciousness climate and nutriment by way of their own distinctive function and salient characteristicYam tadubhayam paticcca uppajjati samyojanam  The fetter that arises dependent on both He understands according to distinct function and characteristic the tenfold fetter that arises dependent on both eye and forms  the tenfold fetter of sensedesire resentment pride speculative theory doubt belief in rites and ceremonies the desire to go on existing envy avarice and ignoranceHow does this tenfold fettering arise asks oneThe fetter of sensuality arises for him who by way of sensuous enjoyment takes delight in a pleasant senseobject become visible at the eyedoorFor him who is annoyed or angry at the sight of an unpleasant object the fetter of resentment arises and the fetter of pride arises in him who thinks No one but me is able to consider the object wiselyThe fetter of speculative theory comes to be in him who takes material form to be permanent and everlastingThe fetter of doubt arises in him who thinks in this way Is the material form a being or a beingsThe fetter of the desire to go on existing arises in him who wishes thus To be sure in a favorable state of existence this material form will become easy of accessThe fetter of rites and ceremonies arises in him who undertakes to perform rites and ceremonies thinking In the future it will be possible to obtain such an object as this by taking up the observance of rites and ceremoniesThe fetter of envy arises in him who contemplates grudgingly Should no others get this material form it would be good indeedThe fetter of avarice arises in one who stints for another the material form belonging to oneThe fetter of ignorance arises with all sensuous passion and the like by way of the relation of conascent nescienceYathaca anupannassa samyojanassa uppado hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the arising of the nonarisen fetter comes to be He understands that the fetter had not arisen earlier owing to some cause of nonoccurrenceYatha ca uppannassa samyojanassa pahanam hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be He understands the reason for the abandoning of just the fetter arisen through previous nonabandoning or through occurrenceYatha ca pahinassa samojanassa ayatim anuppado hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the nonarising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be He understands the reason for the nonarising in the future of even the fetter abandoned by way of rejection of separate factors through right reflection and through absorptionOwing to what reason does the tenfold fettering cease to arise in the future finallyThe path of streamwinning or the first stage of awakening is the reason for final cessation of the five fetters of speculative theory doubt rites and ceremonies envy and avariceThe path of oncereturning or the second stage of awakening is the reason for the final cessation of sensuality and resentment of a gross kind and the residum of these two fetters finally ceases by reason of the statement of the path of neverreturning the third stage of awakeningThe fact which makes the fetter of pride of the desire to go on existing and of ignorance to cease finally in the future is the path of final purification arahantship the fourth state of awakeningThe same is the method of exegesis in sotañca pajanati sadde ca pajanati  He understands the ear and sounds Further in this connection the talk on the sensebases in full should be understood as stated by the commentator in the Path of PurityIti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating the mental objects by laying hold of the internal sensebases in his own mental objects or in anothers or laying hold of the external sensebases in anothers mental objects or in his own or at one time in his own and at another time in anothers mental objectsOrigination and dissolution should be brought forward and connected here by the extended application of the method indicated by the words From the origin of ignorance the origin of the eye to the sensebases of material form in the aggregate of materiality to the mental sensebase in the aggregate of consciousness and to the sensebase of the mental object in the other nonmaterial aggregates according to the method of exegesis already stated by the commentatorThe supramundane states should not be takenFrom here onward the exposition is according to the method already shown by the commentatorThe two groups of six sensebases are stated by way of determining the sensedoors and the senseobjects of arising of sixfold consciousnessOf the consciousness or mind aggregate included in a course of cognition of eyeconsciousness just the eyebase is the door of origin and the base of the material form is the objectSo it is in the case of the othersBut of the sixth sensebase the part of the mindbase called the lifecontinum the unconscious mind is the door of originAnd in a particular or special way the mindobject base is the objectDependent on both The eye becomes a condition by way of decisive support and the material forms the objects become a condition by way of objective predominance and objective decisive supportAfter explaining the contemplation of mental objects by way of the internal and the external sensebases the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to talk on the contemplation of mental objects by way of the Factors of Enlightenment the mental limbs of a being who is awaking from the stupor of the passions that soil or who is penetrating the Real Truths of Suffering its Cause its Cessation and the Way Leading to the Cessation of SufferingLimbs are members or constituent parts of the awaking mindSantam  Is present Existing by way of attainmentThe enlightenment factor called mindfulness is the enlightenment factor of mindfulnessBecause in these enlightenment factors the meditator effectively gets enlightened the meditator is called Complete Enlightenment from the time he begins strenuous contemplation on insightIt is a name for him who stands in the practice starting from the arising of the knowledge of the rise and fall of phenomenaThe sevenfold completeness or harmony beginning with mindfulness by which he awakes effectively rises from the sleep of the defilements or penetrates the Truths is Complete Enlightenment The components of that Complete Enlightenment or of the harmony called Complete Enlightenment are the factors of enlightenmentThe instruction of the Discourses is figurative and as this instruction on the Arousing of Mindfulness is set going by way of the mundane eightfold path it is said by the commentator that the meditator is Complete Enlightenment Otherwise he should be a Pure DiscipleThe meditator is considered the personification of the factors of complete enlightenment by which he can reach NibbanaIn the other factors of enlightenment the wordmeaning should be understood in the same wayAssantam  Is absent Not existing through lack of attainmentYatha anuppannassa  How of the nonarisen First is the enlightenment factor of mindfulnessThere are things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness and an abundance of right reflection on them is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness and for the increase the expansion and completion by culture of the arisen enlightenment factorThus it comes into being just mindfulness comprises the things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulnessRight reflection has just the characteristic already mentioned and when right reflection occurs plentifully in the things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness the enlightenment factor of mindfulness arisesFurther four things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness Mindfulness with clear comprehension the avoiding of person with confused minds association with persons who keep mindfulness ready for application inclination towards mindfulnessIn explanation it is said Mindfulness arises through mindfulness with clear comprehension in the seven positions beginning with that of going forwards or the mindfulness arousing the knowledge which grasps the purpose of these actions is mindfulness with clear comprehension and as mindfulness with clear comprehension everywhere is a state which brings about the cultivation of mindfulness mindfulness with clear comprehension is necessary for the arising of mindfulnessAs the abandoning or rejection of contrary things and the practice of suitable things are necessary for the arising of fresh karmically wholesome things so the eschewing of persons bereft of mindfulness association with persons who cultivate mindfulness the state of being not engaged with the first kind and the state of being engaged with the second are necessary for the arising of the enlightenment factor of mindfulnessMindfulness arises through the avoiding of persons who are confused in mind like crows that come cawing to food thrown through association with persons who keep mindfulness ready for application like the Elder Tissadatta who in the Terrace of the Wisdom Tree having got a golden ticket authorizing him to expound the Dhamma entered the assembly saying In which one of the eighteen languages shall I expound the Dhamma and the Elder Abhaya who is mentioned as the Elder Dattabhaya by the commentator and through the state of mind tending for originating mindfulness in all postures in all kinds of behavior or disposition of the bodyAnd the bhikkhu knows that the completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness brought into being by these four ways takes place by means of the attainment of the path of arahantshipThere are karmically good and karmically bad things right and wrong counterparts of bright and dark things and an abundance of right reflection on them is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects and for the increase expansion and the completion of culture of that enlightenment factor when it has arisenHere right reflection is the conscious state that is associated with knowledge and which arises by way of perceiving according to actuality the nature function characteristic and so forth of the several skillful states of mind and the likeBecause it is correct reflection it is called right reflectionSix things lead to the arising of this enlightenment factor Inquiring about the aggregates and so forth the purification of the basis imparting evenness to the controlling faculties avoiding the ignorant associating with the wise reflecting on the profound difference of the hardtoperceive processes of the aggregates modes sensebases and so forth and the inclining towards the development of the enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objectsInquiring about the aggregates and so forth means seeking the meaning of the aggregates the modes sensebases controlling faculties powers enlightenment factors way factors absorption factors the meditation for quietude and the meditation for insight by asking for explanation of knotty points regarding these things in the Five Nikayas with the commentaries from teachers of the DhammaPurification of the basis is the cleaning of the personal basis the body and of the impersonal basis clothes and dwelling placeThe flame of a lamp is unclear when its wick oil and container are dirty the wick splutters flickers but the flame of a lamp that has a clean wick oil and container is clear and the wick does not spit it burns smoothlySo it is with knowledgeKnowing that arises out of the mind and mental qualities which are in dirty external and internal surroundings is apt to be impure too but the knowledge that arises under clean conditions is apt to be pureIn this way cleanliness leads to the growth of this enlightenment factor which comprises knowledgePersonal cleanliness is impaired by the excessive length of hair of the head nails hair of the body by the excess of humors and by the dirt of perspiration cleanliness of impersonal or external things is impaired when robes are worn out dirty and smelly and when the house where one lives is dirty soiled and untidySo personal cleanliness should be secured by shaving haircutting nailparing the use of pectoral emetics and of purgatives which make the body light and by shampooing bathing and doing other necessary things at the proper timeIn similar way external cleanliness should be brought about by darning washing and dyeing ones robes and by smearing the floor of ones house with clay and the like to smoothen and clean it and by doing other necessary things to keep the house clean and tidyImparting evenness to the controlling faculties is the equalizing of the controlling faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdomEqualizing is making neither more nor less effective functionallyWhen faith outstrips the others through overactivity the others are thrown out of gearThen energy finds it impossible to exert mindfulness to attend to the object concentration to be nondistracted and wisdom to seeTherefore that overactivity of faith should be made to wane either by reflection on the phenomenal nature of the things or by not attending to that thing when thinking of which faith becomes excessiveThe story of the Thera Vakkali is the illustration of overactive faithFaith outstrips the others because of unclearness of wisdom and the laxity and so forth of energy and the others through the excessive zeal of the function of faith in regard to a believable object an object that generates trustEnergy is unable to do the work of exerting and of supporting the associated mental characteristics and to avoid indolenceMindfulness is not able to do the work of attending to the object of continuing to be at the object after coming to itConcentration is not able to do the work of nondistraction of rejecting distractionTo see the object according to actuality as if one were seeing a physical thing with the eye wisdom is not ableThese four faculties are unable to do their work because of their being overwhelmed by the faculty of faith acting very strongOnly by the evenness of function can the mental things which exist together with consciousness and are the principal things amongst conascent mental things namely the five spiritual controlling faculties accomplish their workNot otherwiseReflection on the phenomenal nature of the thingBy examining the objet of faith by way of the conditioned and the produced from the conditioned and the like by scrutiny according to actualityThe story of the Thera VakkaliThis venerable person who fulfilled his duties through keen faith liked to behold the Master alwaysThe Master admonished him saying What shall it profit you to see this impure bodyWho sees the Dhamma sees me and urged him to practice a subject of meditationHe was unable to apply himself to the practice of the subject of meditation and as he was inclined to destroy himself he went up to a place that was a steep declivityThen the Master showed himself by his psychic power as if he were seated before the thera and spoke these wordsGladdened by the words of the Master he set up the development of insight but as his faith was very strong he was not able to enter into the joy of the insightThe Master knowing this gave him the subject of meditation after correcting it with the imparting of evenness of the controlling facultiesThe thera after putting himself in the path of practice taught by the Master and after doing hard work in regular order reached arahantshipIf however the controlling faculty of energy becomes too powerful then neither will the faculty of faith be able to do its work of arousing faith in a settled way in its object nor will the remaining controlling faculties be able to perform their functionsTherefore in such a case energy should be made to lessen its activity by the development of the enlightenment factors of calm concentration and equanimityThe story of the Thera Sona is given as an illustration of overdone energyThe story of the Thera SonaThis refers to Sona Thera who was of delicate constitutionAfter getting a subject of meditation from the Master he was living in Cool Wood and he thought thus My body is delicate and it is not possible to reach happiness with comfort onlyEven after being exhausted the duty of the recluse should be done Thereupon he decided while giving himself up to exertion to keep to only the two postures of standing and walkingOwing to excessive walking blisters appeared on the soles of his feet and caused him great painHe continued to make strong effort in spite of the pain but could not produce a state of distinction in meditation with his excessive energyThe Master visited Sona instructed him with the simile of the lute corrected the Theras subject of meditation showing him the method of applying energy evenly and went to Vulture PeakHaving applied energy evenly according to the method given by the Master and after working hard for insight the Thera developing the practice established himself in arahantshipEven thus should the incapacity of the rest of the spiritual faculties to function effectively when one of them has become overactive and powerful be understoodHere the wise specially praise the equalizing of faith and wisdom and of concentration and energyHe who is very strong in faith and feeble in wisdom becomes a person who believes in foolish people who have no virtue persons who are not trustworthyHe who has very strong wisdom and feeble faith gets craftyminded and is like a drugproduced disease that cannot be curedSuch a person thinks that wholesome karma arises with just the intention to do goodGoing along the wrong way by a species of thought beyond the limits of reason and doing neither almsgiving nor other similar good deeds he is born in a state of woeBy the equalizing of faith and wisdom one believes only in those like the Buddha who are worthy of trust because there is a reason for trusting themAs concentration naturally inclines towards indolence when there is too much of concentration and too little of energy indolence overwhelms the mindAs energy inclines naturally towards restlessness or agitation when there is much energy and little concentration restlessness overwhelms the mindWhen concentration is combined well with energy there will be no falling of the mind into indolenceWhen energy is combined well with concentration there will be no falling of the mind into restlessnessDiscord of faith and wisdom and discord of concentration and energy through functional unevenness are not conducive to success in meditationFaith and wisdom should be made functionally even and harmoniousSo too concentration and energyWith the making even functionally of these pairs full absorption occursFurther to a worker in concentration  a man pursuing the path of quietude  faith that is somewhat strong is metWith faith that is strong the yogi will by believing in and fixing the mind on the object reach full absorptionIf for instance the yogi is meditating on the element of earth he will not think thus How can absorption arise by the repetition of the word earth He will think that the method of meditation taught by the Supreme Buddha will surely succeed and he will settle in and leap on to the object by way of firm belief having as it were forced his way into itConcerning concentration and wisdom it is said as follows For the worker in concentration  the man pursuing quietude  strong onepointedness is met by reason of the fact that concentration is the principal thing in absorptionWith strong onepointedness he reaches full absorptionFor the man pursuing the path of insight strong wisdom is met if strong wisdom exists he arrives at the penetration of the characteristicsBy the equalizing of the concentration and wisdom of the worker in concentration the man pursuing quietude there is just full absorptionOwing to the very great strength of the concentration of the man pursuing quietude very great strength of wisdom too should be desiredFull absorption is mundane full absorptionSupramundane full absorption also is expected through the equalizing of theseAccordingly the Master said He develops quietude and insight yoked togetherStrong mindfulness is met everywhere since it protects the mind from falling into restlessness belonging to faith energy and wisdom and from falling into indolence belonging to concentrationFaith energy and wisdom have a tendency towards excitement and concentration has a tendency towards slothTherefore mindfulness is to be desired by the yogi alwaysIt is likened to the saltflavoring which is in all curries and the ministerofallwork wanted in every business of the kingAnd because of this the commentator made the following statement And indeed it was said by the Blessed One thus Mindfulness is to be desired everywhere WhyBecause mindfulness is the minds help because mindfulness has just protection as its manifestation and because without mindfulness there is no exerting or restraining of the mindBecause it is applied always mindfulness is always useful or desirable and because in all states of elation and depression it should be developed by the man longing for the factors of enlightenment it is necessaryMinds help the help of a wholesome or skillful state of consciousnessIt is the support of such a state of mind for attaining the yet unattainedAvoiding the ignorant is keeping away from foolish folk not grounded in the knowledge of the divisions of the aggregates and so forthAssociation with wise folk is fellowship with persons possessed of the knowledge of rise and fall through the laying hold of all the fifty characteristicsReflecting on the profound differences of the profound process of the aggregates and so forth is the analytic reflection according to wisdom of the movement of the hardtoperceive aggregates and so forthInclining towards the enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects is the mental state inclining tending and sloping towards the purpose of originating this enlightenment factor in every posture of standing sitting walking and lying downThe yogi understands that the culture of this enlightenment factor arisen thus comes to completion through the path of arahantshipThere is the mode of energy that is inceptive the mode of energy that is enduring and the mode of energy that is strong powerful courageous and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of energy and for the increase expansion and the completion by culture of that enlightenment factor when it has arisenEleven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of energy Reflection on the fearfulness of statesofwoe the seeing of the benefits of energy reflection on the path to be trodden the honoring of alms reflection on the greatness of the heritage the reflection on the greatness of the Master reflection on the greatness of race reflection on the greatness of fellows in the holy life the avoiding of lazy folk the associating with folk who have begun to exert and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of energyReflection on the fearfulness of the statesofwoe as stated in the Devaduta and other Suttas produces in the yogi the thought Now is the time to rouse energy it is not possible to be energetic when subject to great sufferingThe seeing of the benefits of energy is the appreciation of the fact that only by one who has begun to exert himself could the Supramundane Truth be obtained and not by a lazy personThe path trodden by all the Supreme Buddhas the Paccekabuddhas and the Great Disciples has to be trodden by you says the yogi to himself and that path is impossible for an indolent person That is the reflection on the path to be troddenThe yogi thinks thus Those who support you with almsfood and so forth are not relatives of yours are not your servants they do not give you excellent alms thinking We shall live depending on you But they give expecting from their offerings great fruitAlso the requisites were not allowed to you by the Master so that you may make use of the requisites and live strongbodied in comfort but they were allowed to you so that you may do the duty of the recluse and escape the round of suffering whilst using the requisitesThe indolent one does not honor the alms only he who has begun to be energetic honors it Reflection in this way about honoring the alms permitted by the Buddha produces energy as in the case of the Thera Maha MittaThe Thera lived in Kassaka LenaIn the village to which he resorted for alms there was a certain Maha Upasika who taking him as a child of hers looked after himOne day she was preparing to go to the forest and spoke to her daughter thus Here is old rice here milk here ghee and here treacleWhen your brother the venerable Mitta comes cook the rice and give it to him with milk ghee and treacleYou too eat of itI have eaten the cold rice cooked yesterday with gruel Mother what will you take at noon Cook a sour gruel with herbs and broken rice and put it byJust as the Thera was taking out the bowl after he had robed himself to go out for alms he heard that talk of the mother and daughter through his clairaudient power at the door of his cave and thought as follows The great lay devotee has eaten stale rice with gruel and will take sour gruel at noonFor you she has given old rice milk ghee and treacleShe does not expect field or food or cloth from youOnly expecting the three good attainments of the human divine and supramundane planes does she giveWill you be able to bestow on her those attainmentsIndeed her alms is not fit to be taken by you with lust hatred and ignorance Then he put back the bowl into the bowlbag loosened the robeknot refrained from going for alms and returning to the Cultivators Cave put the bowl under his bed the robe on the robe pole and sat down resolved on endeavor thinking I will not go from here without attaining arahantshipThis recluse who had been earnest for a long time after developing insight reached the fruit of arahantship even before mealtime and the great destroyer of the corruptions smiling like an opening lotus went out of the caveTo him the guardian deity of the tree near the cave said thisHaving uttered this appreciation the tree deity said Venerable Sir after giving alms to an arahant like you wandering for alms the elderly woman will escape sufferingWhen the Thera got up and opened the door to observe what the time was he found that it was still quite earlySo he took his bowl and robe and entered the villageThe young girl having prepared the rice sat looking towards the door of her house thinking Now my brother will comeAnd when the Thera arrived she took the bowl filled it with milkrice alms mixed with ghee and treacle and placed it in his hands and he departed after giving thanks with the words May there be happiness and the girl stood there looking at the departing oneThe color of the Elder at that time was exceedingly clear and his controlling faculties especially pure and his face was shining like a ripe palmfruit freed from the footstalkThe mother of the girl on returning from the forest inquired Dear did your brother come The daughter told her everythingThe Maha Upasika knowing that her sons renunciation work had that day reached its acme said Dear your brother delights in the Dispensation of the BuddhaHe is not dissatisfiedThere is reflection on the greatness of the heritage when one thinks thus Great indeed is the heritage of the Teacher namely the Seven Real TreasuresThese are not to be got by the slothfulThe indolent man is like a son disowned by his parentsHe does not get this parents wealth when they pass awaySo too it is with the Seven Real TreasuresOnly the man of energy gets theseReflection on the greatness of the Master consists in recalling the great events in the teachers life and admonishing oneself thus Does it befit you to be slack after entering the Dispensation of such a TeacherReflection on the greatness of race is carried out by way of the fact that in entering the Buddhas Dispensation one has become the Conquerors son and that for such a one slacking is not fitReflection on the greatness of fellows in the holy life consists of admonishing oneself thus Sariputta Maha Moggallana and the great disciples penetrated the supramundane after much endeavorAre you following their way of lifeThe avoiding of lazy folk is the avoiding of people without physical and mental energy who are like a rocksnake lying inert after a full feedAnd the association with folk who have begun to exert themselves is mixing with those whose minds are turned towards and who are endeavoring for the attainment of NibbanaInclination towards the development of this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards right exertion in all postures of sitting standing and so forthThe enlightenment factor that arises in this way comes to completion by culture through the path of arahantshipThere are things which condition the enlightenment factor of joy and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of joy and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of the enlightenment factor when it has arisenEleven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of joy recollection of the Buddha recollection of the Dhamma recollection of the Sangha recollection of virtue of liberality of the shining ones and the recollection of peace the avoiding of bad people association with good people reflection on the discourses inspiring confidence and the inclination towards joyBy recollection of the Buddhas qualities of the qualities of the Dhamma and of the Sangha joy arisesJoy arises also for one who having kept the precepts of fourfold purity unbroken for a long time reflects on ones virtue to laymen who reflect on their virtue through observing the ten and the five precepts to one reflecting on liberality and recollecting ones gift of excellent food to ones fellows in the holy life during a time of scarcity and the like to laymen recollecting their liberality in giving alms to virtuous folk to one reflecting on ones possession of qualities by which beings have reached the state of shining ones to one reflecting thus by way of peace The passions suppressed by the higher attainments do not occur for sixty or seventy yearsThe avoiding of bad people is the keeping away from rough people who are like dirt on a mules back who show a callous nature through irreverence owing to lack of faithinspired affection for the Buddha and the like in worshipping shrines or eldersGood people are those who have much faith in the Buddha and the like and are gentle of mindDiscourses which illumine the qualities of and inspire confidence in the Triple Gem are discourses inspiring confidenceThe inclination towards joy refers to the mind sloping towards this enlightenment factor in all postures of sitting and the likeThe completion by culture of this enlightenment factor is through the path of awakeningThere are things which condition the enlightenment factor of calm of the body and of the mind and an abundance of right reflection on these things is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of calm and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of this enlightenment factor when it has arisenSeven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of calm The resorting to fine food comfortable weather and comfortable postures judgment according to the middle way the avoiding of people who are physically restless the association with people who are physically calm and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of calmThe resorting to fine food is the resorting to excellent beneficial food that is suitable to oneThe resorting to comfortable weather and postures means the resorting to weather and postures suitable to oneBy resorting to this threefold suitability wellbeing of mind comes into existence by way of the basis of bodily wellbeing and there proceeds then the reason for twofold calmJudgment according to the middle way is reflection on ones own deed as ones own property and anothers deed as that of others propertyThis is the judgment of things based on the acknowledgment of the law of moral causation avoiding first the extreme view that the suffering and happiness experienced by living beings are causeless and then the other extreme view of ascribing these to a fictive cause like that of a Creator God and the knowing of all suffering and happiness as ones own actionBut he who has the nature of a great man is patient of all kinds of weather and posturesNot concerning such a person has the above been saidThe avoiding of people who are physically restless is the keeping away from restless people who go about harassing others with clod and stickPeople who are physically calm are those who are quiet because they are restrained on hand and footThe inclination towards the development of this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards calm in all posturesBy the arahants path the completion by culture of this enlightenment factor takes placeThere is the sign of quietude and the sign of nonconfusion and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of concentration and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of concentration when it has arisenThe first stage of tranquillity which arises when an object is being grasped by way of bearing it in mind the composed manner is the characteristic sign of quietudeThere the sign of quietude is just the quietude by way of the composed mannerAnd in the sense of nondistraction is the sign of nonconfusion to be takenConfusion is the state of mind which because of the whirling in a multiplicity of objects is jumping from thing to thing diverse of aim and not onepointedDistraction is the same in characterUnsteadiness is its salient feature and deviation is its manifestationBy onepointedness of mind confusion is thrown outEleven things lead to the arising of concentrationPurification of the basis the imparting of evenness to the spiritual controlling faculties skill in taking up the sign of the object of meditation the inciting of the mind on occasion the restraining of the mind on occasion the gladdening of the mind on occasion and the regarding of the mind without interfering on occasion the avoiding of people who are not collected in mind association with people who are collected in mind reflection on the absorptions and the emancipations and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of concentrationSkill in the taking up of the sign which is the cause for the arising of absorption is skill in taking up the signThe inciting of the mind on occasion is the applying of the mind vigorously by bringing into being the enlightenment factors of the investigation of mental objects energy and joy when there is excessive laxity of energy and of the application of wisdom and a deficiency of delight in the meditationThe restraining of the mind refers to the checking of the mind that is becoming excessively energetic too strong in the application of wisdom and elated with delight by bringing into being the enlightenment factors of calm concentration and equanimityThe gladdening of the mind means The enlivening with confidence of the mind becomes dissatisfied either through weak application of wisdom or the nonattainment of the bliss of restfulnessThis enlivening is done through reflection on the eight reasons for the upsurge of spiritual feeling namely birth decay disease death the suffering of the four states of woe the samsaric round of suffering in the past and the suffering rooted in the search for nutriment in the present life and through contemplation on the qualities of the Triple GemThe regarding of the mind without interfering is the absence of the work of inciting retraining and gladdening the mind which has got to right practice and which proceeds well in the object free from sloth free from restlessness and free from dissatisfactionIt is comparable to the state of a charioteer who looks on uninterfering when the horses are going wellThe keeping away from persons who have not reached partial or full absorption and are distracted of mind is the avoiding of people who are not collected in mindAssociation with persons who have reached those states of absorption is association with people who are collected in mindThe mind inclining sloping and bending towards concentrationproduction in all postures of standing sitting and the like constitutes the inclination for this factorThe completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of concentration is through the path of arahantshipExcessive laxity Of application of wisdom means feeble working of wisdomAs the principal thing in liberality is nongreed and in virtue nonhate so in meditation it is wisdom that is the principal thingTherefore if wisdom is not very strong in the development of concentration there will be no causing of contemplative attainmentAs unprepared food gives no pleasure to a man so without the application of wisdom the object of meditation does not give satisfaction to the yogis mindTo the yogi then there is the pointing out of the remedy for that lack of satisfaction in the stirring up of spiritual feeling and confidenceThere are things which condition the enlightenment factor of equanimity and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of equanimity and for the increase expansion and the completion by culture of the enlightenment factor when it has risenFive things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of equanimity The detached attitude towards beings the detached attitude towards things the avoiding of persons who are egotistical in regard to living beings and things association with people who are neutral in regard to living beings and things and the inclination for developing the enlightenment factor of equanimityThe detached attitude towards beings is brought about by reflection on beings as possessors of their own deeds and by reflection in the highest senseReflection on beings as possessors of their own deeds is there when a person thinks thus You have been born here by your own deeds in the past and will depart from here and fare according to your own deedsWho then is the being you are attached toReflection in the highest sense is thinking in the following way Really no living being existsTo whom then can you be attachedThe detached attitude towards things is brought about by reflection on ownerlessness and temporarinessA person thinks thus This robe will fade get old become a footcleaning rag and be after that fit only to be taken up at the end of a stick and flung awaySurely should there be an owner of this he would not let it come to ruin in this way This is the reflection on ownerlessnessTo think that this robe cannot last long and that its duration is short is to reflect on the temporariness of itThese two reflections are applicable in a similar way to the bowl and other thingsPersons who are egotistical in regard to living beings are laymen who cherish their own sons and daughters and the like and recluses who cherish their resident pupils mates preceptors and the likeAnd these persons if for instance they are recluses do with their own hands for them whom they cherish haircutting sewing robewashing robedyeing bowllacquering and so forthIf even for a short time they do not see their cherished ones they look here and there like bewildered deer and ask Where is such and such novice or Where is such and such a young bhikkhu And if these recluses are requested by others to send a novice or a young bhikkhu to do some work for them such as haircutting they dont send the novice or young bhikkhu on the pretense that he is not made to do even his own work and that if he is made to do the work of others he would get tiredPersons egotistical in this way should be avoidedA person who is egotistical in regard to things is he who cherishes robes bowls beakers walking sticks staffs and so forth and does not let another even touch theseWhen asked for a loan of some article he would say Even I do not use it how can I give it Persons egotistical in that way too should be avoidedA person who is neutral indifferent as regards both living beings and things is a person who is detached as regards both living beings and thingsThe company of such a person should be soughtInclination for developing this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards equanimity in all postures of standing and so forthThe completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of equanimity is wrought by the path of awakeningIti ajjhattam  Thus internally The yogi lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects by laying hold of his own enlightenment factors or anothers enlightenment factors or at one time his own enlightenment factors and at another time anothers enlightenment factorsHere origination and dissolution should be known by way of the origination and dissolution of the enlightenment factorsFrom here on the exposition is just according to the manner already statedThe cause of the enlightenment factor of equanimity is the impartial state the middle state free from attraction and repulsionIf that freedom from attraction and repulsion exists then there is equanimity when it does not exist there is no equanimityThis state of freedom from attraction and repulsion is twofold by way of scope detachment in regard to beings and detachment in regard to thingsRepulsion is thrown away even by the development of the enlightenment factor of calm and in order to show just the way of casting out attraction is the instruction beginning with detachment in regard to beings taughtSpecially equanimity is an enemy of lust and so the commentator said Equanimity is the path of purity of one who is full of lustThe detached attitude towards beings is developed by reflection on the individual nature of moral causation and by reflection on soullessnessBy reflection on ownerlessness the state of not belonging to a soul is brought out and by reflection on temporariness the impermanence of things is brought out to produce the detached attitude towards inanimate thingsHaving explained thus the contemplation of mental objects by way of the seven factors of enlightenment the Master said And further and so forth in order to explain the meditation by way of the Four TruthsIdam dukkhanti yathabhutam Pajanati  A bhikkhu understands this is suffering according to reality He puts aside craving and understands all things of the three planes of becoming as suffering according to natureHe understands according to nature the previous craving that produces and makes to arise that very sufferingHe understands the nonoccurrence of both suffering and its origin according to nature as NibbanaHe understands according to nature the Noble Path which penetrates suffering abandons origination and realizes cessationThe rest of the explanation of the Noble Truths is in the Path of PurityIti ajjhattam  Thus internally He lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects having laid hold of his own four truths or the four truths of another or at one time his own four truths and at another time anothers four truthsIn this explanation of the truths the origination and dissolution of the four truths should be understood according to nature by way of arising and stoppingFrom here on the explanation is according to the manner already statedWith this have been stated the following twentyone subjects of meditation Breathing Modes of Deportments the Method of the Thirtytwo Parts of the Body the Determination of the Four Modes of Materiality the Nine Cemetery Contemplations Contemplation of Feeling Contemplation of Consciousness the Laying Hold on the Hindrances the Laying Hold on the Aggregates the Laying Hold on the Sensebases the Laying Hold on the Enlightenment Factors and the Laying Hold on the TruthsThe Cemetery Contemplations are counted separatelyThe Contemplation on Breathing the Thirtytwo Parts and the Nine Cemetery Contemplations these eleven are subjects of meditation which produce full absorptionThe Dighabhanaka Maha Siva however says that the Nine Cemetery Contemplations are here stated by way of the contemplation of MiseryTherefore according to his view only two subjects Breathing and the Thirtytwo Parts produce full absorption the rest produce only partial absorptionYo hi koci bhikkhave ime cattaro satipatthane evam bhaveyya  O bhikkhus if anyone develops the Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner If any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni or upasaka or upasika cultivates mindfulness from the beginning according to the method taught hereTitthantu bhikkhave  O bhikkhus let alone This together with what follows was said by way of the average person capable of being trainedBut concerning the person of keen intelligence it was stated as follows Instructed in the morning he will attain in the evening instructed in the evening he will attain in the morningThe Blessed One pointed out the teaching thus Bhikkhus my Dispensation leads to Deliverance in this way closed the instruction that is crowned with arahantship in twentyone places and uttered the following words This is the only way o bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of MindfulnessThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseSomdet Toh  his formal title was Somdet Budhacariya  was probably the most famous and widely loved monk in nineteenth century ThailandA skilled meditator closely associated with the royal family he was famous for many reasons but his wide popularity rests on two things Despite his rank he was easily approachable to people on all levels of society and he made amulets that  because of his meditative prowess  were reputed to be very powerfulHe was also famous for his wisdom and witSince his death in a cult has grown up around his memory with many mediums throughout Thailand claiming to channel his spiritAt the same time many legends have grown up around his nameHere are a few of my favoritesI cant vouch for their accuracy but they all carry a good lesson which is why they merit passing onSomdet Toh was an illegitimate son of a nobleman who eventually became King Rama The story goes that one day in or when the nobleman was in northern Thailand cleaning up after the Burmese invasion he happened to get separated from his troopsAs he rode along on his horse he came across a house with a young woman about sixteen years old standing in frontThirsty he asked her for some waterShe went to the well got a bowl of water  in Thailand in the old days they would drink water out of a bowl rather than out of a glass  and crushed a lotus flower over the bowl sprinkling the stamens all over the surface of the waterThen she handed the bowl to him as he was sitting on his horseHe took one long look at the stamens on top of the water and then had to drink the water very carefully so as not to swallow themAs he handed the bowl back to her he asked her Was that a trickNo she saidI saw that you were so thirsty that you might gulp the water down and end up choking on itSo I figured this would be a good way to make sure that you drank slowlyWellHe asked her Are your parents around So she fetched her parentsThey didnt know who he was but he was obviously a nobleman so when he told them Id like to have your daughter they gave their consentSo she joined the king in the army camp but as the campaign was ending he said to her Im afraid I cant take you down to the palace with me but in case you do have a child by me heres my beltGive the child my belt and Ill know that its my childIll take care of him or her in the future So he left her and went down to BangkokHer whole family soon followed down to Bangkok when they discovered that she actually was pregnantThey moved onto a floating house moored on the bank of the Chao Phraya River in front of a monastery Wat InShe gave birth to a son and named him Toh which means large When he was old enough he was ordained as a noviceA few years later when the nobleman had become King Rama II the family took Novice Toh to Wat Nibbanaram  currently Wat Mahathaad a temple right across the road from the Grand Palace  and showed the belt to the abbotThe abbot took the belt to the king and the king said Yes thats my son So he later sponsored Novice Tohs ordination as a monkWhen Prince Mongkut  later Rama IV  was ordained as a monk Phra Toh was his older brother monk the one who gave him his initial training in Dhamma and VinayaSoon after Prince Mongkuts ordination his father died and although by birth Prince Mongkut was next in line for the throne the Privy Council chose one of his halfbrothers to reign as Rama III insteadWhen this happened Phra Toh decided it would be wise to leave Bangkok so he went into the forestPrince Mongkut stayed on as a monk for years until Rama III passed awayHe was then offered the throne so he disrobed and was crowned King Rama IVSoon after his coronation he sent out word to fetch Phra Toh back to BangkokOfficials went into the forest dragging back any monk they could find and asking Is this the monk No Is this the monk No Finally word got to Phra Toh and he came out voluntarilyThe king gave him the title of Somdet  which next to the Supreme Patriarch is the highest title a monk can hold  and put him in charge of Wat Rakhang the monastery across the river from the palaceRama IV is remembered as a wise and humane kingSomdet Tohs own epithet for him  in a brief poem he wrote summarizing the history and prophesizing the future of the Chakri dynasty  was that he maintained or embodied the DhammaAnd Rama IVs desire to have Somdet Toh near the palace is an indication of his wisdomHe knew that as king he would have trouble finding people fearless and selfless enough to tell him frankly when he was wrong and so he wanted his former teacher nearby to perform this functionBut even as the kings former teacher Somdet Toh had to exercise tact and skill in criticizing the kingOne story tells that one day early in his reign the king  and remember he had been a monk for twentyeight years  was sitting out on the boat landing in front of the palace drinking with his courtiersSo Somdet Toh came paddling across the river in a small boatThe king displeased said to him Here Ive made you a SomdetDont you have any respect for your titleHow can you paddle your own boat The Somdet replied When the king of the country is drinking in public Somdets can paddle their own boats Turning around he paddled back to Wat RakhangThat was the last time the king drank in publicAnother time Rama IV felt that since Thailand had been laid waste by the Burmese many ancient Thai customs had disappeared so new customs should be developed to replace themSo he decided Wouldnt it be nice if we had a boat parade at the end of the rains retreatEvery monastery in Bangkok will be responsible for decorating a boat and well have a contest to reward the bestlooking boat So the royal decree went out that every monastery in Bangkok had to decorate a boat for the paradeWhen the day for the parade came a long line of beautifully decorated boats floated past the royal reviewing stand  except for one a little canoe carrying a monkey tied to a leash with a sign on its backThe kings immediate reaction was anger Somebodys making fun of me He had his officials check the roster to see which monastery was responsible for the boat and it was Wat Rakhang Somdet Tohs monasterySo they took the sign off the monkey to see what it saidIt said Willing to lose face in order to save cloth which rhymed in Thai but didnt make any more sense in Thai than it does in EnglishA few days later the king invited Somdet Toh into the palace for a meal and a Dhamma talk after which he asked him Suppose someone sponsored a boat with a sign like this on the back of a monkeyWhat do you think it might mean And the Somdet said Well it might mean that monks dont have any resources of their own to decorate boats and its certainly not appropriate for them to ask for donations from laypeople to decorate boats so the only course left open to them would to have been to put their robes in the pawn shopSo they were willing to lose face in order to save their robes That was the last time the parade was ever heldAnother story concerns a funeral in the royal palaceFunerals in the palace could go on for a hundred days before the cremationEvery night theyd invite four monks to chantThe famous highranking monks would chant toward the beginning of the hundred days and by the end of the period they were getting down into the ranks of the junior monksOne night toward the end of this particular funeral they invited four young monks who had never seen the king before in their livesAnd this was back in the days when if the king said Off with your head it was off with your headSo they were nervous about their performanceAfter all the king had been a monk for yearsHe would know if they made any mistakes in their chantingFinally the king entered the room followed by his entourageNow Rama IV had a rather stern and fearsome appearance and as soon as the monks took one look at him they went running behind a curtainThis infuriated the kingWhat is thisAm I a monsterAn ogreWhat is thisDisrobe them immediately So a royal decree was written up and sent over the river for Somdet Toh to disrobe the monksHe happened to be sitting at a writing table next to a small altar where incense was burningTaking one look at the royal decree he placed it over a stick of incense burned three holes in it and sent it back across the river to the palaceThe king of course had studied Buddhist doctrine he knew what the three fires were the fire of passion the fire of anger and the fire of delusionThe Somdets message was Put them out So the monks didnt have to disrobeThats how you criticize a kingOnce however Somdet Toh didnt get away with criticizing the kingThere is a tradition recorded in the Apadanas that the Buddhas clan the Sakyan clan started from a time when the sons and daughters of a particular king had to leave their countryThey took up residence in Kapilavastu the area that eventually became the Buddhas homeAfter building their city and settling in they looked around the area for spouses but couldnt find anyone who was highborn enough for them to marrySo the brothers ended up marrying their own sistersThats the tradition recorded in the Apadanas to explain the name of the Sakyan  Ones Own  clanOne day Somdet Toh was giving a talk on this topic in the royal palace and after discussing this point he continued Ever since then its become a custom among royal familiesUncles go running after their nieces cousins go running after their cousins Now Rama IVs major queen was his niece so again he was furiousYou cannot stay in this country he saidSo Somdet Toh was banished from ThailandNow in Thailand the civil law does not extend into the sima the territory immediately around ordination hallsFor instance if a thief goes running into a sima the police have to get the abbots permission before they can go into the sima after himSo the Somdet returned to Wat Rakhang and moved into the ordination hallFor about three months he didnt set foot outside the simaMeanwhile the king had forgotten all about the banishment order and one day he said We havent had Somdet Toh over for a talk in a long timeLets invite him over So the invitation went across the river to the monastery but word came back saying I cannot set foot in this country remember Oh the king said I forgot And he lifted the banishment orderSo it wasnt an easy thing to criticize kings in those daysEven if you were his personal teacher you had to be carefulOf course not all of Somdet Tohs comments about the king were criticalAfter all the respect he felt for the king was what had inspired him to leave the forest to be of help in the first placeOne of the most famous stories about their relationship concerns a Dhamma talk Somdet Toh gave in the palacePalace Dhamma talks were highly ritualized affairsThe talk was expected to be long and literary preceded with and followed by many elaborate chants and other formalitiesOnce Rama IV invited Somdet to present such a talk and had prepared an especially large pile of offerings to be presented to the Somdet after the talk  a sign that he was looking forward to an especially long and learned disquisition to test the Somdets knowledge of the DhammaAfter the beginning formalities however Somdet Toh said only one sentence The king already knows everything there is to know Then he chanted the ritual passages to conclude the talk and returned to his seat on the dais quiet and composedImmensely pleased the king presented him with the offerings commenting that that was the best Dhamma talk he had ever heardAt another similar event at the palace Somdet Toh began the closing blessing with the standard chantAs he reached this point in the chant the king in a very unusual breach of Buddhist etiquette called out Why are you giving all the merit to the hungry ghostsWhat did they do to deserve itSomdet Toh without missing a beat backed up to change the last lineEven so does everything given here benefit the kingThe king who was fluent in Pali himself was delighted with the Somdets ability to think on his feetThere are many other legends concerning Somdet Toh that dont deal with the kingAjaan Fuang my teacher especially liked to tell a story of how Somdet Toh dealt with highranking lay people who would visit monasteries and waste the monks time in idle conversationSomdet Toh ate his meals in a small open pavilion in front of his dwellingIf a stray dog wandered past he would toss a little food to the dog  which meant that over time a whole pack of dogs would regularly come to sit around him at his meal time waiting for foodThis meant that if any highranking lay people wanted to come pay their respects and chat with him while he was eating theyd have to bow down to the dogs as wellAs a result only the people who werent too proud to bow down to the dogs got to talk to him during his mealtimeAnother story concerns a wealthy layman who wanted to invite Somdet Toh to his house for a meal and a Dhamma talkEvents like this would often be fairly public with the donor inviting many friends and relatives to participate in the meal offering and to hear the talkSo the layman sent his servant to convey the invitation to Somdet Toh saying that he wanted Somdet Toh to give a talk on a lofty topic the four noble truthsNow it so happened that the servant wasnt familiar with the term four noble truths  which in Thai is ariyasatTo him it sounded like naksat or zodiacSo he told Somdet Toh that his master wanted to hear a Dhamma talk on the zodiacThe Somdet knew that this couldnt possibly be right but the servants mistake amused him and he decided to use it as an opportunity to make a Dhamma point  and have a little fun at the same timeWhen the day for the talk arrived he went to the laymans house and after the meal got up on the sermon seat and began the talk by saying Today our esteemed host has invited me to deliver a Dhamma talk on the zodiac He then proceeded to describe the twelve houses of the zodiac in a fair amount of detailMeanwhile the master was staring daggers at the servantAfter finishing his description of the zodiac the Somdet then added But regardless of what house of the zodiac people are born into they are all subject to suffering With that he switched to the four noble truths  and probably saved the servants jobAnother time some Christian missionaries came to visit the SomdetOne of the missionary strategies in those days was to show off their knowledge of science so as to dazzle the heathens win their respect and possibly win convertsWith Somdet Toh so closely associated with the king perhaps they thought that if they could convert him the king might be converted as wellSo they discussed various scientific topics with him and finally touched on the fact that they had proof that the world was roundThe Somdet instead of being surprised said I knowIn fact I can show you where the center of the world is This surprised the missionaries so they asked him to show themHe got up took his staff went out in front of his hut and planted the staff firmly on the ground saying Right hereBut how could that be they asked himHe answered If the world is round its a sphere rightAnd any point on the surface of the sphere is as central as any other point on the surfaceAfter that the missionaries left him aloneOn the final day of the Rains retreat in Rama IV passed awayHis eldest son Prince Chulalongkorn who was now Rama V was only fifteen years oldAs a result the running of the government was placed in the hands of a Regent  Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawong  who was to hold this office until Rama V reached maturityShortly after the Regency was instituted Somdet Toh  who was now  appeared at the Regents palace in the middle of a sunny day carrying a lit torch that he held aloft with one hand and a long narrow palmleaf Dhamma text that he carried at a backwardsloping angle under his other armAfter he had walked through the palace halls in this way word reached the RegentThe Regent respectfully approached Somdet Toh and asked him to take a seat after which he assured him that he understood the Somdets message He would not allow his deliberations to be overcome with the darkness of defilement and he would hold to the Dhamma as a rudder while steering the ship of stateFour years later Somdet Toh passed awayBuddhism in a Nutshell first appeared inSince then several editions were published by various philanthropic gentlemen for free distributionFor a fuller exposition of the subjects dealt with here readers are kindly requested to read the revised and enlarged edition of The Buddha and His Teachings published inPermission

Sakya Prince named Siddhattha Gotama who was destined to be the greatest religious teacher in the worldBrought up in the lap of luxury receiving an education befitting a prince he married and had a sonHis contemplative nature and boundless compassion did not permit him to enjoy the fleeting material pleasures of a Royal householdHe knew no woe but he felt a deep pity for sorrowing humanityAmidst comfort and prosperity he realized the universality of sorrowThe palace with all its worldly amusements was no longer a congenial place for the compassionate princeThe time was ripe for him to departRealizing the vanity of sensual enjoyments in his twentyninth year he renounced all worldly pleasures and donning the simple yellow garb of an ascetic alone penniless wandered forth in search of Truth and PeaceIt was an unprecedented historic renunciation for he renounced not in his old age but in the prime of manhood not in poverty but in plentyAs it was the belief in the ancient days that no deliverance could be gained unless one leads a life of strict asceticism he strenuously practiced all forms of severe austeritiesAdding vigil after vigil and penance after penance he made a superhuman effort for six long yearsHis body was reduced to almost a skeletonThe more he tormented his body the farther his goal receded from himThe painful unsuccessful austerities which he strenuously practiced proved absolutely futileHe was now fully convinced through personal experience of the utter futility of selfmortification which weakened his body and resulted in lassitude of spiritBenefiting by this invaluable experience of his he finally decided to follow an independent course avoiding the two extremes of selfindulgence and selfmortificationThe former retards ones spiritual progress and the latter weakens ones intellectThe new way which he himself discovered was the Middle Path Majjhima Patipada which subsequently became one of the salient characteristics of his teachingOne happy morning while He was deeply absorbed in meditation unaided and unguided by any supernatural power and solely relying on His efforts and wisdom He eradicated all defilements purified Himself and realizing things as they truly are attained Enlightenment at the age ofHe was not born a Buddha but He became a Buddha by His own strivingAs the perfect embodiment of all the virtues He preached endowed with deep wisdom commensurate with His boundless compassionHe devoted the remainder of His precious life to serve humanity both by example and precept dominated by no personal motive whateverAfter a very successful ministry of long years the Buddha as every other human being succumbed to the inexorable law of change and finally passed away in His th year exhorting His disciples to regard His doctrine as their teacherThe Buddha was a human beingAs a man He was born as a man He lived and as a man His life came to an endThough a human being He became an extraordinary man but He never arrogated to Himself divinityThe Buddha laid stress on this important point and left no room whatever for anyone to fall into the error of thinking that He was an immortal divine beingFortunately there is no deification in the case of the BuddhaIt should however be remarked that there was no Teacher ever so godless as the Buddha yet none so godlikeThe Buddha is neither an incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu as is believed by some nor is He a savior who freely saves others by His personal salvationThe Buddha exhorts His disciples to depend on themselves for their deliverance for both purity and defilement depend on oneselfClarifying His relationship with His followers and emphasizing the importance of selfreliance and individual striving the Buddha plainly states You should exert yourselves the Tathagatas are only teachersThe Buddhas point out the path and it is left for us to follow that path to obtain our purificationTo depend on others for salvation is negative but to depend on oneself is positive Dependence on others means a surrender of ones effortIn exhorting His disciples to be selfdependent the Buddha says in the Parinibbana Sutta Be ye islands unto yourselves be ye a refuge unto yourselves seek not for refuge in others These significant words are selfelevatingThey reveal how vital is selfexertion to accomplish ones object and how superficial and futile it is to seek redemption through benignant saviors and to crave for illusory happiness in an after life through the propitiation of imaginary Gods or by irresponsive prayers and meaningless sacrificesFurthermore the Buddha does not claim the monopoly of Buddhahood which as a matter of fact is not the prerogative of any specially graced personHe reached the highest possible state of perfection any person could aspire to and without the closefist of a teacher he revealed the only straight path that leads theretoAccording to the Teaching of the Buddha anybody may aspire to that supreme state of perfection if he makes the necessary exertionThe Buddha does not condemn men by calling them wretched sinners but on the contrary He gladdens them by saying that they are pure in heart at conceptionIn His opinion the world is not wicked but is deluded by ignoranceInstead of disheartening His followers and reserving that exalted state only to Himself He encourages and induces them to emulate Him for Buddhahood is latent in allIn one sense all are potential BuddhasOne who aspires to become a Buddha is called a Bodhisatta which literally means a wisdombeingThis Bodhisatta ideal is the most beautiful and the most refined course of life that has ever been presented to this egocentric world for what is nobler than a life of service and purityAs a Man He attained Buddhahood and proclaimed to the world the latent inconceivable possibilities and the creative power of manInstead of placing an unseen Almighty God over man who arbitrarily controls the destinies of mankind and making him subservient to a supreme power He raised the worth of mankindIt was He who taught that man can gain his deliverance and purification by his own exertion without depending on an external God or mediating priestsIt was he who taught the egocentric world the noble ideal of selfless serviceIt was He who revolted against the degrading caste system and taught equality of mankind and gave equal opportunities for all to distinguish themselves in every walk of lifeHe declared that the gates of success and prosperity were open to all in every condition of life high or low saint or criminal who would care to turn a new leaf and aspire to perfectionIrrespective of caste color or rank He established for both deserving men and women a democratically constituted celibate OrderHe did not force His followers to be slaves either to His Teachings or to Himself but granted complete freedom of thoughtHe comforted the bereaved by His consoling wordsHe ministered to the sick that were desertedHe helped the poor that were neglectedHe ennobled the lives of the deluded purified the corrupted lives of criminalsHe encouraged the feeble united the divided enlightened the ignorant clarified the mystic guided the benighted elevated the base dignified the nobleBoth rich and poor saints and criminals loved Him alikeDespotic and righteous kings famous and obscure princes and nobles generous and stingy millionaires haughty and humble scholars destitute paupers downtrodden scavengers wicked murderers despised courtesans  all benefited by His words of wisdom and compassionHis noble example was a source of inspiration to allHis serene and peaceful countenance was a soothing sight to the pious eyesHis message of Peace and Tolerance was welcomed by all with indescribable joy and was of eternal benefit to every one who had the fortune to hear and practice itWherever His teachings penetrated it left an indelible impression upon the character of the respective peoplesThe cultural advancement of all the Buddhist nations was mainly due to His sublime TeachingsIn fact all Buddhist countries like Ceylon Burma Thailand Cambodia Vietnam Laos Nepal Tibet China Mongolia Korea Japan etc grew up in the cradle of BuddhismThough more than years have elapsed since the passing away of this greatest Teacher yet his unique personality exerts a great influence on all who come to know HimHis iron will profound wisdom universal love boundless compassion selfless service historic renunciation perfect purity magnetic personality exemplary methods employed to propagate the Teachings and his final success  all these factors have compelled about onefifth of the population of the world today to hail the Buddha as their supreme TeacherPaying a glowing tribute to the Buddha Sri Radhakrishnan states In Gautama the Buddha we have a mastermind from the East second to none so far as the influence on the thought and life of the human race is concerned and sacred to all as the founder of a religious tradition whose hold is hardly less wide and deep than any otherHe belongs to the history of the worlds thought to the general inheritance of all cultivated men for judged by intellectual integrity moral earnestness and spiritual insight He is undoubtedly one of the greatest figures in historyIn The Three Greatest Men in History HGWells writes In the Buddha you see clearly a man simple devout lonely battling for light  a vivid human personality not a mythHe too gave a message to mankind universal in characterMany of our best modern ideas are in closest harmony with itAll the miseries and discontents are due he taught to selfishnessBefore a man can become serene he must cease to live for his senses or himselfThen he merges into a great beingBuddha in different language called men to selfforgetfulness years before ChristIn some ways he is nearer to us and our needsHe was more lucid upon our individual importance and service than Christ and less ambiguous upon the question of personal immortalityStHilaire remarks The perfect model of all the virtues He preachesHis life has not a stain upon itFausboll says  The more I know of Him the more I love HimA humble follower of his would say  The more I know Him the more I love Him the more I love Him the more I know HimThe nonaggressive moral and philosophical system expounded by the Buddha which demands no blind faith from its adherents expounds no dogmatic creeds encourages no superstitious rites and ceremonies but advocates a golden mean that guides a disciple through pure living and pure thinking to the gain of supreme wisdom and deliverance from all evil is called the Dhamma and is popularly known as BuddhismThe allmerciful Buddha has passed away but the sublime Dhamma which He unreservedly bequeathed to humanity still exists in its pristine purityAlthough the Master has left no written records of His Teachings His distinguished disciples preserved them by committing to memory and transmitting them orally from generation to generationImmediately after His demise chief Arahats versed in the Dhamma and Vinaya held a convocation to rehearse the Doctrine as was originally taught by the BuddhaVenerable Ananda Thera who enjoyed the special privilege of hearing all the discourses recited the Dhamma while the Venerable Upali recited the VinayaThe Tipitaka was compiled and arranged in its present form by those Arahats of oldDuring the reign of the pious Sinhala King Vattagamani Abhaya about BC the Tipitaka was for the first time in the history of Buddhism committed to writing on palm leaves in CeylonThis voluminous Tipitaka which contains the essence of the Buddhas Teaching is estimated to be about eleven times the size of the BibleA striking contrast between the Tipitaka and the Bible is that the former is not a gradual development like the latterAs the word itself implies the Tipitaka consists of three basketsThey are the Basket of Discipline the Basket of Discourses and the Basket of Ultimate DoctrineThe Vinaya Pitaka which is regarded as the sheet anchor to the oldest historic celibate order  the Sangha  mainly deals with rules and regulations which the Buddha promulgated as occasion arose for the future discipline of the Order of monks and nunsIt described in detail the gradual development of the SasanaAn account of the life and ministry of the Buddha is also givenIndirectly it reveals some important and interesting information about ancient history Indian customs arts science etcThe Vinaya Pitaka consists of the five following booksThe Sutta Pitaka consists chiefly of discourses delivered by the Buddha himself on various occasionsThere are also a few discourses delivered by some of His distinguished disciples such as the Venerable Sariputta Ananda Moggallana etc included in itIt is like a book of prescriptions as the sermons embodied therein were expounded to suit the different occasions and the temperaments of various personsThere may be seemingly contradictory statements but they should not be misconstrued as they were opportunely uttered by the Buddha to suit a particular purpose for instance to the selfsame question He would maintain silence or give a detailed reply when He knew the inquirer to be an earnest seekerMost of the sermons were intended mainly for the benefit of Bhikkhus and they deal with the Holy life and with the expositions of the doctrineThere are also several other discourses which deal with both the material and moral progress of His lay followersThis Pitaka is divided into five Nikayas or collections vizThe fifth is subdivided into fifteen booksThe Abhidhamma Pitaka is the most important and the most interesting of the three containing as it does the profound philosophy of the Buddhas Teaching in contrast to the illuminating and simpler discourses in the Sutta PitakaIn the Sutta Pitaka is found the conventional teaching while in the Abhidhamma Pitaka is found the ultimate teachingTo the wise Abhidhamma is an indispensable guide to the spiritually evolved an intellectual treat and to research scholars food for thoughtConsciousness is definedThoughts are analyzed and classified chiefly from an ethical standpointMental states are enumeratedThe composition of each type of consciousness is set forth in detailHow thoughts arise is minutely describedIrrelevant problems that interest mankind but having no relation to ones purification are deliberately set asideMatter is summarily discussed fundamental units of matter properties of matter sources of matter relationship between mind and matter are explainedThe Abhidhamma investigates mind and matter the two composite factors of the socalled being to help the understanding of things as they truly are and a philosophy has been developed on those linesBased on that philosophy an ethical system has been evolved to realize the ultimate goal NibbanaThe Abhidhamma Pitaka consists of seven booksIn the Tipitaka one finds milk for the babe and meat for the strong for the Buddha taught His doctrine both to the masses and to the intelligentsiaThe sublime Dhamma enshrined in these sacred texts deals with truths and facts and is not concerned with theories and philosophies which may be accepted as profound truths today only to be thrown overboard tomorrowThe Buddha has presented us with no new astounding philosophical theories nor did He venture to create any new material scienceHe explained to us what is within and without so far as it concerns our emancipation as ultimately expounded a path of deliverance which is uniqueIncidentally He has however forestalled many a modern scientist and philosopherSchopenhauer in his World as Will and Idea has presented the truth of suffering and its cause in a Western garbSpinoza though he denies not the existence of a permanent reality asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitoryIn his opinion sorrow is conquered by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient not ephemeral but is immutable permanent everlasting Berkeley proved that the socalled indivisible atom is a metaphysical fictionHume after a relentless analysis of the mind concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental statesBergson advocates the doctrine of changeProfJames refers to a stream of consciousnessThe Buddha expounded these doctrines of Transiency Sorrow and NoSoul some years ago while He was sojourning in the valley of the GangesIt should be understood that the Buddha did not preach all that He knewOn one occasion while the Buddha was passing through a forest He took a handful of leaves and said O Bhikkhus what I have taught is comparable to the leaves in my handWhat I have not taught is comparable to the amount of leaves in the forestHe taught what He deemed was absolutely essential for ones purification making no distinction between an esoteric and exoteric doctrineHe was characteristically silent on questions irrelevant to His noble missionBuddhism no doubt accords with science but both should be treated as parallel teachings since one deals mainly with material truths while the other confines itself to moral and spiritual truthsThe subject matter of each is differentThe Dhamma He taught is not merely to be preserved in books nor is it a subject to be studied from a historical or literary standpointOn the contrary it is to be learned and put into practice in the course of ones daily life for without practice one cannot appreciate the truthThe Dhamma is to be studied and more to be practiced and above all to be realized immediate realization is its ultimate goalAs such the Dhamma is compared to a raft which is meant for the sole purpose of escaping from the ocean of birth and deathBuddhism therefore cannot strictly be called a mere philosophy because it is not merely the love of inducing the search after wisdom Buddhism may approximate a philosophy but it is very much more comprehensivePhilosophy deals mainly with knowledge and is not concerned with practice whereas Buddhism lays special emphasis on practice and realizationIt is neither a religion in the sense in which that word is commonly understood for it is not a system of faith and worship owing any allegiance to a supernatural beingBuddhism does not demand blind faith from its adherentsHere mere belief is dethroned and is substituted by confidence based on knowledge which in Pali is known as SaddhaThe confidence placed by a follower on the Buddha is like that of a sick person in a noted physician or a student in his teacherA Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha because it was He who discovered the Path of DeliveranceA Buddhist does not seek refuge in the Buddha with the hope that he will be saved by His personal purificationThe Buddha gives no such guaranteeIt is not within the power of a Buddha to wash away the impurities of othersOne could neither purify nor defile anotherThe Buddha as Teacher instructs us but we ourselves are directly responsible for our purificationAlthough a Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha he does not make any selfsurrenderNor does a Buddhist sacrifice his freedom of thought by becoming a follower of the BuddhaHe can exercise his own free will and develop his knowledge even to the extent of becoming a Buddha himselfThe starting point of Buddhism is reasoning or understanding or in other words SammaditthiTo the seekers of truth the Buddha saysDo not accept anything on hearsay Do not accept anything by mere tradition Do not accept anything on account of mere rumors Do not accept anything just because it accords with your scripturesDo not accept anything by mere suppositionsDo not accept anything by mere inferenceDo not accept anything by merely considering the reasonsDo not accept anything merely because it agrees with your preconceived notionsDo not accept anything merely because it seems acceptable Do not accept anything thinking that the ascetic is respected by usBut when you know for yourselves  these things are immoral these things are blameworthy these things are censured by the wise these things when performed and undertaken conduce to ruin and sorrow  then indeed do you reject themWhen you know for yourselves  these things are moral these things are blameless these things are praised by the wise these things when performed and undertaken conduce to wellbeing and happiness  then do you live acting accordinglyThese inspiring words of the Buddha still retain their original force and freshnessThough there is no blind faith one might argue whether there is no worshiping of images etc in BuddhismBuddhists do not worship an image expecting worldly or spiritual favors but pay their reverence to what it representsAn understanding Buddhist in offering flowers and incense to an image designedly makes himself feel that he is in the presence of the living Buddha and thereby gains inspiration from His noble personality and breathes deep His boundless compassionHe tries to follow His noble exampleThe Botree is also a symbol of EnlightenmentThese external objects of reverence are not absolutely necessary but they are useful as they tend to concentrate ones attentionAn intellectual person could dispense with them as he could easily focus his attention and visualize the BuddhaFor our own good and out of gratitude we pay such external respect but what the Buddha expects from His disciple is not so much obeisance as the actual observance of His TeachingsThe Buddha says  He honors me best who practices my teaching best He who sees the Dhamma sees meWith regard to images however Count Kevserling remarks  I see nothing more grand in this world than the image of the BuddhaIt is an absolutely perfect embodiment of spirituality in the visible domainFurthermore it must be mentioned that there are not petitional or intercessory prayers in BuddhismHowever much we may pray to the Buddha we cannot be savedThe Buddha does not grant favors to those who pray to HimInstead of petitional prayers there is meditation that leads to selfcontrol purification and enlightenmentMeditation is neither a silent reverie nor keeping the mind blankIt is an active strivingIt serves as a tonic both to the heart and the mindThe Buddha not only speaks of the futility of offering prayers but also disparages a slave mentalityA Buddhist should not pray to be saved but should rely on himself and win his freedomPrayers take the character of private communications selfish bargaining with GodIt seeks for objects of earthly ambitions and inflames the sense of selfMeditation on the other hand is selfchange Sri RadhakrishnanIn Buddhism there is not as in most other religions an Almighty God to be obeyed and fearedThe Buddha does not believe in a cosmic potentate omniscient and omnipresentIn Buddhism there are no divine revelations or divine messengersA Buddhist is therefore not subservient to any higher supernatural power which controls his destinies and which arbitrarily rewards and punishesSince Buddhists do not believe in revelations of a divine being Buddhism does not claim the monopoly of truth and does not condemn any other religionBut Buddhism recognizes the infinite latent possibilities of man and teaches that man can gain deliverance from suffering by his own efforts independent of divine help or mediating priestsBuddhism cannot therefore strictly be called a religion because it is neither a system of faith and worship nor the outward act or form by which men indicate their recognition of the existence of a God or gods having power over their own destiny to whom obedience service and honor are dueIf by religion is meant a teaching which takes a view of life that is more than superficial a teaching which looks into life and not merely at it a teaching which furnishes men with a guide to conduct that is in accord with this its inlook a teaching which enables those who give it heed to face life with fortitude and death with serenity or a system to get rid of the ills of life then it is certainly a religion of religionsIt no doubt contains an excellent ethical code which is unparalleled in its perfection and altruistic attitudeIt deals with one way of life for the monks and another for the laityBut Buddhism is much more than an ordinary moral teachingMorality is only the preliminary stage on the Path of Purity and is a means to an end but not an end in itselfConduct though essential is itself insufficient to gain ones emancipationIt should be coupled with wisdom or knowledgeThe base of Buddhism is morality and wisdom is its apexIn observing the principles of morality a Buddhist should not only regard his own self but also should have a consideration for others we well  animals not excludedMorality in Buddhism is not founded on any doubtful revelation nor is it the ingenious invention of an exceptional mind but it is a rational and practical code based on verifiable facts and individual experienceIt should be mentioned that any external supernatural agency plays no part whatever in the moulding of the character of a BuddhistIn Buddhism there is no one to reward or punishPain or happiness are the inevitable results of ones actionsThe question of incurring the pleasure or displeasure of a God does not enter the mind of a BuddhistNeither hope of reward nor fear of punishment acts as an incentive to him to do good or to refrain from evilA Buddhist is aware of future consequences but he refrains from evil because it retards does good because it aids progress to EnlightenmentThere are also some who do good because it is good refrain from evil because it is badTo understand the exceptionally high standard of morality the Buddha expects from His ideal followers one must carefully read the Dhammapada Sigalovada Sutta Vyaggapajja Sutta Mangala Sutta Karaniya Sutta Parabhava Sutta Vasala Sutta Dhammika Sutta etcAs a moral teaching it excels all other ethical systems but morality is only the beginning and not the end of BuddhismIn one sense Buddhism is not a philosophy in another sense it is the philosophy of philosophiesIn one sense Buddhism is not a religion in another sense it is the religion of religionsBuddhism is neither a metaphysical path nor a ritualistic pathIt is neither sceptical nor dogmaticIt is neither selfmortification nor selfindulgenceIt is neither pessimism nor optimismIt is neither eternalism nor nihilismIt is neither absolutely thisworldly nor otherworldlyIt is a unique Path of EnlightenmentThe original Pali term for Buddhism is Dhamma which literally means that which upholdsThere is no English equivalent that exactly conveys the meaning of the Pali termThe Dhamma is that which really isIt is the Doctrine of RealityIt is a means of Deliverance from suffering and Deliverance itselfWhether the Buddhas arise or not the Dhamma existsIt lies hidden from the ignorant eyes of men till a Buddha an Enlightened One realizes and compassionately reveals it to the worldThis Dhamma is not something apart from oneself but is closely associated with oneselfAs such the Buddha exhortsAbide with oneself as an island with oneself as a RefugeAbide with the Dhamma as an island with the Dhamma as a RefugeSeek no external refuge Parinibbana SuttaThe foundations of Buddhism are the four Noble Truths  namely Suffering its cause its end and the Middle WayWhat is the Noble Truth of SufferingBirth is suffering old age is suffering disease is suffering death is suffering to be united with the unpleasant is suffering to be separated from the pleasant is suffering not to receive what one craves for is suffering in brief the five Aggregates of Attachment are sufferingWhat is the Noble Truth of the Cause of SufferingWhat is the Noble Truth of the Annihilation of SufferingWhat is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Annihilation of SufferingWhether the Buddhas arise or not these four Truths exist in the universeThe Buddhas only reveal these Truths which lay hidden in the dark abyss of timeScientifically interpreted the Dhamma may be called the law of cause and effectThese two embrace the entire body of the Buddhas TeachingsThe first three represent the philosophy of Buddhism the fourth represents the ethics of Buddhism based on that philosophyAll these four truths are dependent on this body itselfThe Buddha states In this very onefathom long body along with perceptions and thoughts do I proclaim the world the origin of the world the end of the world and the path leading to the end of the world Here the term world is applied to sufferingBuddhism rests on the pivot of sorrowBut it does not thereby follow that Buddhism is pessimisticIt is neither totally pessimistic nor totally optimistic but on the contrary it teaches a truth that lies midway between themOne would be justified in calling the Buddha a pessimist if He had only enunciated the Truth of suffering without suggesting a means to put an end to itThe Buddha perceived the universality of sorrow and did prescribe a panacea for this universal sickness of humanityThe highest conceivable happiness according to the Buddha is Nibbana which is the total extinction of sufferingThe author of the article on Pessimism in the Encyclopedia Britannica writes Pessimism denotes an attitude of hopelessness towards life a vague general opinion that pain and evil predominate in human affairsThe original doctrine of the Buddha is in fact as optimistic as any optimism of the WestTo call it pessimism is merely to apply to it a characteristically Western principle to which happiness is impossible without personalityThe true Buddhist looks forward with enthusiasm to absorption into eternal blissOrdinarily the enjoyment of sensual pleasures is the highest and only happiness of the average manThere is no doubt a kind of momentary happiness in the anticipation gratification and retrospection of such fleeting material pleasures but they are illusive and temporaryAccording to the Buddha nonattachment is a greater blissThe Buddha does not expect His followers to be constantly pondering on suffering and lead a miserable unhappy lifeHe exhorts them to be always happy and cheerful for zest is one of the factors of EnlightenmentReal happiness is found within and is not to be defined in terms of wealth children honors or fameIf such possessions are misdirected forcibly or unjustly obtained misappropriated or even viewed with attachment they will be a source of pain and sorrow to the possessorsInstead of trying to rationalize suffering Buddhism takes suffering for granted and seeks the cause to eradicate itSuffering exists as long as there is cravingIt can only be annihilated by treading the Noble Eightfold Path and attaining the supreme bliss of NibbanaThese four Truths can be verified by experienceHence the Buddha Dhamma is not based on the fear of the unknown but is founded on the bedrock of facts which can be tested by ourselves and verified by experienceBuddhism is therefore rational and intensely practicalSuch a rational and practical system cannot contain mysteries or esoteric doctrinesBlind faith therefore is foreign to BuddhismWhere there is no blind faith there cannot be any coercion or persecution or fanaticismTo the unique credit of Buddhism it must be said that throughout its peaceful march of years no drop of blood was shed in the name of the Buddha no mighty monarch wielded his powerful sword to propagate the Dhamma and no conversion was made either by force or by repulsive methodsYet the Buddha was the first and the greatest missionary that lived on earthAldous Huxley writes Alone of all the great world religions Buddhism made its way without persecution censorship or inquisitionLord Russell remarks Of the great religions of history I prefer Buddhism especially in its earliest forms because it has had the smallest element of persecutionIn the name of Buddhism no altar was reddened with the blood of a Hypatia no Bruno was burnt aliveBuddhism appeals more to the intellect than to the emotionIt is concerned more with the character of the devotees than with their numerical strengthOn one occasion Upali a follower of Nigantha Nataputta approached the Buddha and was so pleased with the Buddhas exposition of the Dhamma that he instantly expressed his desire to become a follower of the BuddhaBut the Buddha cautioned him sayingUpali who was overjoyed at this unexpected remark of the Buddha saidBuddhism is saturated with this spirit of free enquiry and complete toleranceIt is the teaching of the open mind and the sympathetic heart which lighting and warming the whole universe with its twin rays of wisdom and compassion sheds its genial glow on every being struggling in the ocean of birth and deathThe Buddha was so tolerant that He did not even exercise His power to give commandments to His lay followersInstead of using the imperative He said It behooves you to do this  It behooves you not to do this He commands not but does exhortThis tolerance the Buddha extended to men women and all living beingsIt was the Buddha who first attempted to abolish slavery and vehemently protested against the degrading caste system which was firmly rooted in the soil of IndiaIn the Word of the Buddha it is not by mere birth one becomes an outcast or a noble but by ones actionsCaste or color does not preclude one from becoming a Buddhist or from entering the OrderFishermen scavengers courtesans together with warriors and Brahmans were freely admitted to the Order and enjoyed equal privileges and were also given positions of rankUpali the barber for instance was made in preference to all other the chief in matters pertaining to Vinaya disciplineThe timid Sunita the scavenger who attained Arhatship was admitted by the Buddha Himself into the OrderAngulimala the robber and criminal was converted to a compassionate saintThe fierce Alavaka sought refuge in the Buddha and became a saintThe courtesan Ambapali entered the Order and attained ArhatshipSuch instances could easily be multiplied from the Tipitaka to show that the portals of Buddhism were wide open to all irrespective of caste color or rankIt was also the Buddha who raised the status of downtrodden women and not only brought them to a realization of their importance to society but also founded the first celibate religious order for women with rules and regulationsThe Buddha did not humiliate women but only regarded them as feeble by natureHe saw the innate good of both men and women and assigned to them their due places in His teachingSex is no barrier to attaining SainthoodSometimes the Pali term used to denote women is Matugama which means motherfolk or society of mothers As a mother woman holds an honorable place in BuddhismEven the wife is regarded as best friend of the husbandHasty critics are only making ex parte statements when they reproach Buddhism with being inimical to womenAlthough at first the Buddha refused to admit women into the Order on reasonable grounds yet later He yielded to the entreaties of His fostermother Pajapati Gotami and founded the Bhikkhuni OrderJust as the Arahats Sariputta and Moggallana were made the two chief disciples in the Order of monks even so he appointed Arahats Khema and Uppalavanna as the two chief female disciplesMany other female disciples too were named by the Buddha Himself as His distinguished and pious followersOn one occasion the Buddha said to King Kosala who was displeased on hearing that a daughter was born to himMany women who otherwise would have fallen into oblivion distinguished themselves in various ways and gained their emancipation by following the Dhamma and entering the OrderIn this new Order which later proved to be a great blessing to many women queens princesses daughters of noble families widows bereaved mothers destitute women pitiable courtesans  all despite their caste or rank met on a common platform enjoyed perfect consolation and peace and breathed that free atmosphere which is denied to those cloistered in cottages and palatial mansionsIt was also the Buddha who banned the sacrifice of poor beasts and admonished His followers to extend their loving kindness to all living beings  even to the tiniest creature that crawls at ones feetNo man has the power or the right to destroy the life of another as life is precious to allA genuine Buddhist would exercise this lovingkindness towards every living being and identify himself with all making no distinction whatsoever with regard to caste color or sexIt is this Buddhist Metta that attempts to break all the barriers which separate one from anotherThere is no reason to keep aloof from others merely because they belong to another persuasion or another nationalityIn that noble Toleration Edict which is based on CullaVyuha and MahaVyuha Suttas Asoka says Concourse alone is best that is all should harken willingly to the doctrine professed by othersBuddhism is not confined to any country or any particular nationIt is universalIt is not nationalism which in other words is another form of caste system founded on a wider basisBuddhism if it be permitted to say so is supernationalismTo a Buddhist there is no far or near no enemy or foreigner no renegade or untouchable since universal love realized through understanding has established the brotherhood of all living beingsA real Buddhist is a citizen of the worldHe regards the whole world as his motherland and all as his brothers and sistersBuddhism is therefore unique mainly owing to its tolerance nonaggressiveness rationality practicability efficacy and universalityIt is the noblest of all unifying influences and the only lever that can uplift the worldThese are some of the salient features of Buddhism and amongst some of the fundamental doctrines may be said  Kamma or the Law of Moral Causation the Doctrine of Rebirth Anatta and NibbanaWe are faced with a totally illbalanced worldWe perceive the inequalities and manifold destinies of men and the numerous grades of beings that exist in the universeWe see one born into a condition of affluence endowed with fine mental moral and physical qualities and another into a condition of abject poverty and wretchednessHere is a man virtuous and holy but contrary to his expectation illluck is ever ready to greet himThe wicked world runs counter to his ambitions and desiresHe is poor and miserable in spite of his honest dealings and pietyThere is another vicious and foolish but accounted to be fortunes darlingHe is rewarded with all forms of favors despite his shortcomings and evil modes of lifeWhy it may be questioned should one be an inferior and another a superiorWhy should one be wrested from the hands of a fond mother when he has scarcely seen a few summers and another should perish in the flower or manhood or at the ripe age of eighty or hundredWhy should one be sick and infirm and another strong and healthyWhy should one be handsome and another ugly and hideous repulsive to allWhy should one be brought up in the lap of luxury and another in absolute poverty steeped in miseryWhy should one be born a millionaire and another a pauperWhy should one be born with saintly characteristics and another with criminal tendenciesWhy should some be linguists artists mathematicians or musicians from the very cradleWhy should some be congenitally blind deaf and deformedWhy should some be blessed and others cursed from their birthThese are some problems that perplex the minds of all thinking menHow are we to account for all this unevenness of the world this inequality of mankindIs it due to the work of blind chance or accidentThere is nothing in this world that happens by blind chance or accidentTo say that anything happens by chance is no more true than that this book has come here of itselfStrictly speaking nothing happens to man that he does not deserve for some reason or anotherCould this be the fiat of an irresponsible CreatorHuxley writesIf we are to assume that anybody has designedly set this wonderful universe going it is perfectly clear to me that he is no more entirely benevolent and just in any intelligible sense of the words than that he is malevolent and unjustAccording to EinsteinIf this being is omnipotent then every occurrence including every human action every human thought and every human feeling and aspiration is also his work how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an Almighty BeingIn giving out punishments and rewards he would to a certain extent be passing judgment on himselfHow can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to himAccording to the theological principles man is created arbitrarily and without his desire and at the moment of his creation is either blessed or damned eternallyHence man is either good or evil fortunate or unfortunate noble or depraved from the first step in the process of his physical creation to the moment of his last breath regardless of his individual desires hopes ambitions struggles or devoted prayersSuch is theological fatalism Spencer LewisAs Charles Bradlaugh saysThe existence of evil is a terrible stumbling block to the TheistPain misery crime poverty confront the advocate of eternal goodness and challenge with unanswerable potency his declaration of Deity as allgood allwise and allpowerfulIn the words of SchopenhauerWhoever regards himself as having become out of nothing must also think that he will again become nothing for an eternity has passed before he was and then a second eternity had begun through which he will never cease to be is a monstrous thoughtIf birth is the absolute beginning then death must be his absolute end and the assumption that man is made out of nothing leads necessarily to the assumption that death is his absolute endCommenting on human sufferings and God ProfJBSHaldane writesEither suffering is needed to perfect human character or God is not AlmightyThe former theory is disproved by the fact that some people who have suffered very little but have been fortunate in their ancestry and education have very fine charactersThe objection to the second is that it is only in connection with the universe as a whole that there is any intellectual gap to be filled by the postulation of a deityAnd a creator could presumably create whatever he or it wantedLord Russell statesThe world we are told was created by a God who is both good and omnipotentBefore He created the world he foresaw all the pain and misery that it would containHe is therefore responsible for all of itit is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sinIf God knew in advance the sins of which man would be guilty He was clearly responsible for all the consequences of those sins when He decided to create manIn Despair a poem of his old age Lord Tennyson thus boldly attacks God who as recorded in Isaiah says I make peace and create evil WhatI should call on that infinite love that has served us so wellInfinite cruelty rather that made everlasting hell Made us foreknew us foredoomed us and does what he will with his ownBetter our dead brute mother who never has heard us groanSurely the doctrine that all men are sinners and have the essential sin of Adam is a challenge to justice mercy love and omnipotent fairnessSome writers of old authoritatively declared that God created man in his own imageSome modern thinkers state on the contrary that man created God in his own imageWith the growth of civilization mans concept of God also became more and more refinedIt is however impossible to conceive of such a being either in or outside the universeCould this variation be due to heredity and environmentOne must admit that all such chemicophysical phenomena revealed by scientists are partly instrumental but they cannot be solely responsible for the subtle distinctions and vast differences that exist amongst individualsYet why should identical twins who are physically alike inheriting like genes enjoying the same privilege of upbringing be very often temperamentally morally and intellectually totally differentHeredity alone cannot account for these vast differencesStrictly speaking it accounts more plausibly for their similarities than for most of the differencesThe infinitesimally minute chemicophysical germ which is about millionth part of an inch across inherited from parents explains only a portion of man his physical foundationWith regard to the more complex and subtle mental intellectual and moral differences we need more enlightenmentThe theory of heredity cannot give a satisfactory explanation for the birth of a criminal in a long line of honorable ancestors the birth of a saint or a noble man in a family of evil repute for the arising of infant prodigies men of genius and great religious teachersAccording to Buddhism this variation is due not only to heredity environment nature and nurture but also to our own kamma or in other words to the result of our own inherited past actions and our present deedsWe ourselves are responsible for our own deeds happiness and miseryWe build our own hellsWe create our own heavensWe are the architects of our own fateIn short we ourselves are our own kammaOn one occasion a certain young man named Subha approached the Buddha and questioned why and wherefore it was that among human beings there are the low and high statesFor said he we find amongst mankind those of brief life and those of long life the hale and the ailing the good looking and the illlooking the powerful and the powerless the poor and the rich the lowborn and the highborn the ignorant and the intelligentThe Buddha briefly replied Every living being has kamma as its own its inheritance its cause its kinsman its refugeKamma is that which differentiates all living beings into low and high statesHe then explained the cause of such differences in accordance with the law of moral causationThus from a Buddhist standpoint our present mental intellectual moral and temperamental differences are mainly due to our own actions and tendencies both past the presentKamma literally means action but in its ultimate sense it means the meritorious and demeritorious volitionKamma constitutes both good and evilGood gets goodEvil gets evilLike attracts likeThis is the law of KammaAs some Westerners prefer to say Kamma is actioninfluenceWe reap what we have sownWhat we sow we reap somewhere or some whenIn one sense we are the result of what we were we will be the result of what we areIn another sense we are not totally the result of what we were and we will not absolutely be the result of what we areFor instance a criminal today may be a saint tomorrowBuddhism attributes this variation to Kamma but it does not assert that everything is due to KammaIf everything were due to Kamma a man must ever be bad for it is his Kamma to be badOne need not consult a physician to be cured of a disease for if ones Kamma is such one will be curedAccording to Buddhism there are five orders or processes which operate in the physical and mental realmsEvery mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by these allembracing five orders or processes which are laws in themselvesKamma is therefore only one of the five orders that prevail in the universeIt is a law in itself but it does not thereby follow that there should be a lawgiverOrdinary laws of nature like gravitation need no lawgiverIt operates in its own field without the intervention of an external independent ruling agencyNobody for instance has decreed that fire should burnNobody has commanded that water should seek its own levelNo scientist has ordered that water should consist of HO and that coldness should be one of its propertiesThese are their intrinsic characteristicsKamma is neither fate nor predestination imposed upon us by some mysterious unknown power to which we must helplessly submit ourselvesIt is ones own doing reacting on oneself and so one has the possibility to divert the course of Kamma to some extentHow far one diverts it depends on oneselfIt must also be said that such phraseology as rewards and punishments should not be allowed to enter into discussions concerning the problem of KammaFor Buddhism does not recognize an Almighty Being who rules His subjects and rewards and punishes them accordinglyBuddhists on the contrary believe that sorrow and happiness one experiences are the natural outcome of ones own good and bad actionsIt should be stated that Kamma has both the continuative and the retributive principleInherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing its due effectThe cause produces the effect the effect explains the causeSeed produces the fruit the fruit explains the seed as both are interrelatedEven so Kamma and its effect are interrelated the effect already blooms in the causeA Buddhist who is fully convinced of the doctrine of Kamma does not pray to another to be saved but confidently relies on himself for his purification because it teaches individual responsibilityIt is this doctrine of Kamma that gives him consolation hope self reliance and moral courageIt is this belief in Kamma that validates his effort kindles his enthusiasm makes him ever kind tolerant and considerateIt is also this firm belief in Kamma that prompts him to refrain from evil do good and be good without being frightened of any punishment or tempted by any rewardIt is this doctrine of Kamma that can explain the problem of suffering the mystery of socalled fate or predestination of other religions and above all the inequality of mankindKamma and rebirth are accepted as axiomaticAs long as this Kammic force exists there is rebirth for beings are merely the visible manifestation of this invisible Kammic forceDeath is nothing but the temporary end of this temporary phenomenonIt is not the complete annihilation of this socalled beingThe organic life has ceased but the Kammic force which hitherto actuated it has not been destroyedAs the Kammic force remains entirely undisturbed by the disintegration of the fleeting body the passing away of the present dying thoughtmoment only conditions a fresh consciousness in another birthIt is Kamma rooted in ignorance and craving that conditions rebirthPast Kamma conditions the present birth and present Kamma in combination with past Kamma conditions the futureThe present is the offspring of the past and becomes in turn the parent of the futureIf we postulate a past present and a future life then we are at once faced with the alleged mysterious problem  What is the ultimate origin of lifeEither there must be a beginning or there cannot be a beginning for lifeOne school in attempting to solve the problem postulates a first cause God viewed as a force or as an Almighty BeingAnother school denies a first cause for in common experience the cause ever becomes the effect and the effect becomes the causeIn a circle of cause and effect a first cause is inconceivableAccording to the former life has had a beginning according to the latter it is beginninglessFrom the scientific standpoint we are the direct products of the sperm and ovum cells provided by our parentsAs such life precedes lifeWith regard to the origin of the first protoplasm of life or colloid scientists plead ignoranceAccording to Buddhism we are born from the matrix of actionParents merely provide an infinitesimally small cellAs such being precedes beingAt the moment of conception it is past Kamma that conditions the initial consciousness that vitalizes the fetusIt is this invisible Kammic energy generated from the past birth that produces mental phenomena and the phenomenon of life in an already extent physical phenomenon to complete the trio that constitutes manFor a being to be born here a being must die somewhereThe birth of a being which strictly means the arising of the five aggregates or psychophysical phenomena in this present life corresponds to the death of a being in a past life just as in conventional terms the rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in another placeThis enigmatic statement may be better understood by imagining life as a wave and not as a straight lineBirth and death are only two phases of the same processBirth precedes death and death on the other hand precedes birthThe constant succession of birth and death in connection with each individual life flux constitutes what is technically known as Samsara  recurrent wanderingWhat is the ultimate origin of lifeThe Buddha declaresWithout cognizable end is this SamsaraA first beginning of beings who obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving wander and fare on is not to be perceivedThis lifestream flows ad infinitum as long as it is fed by the muddy waters of ignorance and cravingWhen these two are completely cut off then only if one so wishes does the stream cease to flow rebirth ends as in the case of the Buddhas and ArahatsAn ultimate beginning of this lifestream cannot be determined as a stage cannot be perceived when this lifeforce was not fraught with ignorance and cravingThe Buddha has here referred merely to the beginning of the lifestream of living beingsIt is left to scientists to speculate on the origin and the evolution of the universeThe Buddha does not attempt to solve all the ethical and philosophical problems that perplex mankindNor does He deal with theories and speculations that tend neither to edification nor to enlightenmentNor does He demand blind faith from His adherentsHe is chiefly concerned with the problem of suffering and its destructionWith but this one practical and specific purpose in view all irrelevant side issues are completely ignoredBut how are we to believe that there is a past existenceThe most valuable evidence Buddhists cite in favor of rebirth is the Buddha for He developed a knowledge which enabled Him to read past and future livesFollowing His instructions His disciples also developed this knowledge and were able to read their past lives to a great extentEven some Indian Rishis before the advent of the Buddha were distinguished for such psychic powers as clairaudience clairvoyance thoughtreading remembering past births etcThere are also some persons who probably in accordance with the laws of association spontaneously develop the memory of their past birth and remember fragments of their previous livesSuch cases are very rare but those few wellattested respectable cases tend to throw some light on the idea of a past birthSo are the experiences of some modern dependable psychics and strange cases of alternating and multiple personalitiesIn hypnotic states some relate experiences of their past lives while a few others read the past lives of others and even heal diseasesSometimes we get strange experiences which cannot be explained but by rebirthHow often do we meet persons whom we have never met and yet instinctively feel that they are quite familiar to usHow often do we visit places and yet feel impressed that we are perfectly acquainted with those surroundingsThe Buddha tells usThrough previous associations or present advantage that old love springs up again like the lotus in the waterExperiences of some reliable modern psychics ghostly phenomena spirit communications strange alternating and multiple personalities and so on shed some light upon this problem of rebirthInto this world come Perfect Ones like the Buddhas and highly developed personalitiesDo they evolve suddenlyCan they be the products of a single existenceHow are we to account for great characters like Buddhaghosa Panini Kalidasa Homer and Plato men of genius like Shakespeare infant prodigies like Pascal Mozart Beethoven Raphael Ramanujan etcHeredity alone cannot account for themElse their ancestry would disclose it their posterity even greater than themselves demonstrate itCould they rise to such lofty heights if they had not lived noble lives and gained similar experiences in the pastIs it by mere chance that they are been born or those particular parents and placed under those favorable circumstancesThe few years that we are privileged to spend here or for the most five score years must certainly be an inadequate preparation for eternityIf one believes in the present and in the future it is quite logical to believe in the pastThe present is the offspring of the past and acts in turn as the parent of the futureIf there are reasons to believe that we have existed in the past then surely there are no reasons to disbelieve that we shall continue to exist after our present life has apparently ceasedIt is indeed a strong argument in favor of past and future lives that in this world virtuous persons are very often unfortunate and vicious persons prosperousA Western writer saysWhether we believe in a past existence or not it forms the only reasonable hypothesis which bridges certain gaps in human knowledge concerning certain facts of every day lifeOur reason tells us that this idea of past birth and Kamma alone can explain the degrees of difference that exist between twins how men like Shakespeare with a very limited experience are able to portray with marvelous exactitude the most diverse types of human character scenes and so forth of which they could have no actual knowledge why the work of the genius invariably transcends his experience the existence of infant precocity the vast diversity in mind and morals in brain and physique in conditions circumstances and environment observable throughout the world and so forthIt should be stated that this doctrine of rebirth can neither be proved nor disproved experimentally but it is accepted as an evidentially verifiable factThe cause of this Kamma continues the Buddha is avijja or ignorance of the Four Noble TruthsIgnorance is therefore the cause of birth and death and its transmutation into knowingness or vijja is consequently their cessationThe result of this analytical method is summed up in the Paticca SamuppadaPaticca means because of or dependent upon Samuppada arising or origination Paticca Samuppada therefore literally means  Dependent Arising or Dependent OriginationIt must be borne in mind that Paticca Samuppada is only a discourse on the process of birth and death and not a theory of the ultimate origin of lifeIt deals with the cause of rebirth and suffering but it does not in the least attempt to show the evolution of the world from primordial matterIgnorance is the first link or cause of the wheel of lifeIt clouds all right understandingDependent on ignorance of the Four Noble Truths arise activities  both moral and immoralThe activities whether good or bad rooted in ignorance which must necessarily have their due effects only tend to prolong lifes wanderingNevertheless good actions are essential to get rid of the ills of lifeDependent on activities arise rebirthconsciousnessThis links the past with the presentSimultaneous with the arising of rebirthconsciousness there come into being mind and bodyThe six senses are the inevitable consequences of mind and bodyBecause of the six senses contact sets inContact leads to feelingThese five  viz consciousness mind and matter six senses contact and feeling  are the effects of past actions and are called the passive side of lifeDependent on feeling arises cravingCraving results in graspingGrasping is the cause of Kamma which in its turn conditions future birthBirth is the inevitable cause of old age and deathIf on account of cause effect comes to be then if the cause ceases the effect also must ceaseThe reverse order of the Paticca Samuppada will make the matter clearOld age and death are possible in and with a psychophysical organismSuch an organism must be born therefore it presupposes birthBut birth is the inevitable result of past deeds or KammaKamma is conditioned by grasping which is due to cravingSuch craving can appear only where feeling existsFeeling is the outcome of contact between the senses and objectsTherefore it presupposes organs of senses which cannot exist without mind and bodyWhere there is a mind there is consciousnessIt is the result of past good and evilThe acquisition of good and evil is due to ignorance of things as they truly areThe whole formula may be summed up thusThus does the entire aggregate of suffering ariseThe first two of these twelve pertain to the past the middle eight to the present and the last two to the futureThe complete cessation of Ignorance leads to the cessation of ActivitiesThus does the cessation of this entire aggregate of suffering resultThis process of cause and effect continues ad infinitumThe beginning of this process cannot be determined as it is impossible to say whence this lifeflux was encompassed by nescienceBut when this nescience is turned into knowledge and the lifeflux is diverted into Nibbanadhatu then the end of the life process of Samsara comes aboutThis Buddhist doctrine of rebirth should be distinguished from the theory of reincarnation which implies the transmigration of a soul and its invariable material rebirthBuddhism denies the existence of an unchanging or eternal soul created by a God or emanating from a Divine EssenceIf the immortal soul which is supposed to be the essence of man is eternal there cannot be either a rise or a fallBesides one cannot understand why different souls are so variously constituted at the outsetTo prove the existence of endless felicity in an eternal heaven and unending torments in an eternal hell an immortal soul is absolutely necessaryOtherwise what is it that is punished in hell or rewarded in heavenIt should be said writes Bertrand Russell that the old distinction between soul and body has evaporated quite as much because matter has lost its solidity as mind has lost its spiritualityPsychology is just beginning to be scientificIn the present state of psychology belief in immortality can at any rate claim no support from scienceBuddhists do agree with Russell when he says there is obviously some reason in which I am the same person as I was yesterday and to take an even more obvious example if I simultaneously see a man and hear him speaking there is some sense in which the I that sees is the same as the I that hearsTill recently scientists believed in an indivisible and indestructible atomFor sufficient reasons physicists have reduced this atom to a series of eventsFor equally good reasons psychologists find that mind has not the identity of a single continuing thing but is a series of occurrences bound together by certain intimate relationsThe question of immortality therefore has become the question whether these intimate relations exist between occurrences connected with a living body and other occurrence which take place after that body is deadAs CEMJoad says in The Meaning of Life matter has since disintegrated under our very eyesIt is no longer solid it is no longer enduring it is no longer determined by compulsive causal laws and more important than all it is no longer knownThe socalled atoms it seems are both divisible and destructible The electrons and protons that compose atoms can meet and annihilate one another while their persistence such as it is is rather that of a wave lacking fixed boundaries and in process of continual change both as regards shape and position than that of a thingBishop Berkeley who showed that this socalled atom is a metaphysical fiction held that there exists a spiritual substance called the soulHume for instance looked into consciousness and perceived hat there was nothing except fleeting mental states and concluded that the supposed permanent ego is nonexistentThere are some philosophers he says who imagine we are every moment conscious of what we call ourself that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence and so we are certain both of its perfect identity and simplicityFor my part when I enter most intimately into what I call myself I always stumble on some particular perception or other  of heat or cold light or shade love or hatred pain or pleasureI never catch myself and never can observe anything but the perception nor do I conceive what is further requisite to make me a perfect nonentityBergson says All consciousness is time existence and a conscious state is not a state that endures without changingIt is a change without ceasing when change ceases it ceases it is itself nothing but changeDealing with this question of soul ProfJames says  The soultheory is a complete superfluity so far as accounting for the actually verified facts of conscious experience goesSo far no one can be compelled to subscribe to it for definite scientific reasons In concluding his interesting chapter on the soul he says And in this book the provisional solution which we have reached must be the final word the thoughts themselves are the thinkersWatson a distinguished psychologist states No one has ever touched a soul or has seen one in a test tube or has in any way come into relationship with it as he has with the other objects of his daily experienceNevertheless to doubt its existence is to become a heretic and once might possibly even had led to the loss of ones headEven today a man holding a public position dare not question itThe Buddha anticipated these facts some years agoAccording to Buddhism mind is nothing but a complex compound of fleeting mental statesOne unit of consciousness consists of three phases  arising or genesis static or development and cessation or dissolutionImmediately after the cessation stage of a thought moment there occurs the genesis stage of the subsequent thoughtmomentEach momentary consciousness of this everchanging lifeprocess on passing away transmits its whole energy all the indelibly recorded impressions to its successorEvery fresh consciousness consists of the potentialities of its predecessors together with something moreThere is therefore a continuous flow of consciousness like a stream without any interruptionThe subsequent thought moment is neither absolutely the same as its predecessor  since that which goes to make it up is not identical  nor entirely another  being the same continuity of Kamma energyHere there is no identical being but there is an identity in processEvery moment there is birth every moment there is deathThe arising of one thoughtmoment means the passing away of another thoughtmoment and vice versaIn the course of one lifetime there is momentary rebirth without a soulIt must not be understood that a consciousness is chopped up in bits and joined together like a train or a chainBut on the contrary it persistently flows on like a river receiving from the tributary streams of sense constant accretions to its flood and ever dispensing to the world without the thoughtstuff it has gathered by the way It has birth for its source and death for its mouthThe rapidity of the flow is such that hardly is there any standard whereby it can be measured even approximatelyHowever it pleases the commentators to say that the time duration of one thoughtmoment is even less than onebillionth part of the time occupied by a flash of lightningHere we find a juxtaposition of such fleeting mental states of consciousness opposed to a superposition of such states as some appear to believeNo state once gone ever recurs nor is identical with what goes beforeBut we worldlings veiled by the web of illusion mistake this apparent continuity to be something eternal and go to the extent of introducing an unchanging soul an Atta the supposed doer and receptacle of all actions to this everchanging consciousnessThe socalled being is like a flash of lightning that is resolved into a succession of sparks that follow upon one another with such rapidity that the human retina cannot perceive them separately nor can the uninstructed conceive of such succession of separate sparks As the wheel of a cart rests on the ground at one point so does the being live only for one thoughtmomentIt is always in the present and is ever slipping into the irrevocable pastWhat we shall become is determined by this present thoughtmomentIf there is no soul what is it that is reborn one might askWell there is nothing to be rebornWhen life ceases the Kammic energy rematerializes itself in another formAs Bhikkhu Silacara says Unseen it passes whithersoever the conditions appropriate to its visible manifestation are presentHere showing itself as a tiny gnat or worm there making its presence known in the dazzling magnificence of a Deva or an Archangels existenceWhen one mode of its manifestation ceases it merely passes on and where suitable circumstances offer reveals itself afresh in another name or formBirth is the arising of the psychophysical phenomenaDeath is merely the temporary end of a temporary phenomenonJust as the arising of a physical state is conditioned by a preceding state as its cause so the appearance of psychophysical phenomena is conditioned by cause anterior to its birthAs the process of one lifespan is possible without a permanent entity passing from one thoughtmoment to another so a series of lifeprocesses is possible without an immortal soul to transmigrate from one existence to anotherBuddhism does not totally deny the existence of a personality in an empirical senseIt only attempts to show that it does not exist in an ultimate senseThe Buddhist philosophical term for an individual is Santana ie a flux or a continuityIt includes the mental and physical elements as wellThe Kammic force of each individual binds the elements togetherThis uninterrupted flux or continuity of psychophysical phenomenon which is conditioned by Kamma and not limited only to the present life but having its source in the beginningless past and its continuation in the future  is the Buddhist substitute for the permanent ego or the immortal soul of other religionsThis process of birth and death continues ad infinitum until this flux is transmuted so to say to Nibbanadhatu the ultimate goal of BuddhistsThe Pali word Nibbana is formed of Ni and VanaNi is a negative particle and Vana means lusting or cravingIt is called Nibbana in that it is a departure from the craving which is called Vana lusting Literally Nibbana means nonattachmentIt may also be defined as the extinction of lust hatred and ignorance The whole world is in flames says the BuddhaBy what fire is it kindledBy the fire of lust hatred and ignorance by the fire of birth old age death pain lamentation sorrow grief and despair it is kindledIt should not be understood that Nibbana is a state of nothingness or annihilation owing to the fact that we cannot perceive it with our worldly knowledgeOne cannot say that there exists no light just because the blind man does not see itIn that well known story too the fish arguing with his friend the turtle triumphantly concluded that there exists no landNibbana of the Buddhists is neither a mere nothingness nor a state of annihilation but what it is no words can adequately expressNibbana is a Dhamma which is unborn unoriginated uncreated and unformed Hence it is eternal desirable and happyIn Nibbana nothing is eternalized nor is anything annihilated besides sufferingAccording to the Books references are made to Nibbana as Sopadisesa and AnupadisesaThese in fact are not two kinds of Nibbana but the one single Nibbana receiving its name according to the way it is experienced before and after deathNibbana is not situated in any place nor is it a sort of heaven where a transcendental ego residesIt is a state which is dependent upon this body itselfIt is an attainment which is within the reach of allNibbana is a supramundane state attainable even in this present lifeBuddhism does not state that this ultimate goal could be reached only in a life beyondHere lies the chief difference between the Buddhist conception of Nibbana and the nonBuddhist conception of an eternal heaven attainable only after death or a union with a God or Divine Essence in an afterlifeWhen Nibbana is realized in this life with the body remaining it is called Sopadisesa NibbanadhatuWhen an arahant attains Parinibbana after the dissolution of his body without any remainder of physical existence it is called Anupadisesa NibbanadhatuIn the words of Sir Edwin ArnoldFrom a metaphysical standpoint Nibbana is deliverance from sufferingFrom a psychological standpoint Nibbana is the eradication of egoismFrom an ethical standpoint Nibbana is the destruction of lust hatred and ignoranceDoes the arahant exist or not after deathThe Buddha repliesThe arahant who has been released from the five aggregates is deep immeasurable like the mighty oceanTo say that he is reborn would not fit the caseTo say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the caseOne cannot say that an arahant is reborn as all passions that condition rebirth are eradicated nor can one say that the arahant is annihilated for there is nothing to annihilateRobert Oppenheimer a scientist writesIf we ask for instance whether the position of the electron remains the same we must say no if we ask whether the electrons position changes with time we must say no if we ask whether the electron is at rest we must say no if we ask whether it is in motion we must say noThe Buddha has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of mans self after death but they are not familiar answers from the tradition of the th and th century scienceHow is Nibbana to be attainedIt is by following the Noble Eightfold Path which consists of Right Understanding Right Thoughts Right Speech Right Actions Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right ConcentrationRight Understanding which is the keynote of Buddhism is explained as the knowledge of the four Noble TruthsTo understand rightly means to understand things as they really are and not as they appear to beThis refers primarily to a correct understanding of oneself because as the Rohitassa Sutta states Dependent on this onefathom long body with its consciousness are all the four TruthsIn the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path Right Understanding stands at the beginning as well as at its endA minimum degree of Right Understanding is necessary at the very beginning because it gives the right motivations to the other seven factors of the Path and gives to them correct directionAt the culmination of the practice Right Understanding has matured into perfect Insight Wisdom leading directly to the Stages of SainthoodClear vision of right understanding leads to clear thinkingThe second factor of the Noble Eightfold Path is therefore Right Thoughts which serves the double purpose of eliminating evil thoughts and developing pure thoughtsRight Thoughts in this particular connection are three foldThey consist ofRight Thoughts lead to Right Speech the third factorThis includes abstinence from falsehood slandering harsh words and frivolous talkRight Speech must be followed by Right Action which comprises abstinence from killing stealing and sexual misconductPurifying his thoughts words and deeds at the outset the spiritual pilgrim tries to purify his livelihood by refraining from the five kinds of trade which are forbidden to a laydiscipleThey are trading in arms human beings animals for slaughter intoxicating drinks and drugs and poisonsFor monks wrong livelihood consists of hypocritical conduct and wrong means of obtaining the requisites of monklifeRight Effort is fourfold namelyRight Mindfulness is constant mindfulness with regard to body feelings thoughts and mindobjectsRight Effort and Right Mindfulness lead to Right ConcentrationIt is the onepointedness of mind culminating in the Jhanas or meditative absorptionsOf these eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path the first two are grouped under the heading of Wisdom the following three under Morality and the last three under ConcentrationBut according to the order of development the sequence is as followsMorality is the first stage on this path to NibbanaWithout killing or causing injury to any living creature man should be kind and compassionate towards all even to the tiniest creature that crawls at his feetRefraining from stealing he should be upright and honest in all his dealingsAbstaining from sexual misconduct which debases the exalted nature of man he should be pureShunning false speech he should be truthfulAvoiding pernicious drinks that promote heedlessness he should be sober and diligentThese elementary principles of regulated behavior are essential to one who treads the path to NibbanaViolation of them means the introduction of obstacles on the path which will obstruct his moral progressObservance of them means steady and smooth progress along the pathThe spiritual pilgrim disciplining thus his words and deeds may advance a step further and try to control his sensesWhile he progresses slowly and steadily with regulated word and deed and restrained senses the Kammic force of this striving aspirant may compel him to renounce worldly pleasures and adopt the ascetic lifeTo him then comes the idea thatIt should not be understood that everyone is expected to lead the life of a Bhikkhu or a celibate life to achieve ones goalOnes spiritual progress is expedited by being a Bhikkhu although as a lay follower one can become an arahantAfter attaining the third state of Sainthood one leads a life of celibacySecuring a firm footing on the ground of morality the progressing pilgrim then embarks upon the higher practice of Samadhi the control and culture of the mind  the second stage on this PathSamadhi  is the onepointedness of the mind It is the concentration of the mind on one object to the entire exclusion of all irrelevant matterThere are different subjects for meditation according to the temperaments of the individualsConcentration on respiration is the easiest to gain the onepointedness of the mindMeditation on lovingkindness is very beneficial as it is conducive to mental peace and happinessCultivation of the four sublime states  lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity  is highly commendableAfter giving careful consideration to the subject for contemplation he should choose the one most suited to his temperamentThis being satisfactorily settled he makes a persistent effort to focus his mind until he becomes so wholly absorbed and interested in it that all other thoughts get ipso facto excluded from the mindThe five hindrances to progress  namely sensedesire hatred sloth and torpor restlessness and brooding and doubts are then temporarily inhibitedEventually he gains ecstatic concentration and to his indescribable joy becomes enwrapt in Jhana enjoying the calmness and serenity of a onepointed mindWhen one gains this perfect onepointedness of the mind it is possible for one to develop the five Supernormal Powers Divine Eye Divine Ear Reminiscence of past birthsThought Reading and different Psychic PowersIt must not be understood that those supernormal powers are essential for SainthoodThough the mind is now purified there still lies dormant in him the tendency to give vent to his passions for by concentration passions are lulled to sleep temporarilyThey may rise to the surface at unexpected momentsBoth Discipline and Concentration are helpful to clear the Path of its obstacles but it is Insight alone which enables one to see things as they truly are and consequently reach the ultimate goal by completely annihilating the passions inhibited by SamadhiThis is the third and the final stage on the Path of NibbanaWith his onepointed mind which now resembles a polished mirror he looks at the world to get a correct view of lifeWherever he turns his eyes he sees nought but the Three Characteristics  Anicca Dukkha and anatta standing out in bold reliefHe comprehends that life is constantly changing and all conditioned things are transientNeither in heaven nor on earth does he find any genuine happiness for every form of pleasure is a prelude to painWhat is transient is therefore painful and where change and sorrow prevail there cannot be a permanent immortal soulWhereupon of these three characteristics he chooses one that appeals to him most and intently keeps on developing Insight in that particular direction until that glorious day comes to him when he would realize Nibbana for the first time in his life having destroyed the three Fetters  selfillusion doubts indulgence in rites and ceremoniesAt this stage he is called a Sotapanna  one who has entered the stream that leads to NibbanaAs he has not eradicated all Fetters he is reborn seven times at the mostSummoning up fresh courage as a result of this glimpse of Nibbana the Pilgrim makes rapid progress and cultivating deeper Insight becomes a Sakadagami by weakening two more Fetters  namely Sensedesire and illwillHe is called a Sakadagami because he is reborn on earth only once in case he does not attain ArhatshipIt is in the third state of Sainthood  Anagama that he completely discards the aforesaid two FettersThereafter he neither returns to this world nor does he seek birth in the celestial realms since he has no more desire for sensual pleasuresAfter death he is reborn in the Pure Abodes a congenial Brahma plane till he attains ArhatshipNow the saintly pilgrim encouraged by the unprecedented success of his endeavors makes his final advance and destroying the remaining Fetters  namely lust after life in Realms of Forms and Formless Realms conceit restlessness and ignorance  becomes a perfect Saint an arahant a Worthy OneInstantly he realizes that what was to be accomplished has been done that a heavy burden of sorrow has been relinquished that all forms of attachment have been totally annihilated and that the Path to Nibbana has been troddenThe Worthy One now stands on heights more than celestial far removed from the rebellious passions and defilements of the world realizing the unutterable bliss of Nibbana and like many an arahant of old uttering that paean of joyAs THHuxley states  Buddhism is a system which knows no God in the Western sense which denies a soul to man which counts the belief in immortality a blunder which refuses any efficacy to prayer and sacrifice which bids men to look to nothing but their own efforts for salvation which in its original purity knew nothing of vows of obedience and never sought the aid of the secular arm yet spread over a considerable moiety of the world with marvelous rapidity  and is still the dominant creed of a large fraction of mankindAnapana Sati is mindfulness on respirationAna means inhalation and Apana exhalationConcentration on the breathing process leads to onepointedness of the mind and ultimately to Insight which enables one to attain Sainthood or ArhatshipThe Buddha also practiced concentration on respiration before He attained EnlightenmentThis harmless concentration may be practiced by any person irrespective of religious beliefsAdopting a convenient posture keep the body erectPlace the right hand over the left handEyes may be closed or halfclosedEasterners generally sit crosslegged with the body erectThey sit placing the right foot on the left thigh and the left foot on the right thighThis is the full positionSometimes they adopt the half position that is by simply placing the right foot on the left thigh or the left foot on the right thighWhen the triangular position is assumed the whole body is wellbalancedThose who find the crosslegged posture too difficult may sit comfortably in a chair or any other support sufficiently high to rest the legs on the groundIt is of no importance which posture one may adopt provided the position is easy and relaxedHead should not be droopingNeck should be straightened so that the nose may be in a perpendicular line with the navelBuddhas usually adopt the full lotus positionThey sit with half closed eyes looking not more than a distance of three and half feetBefore the practice bad air from the lungs should be breathed out slowly through the mouth and then the mouth should be closedNow inhale through the nostrils normally without strain without forceMentally count oneExhale and count twoInhale and count threeCount up to ten constantly concentrating on the breathing process without thinking of anything elseWhile doing so ones mind may wanderBut one need not be discouragedGradually one may increase the number of series  say five series of tenLater one may inhale and pause for a moment concentrating merely on inhalation without countingExhale and pause for a momentThus inhale and exhale concentrating on respirationSome prefer counting as it aide concentration while others prefer not to countWhat is essential is concentration and not counting which is secondaryWhen one practices this concentration one feels very peaceful light in mind and bodyAfter practicing for a certain period a day might come when one may realize that this socalled body is supported by mere breath and that body perishes when breathing ceasesOne fully realizes impermanenceWhere there is change there cannot be a permanent entity or an immortal soulInsight can then be developed to attain ArhatshipIt is clear that the object of this concentration on respiration is not merely to gain onepointedness but also to cultivate Insight to obtain deliverance from sufferingIn some discourses this simple and harmless method of respiration is described as followsMindfully he inhales mindfully he exhalesWhen making a long inhalation he knows I make a long inhalation when making a long exhalation he knows I make a long exhalationWhen making a short inhalation he knows  I make a short inhalation when making a short exhalation he knows I make a short exhalationClearly perceiving the entire breathing process I will inhale thus he trains himself clearly perceiving the entire breathing process I will exhale thus he trains himselfCalming the respiration I will inhale thus he trains himself

Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe essence of the Buddhas teaching can be summed up in two principles the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold PathThe first covers the side of doctrine and the primary response it elicits is understanding the second covers the side of discipline in the broadest sense of that word and the primary response it calls for is practiceIn the structure of the teaching these two principles lock together into an indivisible unity called the dhammavinaya the doctrineanddiscipline or in brief the DhammaThe internal unity of the Dhamma is guaranteed by the fact that the last of the Four Noble Truths the truth of the way is the Noble Eightfold Path while the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path right view is the understanding of the Four Noble TruthsThus the two principles penetrate and include one another the formula of the Four Noble Truths containing the Eightfold Path and the Noble Eightfold Path containing the Four TruthsGiven this integral unity it would be pointless to pose the question which of the two aspects of the Dhamma has greater value the doctrine or the pathBut if we did risk the pointless by asking that question the answer would have to be the pathThe path claims primacy because it is precisely this that brings the teaching to lifeThe path translates the Dhamma from a collection of abstract formulas into a continually unfolding disclosure of truthIt gives an outlet from the problem of suffering with which the teaching startsAnd it makes the teachings goal liberation from suffering accessible to us in our own experience where alone it takes on authentic meaningTo follow the Noble Eightfold Path is a matter of practice rather than intellectual knowledge but to apply the path correctly it has to be properly understoodIn fact right understanding of the path is itself a part of the practiceIt is a facet of right view the first path factor the forerunner and guide for the rest of the pathThus though initial enthusiasm might suggest that the task of intellectual comprehension may be shelved as a bothersome distraction mature consideration reveals it to be quite essential to ultimate success in the practiceThe present book aims at contributing towards a proper understanding of the Noble Eightfold Path by investigating its eight factors and their components to determine exactly what they involveI have attempted to be concise using as the framework for exposition the Buddhas own words in explanation of the path factors as found in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali canonTo assist the reader with limited access to primary sources even in translation I have tried to confine my selection of quotations as much as possible to those found in Venerable Nyanatilokas classic anthology The Word of the BuddhaIn some cases passages taken from that work have been slightly modified to accord with my own preferred renderingsFor further amplification of meaning I have sometimes drawn upon the commentaries especially in my accounts of concentration and wisdom I have relied heavily on the Visuddhimagga a vast encyclopedic work which systematizes the practice of the path in a detailed and comprehensive mannerLimitations of space prevent an exhaustive treatment of each factorTo compensate for this deficiency I have included a list of recommended readings at the end which the reader may consult for more detailed explanations of individual path factorsFor full commitment to the practice of the path however especially in its advanced stages of concentration and insight it will be extremely helpful to have contact with a properly qualified teacherTextual references have been abbreviated as followsReferences to Vismare to the chapter and section number of the translation by Bhikkhu anamoli The Path of Purification The search for a spiritual path is born out of sufferingIt does not start with lights and ecstasy but with the hard tacks of pain disappointment and confusionHowever for suffering to give birth to a genuine spiritual search it must amount to more than something passively received from withoutIt has to trigger an inner realization a perception which pierces through the facile complacency of our usual encounter with the world to glimpse the insecurity perpetually gaping underfootWhen this insight dawns even if only momentarily it can precipitate a profound personal crisisIt overturns accustomed goals and values mocks our routine preoccupations leaves old enjoyments stubbornly unsatisfyingAt first such changes generally are not welcomeWe try to deny our vision and to smother our doubts we struggle to drive away the discontent with new pursuitsBut the flame of inquiry once lit continues to burn and if we do not let ourselves be swept away by superficial readjustments or slouch back into a patched up version of our natural optimism eventually the original glimmering of insight will again flare up again confront us with our essential plightIt is precisely at that point with all escape routes blocked that we are ready to seek a way to bring our disquietude to an endNo longer can we continue to drift complacently through life driven blindly by our hunger for sense pleasures and by the pressure of prevailing social normsA deeper reality beckons us we have heard the call of a more stable more authentic happiness and until we arrive at our destination we cannot rest contentBut it is just then that we find ourselves facing a new difficultyOnce we come to recognize the need for a spiritual path we discover that spiritual teachings are by no means homogeneous and mutually compatibleWhen we browse through the shelves of humanitys spiritual heritage both ancient and contemporary we do not find a single tidy volume but a veritable bazaar of spiritual systems and disciplines each offering themselves to us as the highest the fastest the most powerful or the most profound solution to our quest for the UltimateConfronted with this melange we fall into confusion trying to size them up  to decide which is truly liberative a real solution to our needs and which is a sidetrack beset with hidden flawsOne approach to resolving this problem that is popular today is the eclectic one to pick and choose from the various traditions whatever seems amenable to our needs welding together different practices and techniques into a synthetic whole that is personally satisfyingThus one may combine Buddhist mindfulness meditation with sessions of Hindu mantra recitation Christian prayer with Sufi dancing Jewish Kabbala with Tibetan visualization exercisesEclecticism however though sometimes helpful in making a transition from a predominantly worldly and materialistic way of life to one that takes on a spiritual hue eventually wears thinWhile it makes a comfortable halfway house it is not comfortable as a final vehicleThere are two interrelated flaws in eclecticism that account for its ultimate inadequacyOne is that eclecticism compromises the very traditions it draws uponThe great spiritual traditions themselves do not propose their disciplines as independent techniques that may be excised from their setting and freely recombined to enhance the felt quality of our livesThey present them rather as parts of an integral whole of a coherent vision regarding the fundamental nature of reality and the final goal of the spiritual questA spiritual tradition is not a shallow stream in which one can wet ones feet and then beat a quick retreat to the shoreIt is a mighty tumultuous river which would rush through the entire landscape of ones life and if one truly wishes to travel on it one must be courageous enough to launch ones boat and head out for the depthsThe second defect in eclecticism follows from the firstAs spiritual practices are built upon visions regarding the nature of reality and the final good these visions are not mutually compatibleWhen we honestly examine the teachings of these traditions we will find that major differences in perspective reveal themselves to our sight differences which cannot be easily dismissed as alternative ways of saying the same thingRather they point to very different experiences constituting the supreme goal and the path that must be trodden to reach that goalHence because of the differences in perspectives and practices that the different spiritual traditions propose once we decide that we have outgrown eclecticism and feel that we are ready to make a serious commitment to one particular path we find ourselves confronted with the challenge of choosing a path that will lead us to true enlightenment and liberationOne cue to resolving this dilemma is to clarify to ourselves our fundamental aim to determine what we seek in a genuinely liberative pathIf we reflect carefully it will become clear that the prime requirement is a way to the end of sufferingAll problems ultimately can be reduced to the problem of suffering thus what we need is a way that will end this problem finally and completelyBoth these qualifying words are importantThe path has to lead to a complete end of suffering to an end of suffering in all its forms and to a final end of suffering to bring suffering to an irreversible stopBut here we run up against another questionHow are we to find such a path  a path which has the capacity to lead us to the full and final end of sufferingUntil we actually follow a path to its goal we cannot know with certainty where it leads and in order to follow a path to its goal we must place complete trust in the efficacy of the pathThe pursuit of a spiritual path is not like selecting a new suit of clothesTo select a new suit one need only try on a number of suits inspect oneself in the mirror and select the suit in which one appears most attractiveThe choice of a spiritual path is closer to marriage one wants a partner for life one whose companionship will prove as trustworthy and durable as the pole star in the night skyFaced with this new dilemma we may think that we have reached a dead end and conclude that we have nothing to guide us but personal inclination if not a flip of the coinHowever our selection need not be as blind and uninformed as we imagine for we do have a guideline to help usSince spiritual paths are generally presented in the framework of a total teaching we can evaluate the effectiveness of any particular path by investigating the teaching which expounds itIn making this investigation we can look to three criteria as standards for evaluationFirst the teaching has to give a full and accurate picture of the range of sufferingIf the picture of suffering it gives is incomplete or defective then the path it sets forth will most likely be flawed unable to yield a satisfactory solutionJust as an ailing patient needs a doctor who can make a full and correct diagnosis of his illness so in seeking release from suffering we need a teaching that presents a reliable account of our conditionThe second criterion calls for a correct analysis of the causes giving rise to sufferingThe teaching cannot stop with a survey of the outward symptomsIt has to penetrate beneath the symptoms to the level of causes and to describe those causes accuratelyIf a teaching makes a faulty causal analysis there is little likelihood that its treatment will succeedThe third criterion pertains directly to the path itselfIt stipulates that the path which the teaching offers has to remove suffering at its sourceThis means it must provide a method to cut off suffering by eradicating its causesIf it fails to bring about this rootlevel solution its value is ultimately nilThe path it prescribes might help to remove symptoms and make us feel that all is well but one afflicted with a fatal disease cannot afford to settle for cosmetic surgery when below the surface the cause of his malady continues to thriveTo sum up we find three requirements for a teaching proposing to offer a true path to the end of suffering first it has to set forth a full and accurate picture of the range of suffering second it must present a correct analysis of the causes of suffering and third it must give us the means to eradicate the causes of sufferingThis is not the place to evaluate the various spiritual disciplines in terms of these criteriaOur concern is only with the Dhamma the teaching of the Buddha and with the solution this teaching offers to the problem of sufferingThat the teaching should be relevant to this problem is evident from its very nature for it is formulated not as a set of doctrines about the origin and end of things commanding belief but as a message of deliverance from suffering claiming to be verifiable in our own experienceAlong with that message there comes a method of practice a way leading to the end of sufferingThis way is the Noble Eightfold PathThe Eightfold Path stands at the very heart of the Buddhas teachingIt was the discovery of the path that gave the Buddhas own enlightenment a universal significance and elevated him from the status of a wise and benevolent sage to that of a world teacherTo his own disciples he was preeminently the arouser of the path unarisen before the producer of the path not produced before the declarer of the path not declared before the knower of the path the seer of the path the guide along the pathAnd he himself invites the seeker with the promise and challenge You yourselves must striveThe Buddhas are only teachersThe meditative ones who practice the path are released from the bonds of evilTo see the Noble Eightfold Path as a viable vehicle to liberation we have to check it out against our three criteria to look at the Buddhas account of the range of suffering his analysis of its causes and the programme he offers as a remedyThe Buddha does not merely touch the problem of suffering tangentially he makes it rather the very cornerstone of his teachingHe starts the Four Noble Truths that sum up his message with the announcement that life is inseparably tied to something he calls dukkhaThe Pali word is often translated as suffering but it means something deeper than pain and miseryIt refers to a basic unsatisfactoriness running through our lives the lives of all but the enlightenedSometimes this unsatisfactoriness erupts into the open as sorrow grief disappointment or despair but usually it hovers at the edge of our awareness as a vague unlocalized sense that things are never quite perfect never fully adequate to our expectations of what they should beThis fact of dukkha the Buddha says is the only real spiritual problemThe other problems  the theological and metaphysical questions that have taunted religious thinkers through the centuries  he gently waves aside as matters not tending to liberation What he teaches he says is just suffering and the ending of suffering dukkha and its cessationThe Buddha does not stop with generalitiesHe goes on to expose the different forms that dukkha takes both the evident and the subtleHe starts with what is close at hand with the suffering inherent in the physical process of life itselfHere dukkha shows up in the events of birth aging and death in our susceptibility to sickness accidents and injuries even in hunger and thirstIt appears again in our inner reactions to disagreeable situations and events in the sorrow anger frustration and fear aroused by painful separations by unpleasant encounters by the failure to get what we wantEven our pleasures the Buddha says are not immune from dukkhaThey give us happiness while they last but they do not last forever eventually they must pass away and when they go the loss leaves us feeling deprivedOur lives for the most part are strung out between the thirst for pleasure and the fear of painWe pass our days running after the one and running away from the other seldom enjoying the peace of contentment real satisfaction seems somehow always out of reach just beyond the next horizonThen in the end we have to die to give up the identity we spent our whole life building to leave behind everything and everyone we loveBut even death the Buddha teaches does not bring us to the end of dukkha for the life process does not stop with deathWhen life ends in one place with one body the mental continuum the individual stream of consciousness springs up again elsewhere with a new body as its physical supportThus the cycle goes on over and over  birth aging and death  driven by the thirst for more existenceThe Buddha declares that this round of rebirths  called samsara the wandering  has been turning through beginningless timeIt is without a first point without temporal originNo matter how far back in time we go we always find living beings  ourselves in previous lives  wandering from one state of existence to anotherThe Buddha describes various realms where rebirth can take place realms of torment the animal realm the human realm realms of celestial blissBut none of these realms can offer a final refugeLife in any plane must come to an endIt is impermanent and thus marked with that insecurity which is the deepest meaning of dukkhaFor this reason one aspiring to the complete end of dukkha cannot rest content with any mundane achievement with any status but must win emancipation from the entire unstable whirlA teaching proposing to lead to the end of suffering must as we said give a reliable account of its causal originationFor if we want to put a stop to suffering we have to stop it where it begins with its causesTo stop the causes requires a thorough knowledge of what they are and how they work thus the Buddha devotes a sizeable section of his teaching to laying bare the truth of the origin of dukkha The origin he locates within ourselves in a fundamental malady that permeates our being causing disorder in our own minds and vitiating our relationships with others and with the worldThe sign of this malady can be seen in our proclivity to certain unwholesome mental states called in Pali kilesas usually translated defilements The most basic defilements are the triad of greed aversion and delusionGreed is selfcentered desire the desire for pleasure and possessions the drive for survival the urge to bolster the sense of ego with power status and prestigeAversion signifies the response of negation expressed as rejection irritation condemnation hatred enmity anger and violenceDelusion means mental darkness the thick coat of insensitivity which blocks out clear understandingFrom these three roots emerge the various other defilements  conceit jealousy ambition lethargy arrogance and the rest  and from all these defilements together the roots and the branches comes dukkha in its diverse forms as pain and sorrow as fear and discontent as the aimless drifting through the round of birth and deathTo gain freedom from suffering therefore we have to eliminate the defilementsBut the work of removing the defilements has to proceed in a methodical wayIt cannot be accomplished simply by an act of will by wanting them to go awayThe work must be guided by investigationWe have to find out what the defilements depend upon and then see how it lies within our power to remove their supportThe Buddha teaches that there is one defilement which gives rise to all the others one root which holds them all in placeThis root is ignoranceIgnorance is not mere absence of knowledge a lack of knowing particular pieces of informationIgnorance can coexist with a vast accumulation of itemized knowledge and in its own way it can be tremendously shrewd and resourcefulAs the basic root of dukkha ignorance is a fundamental darkness shrouding the mindSometimes this ignorance operates in a passive manner merely obscuring correct understandingAt other times it takes on an active role it becomes the great deceiver conjuring up a mass of distorted perceptions and conceptions which the mind grasps as attributes of the world unaware that they are its own deluded constructsIn these erroneous perceptions and ideas we find the soil that nurtures the defilementsThe mind catches sight of some possibility of pleasure accepts it at face value and the result is greedOur hunger for gratification is thwarted obstacles appear and up spring anger and aversionOr we struggle over ambiguities our sight clouds and we become lost in delusionWith this we discover the breeding ground of dukkha ignorance issuing in the defilements the defilements issuing in sufferingAs long as this causal matrix stands we are not yet beyond dangerWe might still find pleasure and enjoyment  sense pleasures social pleasures pleasures of the mind and heartBut no matter how much pleasure we might experience no matter how successful we might be at dodging pain the basic problem remains at the core of our being and we continue to move within the bounds of dukkhaTo free ourselves from suffering fully and finally we have to eliminate it by the root and that means to eliminate ignoranceBut how does one go about eliminating ignoranceThe answer follows clearly from the nature of the adversarySince ignorance is a state of not knowing things as they really are what is needed is knowledge of things as they really areNot merely conceptual knowledge knowledge as idea but perceptual knowledge a knowing which is also a seeingThis kind of knowing is called wisdomWisdom helps to correct the distorting work of ignoranceIt enables us to grasp things as they are in actuality directly and immediately free from the screen of ideas views and assumptions our minds ordinarily set up between themselves and the realTo eliminate ignorance we need wisdom but how is wisdom to be acquiredAs indubitable knowledge of the ultimate nature of things wisdom cannot be gained by mere learning by gathering and accumulating a battery of factsHowever the Buddha says wisdom can be cultivatedIt comes into being through a set of conditions conditions which we have the power to developThese conditions are actually mental factors components of consciousness which fit together into a systematic structure that can be called a path in the words essential meaning a courseway for movement leading to a goalThe goal here is the end of suffering and the path leading to it is the Noble Eightfold Path with its eight factors right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThe Buddha calls this path the middle wayIt is the middle way because it steers clear of two extremes two misguided attempts to gain release from sufferingOne is the extreme of indulgence in sense pleasures the attempt to extinguish dissatisfaction by gratifying desireThis approach gives pleasure but the enjoyment won is gross transitory and devoid of deep contentmentThe Buddha recognized that sensual desire can exercise a tight grip over the minds of human beings and he was keenly aware of how ardently attached people become to the pleasures of the sensesBut he also knew that this pleasure is far inferior to the happiness that arises from renunciation and therefore he repeatedly taught that the way to the Ultimate eventually requires the relinquishment of sensual desireThus the Buddha describes the indulgence in sense pleasures as low common worldly ignoble not leading to the goalThe other extreme is the practice of selfmortification the attempt to gain liberation by afflicting the bodyThis approach may stem from a genuine aspiration for deliverance but it works within the compass of a wrong assumption that renders the energy expended barren of resultsThe error is taking the body to be the cause of bondage when the real source of trouble lies in the mind  the mind obsessed by greed aversion and delusionTo rid the mind of these defilements the affliction of the body is not only useless but selfdefeating for it is the impairment of a necessary instrumentThus the Buddha describes this second extreme as painful ignoble not leading to the goalAloof from these two extreme approaches is the Noble Eightfold Path called the middle way not in the sense that it effects a compromise between the extremes but in the sense that it transcends them both by avoiding the errors that each involvesThe path avoids the extreme of sense indulgence by its recognition of the futility of desire and its stress on renunciationDesire and sensuality far from being means to happiness are springs of suffering to be abandoned as the requisite of deliveranceBut the practice of renunciation does not entail the tormenting of the bodyIt consists in mental training and for this the body must be fit a sturdy support for the inward workThus the body is to be looked after well kept in good health while the mental faculties are trained to generate the liberating wisdomThat is the middle way the Noble Eightfold Path which gives rise to vision gives rise to knowledge and leads to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaThe eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path are not steps to be followed in sequence one after anotherThey can be more aptly described as components rather than as steps comparable to the intertwining strands of a single cable that requires the contributions of all the strands for maximum strengthWith a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously each supporting the othersHowever until that point is reached some sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitableConsidered from the standpoint of practical training the eight path factors divide into three groups the moral discipline group made up of right speech right action and right livelihood the concentration group made up of right effort right mindfulness and right concentration and the wisdom group made up of right view and right intentionThese three groups represent three stages of training the training in the higher moral discipline the training in the higher consciousness and the training in the higher wisdomThe order of the three trainings is determined by the overall aim and direction of the pathSince the final goal to which the path leads liberation from suffering depends ultimately on uprooting ignorance the climax of the path must be the training directly opposed to ignoranceThis is the training in wisdom designed to awaken the faculty of penetrative understanding which sees things as they really are Wisdom unfolds by degrees but even the faintest flashes of insight presuppose as their basis a mind that has been concentrated cleared of disturbance and distractionConcentration is achieved through the training in the higher consciousness the second division of the path which brings the calm and collectedness needed to develop wisdomBut in order for the mind to be unified in concentration a check must be placed on the unwholesome dispositions which ordinarily dominate its workings since these dispositions disperse the beam of attention and scatter it among a multitude of concernsThe unwholesome dispositions continue to rule as long as they are permitted to gain expression through the channels of body and speech as bodily and verbal deedsTherefore at the very outset of training it is necessary to restrain the faculties of action to prevent them from becoming tools of the defilementsThis task is accomplished by the first division of the path the training in moral disciplineThus the path evolves through its three stages with moral discipline as the foundation for concentration concentration the foundation for wisdom and wisdom the direct instrument for reaching liberationPerplexity sometimes arises over an apparent inconsistency in the arrangement of the path factors and the threefold trainingWisdom  which includes right view and right intention  is the last stage in the threefold training yet its factors are placed at the beginning of the path rather than at its end as might be expected according to the canon of strict consistencyThe sequence of the path factors however is not the result of a careless slip but is determined by an important logistical consideration namely that right view and right intention of a preliminary type are called for at the outset as the spur for entering the threefold trainingRight view provides the perspective for practice right intention the sense of directionBut the two do not expire in this preparatory roleFor when the mind has been refined by the training in moral discipline and concentration it arrives at a superior right view and right intention which now form the proper training in the higher wisdomRight view is the forerunner of the entire path the guide for all the other factorsIt enables us to understand our starting point our destination and the successive landmarks to pass as practice advancesTo attempt to engage in the practice without a foundation of right view is to risk getting lost in the futility of undirected movementDoing so might be compared to wanting to drive someplace without consulting a roadmap or listening to the suggestions of an experienced driverOne might get into the car and start to drive but rather than approaching closer to ones destination one is more likely to move farther away from itTo arrive at the desired place one has to have some idea of its general direction and of the roads leading to itAnalogous considerations apply to the practice of the path which takes place in a framework of understanding established by right viewThe importance of right view can be gauged from the fact that our perspectives on the crucial issues of reality and value have a bearing that goes beyond mere theoretical convictionsThey govern our attitudes our actions our whole orientation to existenceOur views might not be clearly formulated in our mind we might have only a hazy conceptual grasp of our beliefsBut whether formulated or not expressed or maintained in silence these views have a farreaching influenceThey structure our perceptions order our values crystallize into the ideational framework through which we interpret to ourselves the meaning of our being in the worldThese views then condition actionThey lie behind our choices and goals and our efforts to turn these goals from ideals into actualityThe actions themselves might determine consequences but the actions along with their consequences hinge on the views from which they springSince views imply an ontological commitment a decision on the question of what is real and true it follows that views divide into two classes right views and wrong viewsThe former correspond to what is real the latter deviate from the real and confirm the false in its placeThese two different kinds of views the Buddha teaches lead to radically disparate lines of action and thence to opposite resultsIf we hold a wrong view even if that view is vague it will lead us towards courses of action that eventuate in sufferingOn the other hand if we adopt a right view that view will steer us towards right action and thereby towards freedom from sufferingThough our conceptual orientation towards the world might seem innocuous and inconsequential when looked at closely it reveals itself to be the decisive determinant of our whole course of future developmentThe Buddha himself says that he sees no single factor so responsible for the arising of unwholesome states of mind as wrong view and no factor so helpful for the arising of wholesome states of mind as right viewAgain he says that there is no single factor so responsible for the suffering of living beings as wrong view and no factor so potent in promoting the good of living beings as right viewIn its fullest measure right view involves a correct understanding of the entire Dhamma or teaching of the Buddha and thus its scope is equal to the range of the Dhamma itselfBut for practical purposes two kinds of right view stand out as primaryOne is mundane right view right view which operates within the confines of the worldThe other is supramundane right view the superior right view which leads to liberation from the worldThe first is concerned with the laws governing material and spiritual progress within the round of becoming with the principles that lead to higher and lower states of existence to mundane happiness and sufferingThe second is concerned with the principles essential to liberationIt does not aim merely at spiritual progress from life to life but at emancipation from the cycle of recurring lives and deathsMundane right view involves a correct grasp of the law of kamma the moral efficacy of actionIts literal name is right view of the ownership of action and it finds its standard formulation in the statement Beings are the owners of their actions the heirs of their actions they spring from their actions are bound to their actions and are supported by their actionsWhatever deeds they do good or bad of those they shall be heirs More specific formulations have also come down in the textsOne stock passage for example affirms that virtuous actions such as giving and offering alms have moral significance that good and bad deeds produce corresponding fruits that one has a duty to serve mother and father that there is rebirth and a world beyond the visible one and that religious teachers of high attainment can be found who expound the truth about the world on the basis of their own superior realizationTo understand the implications of this form of right view we first have to examine the meaning of its key term kammaThe word kamma means actionFor Buddhism the relevant kind of action is volitional action deeds expressive of morally determinate volition since it is volition that gives the action ethical significanceThus the Buddha expressly identifies action with volitionIn a discourse on the analysis of kamma he says Monks it is volition that I call actionHaving willed one performs an action through body speech or mind The identification of kamma with volition makes kamma essentially a mental event a factor originating in the mind which seeks to actualize the minds drives dispositions and purposesVolition comes into being through any of three channels  body speech or mind  called the three doors of actionA volition expressed through the body is a bodily action a volition expressed through speech is a verbal action and a volition that issues in thoughts plans ideas and other mental states without gaining outer expression is a mental actionThus the one factor of volition differentiates into three types of kamma according to the channel through which it becomes manifestRight view requires more than a simple knowledge of the general meaning of kammaIt is also necessary to understand the ethical distinction of kamma into the unwholesome and the wholesome the principal cases of each type and the roots from which these actions springAs expressed in a sutta When a noble disciple understands what is kammically unwholesome and the root of unwholesome kamma what is kammically wholesome and the root of wholesome kamma then he has right viewTaking these points in order we find that kamma is first distinguished as unwholesome and wholesomeUnwholesome kamma is action that is morally blameworthy detrimental to spiritual development and conducive to suffering for oneself and othersWholesome kamma on the other hand is action that is morally commendable helpful to spiritual growth and productive of benefits for oneself and othersInnumerable instances of unwholesome and wholesome kamma can be cited but the Buddha selects ten of each as primaryThese he calls the ten courses of unwholesome and wholesome actionAmong the ten in the two sets three are bodily four are verbal and three are mentalThe ten courses of unwholesome kamma may be listed as follows divided by way of their doors of expressionThe ten courses of wholesome kamma are the opposites of these abstaining from the first seven courses of unwholesome kamma being free from covetousness and ill will and holding right viewThough the seven cases of abstinence are exercised entirely by the mind and do not necessarily entail overt action they are still designated wholesome bodily and verbal action because they center on the control of the faculties of body and speechActions are distinguished as wholesome and unwholesome on the basis of their underlying motives called roots which impart their moral quality to the volitions concomitant with themselvesThus kamma is wholesome or unwholesome according to whether its roots are wholesome or unwholesomeThe roots are threefold for each setThe unwholesome roots are the three defilements we already mentioned  greed aversion and delusionAny action originating from these is an unwholesome kammaThe three wholesome roots are their opposites expressed negatively in the old Indian fashion as nongreed nonaversion and nondelusionThough these are negatively designated they signify not merely the absence of defilements but the corresponding virtuesNongreed implies renunciation detachment and generosity nonaversion implies lovingkindness sympathy and gentleness and nondelusion implies wisdomAny action originating from these roots is a wholesome kammaThe most important feature of kamma is its capacity to produce results corresponding to the ethical quality of the actionAn immanent universal law holds sway over volitional actions bringing it about that these actions issue in retributive consequences called vipaka ripenings or phala fruits The law connecting actions with their fruits works on the simple principle that unwholesome actions ripen in suffering wholesome actions in happinessThe ripening need not come right away it need not come in the present life at allKamma can operate across the succession of lifetimes it can even remain dormant for aeons into the futureBut whenever we perform a volitional action the volition leaves its imprint on the mental continuum where it remains as a stored up potencyWhen the stored up kamma meets with conditions favorable to its maturation it awakens from its dormant state and triggers off some effect that brings due compensation for the original actionThe ripening may take place in the present life in the next life or in some life subsequent to the nextA kamma may ripen by producing rebirth into the next existence thus determining the basic form of life or it may ripen in the course of a lifetime issuing in our varied experiences of happiness and pain success and failure progress and declineBut whenever it ripens and in whatever way the same principle invariably holds wholesome actions yield favorable results unwholesome actions yield unfavorable resultsTo recognize this principle is to hold right view of the mundane kindThis view at once excludes the multiple forms of wrong view with which it is incompatibleAs it affirms that our actions have an influence on our destiny continuing into future lives it opposes the nihilistic view which regards this life as our only existence and holds that consciousness terminates with deathAs it grounds the distinction between good and evil right and wrong in an objective universal principle it opposes the ethical subjectivism which asserts that good and evil are only postulations of personal opinion or means to social controlAs it affirms that people can choose their actions freely within limits set by their conditions it opposes the hard deterministic line that our choices are always made subject to necessitation and hence that free volition is unreal and moral responsibility untenableSome of the implications of the Buddhas teaching on the right view of kamma and its fruits run counter to popular trends in presentday thought and it is helpful to make these differences explicitThe teaching on right view makes it known that good and bad right and wrong transcend conventional opinions about what is good and bad what is right and wrongAn entire society may be predicated upon a confusion of correct moral values and even though everyone within that society may applaud one particular kind of action as right and condemn another kind as wrong this does not make them validly right and wrongFor the Buddha moral standards are objective and invariableWhile the moral character of deeds is doubtlessly conditioned by the circumstances under which they are performed there are objective criteria of morality against which any action or any comprehensive moral code can be evaluatedThis objective standard of morality is integral to the Dhamma the cosmic law of truth and righteousnessIts transpersonal ground of validation is the fact that deeds as expressions of the volitions that engender them produce consequences for the agent and that the correlations between deeds and their consequences are intrinsic to the volitions themselvesThere is no divine judge standing above the cosmic process who assigns rewards and punishmentsNevertheless the deeds themselves through their inherent moral or immoral nature generate the appropriate resultsFor most people the vast majority the right view of kamma and its results is held out of confidence accepted on faith from an eminent spiritual teacher who proclaims the moral efficacy of actionBut even when the principle of kamma is not personally seen it still remains a facet of right viewIt is part and parcel of right view because right view is concerned with understanding  with understanding our place in the total scheme of things  and one who accepts the principle that our volitional actions possess a moral potency has to that extent grasped an important fact pertaining to the nature of our existenceHowever the right view of the kammic efficacy of action need not remain exclusively an article of belief screened behind an impenetrable barrierIt can become a matter of direct seeingThrough the attainment of certain states of deep concentration it is possible to develop a special faculty called the divine eye a supersensory power of vision that reveals things hidden from the eyes of fleshWhen this faculty is developed it can be directed out upon the world of living beings to investigate the workings of the kammic lawWith the special vision it confers one can then see for oneself with immediate perception how beings pass away and rearise according to their kamma how they meet happiness and suffering through the maturation of their good and evil deedsThe right view of kamma and its fruits provides a rationale for engaging in wholesome actions and attaining high status within the round of rebirths but by itself it does not lead to liberationIt is possible for someone to accept the law of kamma yet still limit his aims to mundane achievementsOnes motive for performing noble deeds might be the accumulation of meritorious kamma leading to prosperity and success here and now a fortunate rebirth as a human being or the enjoyment of celestial bliss in the heavenly worldsThere is nothing within the logic of kammic causality to impel the urge to transcend the cycle of kamma and its fruitThe impulse to deliverance from the entire round of becoming depends upon the acquisition of a different and deeper perspective one which yields insight into the inherent defectiveness of all forms of samsaric existence even the most exaltedThis superior right view leading to liberation is the understanding of the Four Noble TruthsIt is this right view that figures as the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path in the proper sense as the noble right viewThus the Buddha defines the path factor of right view expressly in terms of the four truths What now is right viewIt is understanding of suffering understanding of the origin of suffering understanding of the cessation of suffering understanding of the way leading to the cessation to suffering The Eightfold Path starts with a conceptual understanding of the Four Noble Truths apprehended only obscurely through the media of thought and reflectionIt reaches its climax in a direct intuition of those same truths penetrated with a clarity tantamount to enlightenmentThus it can be said that the right view of the Four Noble Truths forms both the beginning and the culmination of the way to the end of sufferingThe first noble truth is the truth of suffering the inherent unsatisfactoriness of existence revealed in the impermanence pain and perpetual incompleteness intrinsic to all forms of lifeThis is the noble truth of sufferingBirth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering association with the unpleasant is suffering separation from the pleasant is suffering not to get what one wants is suffering in brief the five aggregates of clinging are sufferingThe last statement makes a comprehensive claim that calls for some attentionThe five aggregates of clinging are a classificatory scheme for understanding the nature of our beingWhat we are the Buddha teaches is a set of five aggregates  material form feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness  all connected with clingingWe are the five and the five are usWhatever we identify with whatever we hold to as our self falls within the set of five aggregatesTogether these five aggregates generate the whole array of thoughts emotions ideas and dispositions in which we dwell our world Thus the Buddhas declaration that the five aggregates are dukkha in effect brings all experience our entire existence into the range of dukkhaBut here the question arises Why should the Buddha say that the five aggregates are dukkhaThe reason he says that the five aggregates are dukkha is that they are impermanentThey change from moment to moment arise and fall away without anything substantial behind them persisting through the changeSince the constituent factors of our being are always changing utterly devoid of a permanent core there is nothing we can cling to in them as a basis for securityThere is only a constantly disintegrating flux which when clung to in the desire for permanence brings a plunge into sufferingThe second noble truth points out the cause of dukkhaFrom the set of defilements which eventuate in suffering the Buddha singles out craving as the dominant and most pervasive cause the origin of sufferingThis is the noble truth of the origin of sufferingIt is this craving which produces repeated existence is bound up with delight and lust and seeks pleasure here and there namely craving for sense pleasures craving for existence and craving for nonexistenceThe third noble truth simply reverses this relationship of originationIf craving is the cause of dukkha then to be free from dukkha we have to eliminate cravingThus the Buddha saysThis is the noble truth of the cessation of sufferingIt is the complete fading away and cessation of this craving its forsaking and abandonment liberation and detachment from itThe state of perfect peace that comes when craving is eliminated is Nibbana the unconditioned state experienced while alive with the extinguishing of the flames of greed aversion and delusionThe fourth noble truth shows the way to reach the end of dukkha the way to the realization of NibbanaThat way is the Noble Eightfold Path itselfThe right view of the Four Noble Truths develops in two stagesThe first is called the right view that accords with the truths the second the right view that penetrates the truthsTo acquire the right view that accords with the truths requires a clear understanding of their meaning and significance in our livesSuch an understanding arises first by learning the truths and studying themSubsequently it is deepened by reflecting upon them in the light of experience until one gains a strong conviction as to their veracityBut even at this point the truths have not been penetrated and thus the understanding achieved is still defective a matter of concept rather than perceptionTo arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation  first to strengthen the capacity for sustained concentration then to develop insightInsight arises by contemplating the five aggregates the factors of existence in order to discern their real characteristicsAt the climax of such contemplation the mental eye turns away from the conditioned phenomena comprised in the aggregates and shifts its focus to the unconditioned state Nibbana which becomes accessible through the deepened faculty of insightWith this shift when the minds eye sees Nibbana there takes place a simultaneous penetration of all Four Noble TruthsBy seeing Nibbana the state beyond dukkha one gains a perspective from which to view the five aggregates and see that they are dukkha simply because they are conditioned subject to ceaseless changeAt the same moment Nibbana is realized craving stops the understanding then dawns that craving is the true origin of dukkhaWhen Nibbana is seen it is realized to be the state of peace free from the turmoil of becomingAnd because this experience has been reached by practicing the Noble Eightfold Path one knows for oneself that the Noble Eightfold Path is truly the way to the end of dukkhaThis right view that penetrates the Four Noble Truths comes at the end of the path not at the beginningWe have to start with the right view conforming to the truths acquired through learning and fortified through reflectionThis view inspires us to take up the practice to embark on the threefold training in moral discipline concentration and wisdomWhen the training matures the eye of wisdom opens by itself penetrating the truths and freeing the mind from bondageThe second factor of the path is called in Pali samma sankappa which we will translate as right intention The term is sometimes translated as right thought a rendering that can be accepted if we add the proviso that in the present context the word thought refers specifically to the purposive or conative aspect of mental activity the cognitive aspect being covered by the first factor right viewIt would be artificial however to insist too strongly on the division between these two functionsFrom the Buddhist perspective the cognitive and purposive sides of the mind do not remain isolated in separate compartments but intertwine and interact in close correlationEmotional predilections influence views and views determine predilectionsThus a penetrating view of the nature of existence gained through deep reflection and validated through investigation brings with it a restructuring of values which sets the mind moving towards goals commensurate with the new visionThe application of mind needed to achieve those goals is what is meant by right intentionThe Buddha explains right intention as threefold the intention of renunciation the intention of good will and the intention of harmlessnessThe three are opposed to three parallel kinds of wrong intention intention governed by desire intention governed by ill will and intention governed by harmfulnessEach kind of right intention counters the corresponding kind of wrong intentionThe intention of renunciation counters the intention of desire the intention of good will counters the intention of ill will and the intention of harmlessness counters the intention of harmfulnessThe Buddha discovered this twofold division of thought in the period prior to his EnlightenmentWhile he was striving for deliverance meditating in the forest he found that his thoughts could be distributed into two different classesIn one he put thoughts of desire ill will and harmfulness in the other thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessnessWhenever he noticed thoughts of the first kind arise in him he understood that those thoughts lead to harm for oneself and others obstruct wisdom and lead away from NibbanaReflecting in this way he expelled such thoughts from his mind and brought them to an endBut whenever thoughts of the second kind arose he understood those thoughts to be beneficial conducive to the growth of wisdom aids to the attainment of NibbanaThus he strengthened those thoughts and brought them to completionRight intention claims the second place in the path between right view and the triad of moral factors that begins with right speech because the minds intentional function forms the crucial link connecting our cognitive perspective with our modes of active engagement in the worldOn the one side actions always point back to the thoughts from which they springThought is the forerunner of action directing body and speech stirring them into activity using them as its instruments for expressing its aims and idealsThese aims and ideals our intentions in turn point back a further step to the prevailing viewsWhen wrong views prevail the outcome is wrong intention giving rise to unwholesome actionsThus one who denies the moral efficacy of action and measures achievement in terms of gain and status will aspire to nothing but gain and status using whatever means he can to acquire themWhen such pursuits become widespread the result is suffering the tremendous suffering of individuals social groups and nations out to gain wealth position and power without regard for consequencesThe cause for the endless competition conflict injustice and oppression does not lie outside the mindThese are all just manifestations of intentions outcroppings of thoughts driven by greed by hatred by delusionBut when the intentions are right the actions will be right and for the intentions to be right the surest guarantee is right viewsOne who recognizes the law of kamma that actions bring retributive consequences will frame his pursuits to accord with this law thus his actions expressive of his intentions will conform to the canons of right conductThe Buddha succinctly sums up the matter when he says that for a person who holds a wrong view his deeds words plans and purposes grounded in that view will lead to suffering while for a person who holds right view his deeds words plans and purposes grounded in that view will lead to happinessSince the most important formulation of right view is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths it follows that this view should be in some way determinative of the content of right intentionThis we find to be in fact the caseUnderstanding the four truths in relation to ones own life gives rise to the intention of renunciation understanding them in relation to other beings gives rise to the other two right intentionsWhen we see how our own lives are pervaded by dukkha and how this dukkha derives from craving the mind inclines to renunciation  to abandoning craving and the objects to which it binds usThen when we apply the truths in an analogous way to other living beings the contemplation nurtures the growth of good will and harmlessnessWe see that like ourselves all other living beings want to be happy and again that like ourselves they are subject to sufferingThe consideration that all beings seek happiness causes thoughts of good will to arise  the loving wish that they be well happy and peacefulThe consideration that beings are exposed to suffering causes thoughts of harmlessness to arise  the compassionate wish that they be free from sufferingThe moment the cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path begins the factors of right view and right intention together start to counteract the three unwholesome rootsDelusion the primary cognitive defilement is opposed by right view the nascent seed of wisdomThe complete eradication of delusion will only take place when right view is developed to the stage of full realization but every flickering of correct understanding contributes to its eventual destructionThe other two roots being emotive defilements require opposition through the redirecting of intention and thus meet their antidotes in thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessnessSince greed and aversion are deeply grounded they do not yield easily however the work of overcoming them is not impossible if an effective strategy is employedThe path devised by the Buddha makes use of an indirect approach it proceeds by tackling the thoughts to which these defilements give riseGreed and aversion surface in the form of thoughts and thus can be eroded by a process of thought substitution by replacing them with the thoughts opposed to themThe intention of renunciation provides the remedy to greedGreed comes to manifestation in thoughts of desire  as sensual acquisitive and possessive thoughtsThoughts of renunciation spring from the wholesome root of nongreed which they activate whenever they are cultivatedSince contrary thoughts cannot coexist when thoughts of renunciation are roused they dislodge thoughts of desire thus causing nongreed to replace greedSimilarly the intentions of good will and harmlessness offer the antidote to aversionAversion comes to manifestation either in thoughts of ill will  as angry hostile or resentful thoughts or in thoughts of harming  as the impulses to cruelty aggression and destructionThoughts of good will counter the former outflow of aversion thoughts of harmlessness the latter outflow in this way excising the unwholesome root of aversion itselfThe Buddha describes his teaching as running contrary to the way of the worldThe way of the world is the way of desire and the unenlightened who follow this way flow with the current of desire seeking happiness by pursuing the objects in which they imagine they will find fulfillmentThe Buddhas message of renunciation states exactly the opposite the pull of desire is to be resisted and eventually abandonedDesire is to be abandoned not because it is morally evil but because it is a root of sufferingThus renunciation turning away from craving and its drive for gratification becomes the key to happiness to freedom from the hold of attachmentThe Buddha does not demand that everyone leave the household life for the monastery or ask his followers to discard all sense enjoyments on the spotThe degree to which a person renounces depends on his or her disposition and situationBut what remains as a guiding principle is this that the attainment of deliverance requires the complete eradication of craving and progress along the path is accelerated to the extent that one overcomes cravingBreaking free from domination by desire may not be easy but the difficulty does not abrogate the necessitySince craving is the origin of dukkha putting an end to dukkha depends on eliminating craving and that involves directing the mind to renunciationBut it is just at this point when one tries to let go of attachment that one encounters a powerful inner resistanceThe mind does not want to relinquish its hold on the objects to which it has become attachedFor such a long time it has been accustomed to gaining grasping and holding that it seems impossible to break these habits by an act of willOne might agree to the need for renunciation might want to leave attachment behind but when the call is actually sounded the mind recoils and continues to move in the grip of its desiresSo the problem arises of how to break the shackles of desireThe Buddha does not offer as a solution the method of repression  the attempt to drive desire away with a mind full of fear and loathingThis approach does not resolve the problem but only pushes it below the surface where it continues to thriveThe tool the Buddha holds out to free the mind from desire is understandingReal renunciation is not a matter of compelling ourselves to give up things still inwardly cherished but of changing our perspective on them so that they no longer bind usWhen we understand the nature of desire when we investigate it closely with keen attention desire falls away by itself without need for struggleTo understand desire in such a way that we can loosen its hold we need to see that desire is invariably bound up with dukkhaThe whole phenomenon of desire with its cycle of wanting and gratification hangs on our way of seeing thingsWe remain in bondage to desire because we see it as our means to happinessIf we can look at desire from a different angle its force will be abated resulting in the move towards renunciationWhat is needed to alter perception is something called wise considerationJust as perception influences thought so thought can influence perceptionOur usual perceptions are tinged with unwise considerationWe ordinarily look only at the surfaces of things scan them in terms of our immediate interests and wants only rarely do we dig into the roots of our involvements or explore their longrange consequencesTo set this straight calls for wise consideration looking into the hidden undertones to our actions exploring their results evaluating the worthiness of our goalsIn this investigation our concern must not be with what is pleasant but with what is trueWe have to be prepared and willing to discover what is true even at the cost of our comfortFor real security always lies on the side of truth not on the side of comfortWhen desire is scrutinized closely we find that it is constantly shadowed by dukkhaSometimes dukkha appears as pain or irritation often it lies low as a constant strain of discontentBut the two  desire and dukkha  are inseparable concomitantsWe can confirm this for ourselves by considering the whole cycle of desireAt the moment desire springs up it creates in us a sense of lack the pain of wantTo end this pain we struggle to fulfill the desireIf our effort fails we experience frustration disappointment sometimes despairBut even the pleasure of success is not unqualifiedWe worry that we might lose the ground we have gainedWe feel driven to secure our position to safeguard our territory to gain more to rise higher to establish tighter controlsThe demands of desire seem endless and each desire demands the eternal it wants the things we get to last foreverBut all the objects of desire are impermanentWhether it be wealth power position or other persons separation is inevitable and the pain that accompanies separation is proportional to the force of attachment strong attachment brings much suffering little attachment brings little suffering no attachment brings no sufferingContemplating the dukkha inherent in desire is one way to incline the mind to renunciationAnother way is to contemplate directly the benefits flowing from renunciationTo move from desire to renunciation is not as might be imagined to move from happiness to grief from abundance to destitutionIt is to pass from gross entangling pleasures to an exalted happiness and peace from a condition of servitude to one of selfmasteryDesire ultimately breeds fear and sorrow but renunciation gives fearlessness and joyIt promotes the accomplishment of all three stages of the threefold training it purifies conduct aids concentration and nourishes the seed of wisdomThe entire course of practice from start to finish can in fact be seen as an evolving process of renunciation culminating in Nibbana as the ultimate stage of relinquishment the relinquishing of all foundations of existenceWhen we methodically contemplate the dangers of desire and the benefits of renunciation gradually we steer our mind away from the domination of desireAttachments are shed like the leaves of a tree naturally and spontaneouslyThe changes do not come suddenly but when there is persistent practice there is no doubt that they will comeThrough repeated contemplation one thought knocks away another the intention of renunciation dislodges the intention of desireThe intention of good will opposes the intention of ill will thoughts governed by anger and aversionAs in the case of desire there are two ineffective ways of handling ill willOne is to yield to it to express the aversion by bodily or verbal actionThis approach releases the tension helps drive the anger out of ones system but it also poses certain dangersIt breeds resentment provokes retaliation creates enemies poisons relationships and generates unwholesome kamma in the end the ill will does not leave the system after all but instead is driven down to a deeper level where it continues to vitiate ones thoughts and conductThe other approach repression also fails to dispel the destructive force of ill willIt merely turns that force around and pushes it inward where it becomes transmogrified into selfcontempt chronic depression or a tendency to irrational outbursts of violenceThe remedy the Buddha recommends to counteract ill will especially when the object is another person is a quality called in Pali mettaThis word derives from another word meaning friend but metta signifies much more than ordinary friendlinessI prefer to translate it by the compound lovingkindness which best captures the intended sense an intense feeling of selfless love for other beings radiating outwards as a heartfelt concern for their wellbeing and happinessMetta is not just sentimental good will nor is it a conscientious response to a moral imperative or divine commandIt must become a deep inner feeling characterized by spontaneous warmth rather than by a sense of obligationAt its peak metta rises to the heights of a brahmavihara a divine dwelling a total way of being centered on the radiant wish for the welfare of all living beingsThe kind of love implied by metta should be distinguished from sensual love as well as from the love involved in personal affectionThe first is a form of craving necessarily selfdirected while the second still includes a degree of attachment we love a person because that person gives us pleasure belongs to our family or group or reinforces our own selfimageOnly rarely does the feeling of affection transcend all traces of egoreference and even then its scope is limitedIt applies only to a certain person or group of people while excluding othersThe love involved in metta in contrast does not hinge on particular relations to particular personsHere the reference point of self is utterly omittedWe are concerned only with suffusing others with a mind of lovingkindness which ideally is to be developed into a universal state extended to all living beings without discriminations or reservationsThe way to impart to metta this universal scope is to cultivate it as an exercise in meditationSpontaneous feelings of good will occur too sporadically and are too limited in range to be relied on as the remedy for aversionThe idea of deliberately developing love has been criticized as contrived mechanical and calculatedLove it is said can only be genuine when it is spontaneous arisen without inner prompting or effortBut it is a Buddhist thesis that the mind cannot be commanded to love spontaneously it can only be shown the means to develop love and enjoined to practice accordinglyAt first the means has to be employed with some deliberation but through practice the feeling of love becomes ingrained grafted onto the mind as a natural and spontaneous tendencyThe method of development is mettabhavana the meditation on lovingkindness one of the most important kinds of Buddhist meditationThe meditation begins with the development of lovingkindness towards oneselfIt is suggested that one take oneself as the first object of metta because true lovingkindness for others only becomes possible when one is able to feel genuine lovingkindness for oneselfProbably most of the anger and hostility we direct to others springs from negative attitudes we hold towards ourselvesWhen metta is directed inwards towards oneself it helps to melt down the hardened crust created by these negative attitudes permitting a fluid diffusion of kindness and sympathy outwardsOnce one has learned to kindle the feeling of metta towards oneself the next step is to extend it to othersThe extension of metta hinges on a shift in the sense of identity on expanding the sense of identity beyond its ordinary confines and learning to identify with othersThe shift is purely psychological in method entirely free from theological and metaphysical postulates such as that of a universal self immanent in all beingsInstead it proceeds from a simple straightforward course of reflection which enables us to share the subjectivity of others and experience the world from the standpoint of their own inwardnessThe procedure starts with oneselfIf we look into our own mind we find that the basic urge of our being is the wish to be happy and free from sufferingNow as soon as we see this in ourselves we can immediately understand that all living beings share the same basic wishAll want to be well happy and secureTo develop metta towards others what is to be done is to imaginatively share their own innate wish for happinessWe use our own desire for happiness as the key experience this desire as the basic urge of others then come back to our own position and extend to them the wish that they may achieve their ultimate objective that they may be well and happyThe methodical radiation of metta is practiced first by directing metta to individuals representing certain groupsThese groups are set in an order of progressive remoteness from oneselfThe radiation begins with a dear person such as a parent or teacher then moves on to a friend then to a neutral person then finally to a hostile personThough the types are defined by their relation to oneself the love to be developed is not based on that relation but on each persons common aspiration for happinessWith each individual one has to bring his image into focus and radiate the thought May he be wellMay he be happyMay he be peaceful Only when one succeeds in generating a warm feeling of good will and kindness towards that person should one turn to the nextOnce one gains some success with individuals one can then work with larger unitsOne can try developing metta towards all friends all neutral persons all hostile personsThen metta can be widened by directional suffusion proceeding in the various directions  east south west north above below  then it can be extended to all beings without distinctionIn the end one suffuses the entire world with a mind of lovingkindness vast sublime and immeasurable without enmity without aversionThe intention of harmlessness is thought guided by compassion aroused in opposition to cruel aggressive and violent thoughtsCompassion supplies the complement to lovingkindnessWhereas lovingkindness has the characteristic of wishing for the happiness and welfare of others compassion has the characteristic of wishing that others be free from suffering a wish to be extended without limits to all living beingsLike metta compassion arises by entering into the subjectivity of others by sharing their interiority in a deep and total wayIt springs up by considering that all beings like ourselves wish to be free from suffering yet despite their wishes continue to be harassed by pain fear sorrow and other forms of dukkhaTo develop compassion as a meditative exercise it is most effective to start with somebody who is actually undergoing suffering since this provides the natural object for compassionOne contemplates this persons suffering either directly or imaginatively then reflects that like oneself he also wants to be free from sufferingThe thought should be repeated and contemplation continually exercised until a strong feeling of compassion swells up in the heartThen using that feeling as a standard one turns to different individuals considers how they are each exposed to suffering and radiates the gentle feeling of compassion out to themTo increase the breadth and intensity of compassion it is helpful to contemplate the various sufferings to which living beings are susceptibleA useful guideline to this extension is provided by the first noble truth with its enumeration of the different aspects of dukkhaOne contemplates beings as subject to old age then as subject to sickness then to death then to sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair and so forthWhen a high level of success has been achieved in generating compassion by the contemplation of beings who are directly afflicted by suffering one can then move on to consider people who are presently enjoying happiness which they have acquired by immoral meansOne might reflect that such people despite their superficial fortune are doubtlessly troubled deep within by the pangs of conscienceEven if they display no outward signs of inner distress one knows that they will eventually reap the bitter fruits of their evil deeds which will bring them intense sufferingFinally one can widen the scope of ones contemplation to include all living beingsOne should contemplate all beings as subject to the universal suffering of samsara driven by their greed aversion and delusion through the round of repeated birth and deathIf compassion is initially difficult to arouse towards beings who are total strangers one can strengthen it by reflecting on the Buddhas dictum that in this beginningless cycle of rebirths it is hard to find even a single being who has not at some time been ones own mother or father sister or brother son or daughterTo sum up we see that the three kinds of right intention  of renunciation good will and harmlessness  counteract the three wrong intentions of desire ill will and harmfulnessThe importance of putting into practice the contemplations leading to the arising of these thoughts cannot be overemphasizedThe contemplations have been taught as methods for cultivation not mere theoretical excursionsTo develop the intention of renunciation we have to contemplate the suffering tied up with the quest for worldly enjoyment to develop the intention of good will we have to consider how all beings desire happiness to develop the intention of harmlessness we have to consider how all beings wish to be free from sufferingThe unwholesome thought is like a rotten peg lodged in the mind the wholesome thought is like a new peg suitable to replace itThe actual contemplation functions as the hammer used to drive out the old peg with the new oneThe work of driving in the new peg is practice  practicing again and again as often as is necessary to reach successThe Buddha gives us his assurance that the victory can be achievedHe says that whatever one reflects upon frequently becomes the inclination of the mindIf one frequently thinks sensual hostile or harmful thoughts desire ill will and harmfulness become the inclination of the mindIf one frequently thinks in the opposite way renunciation good will and harmlessness become the inclination of the mindThe direction we take always comes back to ourselves to the intentions we generate moment by moment in the course of our livesThe next three path factors  right speech right action and right livelihood  may be treated together as collectively they make up the first of the three divisions of the path the division of moral disciplineThough the principles laid down in this section restrain immoral actions and promote good conduct their ultimate purpose is not so much ethical as spiritualThey are not prescribed merely as guides to action but primarily as aids to mental purificationAs a necessary measure for human wellbeing ethics has its own justification in the Buddhas teaching and its importance cannot be underratedBut in the special context of the Noble Eightfold Path ethical principles are subordinate to the paths governing goal final deliverance from sufferingThus for the moral training to become a proper part of the path it has to be taken up under the tutelage of the first two factors right view and right intention and to lead beyond to the trainings in concentration and wisdomThough the training in moral discipline is listed first among the three groups of practices it should not be regarded lightlyIt is the foundation for the entire path essential for the success of the other trainingsThe Buddha himself frequently urged his disciples to adhere to the rules of discipline seeing danger in the slightest fault One time when a monk approached the Buddha and asked for the training in brief the Buddha told him First establish yourself in the starting point of wholesome states that is in purified moral discipline and in right viewThen when your moral discipline is purified and your view straight you should practice the four foundations of mindfulnessThe Pali word we have been translating as moral discipline sila appears in the texts with several overlapping meanings all connected with right conductIn some contexts it means action conforming to moral principles in others the principles themselves in still others the virtuous qualities of character that result from the observance of moral principlesSila in the sense of precepts or principles represents the formalistic side of the ethical training sila as virtue the animating spirit and sila as right conduct the expression of virtue in reallife situationsOften sila is formally defined as abstinence from unwholesome bodily and verbal actionThis definition with its stress on outer action appears superficialOther explanations however make up for the deficiency and reveal that there is more to sila than is evident at first glanceThe Abhidhamma for example equates sila with the mental factors of abstinence  right speech right action and right livelihood  an equation which makes it clear that what is really being cultivated through the observance of moral precepts is the mindThus while the training in sila brings the public benefit of inhibiting socially detrimental actions it entails the personal benefit of mental purification preventing the defilements from dictating to us what lines of conduct we should followThe English word morality and its derivatives suggest a sense of obligation and constraint quite foreign to the Buddhist conception of sila this connotation probably enters from the theistic background to Western ethicsBuddhism with its nontheistic framework grounds its ethics not on the notion of obedience but on that of harmonyIn fact the commentaries explain the word sila by another word samadhana meaning harmony or coordinationThe observance of sila leads to harmony at several levels  social psychological kammic and contemplativeAt the social level the principles of sila help to establish harmonious interpersonal relations welding the mass of differently constituted members of society with their own private interests and goals into a cohesive social order in which conflict if not utterly eliminated is at least reducedAt the psychological level sila brings harmony to the mind protection from the inner split caused by guilt and remorse over moral transgressionsAt the kammic level the observance of sila ensures harmony with the cosmic law of kamma hence favorable results in the course of future movement through the round of repeated birth and deathAnd at the fourth level the contemplative sila helps establish the preliminary purification of mind to be completed in a deeper and more thorough way by the methodical development of serenity and insightWhen briefly defined the factors of moral training are usually worded negatively in terms of abstinenceBut there is more to sila than refraining from what is wrongEach principle embedded in the precepts as we will see actually has two aspects both essential to the training as a wholeOne is abstinence from the unwholesome the other commitment to the wholesome the former is called avoidance and the latter performanceAt the outset of training the Buddha stresses the aspect of avoidanceHe does so not because abstinence from the unwholesome is sufficient in itself but to establish the steps of practice in proper sequenceThe steps are set out in their natural order in the famous dictum of the Dhammapada To abstain from all evil to cultivate the good and to purify ones mind  this is the teaching of the BuddhasThe other two steps  cultivating the good and purifying the mind  also receive their due but to ensure their success a resolve to avoid the unwholesome is a necessityWithout such a resolve the attempt to develop wholesome qualities is bound to issue in a warped and stunted pattern of growthThe training in moral discipline governs the two principal channels of outer action speech and body as well as another area of vital concern  ones way of earning a livingThus the training contains three factors right speech right action and right livelihoodThese we will now examine individually following the order in which they are set forth in the usual exposition of the pathThe Buddha divides right speech into four components abstaining from false speech abstaining from slanderous speech abstaining from harsh speech and abstaining from idle chatterBecause the effects of speech are not as immediately evident as those of bodily action its importance and potential is easily overlookedBut a little reflection will show that speech and its offshoot the written word can have enormous consequences for good or for harmIn fact whereas for beings such as animals who live at the preverbal level physical action is of dominant concern for humans immersed in verbal communication speech gains the ascendencySpeech can break lives create enemies and start wars or it can give wisdom heal divisions and create peaceThis has always been so yet in the modern age the positive and negative potentials of speech have been vastly multiplied by the tremendous increase in the means speed and range of communicationsThe capacity for verbal expression oral and written has often been regarded as the distinguishing mark of the human speciesFrom this we can appreciate the need to make this capacity the means to human excellence rather than as too often has been the case the sign of human degradationAbstaining from false speech Herein someone avoids false speech and abstains from itHe speaks the truth is devoted to truth reliable worthy of confidence not a deceiver of peopleBeing at a meeting or amongst people or in the midst of his relatives or in a society or in the kings court and called upon and asked as witness to tell what he knows he answers if he knows nothing I know nothing and if he knows he answers I know if he has seen nothing he answers I have seen nothing and if he has seen he answers I have seen Thus he never knowingly speaks a lie either for the sake of his own advantage or for the sake of another persons advantage or for the sake of any advantage whatsoeverThis statement of the Buddha discloses both the negative and the positive sides to the preceptThe negative side is abstaining from lying the positive side speaking the truthThe determinative factor behind the transgression is the intention to deceiveIf one speaks something false believing it to be true there is no breach of the precept as the intention to deceive is absentThough the deceptive intention is common to all cases of false speech lies can appear in different guises depending on the motivating root whether greed hatred or delusionGreed as the chief motive results in the lie aimed at gaining some personal advantage for oneself or for those close to oneself  material wealth position respect or admirationWith hatred as the motive false speech takes the form of the malicious lie the lie intended to hurt and damage othersWhen delusion is the principal motive the result is a less pernicious type of falsehood the irrational lie the compulsive lie the interesting exaggeration lying for the sake of a jokeThe Buddhas stricture against lying rests upon several reasonsFor one thing lying is disruptive to social cohesionPeople can live together in society only in an atmosphere of mutual trust where they have reason to believe that others will speak the truth by destroying the grounds for trust and inducing mass suspicion widespread lying becomes the harbinger signalling the fall from social solidarity to chaosBut lying has other consequences of a deeply personal nature at least equally disastrousBy their very nature lies tend to proliferateLying once and finding our word suspect we feel compelled to lie again to defend our credibility to paint a consistent picture of eventsSo the process repeats itself the lies stretch multiply and connect until they lock us into a cage of falsehoods from which it is difficult to escapeThe lie is thus a miniature paradigm for the whole process of subjective illusionIn each case the selfassured creator sucked in by his own deceptions eventually winds up their victimSuch considerations probably lie behind the words of counsel the Buddha spoke to his son the young novice Rahula soon after the boy was ordainedOne day the Buddha came to Rahula pointed to a bowl with a little bit of water in it and asked Rahula do you see this bit of water left in the bowl Rahula answered Yes sir So little Rahula is the spiritual achievement of one who is not afraid to speak a deliberate lie Then the Buddha threw the water away put the bowl down and said Do you see Rahula how that water has been discardedIn the same way one who tells a deliberate lie discards whatever spiritual achievement he has made Again he asked Do you see how this bowl is now emptyIn the same way one who has no shame in speaking lies is empty of spiritual achievement Then the Buddha turned the bowl upside down and said Do you see Rahula how this bowl has been turned upside downIn the same way one who tells a deliberate lie turns his spiritual achievements upside down and becomes incapable of progress Therefore the Buddha concluded one should not speak a deliberate lie even in jestIt is said that in the course of his long training for enlightenment over many lives a bodhisatta can break all the moral precepts except the pledge to speak the truthThe reason for this is very profound and reveals that the commitment to truth has a significance transcending the domain of ethics and even mental purification taking us to the domains of knowledge and beingTruthful speech provides in the sphere of interpersonal communication a parallel to wisdom in the sphere of private understandingThe two are respectively the outward and inward modalities of the same commitment to what is realWisdom consists in the realization of truth and truth is not just a verbal proposition but the nature of things as they areTo realize truth our whole being has to be brought into accord with actuality with things as they are which requires that in communications with others we respect things as they are by speaking the truthTruthful speech establishes a correspondence between our own inner being and the real nature of phenomena allowing wisdom to rise up and fathom their real natureThus much more than an ethical principle devotion to truthful speech is a matter of taking our stand on reality rather than illusion on the truth grasped by wisdom rather than the fantasies woven by desireAbstaining from slanderous speech He avoids slanderous speech and abstains from itWhat he has heard here he does not repeat there so as to cause dissension there and what he has heard there he does not repeat here so as to cause dissension hereThus he unites those that are divided and those that are united he encouragesConcord gladdens him he delights and rejoices in concord and it is concord that he spreads by his wordsSlanderous speech is speech intended to create enmity and division to alienate one person or group from anotherThe motive behind such speech is generally aversion resentment of a rivals success or virtues the intention to tear down others by verbal denigrationsOther motives may enter the picture as well the cruel intention of causing hurt to others the evil desire to win affection for oneself the perverse delight in seeing friends dividedSlanderous speech is one of the most serious moral transgressionsThe root of hate makes the unwholesome kamma already heavy enough but since the action usually occurs after deliberation the negative force becomes even stronger because premeditation adds to its gravityWhen the slanderous statement is false the two wrongs of falsehood and slander combine to produce an extremely powerful unwholesome kammaThe canonical texts record several cases in which the calumny of an innocent party led to an immediate rebirth in the plane of miseryThe opposite of slander as the Buddha indicates is speech that promotes friendship and harmonySuch speech originates from a mind of lovingkindness and sympathyIt wins the trust and affection of others who feel they can confide in one without fear that their disclosures will be used against themBeyond the obvious benefits that such speech brings in this present life it is said that abstaining from slander has as its kammic result the gain of a retinue of friends who can never be turned against one by the slanderous words of othersAbstaining from harsh speechHe avoids harsh language and abstains from itHe speaks such words as are gentle soothing to the ear loving such words as go to the heart and are courteous friendly and agreeable to manyHarsh speech is speech uttered in anger intended to cause the hearer painSuch speech can assume different forms of which we might mention threeOne is abusive speech scolding reviling or reproving another angrily with bitter wordsA second is insult hurting another by ascribing to him some offensive quality which detracts from his dignityA third is sarcasm speaking to someone in a way which ostensibly lauds him but with such a tone or twist of phrasing that the ironic intent becomes clear and causes painThe main root of harsh speech is aversion assuming the form of angerSince the defilement in this case tends to work impulsively without deliberation the transgression is less serious than slander and the kammic consequence generally less severeStill harsh speech is an unwholesome action with disagreeable results for oneself and others both now and in the future so it has to be restrainedThe ideal antidote is patience  learning to tolerate blame and criticism from others to sympathize with their shortcomings to respect differences in viewpoint to endure abuse without feeling compelled to retaliateThe Buddha calls for patience even under the most trying conditionsEven if monks robbers and murderers saw through your limbs and joints whosoever should give way to anger thereat would not be following my adviceFor thus ought you to train yourselves Undisturbed shall our mind remain with heart full of love and free from any hidden malice and that person shall we penetrate with loving thoughts wide deep boundless freed from anger and hatredAbstaining from idle chatterHe avoids idle chatter and abstains from itHe speaks at the right time in accordance with facts speaks what is useful speaks of the Dhamma and the discipline his speech is like a treasure uttered at the right moment accompanied by reason moderate and full of senseIdle chatter is pointless talk speech that lacks purpose or depthSuch speech communicates nothing of value but only stirs up the defilements in ones own mind and in othersThe Buddha advises that idle talk should be curbed and speech restricted as much as possible to matters of genuine importanceIn the case of a monk the typical subject of the passage just quoted his words should be selective and concerned primarily with the DhammaLay persons will have more need for affectionate small talk with friends and family polite conversation with acquaintances and talk in connection with their line of workBut even then they should be mindful not to let the conversation stray into pastures where the restless mind always eager for something sweet or spicy to feed on might find the chance to indulge its defiling propensitiesThe traditional exegesis of abstaining from idle chatter refers only to avoiding engagement in such talk oneselfBut today it might be of value to give this factor a different slant made imperative by certain developments peculiar to our own time unknown in the days of the Buddha and the ancient commentatorsThis is avoiding exposure to the idle chatter constantly bombarding us through the new media of communication created by modern technologyAn incredible array of devices  television radio newspapers pulp journals the cinema  turns out a continuous stream of needless information and distracting entertainment the net effect of which is to leave the mind passive vacant and sterileAll these developments naively accepted as progress threaten to blunt our aesthetic and spiritual sensitivities and deafen us to the higher call of the contemplative lifeSerious aspirants on the path to liberation have to be extremely discerning in what they allow themselves to be exposed toThey would greatly serve their aspirations by including these sources of amusement and needless information in the category of idle chatter and making an effort to avoid themRight action means refraining from unwholesome deeds that occur with the body as their natural means of expressionThe pivotal element in this path factor is the mental factor of abstinence but because this abstinence applies to actions performed through the body it is called right action The Buddha mentions three components of right action abstaining from taking life abstaining from taking what is not given and abstaining from sexual misconductThese we will briefly discuss in orderAbstaining from the taking of life Herein someone avoids the taking of life and abstains from itWithout stick or sword conscientious full of sympathy he is desirous of the welfare of all sentient beingsAbstaining from taking life has a wider application than simply refraining from killing other human beingsThe precept enjoins abstaining from killing any sentient beingA sentient being is a living being endowed with mind or consciousness for practical purposes this means human beings animals and insectsPlants are not considered to be sentient beings though they exhibit some degree of sensitivity they lack fullfledged consciousness the defining attribute of a sentient beingThe taking of life that is to be avoided is intentional killing the deliberate destruction of life of a being endowed with consciousnessThe principle is grounded in the consideration that all beings love life and fear death that all seek happiness and are averse to painThe essential determinant of transgression is the volition to kill issuing in an action that deprives a being of lifeSuicide is also generally regarded as a violation but not accidental killing as the intention to destroy life is absentThe abstinence may be taken to apply to two kinds of action the primary and the secondaryThe primary is the actual destruction of life the secondary is deliberately harming or torturing another being without killing itWhile the Buddhas statement on noninjury is quite simple and straightforward later commentaries give a detailed analysis of the principleA treatise from Thailand written by an erudite Thai patriarch collates a mass of earlier material into an especially thorough treatment which we shall briefly summarize hereThe treatise points out that the taking of life may have varying degrees of moral weight entailing different consequencesThe three primary variables governing moral weight are the object the motive and the effortWith regard to the object there is a difference in seriousness between killing a human being and killing an animal the former being kammically heavier since man has a more highly developed moral sense and greater spiritual potential than animalsAmong human beings the degree of kammic weight depends on the qualities of the person killed and his relation to the killer thus killing a person of superior spiritual qualities or a personal benefactor such as a parent or a teacher is an especially grave actThe motive for killing also influences moral weightActs of killing can be driven by greed hatred or delusionOf the three killing motivated by hatred is the most serious and the weight increases to the degree that the killing is premeditatedThe force of effort involved also contributes the unwholesome kamma being proportional to the force and the strength of the defilementsThe positive counterpart to abstaining from taking life as the Buddha indicates is the development of kindness and compassion for other beingsThe disciple not only avoids destroying life he dwells with a heart full of sympathy desiring the welfare of all beingsThe commitment to noninjury and concern for the welfare of others represent the practical application of the second path factor right intention in the form of good will and harmlessnessAbstaining from taking what is not given He avoids taking what is not given and abstains from it what another person possesses of goods and chattel in the village or in the wood that he does not take away with thievish intentTaking what is not given means appropriating the rightful belongings of others with thievish intentIf one takes something that has no owner such as unclaimed stones wood or even gems extracted from the earth the act does not count as a violation even though these objects have not been givenBut also implied as a transgression though not expressly stated is withholding from others what should rightfully be given to themCommentaries mention a number of ways in which taking what is not given can be committedSome of the most common may be enumeratedstealing taking the belongings of others secretly as in housebreaking pickpocketing etcrobbery taking what belongs to others openly by force or threatssnatching suddenly pulling away anothers possession before he has time to resistfraudulence gaining possession of anothers belongings by falsely claiming them as ones owndeceitfulness using false weights and measures to cheat customersThe degree of moral weight that attaches to the action is determined by three factors the value of the object taken the qualities of the victim of the theft and the subjective state of the thiefRegarding the first moral weight is directly proportional to the value of the objectRegarding the second the weight varies according to the moral qualities of the deprived individualRegarding the third acts of theft may be motivated either by greed or hatredWhile greed is the most common cause hatred may also be responsible as when one person deprives another of his belongings not so much because he wants them for himself as because he wants to harm the latterBetween the two acts motivated by hatred are kammically heavier than acts motivated by sheer greedThe positive counterpart to abstaining from stealing is honesty which implies respect for the belongings of others and for their right to use their belongings as they wishAnother related virtue is contentment being satisfied with what one has without being inclined to increase ones wealth by unscrupulous meansThe most eminent opposite virtue is generosity giving away ones own wealth and possessions in order to benefit othersAbstaining from sexual misconduct He avoids sexual misconduct and abstains from itHe has no intercourse with such persons as are still under the protection of father mother brother sister or relatives nor with married women nor with female convicts nor lastly with betrothed girlsThe guiding purposes of this precept from the ethical standpoint are to protect marital relations from outside disruption and to promote trust and fidelity within the marital unionFrom the spiritual standpoint it helps curb the expansive tendency of sexual desire and thus is a step in the direction of renunciation which reaches its consummation in the observance of celibacy binding on monks and nunsBut for laypeople the precept enjoins abstaining from sexual relations with an illicit partnerThe primary transgression is entering into full sexual union but all other sexual involvements of a less complete kind may be considered secondary infringementsThe main question raised by the precept concerns who is to count as an illicit partnerThe Buddhas statement defines the illicit partner from the perspective of the man but later treatises elaborate the matter for both sexesFor a man three kinds of women are considered illicit partnersA woman who is married to another manThis includes besides a woman already married to a man a woman who is not his legal wife but is generally recognized as his consort who lives with him or is kept by him or is in some way acknowledged as his partnerAll these women are illicit partners for men other than their own husbandsThis class would also include a woman engaged to another manBut a widow or divorced woman is not out of bounds provided she is not excluded for other reasonsA woman still under protectionThis is a girl or woman who is under the protection of her mother father relatives or others rightfully entitled to be her guardiansThis provision rules out elopements or secret marriages contrary to the wishes of the protecting party
