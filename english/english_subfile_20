The fourth and last part of the Dhammasangani the Atthuddharakanda the Synopsis
The arrangement for the recitation of the Abhidhamma
The Numerical Section of the Patthana
In the Anupada Sutta the Buddha himself speaks of the Venerable Sariputta's analysis of meditative consciousness into its chief mental concomitants which the Elder undertook from his own experience after rising from each of the meditative attainments in succession
This analysis may well be either a precursor or an abridgment of the detailed analysis of jhanaconsciousness given in the Dhammasangani
Concerning the Venerable Sariputta's mastery of the Dhamma and its exposition the Buddha had this to say
 Nidana Samyutta No

And on another occasion the Master employed this simile
Similarly O monks is Sariputta endowed with five qualities and rightly turns the supreme Wheel of Dhamma even as I have turned it
And this Wheel cannot be overturned by ascetics or priests by deities or Brahma nor by anyone else in the world
What are those five qualities
Sariputta O monks knows what is beneficial knows the Teaching knows the right measure knows the right time and knows the assembly
 Anguttara Nikaya 
Other Theras were not behind in their appreciation
The Elder Vangisa in his encomium in the Theragatha praises Sariputta who teaches in brief and also speaks in detail while in the same compilation other great Elders Maha Kassapa and Maha Moggallana also give their meed of praise
And the Venerable Maha Moggallana at the end of Sariputta's Discourse on Guiltlessness uttered these words of tribute to his friend's sermon To monks who have heard the exposition of the Venerable Sariputta it will be like food and drink to their ears and mind
How well does he lift up his fellowmonks from what is unwholesome and confirm them in what is good
The relationship in which the two Chief Disciples stood to one another in the matter of teaching was explained by the Buddha when he said
Sariputta is able to expound the Four Noble Truths in detail to teach them and make them intelligible to proclaim reveal and explain them and make them clear
 Majjh Saccavibhanga Sutta
And in the Anguttara Nikaya
A monk of faith O bhikkhus should cherish this right aspiration 'Oh may I become such as Sariputta and Moggallana' For Sariputta and Moggallana are the model and standard for my bhikkhudisciples
That the Venerable Sariputta's great reputation as a teacher of the Dhamma long survived him to become a tradition among later Buddhists is shown by the concluding passages of the Milindapañha written some three hundred years later
There King Milinda compares Nagasena Thera to the Venerable Sariputta saying In this Buddha's Dispensation there is none other like yourself for answering questions except the Elder Sariputta the Marshal of the Law
That grand reputation still lives today upheld by the cherished teachings of the Great Disciple preserved and enshrined in some of the oldest books of Buddhism alongside the words of his Master
As we have already seen the Venerable Sariputta was born into a brahman family of Upatissa village near Rajagaha his father's name being Vaganta and his mother's Sari
He had three brothers Cunda Upasena and Revata and three sisters named Cala Upacala and Sisupacala
All six took ordination and attained Arahatship
Cunda was known by the name Samanuddesa meaning the Novice in the Sangha even after becoming a bhikkhu this was to distinguish him from the Elder Maha Cunda
At the time of Sariputta's death Cunda was his attendant and it was he who informed the Buddha of his passing away bringing with him the Chief Disciple's relics
The story is told in the Cunda Sutta an outline of which will be given elsewhere in this book
Upasena who came to be known as Vagantaputta or Son of Vaganta as Sariputta is Son of Sari was said by the Buddha to be foremost among those of allpleasing deportment
He died of a snakebite as is related in the Salatayana Samyutta Vagga Sutta
Revata was the youngest of the brothers and their mother wishing to prevent his seeking ordination had him married when he was a very young boy
But on the wedding day he saw the grandmother of his future wife an old woman of stricken with all the signs of decrepitude
At once he became disgusted with worldly life
Escaping from the wedding procession by a ruse he fled to a monastery and was ordained
In later years he was on his way to see the Buddha when he stopped at a forest of acacia trees and while spending the rainy season there he attained Arahatship
After that he became known as Revata Khadiravaniya  Revata of the Acacia Forest The Buddha distinguished him as being the foremost among forest dwellers
The three sisters Cala Upacala and Sisupacala wishing to follow their brothers' example became nuns after their marriage
In marriage each of them had a son who was named after his mother Cala and so on
These three sons were also ordained being received as novices by Revata Khadtravaniya
Their good conduct was praised by the Venerable Sariputta who met them when he went to see his youngest brother who was ill
This is recorded in the Commentary to the Theragatha v
Cala Upacala and Sisupacala as nuns are said to have been approached by Mara with taunting and tempting questions to which they gave excellent replies
These are recorded in the Theragatha and Bhikkhuni Samyutta
In contrast to all these Sariputta's mother was a staunch brahman and hostile to the Buddha's Teaching and his followers
In the Commentary to the Dhammapada it is related that once when the Venerable Sariputta was in his own village of Nalaka with a large retinue of monks he came to his mother's house in the course of his almsround
His mother gave him a seat and served him with food but while she did so she uttered abusive words Oh you eater of others' leavings she said
When you fail to get leavings of sour ricegruel you go from house to house among strangers licking the leavings off the backs of ladies
And so it was for this that you gave up eighty crores of wealth and became a monk
You have ruined me
Now go on and eat
Likewise when she was serving food to the monks she said So
You are the men who have made my son your page boy
Go on eat now
Thus she continued reviling them but the Venerable Sariputta spoke not a word
He took his food ate it and in silence returned to the monastery
The Buddha learned of the incident from the Venerable Rahula who had been among the monks at the time
All the bhikkhus who heard of it wondered at the Elder's great forbearance and in the midst of the assembly the Buddha praised him uttering the stanza
It was not until right at the close of Sariputta's life that he was able to convert his mother that story will be told later on
But the incident that has been related here leads us to a consideration of the great Elder's most pleasing characteristics his humility patience and forbearance
It is the neighborhood of Jetavana where the Buddha is residing
Some men are in a group talking about the noble qualities of the Elder Sariputta
Such great patience has our noble Elder they are saying that even when people abuse him and strike him he feels no trace of anger
Who is this that never gets angry The question is from a brahman a holder of false views
And when they tell him It is our Elder Sariputta he retorts It must be that nobody has ever provoked him
That is not so brahman they reply
Well then I will provoke him to anger Provoke him to anger if you can Leave it to me says the brahman
I know just what to do to him
The Venerable Sariputta enters the city on his round for alms
Approaching him from behind the brahman strikes him in a tremendous blow on the back
What was that says the Venerable Sariputta and without so much as turning to look he continues on his way
The fire of remorse leaps up in every part of the brahman's body
Prostrating himself at the Elder's feet he begs for pardon
For what asks the Elder mildly
To test your patience I struck you the penitent brahman replies
Very well I pardon you
Reverend sir the brahman says if you are willing to pardon me hereafter please take your food only at my house With these words he takes the Elder's almsbowl which the Elder willingly yields and leading him to his house serves him with food
But those who saw the assault are enraged
They gather at the brahman's house armed with sticks and stones to kill him
When the Venerable Sariputta emerges accompanied by the brahman carrying his bowl they cry Reverend sir order this brahman to turn back
Why lay disciples asks the Elder
They answer The man struck you
We are going to give him what he deserves
But what do you mean
Was it you or me he struck
It was you reverend sir Well if it was me he struck he has begged my pardon
Go your ways And so dismissing the people and permitting the brahman to return the great Elder calmly makes his way to the monastery
This incident recorded in the Dhammapada Commentary was the occasion of the Buddha's uttering the verses and of the Dhammapada which are among those that give the Buddha's definition of what constitutes a brahman that is to say rectitude of conduct rather than birth or rank
 Dhammapada vv 
The Venerable Sariputta's humility was as great as his patience
He was willing to receive correction from anyone not only with submission but with gratitude
It is told in the Commentary to the Devaputta Samyutta Susima Sutta that once through a momentary negligence a corner of the Elder's underrobe was hanging down and a sevenyearold novice seeing this pointed it out to him
The Venerable Sariputta stepped aside at once and arranged the garment in the proper equallycircular way
Then he stood before the novice with folded hands saying Now it is correct teacher
There is a reference to this incident in the Questions of Milinda where these verses are ascribed to the Venerable Sariputta
On one occasion the Buddha mildly reproved Sariputta for not having carried his teaching far enough
When the brahman Dhanañjani was on his deathbed he was visited by the Venerable Sariputta
The Elder reflecting that brahmans are bent on the Brahmaworld taught the dying man the way to it through the Brahmaviharas
As a result it is said the brahman was in fact reborn there
When the Venerable Sariputta returned from the visit the Master asked him Why Sariputta while there was more to do did you set the brahman Dhanañjani's thoughts on the inferior Brahmaworld and then rising from your seat leave him The Venerable Sariputta replied I thought 'These brahmans are bent on the Brahmaworld
Should I not show the brahman Dhanañjani the way to the communion with Brahma
The brahman Dhanañjani has died Sariputta said the Buddha and he has been reborn in the Brahmaworld
This story which is found in the Dhanañjani Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya is interesting as an illustration of the undesirability of rebirth in an inferior Brahmaworld for one who is capable of bringing rebirth entirely to an end
For while the Buddha himself sometimes showed only the way to Brahma as for example in the Tevijja Sutta it seems probable that in the case of Dhanañjani the Master saw that he was fit to receive a higher teaching while the Venerable Sariputta lacking the capacity of knowing others' hearts was not able to discern that fact
The result is that Dhanañjani will spend an incalculable period in the Brahmaworld and will have to take human birth again before he can achieve the goal
The Venerable Sariputta received another gentle reproof when having asked the Buddha why it was that the Sasana of some of the Buddhas of the past did not last very long and the Buddha had replied that it was because those Enlightened Ones did not preach very much Dhamma did not lay down regulations for the disciples nor institute the recital of the Patimokkha Sariputta said that it was now time for the Blessed One to promulgate the regulations and to recite the Patimokkha so that the Holy Life might last for a long period
The Buddha said Let it be Sariputta
the Tathagata himself will know the time for it
The Master will not lay down regulations for the disciples nor recite the Patimokkha until signs of corruption have appeared in the Sangha
The disciple's concern that the Sasana should endure as long as possible is characteristic of Sariputta equally characteristic was it of the Buddha that he did not wish to lay down regulations until such time as it was absolutely necessary to do so
He went on to explain that at that time the leastadvanced member of the Sangha was a Sotapanna and therefore it was not yet necessary to lay down the rules of the bhikkhu life
The Catuma Sutta records another occasion when the great Elder was admonished by the Master
A large number of monks newly ordained as the Commentary tell us by the Venerable Sariputta and Maha Moggallana had come with the latter to pay their respects to the Buddha for the first time
On arrival they were allotted quarters and started chatting with the resident monks of Catuma
Hearing the noise the Buddha summoned the resident monks to question them about it and was told that the commotion was caused by the new arrivals
The text does not say the visiting monks were present at the time but they must have been for the Buddha addressed them with the words Go away monks I dismiss you
You should not stay with me
The newly ordained monks left but some persons intervened in their behalf and they were allowed to return
The Buddha then said to the Venerable Sariputta What did you think Sariputta when I dismissed that group of monks
The Venerable Sariputta replied I thought 'The Blessed One wishes to remain unconcerned and to abide in the state of happiness hereandnow so we too shall remain unconcerned and abide in the state of happiness hereandnow
Hold Sariputta
Do not allow such a thought ever to arise in you again the Buddha said
Then turning to Maha Moggallana he put the same question
When the Blessed One dismissed those monks replied Maha Moggallana I thought 'The Blessed One wishes to remain unconcerned and to abide in the state of happiness hereandnow
Then I and the Venerable Sariputta should now look after the community of monks' Well spoken Moggallana well spoken said the Master
It is either myself or Sariputta or Moggallana who should look after the community of monks
The Sutta account is lacking in certain details which would place the story in the proper light necessary for an understanding of all its implications but it is possible that since the monks who had been dismissed were pupils of Sariputta and Maha Moggallana the Elder wished to show his displeasure with them and to indicate by his aloofness that they had behaved badly
Once when the Buddha was residing at Jetavana the Venerable Sariputta was the victim of a false accusation
It so happened that at the end of the rains the Elder took leave of the Master and departed with his own retinue of monks on a journey
A large number of monks also took leave of Sariputta and in dismissing them he addressed those who were known by their personal and family names by those names
Among them there was a monk who was not known by his personal and family name but a strong desire arose in him that the Chief Disciple should address him by those names in taking his departure
In the great throng of monks however the Venerable Sariputta did not give him this distinction and the monk was aggrieved
He does not greet me as he does the other monks he thought and conceived a grudge against Sariputta
At the same time it chanced that the hem of the Elder's robe brushed against him and this added to his grievance
He approached the Buddha and complained Lord the Venerable Sariputta doubtless thinking to himself 'I am the Chief Disciple' struck me a blow that almost damaged my ear
And having done that without so much as begging my pardon he set out on his journey
The Buddha summoned Sariputta into his presence
Meanwhile the Venerable Maha Moggallana and the Venerable Ananda knowing that a calumny was about to be exposed summoned all the monks convoking an assembly
Approach venerable sirs they called
When the Venerable Sariputta is face to face with the Master he will roar the roar of a lion
And so it came about
When the Master questioned the great Elder instead of denying the charge he said O Lord one who is not firmly established in the contemplation of the body with regard to his body such a one may be able to hurt a fellow monk and leave without apologizing Then followed the Venerable Sariputta's lion's roar
He compared his freedom from anger and hatred with the patience of the earth which receives all things clean and unclean his tranquillity of mind to a bull with severed horns to a lowly Candala youth to water fire and wind and to the removal of impurity he compared the oppression he felt from his own body to the oppression of snakes and corpses and the maintenance of his body to that of fatty excrescences
In nine similes he described his own virtues and nine times the great earth responded to the words of truth
The entire assembly was moved by the majestic force of his utterance
As the Elder proclaimed his virtues remorse filled the monk who had unjustly traduced him
Immediately he fell at the feet of the Blessed One admitting his slander and confessing his fault
Thereupon the Buddha said Sariputta pardon this deluded man lest his head should split into seven pieces Sariputta's reply was Venerable sir I freely pardon this venerable monk And with joined palms he added May this venerable monk also pardon me if I have in any way offended him
In this way they were reconciled
The other monks were filled with admiration saying See brethren the surpassing goodness of the Elder
He cherishes neither anger nor hatred against this lying slanderous monk
Instead he crouches before him stretches his hands in reverence and asks his pardon
The Buddha's comment was Bhikkhus it is impossible for Sariputta and his like to cherish anger or hatred
Sariputta's mind is like the great earth firm like a gate post like a pool of still water
Another incident of this nature in the early Sangha did not end so happily for the calumniator refused to admit his fault
He was a monk named Kokalika who approached the Buddha with a slander against the two Chief Disciples Sariputta and Moggallana have bad intentions O Lord he said
They are in the grip of evil ambition
The Master replied Do not say so Kokalika
Do not say so
Have friendly and trustful thoughts towards Sariputta and Moggallana
They are of good behavior and lovable
But the misguided Kokalika paid no heed to the Buddha's words
He persisted with his false accusation and soon after that his whole body became covered with boils which continued to grow until eventually he died of his illness
This incident was wellknown
It is recorded in the following places in the Suttapitaka Brahma Samyutta No Sutta Nipata Mahavagga No Anguttara Nikaya and Takkariya Jataka
A comparison of these two incidents reveals the importance of penitence
Neither the Venerable Sariputta nor Maha Moggallana bore the monk Kokalika any illwill for his malice and his apologies had he offered them would have made no difference to the attitude of the two Chief Disciples
But they would have benefited the erring monk himself averting the consequences of his bad kamma
Evil rebounds upon those who direct it towards the innocent and so Kokalika was judged and punished by himself through his own deeds
We now come to the year of the Master's Parinibbana
The Blessed One had spent the rainy season at Beluva village near Vesali and when the Retreat was over he left that place and going by the way he had come returned by stages to Savatthi and arrived at the Jeta Grove Monastery
There the Elder Sariputta the Marshal of the Law paid homage to the Blessed One and went to his day quarters
When his own disciples had saluted him and left he swept the place and spread his leather mat
Then having rinsed his feet he sat down crosslegged and entered into the state of the Fruition Attainment of Arahatship
At the time predetermined by him he arose from the meditation and this thought occurred to him Do the Enlightened Ones have their final passing away first or the Chief Disciples And he saw that it is the Chief Disciples who pass away first
Thereupon he considered his own lifeforce and saw that its residue would sustain him only for another week
He then considered Where shall I have my final passing away And he thought Rahula finally passed away among the deities of the Thirtythree and the Elder Kondañña the Knower at the Chaddanta Lake
Where then will be my place
While thinking this over repeatedly he remembered his mother and the thought came to him Although she is the mother of seven Arahats she has no faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
Has she the supportive conditions in her to acquire that faith or has she not
Investigating the matter he discerned that she had the supportive conditions for the Pathintuition of streamentry
Then he asked himself Through whose instruction can she win to the penetration of truth
And he saw that not through anyone else's but only through his own instruction in the Dhamma could it come about
And following upon that came the thought If I now remain indifferent people will say 'Sariputta has been a helper to so many others on the day for instance when he preached the Discourse to the Deities of Tranquil Mind a large number of devas attained Arahatship and still more of them penetrated to the first three Paths and on other occasions there were many who attained to streamentry and there thousands of families who were reborn in heavenly worlds after the Elder had inspired them with joyous confidence in the Triple Gem
Yet despite this he cannot remove the wrong views of his own mother
Thus people may speak of me
Therefore I shall free my mother from her wrong views and shall have my final passing away in the very chamber where I was born
Having made that decision he thought This very day I shall ask the Master's permission and then leave for Nalaka And calling the elder Cunda who was his attendant he said Friend Cunda please ask our group of five hundred bhikkhus to take their bowls and robes for I wish to go to Nalaka And the elder Cunda did as he was bidden
The bhikkhus put their lodgings in order took their bowls and robes and presented themselves before the Elder Sariputta
He for his own part had tidied up his living quarters and swept the place where he used to spend the day
Then standing at the gate he looked back at the place thinking This is my last sight of it
There will be no more coming back
Then together with the five hundred bhikkhus he went to the Blessed One saluted him and spoke May O Lord the Blessed One permit may the Exalted One consent the time of my final passing away has come I have relinquished the lifeforce
Now says the text if the enlightened One were to have replied You may have your final passing away hostile sectarians would say that he was speaking in praise of death and if he had replied Do not have your final passing away they would say that he extolled the continuation of the round of existence
Therefore the Blessed One did not speak in either way but asked Where will your final passing away take place
The Venerable Sariputta replied In the Magadha country in the village called Nalaka there in the chamber of my birth shall I finally pass away
Then the Blessed One said Do Sariputta what you think timely
But now your elder and younger brethren in the Sangha will no longer have the chance to see a bhikkhu like you
Give them once more a discourse on Dhamma
The great Elder then gave a discourse displaying all his descending to mundane truth rising again and again descending he expounded the Dhamma directly and in symbols
And when he had ended his discourse he paid homage at the feet of the Master
embracing his legs he said So that I might worship these feet I have fulfilled the Perfections throughout an aeon and a hundred thousand kalpas
My heart's wish has found fulfillment
From now on there will be no more contact or meeting severed now is that intimate connection
The City of Nibbana the unaging undying peaceful blissful heatassuaging and secure which has been entered by many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas  I too shall enter it now
If any deed or word of mine did not please you O Lord may the Blessed One forgive me
It is now time for me to go
Now once before the Buddha had answered this when he said There is nothing be it in deeds or words wherein I should have to reproach you Sariputta
For you are learned Sariputta of great wisdom of broad and bright quick keen and penetrative wisdom
So now he made answer in the same way I forgive you Sariputta he said
But there was not a single word or deed of yours that was displeasing to me
Do now Sariputta what you think timely
From this we see that on those few occasions when the Master seemed to reproach his Chief Disciple it was not that he was displeased with him in any way but rather that he was pointing out another approach to a situation another way of viewing a problem
Immediately after the master had given his permission and the Venerable Sariputta had risen from paying homage at his feet the Great Earth cried out and with a single huge tremor shook to its watery boundaries
It was as though the Great Earth wished to say Though I bear these girdling mountain ranges with Mount Meru the encircling mountain walls and the Himavant I cannot sustain on this day so vast an accumulation of virtue And mighty thunder split the heavens a vast cloud appeared and heavy rain poured down
Then the Blessed One thought I shall now permit the Marshal of the Law to depart and he rose from the seat of the Law went to his Perfumed Cell and there stood on the Jewel Slab
Three times the Venerable Sariputta circumambulated the cell keeping it to his right and paid reverence at four places
And this thought was in his mind an aeon and a hundred thousand kalpas ago it was when I fell down at the feet of the Buddha Anomadassi and made the aspiration to see you
This aspiration has been realized and I have seen you
At the first meeting it was my first sight of you now it is my last and there will be none in the future And with raised hands joined in salutation he departed going backwards until the Blessed One was out of sight
And yet again the Great Earth unable to bear it trembled to its watery boundaries
The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus who surrounded him
Go bhikkhus he said
Accompany your elder brother At these words all the four assemblies of devotees at once went out of the Jeta Grove leaving the Blessed One there alone
The citizens of Savatthi also having heard the news went out of the city in an unending stream carrying incense and flowers in their hands and with their hair wet they followed the Elder lamenting and weeping
The Venerable Sariputta then admonished the crowd saying This is a road that none can avoid and asked them to return
And to the monks who had accompanied him he said You may turn back now
Do not neglect the Master
Thus he made them go back and with only his own group of disciples he continued on his way
Yet still some of the people followed him lamenting
Formerly our Venerable went on journeys and returned
But this is a journey without return To them the Elder said Be heedful friends
Of such nature indeed are all things that are formed and conditioned And he made them turn back
During his journey the Venerable Sariputta spent one night wherever he stopped and thus for one week he favored many people with a last sight of him
Reaching Nalaka village in the evening he stopped near a banyan tree at the village gate
It happened that at the time a nephew of the elder Uparevata by name had gone outside the village and there he saw the Venerable Sariputta
He approached the elder saluted him and remained standing
The Elder asked him Is your grandaunt at home Yes venerable sir he replied
Then go and announce our coming said the Elder
And if she asks why I have come tell her that I shall stay in the village for one day and ask her to prepare my birth chamber and provide lodgings for five hundred bhikkhus
Uparevata went to his grandaunt and said Grandaunt my uncle has come
Where is he now she asked
At the village gate
Is he alone or has someone else come with him
He has come with five hundred bhikkhus
And when she asked him Why has he come he gave her the message the elder had entrusted to him
Then she thought Why does he ask me to provide lodgings for so many
After becoming a monk in his youth does he want to be a layman again in his old age But she arranged the birth chamber for the Elder and lodgings for the bhikkhus had torches lit and then sent for the Elder
The Venerable Sariputta then accompanied by the bhikkhus went up to the terrace of the house and entered his birth chamber
After seating himself he asked the bhikkhus to go to their quarters
They had hardly left when a grave illness dysentery fell upon the Elder and he felt severe pains
When one pail was brought in another was carried out
The brahman lady thought The news of my son is not good and she stood leaning by the door of her own room
And then it happened the text tells us that the Four Great Divine Kings asked themselves Where may he now be dwelling the Marshal of the Law And they perceived that he was at Nalaka in his birth chamber lying on the bed of his Final Passing Away
Let us go for a last sight of him they said
When they reached the birth chamber they saluted the Elder and remained standing
Who are you asked the Elder
We are the Great Divine Kings venerable sir
Why have you come
We want to attend on you during your illness
Let it be said the Venerable Sariputta
There is an attendant here
You may go
When they had left there came in the same manner Sakka the king of the gods and after him Maha Brahma and all of them the elder dismissed in the same way
The brahman lady seeing the coming and going of these deities asked herself Who could they have been who came and paid homage to my son and then left And she went to the door of the elder's room and asked the Venerable Cunda for news about the Elder's condition
Cunda conveyed the inquiry to the Elder telling him The Great Upasika has come
The Venerable Sariputta asked her Why have you come at this unusual hour
To see you dear she replied
Tell me who were those who came first
The Four Great Divine Kings upasika
Are you then greater than they she asked
They are like temple attendants said the Elder
Ever since our Master took rebirth they have stood guard over him with swords in hand
After they had left who was it that came then dear
It was Sakka the king of the gods
Are you then greater than the king of gods dear
He is like a novice who carries a bhikkhu's belongings answered Sariputta
When our Master returned from the heaven of the Thirtythree Sakka took his bowl and robe and descended to earth together with him
And when Sakka had gone who was it that came after him filling the room with his radiance
Upasika that was your own Lord and Master the Great Brahma
Then are you greater my son even than my Lord the Great Brahma
Yes Upasika
On the day when our Master was born it is said that four Great Brahmas received the Great Being in a golden net
Upon hearing this the brahman lady thought If my son's power is such as this what must be the majestic power of my son's Master and Lord And while she was thinking this suddenly the fivefold rapture arose in her suffusing her entire body
The Elder thought Rapture and joy have arisen in my mother
Now is the time to preach the Dhamma to her And he said What was it you were thinking about upasika
I was thinking she replied if my son has such virtue what must be the virtue of his Master
The Venerable Sariputta answered At the moment of my Master's birth at his Great Renunciation on his attaining Enlightenment and at his first turning of the Dhamma Wheel  on all these occasions the ten thousand worldsystem quaked and shook
None is there who equals him in virtue in concentration in wisdom in deliverance and in the knowledge and vision of deliverance And he then explained to her in detail the words of homage Such indeed is that Blessed One
And thus he gave her an exposition of the Dhamma basing it on the virtues of the Buddha
When the Dhamma talk given by her beloved son had come to an end the brahman lady was firmly established in the Fruition of streamentry and she said Oh my dear Upatissa why did you act like that
Why during all these years did you not bestow on me this ambrosia
The Elder thought Now I have given my mother the brahman lady RupaSari the nursingfee for bringing me up
This should suffice and he dismissed her with the words You may go now upasika
When she was gone he asked What is the time now Cunda
Venerable sir it is early dawn
And the Elder said Let the community of bhikkhus assemble
When the bhikkhus had assembled he said to Cunda Lift me up to a sitting position Cunda And Cunda did so
Then the Elder spoke to the bhikkhus saying For fortyfour years I have lived and traveled with you my brethren
If any deed or word of mine was unpleasant to you forgive me brethren
And they replied Venerable sir not the least displeasure has ever come from you to us who followed you inseparably like your shadow
But may you venerable sir grant forgiveness to us
After that the Elder gathered his large robe around him covered his face and lay down on his right side
Then just as the Master was to do at his Maha Parinibbana he entered into the nine successive attainments of meditation in forward and reverse order and beginning again with the first absorption he led his meditation up to the fourth absorption
And at the moment after he had entered it just as the crest of the rising sun appeared over the horizon he utterly passed away into the Nibbanaelement which is without any remnant of clinging
And it was the fullmoon day of the month Kattika which by the solar calendar is between October and November
The brahman lady in her room thought How is my son
he does not say anything She rose and going into the Elder's room she massaged his legs
Then seeing that he had passed away she fell at his feet loudly lamenting O my dear son
Before this we did not know of your virtue
Because of that we did not gain the good fortune to have seated in this house and to feed many a hundred bhikkhus
We did not gain the good fortune to have built many monasteries And she lamented thus up to sunrise
As soon as the sun was up she sent for goldsmiths and had the treasure room opened and had the pots full of gold weighed on a large scale
Then she gave the gold to the goldsmiths with the order to prepare funeral ornaments
Columns and arches were erected and in the center of the village the upasika had a pavilion of heartwood built
In the middle of the pavilion a large gabled structure was raised surrounded by a parapet wall of golden arches and columns
Then they began the sacred ceremony in which men and deities mingled
After the great assembly of people had celebrated the sacred rites for a full week they made a pyre with many kinds of fragrant woods
They placed the body of the Venerable Sariputta on the pyre and kindled the wood with bundles of Usira roots
Throughout the night of the cremation the concourse listened to sermons on the Dhamma
After that the flames of the pyre were extinguished by the Elder Anuruddha with scented water
The Elder Cunda gathered together the relics and placed them in a filter cloth
Then the Elder Cunda thought I cannot tarry here any longer
I must tell the Fully Enlightened One of the final passing away of my elder brother the Venerable Sariputta the Marshal of the Law So he took the filter cloth with the relics and the Venerable Sariputta's almsbowl and robes and went to Savatthi spending only one night at each stage of the journey
These are the events released in the Commentary to the Cunda Sutta of the Satipatthana Samyutta with additions from the parallel version in the Commentary to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta
The narrative is taken up in the Cunda Sutta which follows
And the Venerable Sariputta passed away finally through that very illness
Then the Novice Cunda took the almsbowl and robes of the Venerable Sariputta and went to Savatthi to the Jeta Grove Anathapindika's park
There he betook himself to the Venerable Ananda and having saluted him seated himself at one side
Thus seated he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Venerable sir the Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing away
These are his bowl and robes
On this matter Cunda we ought to see the Blessed One
Let us go friend Cunda and meet the Master
Having met him we shall acquaint the Blessed One with that fact
Yes Venerable sir said the Novice Cunda
They went to see the Blessed One and having arrived there and saluted the Master they seated themselves at one side
Then the Venerable Ananda addressed the Blessed One
O Lord the Novice Cunda has told me this 'The Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing away
These are his bowl and robes' Then O Lord my own body became weak as a creeper everything around became dim and things were no longer clear to me when I heard about the final passing away of the Venerable Sariputta
How is this Ananda
When Sariputta had his final passing away did he take from you your portion of virtue or your portion of concentration or your portion of the knowledge and vision of deliverance
Not so Lord
When the Venerable Sariputta had his final passing away he did not take my portion of virtue concentration wisdom deliverance or my portion of the knowledge and vision of deliverance
But O Lord the Venerable Sariputta has been to me a mentor teacher and instructor one who rouses inspires and gladdens untiring in preaching Dhamma a helper of his fellow monks
And we remember how vitalizing enjoyable and helpful his Dhamma instruction was
Have I not taught you aforetime Ananda that it is the nature of all things near and dear to us that we must suffer separation from them and be severed from them
Of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not depart
That indeed is not possible
It is Ananda as though from a mighty hardwood tree a large branch should break off so has Sariputta now had his final passing away from this great and sound community of bhikkhus
Indeed Ananda of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not depart
This indeed is not possible
Therefore Ananda be ye an island unto yourself a refuge unto yourself seeking no external refuge with the Teaching as your island the Teaching your refuge seeking no other refuge
The Commentary takes up the narrative thus
These O monks are the shellcolored relics of the bhikkhu who not long ago asked for permission to have his final passing away
He who fulfilled the Perfections for an incalculable aeon and a hundred thousand kalpas  this was that bhikkhu
He who obtained the seat next to me  this was that bhikkhu
He who apart from me had none to equal him in wisdom throughout the whole tenthousandfold universe  this was that bhikkhu
Of great wisdom was this bhikkhu of broad wisdom bright wisdom quick wisdom of penetrative wisdom was this bhikkhu
Few wants had this bhikkhu he was contented bent on seclusion not fond of company full of energy an exhorter of his fellow monks censuring what is evil
He who went forth into homelessness abandoning the great fortune obtained through his merits in five hundred existences  this was that bhikkhu
He who in my Dispensation was patient like the earth  this was that bhikkhu
Harmless like a bull whose horns had been cut  this was that bhikkhu
Of humble mind like a Candala boy  this was that bhikkhu
See here O monks the relics of him who was of great wisdom of broad bright quick keen and penetrative wisdom who had few wants and was contented bent on seclusion not fond of company energetic  see here the relics of him who was an exhorter of his fellow monks who censured evil
Then the Buddha spoke the following verses in praise of his Great Disciple
When the Blessed One had thus lauded the virtues of the Venerable Sariputta he asked for a stupa to be built for the relics
After that he indicated to the Elder Ananda his wish to go to Rajagaha
Ananda informed the monks and the Blessed One together with a large body of bhikkhus journeyed to Rajagaha
At the time he arrived there the Venerable Maha Moggallana had also had his final passing away
The Blessed One took his relics likewise and had a stupa raised for them
Then he departed from Rajagaha and going by stages towards the Ganges he reached Ukkacela
There he went to the bank of the Ganges and seated with his following of monks he preached the Ukkacela Sutta on the Parinibbana of Sariputta and Maha Moggallana
The Blessed One surveyed the silent gathering of monks and then spoke to them saying
This assembly O bhikkhus appears indeed empty to me now that Sariputta and Maha Moggallana have passed away
Not empty for me is an assembly nor need I have concern for a place where Sariputta and Maha Moggallana dwell
Those who in the past have been Holy Ones
Fully enlightened Ones those Blessed Ones too had such excellent pairs of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Maha Moggallana
Those who in the future will be Holy Ones fully Enlightened Ones those Blessed Ones too will have such excellent pairs of disciples as I had in Sariputta and Maha Moggallana
Marvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning those disciples that they will act in accordance with the Master's Dispensation will act in according to his advice that they will be dear to the four Assemblies will be loved respected and honored by them
Marvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning the Perfect Ones that when such a pair of disciples has passed away there is no grief no lamentation on the part of the Perfect One
For of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not depart
That indeed is not possible
Therefore bhikkhus be ye an island unto yourselves a refuge unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Teaching as your island the Teaching your refuge seeking no other refuge
And with that profound and deeply moving exhortation which echoes again and again through the Buddha's Teaching up to the time of his own final passing away ends the story of the youth Upatissa who became the master's Chief Disciple the beloved Marshal of the Law The Venerable Sariputta died on the full moon of the month Kattika which begins in October and ends in November of the solar calendar
The death of Maha Moggallana followed a halfmonth later on the Uposatha of the New Moon
Half a year later according to tradition came the Parinibbana of the Buddha himself
Could such an auspicious combination of three great personages so fruitful in blessings to gods and men have been brought about purely by chance
We find the answer to that question in the Milindapañha where Nagasena says
So the weary round of becoming which linked them together in time came at last to its end time which is but the succession of fleeting events became for them the Timeless and round of birth and death gave place to the Deathless
And in their final lives they kindled a glory that has illumined the world
Long may it continue to do so
The suttas attributed to the Venerable Sariputta cover a wide range of subjects connected with the Holy Life from simple morality up to abstruse points of doctrine and meditational practice
A list of them together with a brief description of the subject matter of each is given below
their arrangement in the Sutta Pitaka does not give any indication of the chronological order in which they were delivered
Some few however contain references to particular events which make it possible to assign to them a period in the Buddha's ministry
One such is the Anathapindika Sutta preached just before the great lay disciple's death
Later when Dhanañjani was on his deathbed he requested the Elder to visit him and the Venerable Sariputta spoke to him on the way to Brahma through the Brahmaviharas
The Buddha mildly reproached the elder for not having led Dhanañjani to a higher understanding

The Venerable Sariputta is called to Anathapindika's deathbed and admonishes him to free his mind from any attachment whatsoever beginning with the six sense organs Thus should you train yourself householder 'I shall not cling to the eye and my consciousness will not attach itself to the eye' Thus householder should you train yourself This is repeated in full for each of the other five sense organs the six sense objects the sixfold consciousness sixfold contact sixfold feeling born of contact the six elements the five aggregates the four incorporeal jhanas and concludes with detachment from this world and all other worlds detachment from all things seen heard sensed and thought from all that is encountered sought and pursued in mind
In short detachment should be practiced as to the entire range of experience beginning with what for a dying person will be his immediate concern his sense faculties and their function
This call for detachment drawing ever wider circles and repeating the same mighty chord of thought must have had a deeply penetrating impact and a calming liberating even cheering influence on the dying devotee's mind
This was what Sariputta the skilled teacher obviously intended
And in fact his words had that impact because our text says that Anathapindika was moved to tears by the loftiness of the discourse one in profundity unlike any he had ever heard before
Anathapindika passed away soon after and was reborn as a deity in Tusita Heaven
Roman figures denote the number of the book and Arabic figures the number of the sutta
The division of the suttas in the Anguttara Nikaya is only numerical
Here it is said that if one finds in oneself four qualities one can know for certain that one has lost wholesome qualities and that this is what has been called deterioration by the Blessed One
These four are excessive greed excessive hate excessive delusion and lack of knowledge and wisdom concerning the diverse profound subjects
If on the other hand one finds in oneself four other qualities one can know for certain that one has not lost one's wholesome qualities and that this is what has been called progress by the Blessed One
These four other qualities are attenuated greed attenuated hate attenuated delusion and the possession of knowledge and wisdom concerning the diverse profound subjects
Sariputta replies to questions put by his nephew Jambukhadaka who was a Paribbajaka ie a nonBuddhist ascetic
As might be expected the Venerable Sariputta makes frequent appearances in the Jatakas the stories of the Buddha's previous lives
In these the Bodhisatta and Sariputta assume various roles in some existences we find Sariputta as the teacher and the Bodhisatta as pupil as for example in the Susima Cula Nandiya Silavimamsa Karandiya and Maha Dhammapala Jatakas
In the lastmentioned Jataka however the Bodhisatta as pupil gives his teacher Sariputta a valuable lesson not to give the Five Precepts indiscriminately to those who have no desire to accept them nor the intention to observe them
In several births Sariputta appears as a human being and the Bodhisatta an animal
Some examples are the Cula Nandiya Jataka the Romaka Jataka  where Sariputta as a wise ascetic instructs a partridge the Bodhisatta  the Bhojajaniya Jataka and the Dummedha Jataka
In other stories the roles are reversed as in the Jarudapana and Kundakakucchi Sindhava Jatakas where Sariputta is an animal and the Bodhisatta human
Sometimes as in the Kurungamiga Jataka both are animals
The following are summaries of Jatakas in which the Venerable Sariputta's previous personalities appear
On Sanchi Hill in Bhopal are the remains of ten stupas which are among the oldest buildings still standing in India
By their architectural features and sculpture they have always been recognised as belonging to the high noon of Buddhist art the characters in which their numerous inscriptions are written placing them at about the period of Asoka that is some time around the middle of the third century BSome are in good preservation while others have been reduced in the course of centuries to mere mounds of earth and stone
It was in one of these the now famous Third Stupa that Sir Alexander Cunningham discovered the sacred Body Relics of the Buddha's Chief Disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana in
At about the same time more relics of the two great Arahats were found in a stupa at Satadhara about six miles distant from Sanchi
On sinking a shaft in the center of the stupa on Sanchi Hill Cunningham came upon a large stone slab upwards of five feet in length lying in a direction from north to south
Beneath the slab were found two boxes of gray sandstone each with a brief inscription in Brahmi characters on the lid
The box to the south was inscribed Sariputtasa  of Sariputta while that to the north bore the legend MahaMogalanasa  of Maha Moggallana
The southernmost box contained a large flat casket of white steatite rather more than six inches broad and three inches in height
The surface was hard and polished and the box which had been turned on a lathe was a beautiful piece of workmanship
Around this casket were some fragments of sandalwood believed to have been from the funeral pyre while inside it besides the Relic various precious stones were found
This casket contained a single bone relic of the Venerable Sariputta not quite one inch in length
The stone box to the north enclosed another steatite casket similar to that of Sariputta but slightly smaller and with a softer surface
Inside it were two bone relics of the Venerable Maha Moggallana the larger of them being something less than half an inch in length
Each of the two steatite caskets had a single ink letter inscribed on the inner surface of the lid Sa for Sariputta on the southern and Ma for Maha Moggallana on that to the north
In Cunningham's words Sariputta and Maha Moggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha and were usually styled his right and left hand disciples
Their ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life This is explained by the fact that the Buddha customarily sat facing east
In the stupa at Satadhara one of a group which Cunningham noted was called locally Buddha Bhita or Buddha Monuments he discovered two caskets of pale mottled steatite
These were inscribed like those at Sanchi Sariputtasa and Maha Mogallanasa respectively
This stupa showed signs of having been violated by robbers but the bone relics had been left undistrubed
Cunningham who is a very capable archaeologist has left a detailed account of everything his excavations brought to light in these and other stupas and it is thanks to him that the authenticity of the relics is established beyond all doubt
The relics from both stupas were removed to England and placed in the Victoria and Albert Museum but some discrepancies between Cunningham's description of the caskets and the actual boxes in which the relics were deposited gives reason to believe that he or someone else transferred the relics from Sanchi to the caskets discovered at Satadhara and what became of the Sanchi steatite caskets is not known for certain
The Sacred Relics were preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum until when the Maha Bodhi Society approached the British government with a request that they be returned to India
The request was at once granted but owing to the outbreak of the second World War in that year the actual transfer was delayed for reasons of safety until Feb th
On that date they were handed over to the representatives of the Maha Bodhi Society at the Victoria and Albert Museum and so began their journey back to the land of their origin
Before being restored to India however the relics were taken to Sri Lanka where they were received with great honor and amid general rejoicing
For two and a half months in they were displayed for public worship at the Colombo Museum where it has been estimated that well over two million people paid homage to them
It is said that not only Buddhists but Hindus Christians and Muslims joined in paying reverence to them
The next stage of their journey to the new Vihara that was being erected for their reenshrinement at Sanchi was Calcutta
There the relics were displayed for public homage at the Dharmarajika Vihara headquarters of the Maha Bodhi Society of India
The same scenes of religious devotion were enacted there
Every day for two weeks an unbroken stream of people filed past the shrine where the relics were exposed from morning until late evening
Most of the devotees were Hindus but there was also a large number of Muslims among them and the reverence shown by all was a deeply impressive sight
Many had come from distant parts to pay their respects to the remains of these great sons of India
Next came a request from Burma that the relics should be taken for exposition here
This was readily granted
The reception given to them in that country revived all the pomp and religious fervor of ancient times
In order that everyone in Burma should be given an opportunity of worshipping them the relics were conducted on a riverine tour along the Irrawaddy from Mandalay to Rangoon
The steamer that conveyed them was escorted by boats decorated in traditional Burmese style and at every town along the river the relics were taken ashore in procession for worship at the chief pagoda
At the same time religious meetings were held drawing vast crowds of people from the adjacent villages to hear sermons and the recitation of suttas which usually continued all through the night
Subsequently at the request of the respective governments the relics were taken for exposition to Nepal and Ladakh
After they were returned to India the Burmese government asked that a portion of the Sacred Relics should be given to Burma
The Maha Bodhi Society of India agreed to this and the then Prime Minister of Burma went in person to Calcutta to receive them
They were ceremonially transferred to him on the th October
The portion allotted to Burma was afterwards enshrined in the Kaba Aye Zedi built on the site of the Sixth Great Buddhist Council close to Rangoon
The elaborate ceremonies connected with the crowning of the pagoda and the installation of the relics lasted from the th to th of March
Another portion was given to Sri Lanka to be enshrined in a new stupa built by the Maha Bodhi Society of Sri Lanka to receive them
At the time of writing they are housed in the temple of the Maha Bodhi Society Colombo awaiting the completion of the building
On the th November the remaining relics were duly enshrined at Sanchi on completion of the new Chetiyagiri Vihara built to receive them
There they remain objects of the deepest veneration to pilgrims from every Buddhist country and a lasting reminder of the lives of those in whom the Buddha's Teaching bore its finest fruit
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Pleasance
The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus and they replied to him saying Reverend Sir The Blessed One spoke as follows
Five things should be reflected on from time to time by the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness
What five
When evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion arise in a bhikkhu through reflection on an adventitious object he should reflect on a different object which is connected with skill
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like an experienced carpenter or carpenter's apprentice striking hard at pushing out and getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one should the bhikkhu in order to get rid of the adventitious object reflect on a different object which is connected with skill
Then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If the evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who in order to get rid of an adventitious object reflects on a different object which is connected with skill he should ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of misery
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like a welldressed young man or woman who feels horrified humiliated and disgusted because of the carcass of a snake dog or human that is hung round his or her neck should the bhikkhu in whom unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the object which is connected with skill ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of misery
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who ponders on their disadvantageousness he should in regard to them endeavor to be without attention and reflection
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like a keeneyed man shutting his eyes and looking away from some direction in order to avoid seeing visible objects come within sight should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his pondering on their disadvantageousness endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards them
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards evil unskillful thoughts he should reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughts
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Just as a man finding no reason for walking fast walks slowly finding no reason for walking slowly stands finding no reason for standing sits down finding no reason for sitting down lies down and thus getting rid of a posture rather uncalm resorts to a restful posture just so should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts arise in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection regarding them reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughts
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his reflection on the removal of a source of unskillful thoughts he should with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mind
Then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like a strong man holding a weaker man by the head or shoulders and restraining subduing and beating him down should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the source of unskillful thoughts restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mind with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate
Then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
When indeed bhikkhus evil unskillful thoughts due to reflection on an adventitious object are eliminated when they disappear and the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within through his reflection on an object connected with skill through his pondering on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts his endeavoring to be without attentiveness and reflection as regards those thoughts or through his restraining subduing and beating down of the evil mind by the good mind with clenched teeth and tongue pressing on the palate that bhikkhu is called a master of the paths along which thoughts travel
The thought he wants to think that he thinks the thought he does not want to think that he does not think
He has cut down craving removed the fetter rightly mastered pride and made an end of suffering
The Blessed One said this and the bhikkhus glad at heart approved of his words
Thus have I heard evam me sutam
This Discourse on the Removal of Distracting Thoughts was heard by me in this way
Me refers to the Elder Ananda who recited the Discoursecollection of the Pali canon at the first Council of purified ones held at Rajagaha after the passing away of the Buddha
By the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness adhicittam anuyuttena bhikkhuna
Consciousness connected with the practice of the ten courses of skillful action is referred to here as just consciousness
Superior to that is the consciousness of the eight absorptions become a basis for the development of insight
This consciousness is the higher consciousness
Consciousness of the eight absorptions that has become a basis for the development of insight is meant here by higher consciousness
Some say that the consciousness associated with insight is the higher consciousness
By one who is intent on means by one who is diligently occupied with
This bhikkhu is not intent on the higher consciousness the while he is going forth sittingmat in hand to a place near a tree in a jungle thicket at the bottom of a hill or on a slope with the thought I shall do the recluse's duty He is also not intent on that when removing grass and leaves for the sitting place with hands or feet
When however having sat down after washing his hands and feet he remains with legs crossed having taken up his preliminary subject of meditation he is indeed intent on the higher consciousness
Intent on means intent on producing the yet unarisen higher things and zealously developing to completion the higher things that have already arisen
The preliminary subject of meditation is the subject of meditation the bhikkhu is fostering
When he remains having taken up means when having taken up the preliminary subject of meditation he remains applying himself to it
Though full absorption is not reached through the meditation he is still one intent on the higher consciousness
Things nimittani are practical methods  reasonable ways
From time to time kalena kalam means on different occasions
Is not the subject of meditation to be reflected on always without putting it aside even for a moment
Why did the Blessed One say from time to time
There are thirtyeight subjects classified in the text
By the bhikkhu who having selected one of these one which appeals to him and is seated there is no reflection on these five things so long as imperfections do not appear
When an imperfection appears the danger should be driven away by means of these things
Pointing out this the Blessed One said From time to time The opinion of the objector is as follows Because it is said by him who is intent on the higher consciousness  and as the term intent on the higher consciousness means diligently applying oneself to the meditation without a break is it not the fact that the Blessed One began his exposition with the words these five things should be reflected on from time to time in order to point out the method of driving out danger to the meditation that progresses
The other stated that there are thirtyeight subjects of meditation in the text and so forth in order to point out that the Master said From time to time because these five things have to be reflected on at the proper time for the purpose of purifying the mind of the beginner devoted to inner culture when sometimes imperfections of meditation arise in him
Connected with desire chandupasamhita means associated with desire associated with lust
The field and the object of these three obsessive thoughts should be known
The eight kinds of consciousness associated with greed are the field of obsessive thoughts connected with desire
The two kinds of consciousness associated with hatred are the field of obsessive thoughts connected with hate
Even the twelve kinds of unwholesome consciousness are the field of obsessive thoughts connected with delusion
The two kinds of consciousness combining with scepsis and restlessness indeed are equally the field of these obsessive thoughts connected with delusion
To even all three kinds of obsessive thought just living beings and inanimate things are the object since these obsessive thoughts come into being in regard to living beings and inanimate things viewed unimpartially by way of liking and disliking them
Living beings and inanimate things are unimpartially viewed by way of liking and disliking when the dear and the not dear are unequally seen are wrongly seen
Viewing unimpartially is the laying hold of an object with unsystematic attention through looking in ignorantly in a worldly way
He should reflect on a different object which is connected with skill aññam nimittam manasikatabbam kusalupasamhitam means an object different from the adventitious object and one which is connected with skill should be reflected on
Here the explanation of the term different object is as follows When a thought connected with desire for living beings arises the development of the idea of the unlovely is a different object and when a thought connected on with desire for inanimate things arises the reflection on impermanence is a different object
When a thought connected with hate towards living beings arises the development of the idea of friendliness is a different object and when a thought connected with hate for inanimate things arises the reflection on the modes of materiality is a different object
Wheresoever a thought connected with delusion concerning living beings or things arises the fivefold reliance associated with the doctrine is the different object
An object different from the adventitious object tato nimittato aññam nimittam
A different new object separate from the cause for the arising of unskillful thought connected with desire hate and delusion
One which is connected with skill kusala nimittotam
The cause for the proceeding of states of consciousness that is with skill
Should be reflected on manasikatabbam
Should be placed in the mind should be thought upon as a meditation or should go in the mindflux
The unlovely is indeed the unlovely object
When greed arises in regard to living beings with thoughts like the following This one's hands are beautiful This one's feet are beautiful one should think by way of the unlovely thus To what are you attached
Are you attached to the hair of the head the hair of the body nails teeth skin or urine

This body held up by three hundred bones bound with nine hundred nerve strings plastered over with nine hundred lumps of flesh wrapped completely in a wet skin covered with the color of the cuticle drips filth from the nine open sores and the ninetynine thousand pores of the hairs of the body
It is filled with a collection of bones is badsmelling contemptible repellent and is the sum of the thirtytwo parts
There is neither essence nor excellence in it
To one who thinks thus of the unlovely the greed connected with living beings is cast out
Therefore the different object is the thinking on the object which produces greed by way of the meditation on the unlovely
When there is greed for inanimate things like bowls and robes it is cast out through reflection of two kinds of bringing about detachment for inanimate things namely those on ownerlessness and temporariness taught in the section of the enlightenment factors in the commentary to the Satipatthana Sutta
Therefore the thinking on the object by way of the reflection of impermanence is the different object
Reflection on ownerlessness and temporariness this bowl gradually ends up as broken pieces having changed color became old developed cracks and holes or having smashed up this robe having faded worn out will have to be thrown away with the end of a stick after it is used as a rag to wipe the feet with
If these had an owner he would prevent them from being destroyed
In this manner should the reflection on ownerlessness be done
And the reflection on temporariness should be done with the thought that these cannot last long that these are of brief duration
When there is hatred towards living beings friendliness should be developed as taught in the discourse on the Overcoming of Illwill the instruction with the Parable of the Saw and the like
In one developing friendliness hatred vanishes
Therefore the development of friendliness for the object is the different object
The discourse on the Overcoming of Illwill in the Anguttara Nikaya is as follows
Bhikkhus these are the five ways of overcoming illwill
Whenever illwill is arisen in a bhikkhu it should altogether be overcome
What are the five
Should illwill arise at any time in a person friendliness should be developed in him compassion should be developed in him equanimity should be developed in him the state of being without mindfulness and reflection should be developed in him Thus should illwill be overcome in that person
Indeed these are five ways of overcoming illwill
Wherever it is arisen in a bhikkhu it should be overcome entirely
And the like similes like that of the firebrand from funeral pyre
Friendliness should be developed having overcome hate in the manner taught in the above mentioned teachings
Further when one gets angry with the stump a thorn grass or leaves one should ask oneself With whom are you angry
Or who is it that is angry
Is it the earthelement or the waterelement
To one who reflects on the elements anger in regard to inanimate things vanishes
Therefore the reflection of the elements of the object is the different object
When however delusion appears in any circumstances there should be dependence on reliance on or the resorting to five things
They are as follows
The practice of living under the guidance of a teacher
The work of learning the doctrine
The work of inquiring into the meaning of doctrines learned
The act of listening to the doctrine at suitable times
The work of inquiring into what are and what are not causes
Through dependence on these five things or through resorting to these five expedients the element of delusion is eliminated
In this way also a bhikkhu's delusion is eliminated When he while learning too becomes energetic through the thought The teacher punishes him who does not learn at the proper time him who does not recite well and him who does not recite at all
In this way also a bhikkhu's delusion is eliminated When he while inquiring from esteemed and respected bhikkhus after going into their presence Reverend Sir how is this
What does this mean dispels doubts
In this way also a bhikkhu's delusion is eliminated When to him the meaning of various passages becomes clear while listening carefully to the doctrine after going to a place where the doctrine is expounded to the public
In this way also a bhikkhu's delusion is eliminated While he becomes expert in discerning the cause of a thing from what is not its cause saying thus This is the reason for this this not the reason
Further unskillful thoughts are surely eliminated in one practicing by any one of the thirtyeight subjects of meditation but the lust hatred and delusion which are eliminated by their direct opposites by what is contrary to them namely these five objects are thoroughly eliminated
It is like this a fire may surely be put out after its being struck with firebrands earth and branches but when it is extinguished with water which is directly opposed to it it is extinguished well
In the same way the lust hatred and delusion which is eliminated with these five objects are eliminated well
Therefore it should be understood were these stated
Becomes energetic
The bhikkhu who is possessed of the desire for things like the asking of permission to go to the village becomes energetic and active
The meaning of various passages becomes clear  to one listening to the doctrine the meaning of different passages explained becomes clear with the comprehension thus Here virtue is expounded here concentration here wisdom
Expert in discerning the cause of a thing from what is not its cause by knowing for instance that the eye visible object light and so forth are the reasons for eyeconsciousness and not for earconsciousness
Connected with skill
Dependent on skill become a condition of skill
Just within
Just inside the pasture that is just within the resort the subjectofmeditation of the bhikkhu devoted to the higher consciousness
Carpenter  joiner
With a fine peg
A peg of heartwood finer than some peg one wishes to take out of a board
Coarse peg
An incongruous peg in a board or plank of sandalwood or of a heartwood
In a board of heartwood  in a plank of sandal heartwood
An incongruous peg  a peg standing incompatibly there in a board or plank of sandalwood
The mind of the bhikkhu intent on the higher consciousness is like the plank of sandal heartwood the unskillful thoughts are like the incongruous peg the skillful object of meditation on things such as the unlovely which is different from the object producing unskillfulness is like the fine peg
The removal of unskillful objects such as the meditation on the unlovely is like the removal of the coarse with the fine peg
If the yogin who like a person shocked by the carcass slung round his neck by an enemy who has brought it thinks wisely by himself of these unskillful thoughts as blamable and productive of suffering in many ways the unskillful thoughts are eliminated in him
But he who is unable to think wisely by himself should see his teacher and tell the teacher about the troubles
Or he should see his preceptor a respected fellowbhikkhu or the chief of the order for the same purpose
Or he should ring the bell assemble even the order of bhikkhus and inform the order of the troubles
For at a meeting of many persons there surely will be one learned man who will explain to him who is troubled Thus should the disadvantages of these thoughts be understood or he will check these thoughts of the person troubled in meditation with the talk that is intended for the removal of desire for the body and so forth
Should endeavor to be without attention and reflection
Those unskillful thoughts should just not be remembered not be dwelt upon
One should be occupied with something else
Just as a man who does not want to see a certain object shuts his eyes just so should the bhikkhu in whom an unskillful thought arises while he is meditating on the subject of meditation to which he resorts repeatedly occupy himself with something else
By doing that his unskillful thought is eliminated
When that unskillful thought is eliminated he should again sit down to meditate on the subjectofmeditation he is keeping to preliminary object of meditation to which he repeatedly resorts
If the unskillful thought is not eliminated he should recite aloud some composition of doctrinal explanation he knows by heart
If when being occupied with something else in this way too it is not eliminated he should take out from his bag a manual if he has one in which the virtues of the Buddha and the Doctrine are written and by reading it occupy himself with something else
If by that too it is not eliminated he should take out of the bag such things like the pair of firesticks and by turning his attention to them saying This is the upper firestick this is the lower and so forth occupy himself with something else
If by that too it is not eliminated he should having taken out the receptacle by contemplating the requisites thus This is the awl this is the pair of scissors this is the nailcutter this is the needle occupy himself with something else
If by that too it is not eliminated he should occupy himself with something else by darning the wornout parts of the robe
So long as the unskillful thought is not eliminated he should by doing various skillful actions occupy himself with something else
When it is eliminated he should again sit down to meditate on the subject he is keeping to
Composition of doctrinal explanation  a composition helpful to the subjectofmeditation
Manual
A book carried about and which is about the size of the fist
By contemplating  by concentrating
But building work should not be begun
Why
Because when the unskillful thought is destroyed there will be no time for reflection on the subjectofmeditation
But wise ones of old destroyed unskillful thought having done building work too
no time because of the making complete of what is begun
The bringing to an end of what is begun or not beginning is the counsel of the elder 
This is a story connected with building activity
The preceptor of Tissa the novice it is said was staying at the great monastery of the city of Tissa
Reverend Sir said the novice to the preceptor I am dissatisfied Then the elder said to the novice Water for bathing is scarce in this monastery
Take me to Cittalapabbata The novice did that
There the Thera told him This monastery is very largely property made over to the use of the Order as a whole
Make me a personal dwelling place
Good Reverend Sir said the novice
He began to do three things at once
The learning of the Samyutta Nikaya from the beginning the clearing of a cave on a hill and work on the preliminary stage of practice on the meditation on fire and reached absorption in the subjectofmeditation learned the Samyutta Nikaya to the end and finished clearing the cave
Having done all he informed the preceptor about the completion of the tasks
The preceptor said Novice it was done by you with difficulty
Today you yourself first stay there
The novice while staying that night in the cave having obtained suitable weather conditions developed insight reached arahantship and passed away just there
Having taken his bones they built a shrine
To this day that shrine is known as the shrine of the elder Tissa
While exerting himself in clearing the cave just to check unskillful thoughts in reciting the Samyutta Nikaya and in the practice of the preparatory part of the meditation on the firedevice for doing the work that precedes the function of seeing the truth through Streamwinning he accumulated the merit of the three kinds of skillful action of body speech and mind
The elder said Water for bathing is scarce in this monastery
Take me to Cittalapabbata having known the novice's latent tendency and his particular meditationdevice
Therefore everything was effected according to his intention
This is called the section dealing with nonattention on account of the explanation in it of the manner of checking the flow of unskillful thoughts by not attending to them
He again said If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu and so forth in order to set forth the section of inquiry into the source of the unskillful thoughts
The section of inquiry into the source of the unskillful thoughts is the making clear of the source of the source of unskillful thoughts
He should reflect on the removal of the thought source of those unskillful thoughts
What is forming is formation condition cause source is the meaning
That state in which there is stopping or ending is stopping or ending
This is stated What is the cause of this unskillful thought
What is its condition
By what reason has it arisen
Thinking thus the source of the unskillful thoughts and the source of the unskillful thoughts and the source of the source should be reflected on by the yogin
Just as if bhikkhus a man should walk fast and then to him it should occur thus But why do I walk fast
Now let me walk slowly And as if then he should walk slowly and it should occur to him thus Why do I walk slowly
Now let me stand

But why do I walk slowly He thinks thus What profit is there to me by this fast walking
I shall walk slowly
And as if then he should walk slowly as if he having thought in the foregoing way should walk slowly
This is the method of explanation throughout
The man's walking fast is comparable to the bhikkhu's entry into the state of unskillful thinking the walking slowly to the cutting off of unskillful thoughtconduct the standing to the descent of the subjectofmeditation into the bhikkhu's mind with the cutting off of unskillful thoughtconduct the sitting down to the attainment of arahantship through the development of insight the lying down to passing the day in the attainment of the fruit that has Nibbana for its object
In him who goes to the source and the source of that source of unskillful thoughts questioning himself thus Possessed of what cause due to what condition are the unskillful thoughts there is a slackening of unskillful thoughts when the slackening of unskillful thought conduct reaches its highest point unskillful thoughts are entirely dissolved
What produces unskillful thoughts is the source of unskillful thought
It is the condition for unskillful thoughts unwise reflection on the sensuously favorable etc taking them as lovely etc

The state indeed by which the production of unskillful thoughts ends is called the removal of the source of unskillful thought
The source of unskillful thought is the delusion of perceiving unlovely things and so forth as lovely and so forth
Therefore it is said the source and the source of that source should be reflected on
In him who goes to the source of unskillful thoughts  in him who goes along the domain of knowledge by way of investigation to the root of wrong thoughts to the cause of their arising
There is a slackening of unskillful thoughtconduct
In him who knows according to reality unskillful thoughts do not continuously proceed as in the time before he knew truly
When the slackening of unskillful thoughtconduct reaches its highest point through arriving at a stable state gradually
Unskillful thoughts are entirely dissolved
Even all wrong thoughts go do not assail one or owing to the completion of the meditation are eliminated without remainder
The meaning should be brought out through the Daddabha birthstory
It is said that a ripe vilva fruit having been cut off from its stalk fell close to the ear of a hare which was asleep at the foot of the vilva tree
Getting up on hearing that noise it thought The earth is being destroyed and fled
The other beasts which were in front of him fled too seeing the hare's flight
At that time the Bodhisatta was a lion and he thought The earth is destroyed at the end of an eon
In the interval there is no destruction of the earth
Now let me after going from source to source find out
The lion questioned each animal separately beginning with the elephant
When he came to the hare he asked Dear did you see the earth being destroyed The hare Yes lord The lion Come friend show The hare I am not able sire Saying Hey come don't fear the lion using gentle speech alternately with firm speech took the hare along with him
The hare standing not far from the vilva tree said May there be blessing to thee
In that place in which I stayed it echoed
I do not know why it echoed
The Bodhisatta told the hare You stay here and went up to the tree
He saw where the hare had lain saw the ripe vilva fruit and looking upwards saw the fruitstalk from which the fruit had fallen and concluded as follows This hare whilst lying asleep here got the idea that the earth was being destroyed when he heard the sound of the fruit that fell near his ear Then he questioned the hare to see if the facts he had found out were true
The hare said Yes lord confirming the lion's conclusions
The lion thereupon uttered this stanza
The hare ran after the echoing sound of the vilva fruit that fell
Having listened to the hare's words the army of frightened beasts ran
After that the Bodhisatta comforted the beasts saying Don't fear
Thus unskillful thoughts are eliminated in him who goes from source to source
It is said that beneath the place where the hare was sleeping there was a huge rat hole  a big excavation made by rats  and that the fruit falling on the ground above it caused a loud sound
With the repetition of the words If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise the Master points out to the bhikkhu who fails to check the unskillful thoughts according to the instruction in the section of inquiring into the source of unskillful thoughts another method
With clenched teeth with the upper teeth placed on the lower
The mind by the mind
The unskillful state of mind should be checked by the skillful state of mind
Strong man
Just as if a brawny man  a person with great physical strength  should having caught hold of a weaker one by head or body restrain subdue and beat down that weaker person  make him wearied exhausted and to faint  just so should the unskillful thoughts be checked by the bhikkhu who wrestles with the unskillful thoughts having overcome them saying Who are you and who am I and after whipping up great energy saying Let the flesh and blood of this body dry up let skin sinews and bones remain To point out the foregoing meaning the Master gave the simile of the strong man
The unskillful state of mind  the unskillful state of mind with such things like sensual thought
Should be checked
Should after overcoming be checked thus in such a way that in the future no unskillful thoughts assail the bhikkhu
The state of the nonarising of things should be produced is the meaning
When indeed Bhikkhu
This is called the division of summing up
The meaning of the phrase is even clear
The division of that which was pointed out from the beginning thus Five things should be reflected on from time to time by the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness by way of the summing up of the time of reflection of his object mentioned in the passage
As a teacher of archery having taught the art of the five weapons to a prince come from a foreign country spurs him on thus Go and take up the rulership of your country after showing him what ought to be done with the five weapons thus If robbers meet you on the way use the bow if that is destroyed or broken use the spear the sword and go And having done this having gone to his own country taken up the rulership the prince enjoys the fortune of sovereignty
If to the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness objects productive of unskillfulness arise during his meditation he having established himself in the instruction of the section of the different object and checked those unskillful thoughts will reach saintship after developing insight unable to do it in that way he will do it by the instruction of the section on disadvantages unable to do it in that way he will do it in that way too by the instruction of the section of searching the cause unable to do it in that way too by the instruction of the section of restraining he will develop insight and reach saintship
He is called a master of the paths taken by the turns of thought
He is called one who is expert of control in the paths taken by the turns of thoughts one who is conversant with the art of control in the paths taken by the turns of thought
The thought he will intend
This was said to show his expertness of control
Formerly he was not able to think as he wanted and thought what he did not want to think about
Now owing to his expertness in the control of thought he is able to think as he wishes
Therefore it was said The thoughts he will want to think those thoughts he will think
The thoughts he will not want to think those thoughts he will not think
He has cut off craving
This and the rest should be understood as taught in the Sabbasava Suttanta Commentary
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Spiritual progress depends on the emergence of five cardinal virtues  faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdom
The conduct of the ordinary worldling is governed by his sensebased instincts and impulses
As we progress new spiritual forces gradually take over until in the end the five cardinal virtues dominate and shape everything we do feel and think
These virtues are called in Sanskrit and Pali indriya variously translated by faculties controlling faculties or spiritual faculties
The same five virtues are called powers if emphasis is on the fact that they are unshakable by their opposites
Faith is called the seed and without it the plant of spiritual life cannot start at all
Without faith one can as a matter of fact do nothing worthwhile at all
This is true not only of Buddhism but of all religions and even the pseudoreligions of modern times such as Communism
And this faith is much more than the mere acceptance of beliefs
It requires the combination of four factors  intellectual volitional emotional and social
Intellectually faith is an assent to doctrines which are not substantiated by immediately available direct factual evidence
To be a matter of faith a belief must go beyond the available evidence and the believer must be willing and ready to fill up the gaps in the evidence with an attitude of patient and trusting acceptance
Faith taken in this sense has two opposites ie a dull unawareness of the things which are worth believing in and doubt or perplexity
In any kind of religion some assumptions are taken on trust and accepted on the authority of scriptures or teachers
Generally speaking faith is however regarded as only a preliminary step as a merely provisional state
In due course direct spiritual awareness will know that which faith took on trust and longed to know Now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face Much time must usually elapse before the virtue of wisdom has become strong enough to support a vigorous insight into the true nature of reality
Until then quite a number of doctrinal points must be taken on faith
What then in Buddhism are the objects of faith
They are essentially four the belief in karma and rebirth the acceptance of the basic teachings about the nature of reality such as conditioned coproduction emptiness etc confidence in the Three Refuges the Buddha the Dharma and the Order and a belief in the efficacy of the prescribed practices and in Nirvana as the final way out of our difficulties
I shall say more about them when I have dealt with the other aspects of faith
In this skeptical age we anyway dwell far too much on the intellectual side of faith
shraddha the word we render as faith is etymologically akin to Latin cor the heart and faith is far more a matter of the heart than of the intellect
It is as Prof
Radhakrishnan incisively puts it the striving after selfrealization by concentrating the powers of the mind on a given idea Volitionally faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will
It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the selfconfidence that one can do it
Suppose that people living on the one side of a river are doomed to perish from many enemies diseases and famine
Safety lies on the other shore
The man of faith is then likened to the person who swims across the river braving its dangers saving himself and inspiring others by his example
Those without faith will go on dithering along the hither bank
The opposites to this aspect of faith are timidity cowardice fear wavering and a shabby mean and calculating mentality
Emotionally faith is an attitude of serenity and lucidity
Its opposite here is worry the state of being troubled by many things
It is said that someone who has faith loses the five terrors ie he ceases to worry about the necessities of life about loss of reputation death unhappy rebirth and the impression he may make on an audience
It is fairly obvious that the burden of life must be greatly lightened by belief in karma emptiness or notself
Even an unpleasant fate can be accepted more easily when it is understood as a dispensation of justice when vexations are explained as an inevitable retribution when law seems to rule instead of blind chance when even apparent loss is bound to turn into true gain
And if there is no self what and whom do we worry about
If there is only one vast emptiness what is there to disturb our radiance
Socially and that is more difficult to understand faith involves trust and confidence in the Buddha and the Sangha
Its opposite here is the state of being submerged in cares about one's sensory social environment cares which spring from either social pressure or social isolation
The break with the normal social environment is of course complete only in the case of the monk who as the formula goes in faith forsakes his home To a lesser extent it must be carried out by every practitioner of the Dharma who must live apart from his society in spirit if not in fact
The company of others and the help we expect from them are usually a mainstay of our sense of security
By going for refuge to the Buddha and the Sangha one turns from the visible and tangible to the invisible and elusive
By placing one's reliance on spiritual forces one gains the strength to disregard public opinion and social discouragement
Some measure of defiant contempt for the world and its ways is inseparable from a spiritual life
The spiritual man does not belong to his visible environment in which he is bound to feel rather a stranger
He belongs to the community of the saints to the family of the Buddha
Buddhism substitutes a spiritual for the natural environment with the Buddha for the father the Prajnaparamita for the mother the fellowseekers for brothers and sisters relatives and friends
It is with these more invisible forces that one must learn to establish satisfactory social relations
In carrying out this task faith requires a considerable capacity for renunciation
This concludes our survey of the four factors which go into the making of faith
Like other spiritual qualities faith is somewhat paradoxical in that in one sense it is a gift which one cannot obtain by merely wanting to and in another sense it is a virtue that can be cultivated
The capacity for faith varies with the constitution of the individual and his social circumstances
It is usual to classify types of personality according to whether they are dominated by greed hatred or confusion
Those who walk in greed are said to be more susceptible to faith than the other two because of the kinship which exists between faith and greed
To quote Buddhaghosa As on the unwholesome plane greed clings and takes no offense so faith on the wholesome plane
As greed searches for objects of sensedesire so faith for the qualities of morality etc
As greed does not let go that which is harmful so faith does not let go that which is beneficial
As regards social conditions there are ages of faith and ages of unbelief
The present age rather fosters unbelief
It puts a premium on intellectual smartness so that faith is easily held to indicate nothing but a weak head or a lack of intellectual integrity
It multiplies the distractions from the sensory world to such an extent that the calm of the invisible world is harder to reach than ever
It exposes the citizen to so great a variety of conflicting viewpoints that he finds it hard to make a choice
The prestige of science the concern with a high standard of living and the disappearance of all institutions of uncontested authority are the chief foes of faith in our presentday society
It is largely a matter of temperament whether we believe that matters will improve in the near future
As a virtue faith is strengthened and built up by selfdiscipline and not by discussing opinions
Intellectual difficulties are by no means the most powerful among the obstacles to faith
Doubts are inevitable but how one deals with them depends on one's character
The first of our four articles of faith well illustrates this situation
There are many sound reasons for accepting the rebirth doctrine
This is not the place to expound them and I must be content to refer the reader to the very impressive EastWest Anthology on Reincarnation which J
Head and SCranston have published in
Yet although belief in rebirth is perfectly rational and does not conflict with any known fact the range of the average person's vision is so limited that he has no access to the decisive evidence which is direct and immediate experience
The rebirth doctrine assumes at least two things that behind the natural causality which links together events in the world of sense there are other invisible chains of a moral causality which assures that all good acts are rewarded all bad actions punished and that this chain of moral sequences is not interrupted by death but continues from rebirth to rebirth
To the average person these two assumptions cannot be proved absolutely conclusively and beyond the possibility of a doubt
However plausible they may seem on rational grounds Buddhism teaches that they become a matter of direct experience only after the superknowledges have been developed
The fourth superknowledge is the recollection of one's own previous rebirths and the fifth the knowledge of the rebirths of other people by which one sees that whatever happens to them happens in accordance with their deeds There are many wellauthenticated cases of persons spontaneously remembering certain details of one or the other of their own previous lives and these people obviously have an additional reason for belief in rebirth which is lacking in those who cannot recall ever having lived before
Full certitude on the issue is however given to those only who can on the basis of the fourth jhana and by taking definite prescribed and disciplined steps on emerging from that jhana recall their manifold former lives according to the wellknown formula There I was that was my name that was my family that was my caste such was my food this was the happiness this the suffering which I experienced this was the duration of my lifespan
Deceased there I was born elsewhere and there had this name etc When a monk has practiced properly and successfully these things become as clear to him as if lit up by a lamp
Until that time comes we cannot claim that we fully know the doctrine of karma and rebirth to be true
We take it partly on faith
And this faith of ours is maintained less by our dialectical skill as by the virtues of patience and courage
For we must be willing to wait patiently until we are spiritually ripe for the emergence of the superknowledges however far off that might seem to be
And secondly we must be willing to take risks
Life nowhere offers a one hundred per cent security and for our convictions least of all
Employed in gaining wealth a merchant must risk his property
Employed in taking life a soldier must risk his own life
Employed in saving his soul the spiritual man must risk his own soul
The stake automatically increases with the prospect of gain
Of course we may be mistaken
I sometimes wonder what I would think if on dying I would not as I now fondly imagine wake up on the Bardo plane but find myself confronted with Acheron and the threeheaded Cerberus or worse still were illtreated with fire and brimstone in a Christian hell
The experience would I admit be rather disconcerting
All that I can say in the face of such uncertainty is that I am willing to take the consequences and that I hope that my fund of boldness audacity and good humor will not run out
One has the choice to magnify intellectual doubts or to minimize them
It seems not unreasonable that one should blame the difficulties of the teaching on one's own distance from the truth one's own intellectual and moral imperfections
How can one expect to remember one's past lives if at present one cannot even recall hour by hour what one did during one single day a mere month ago
If one hesitates to accept as not immediately obvious the doctrine that this world is the result of ignorance and of the craving of nonexistent individuals for nonexistent objects  is this not perhaps due to the very denseness of one's own ignorance for which one can collect plenty of proofs all day long
Doubts are effectively overcome when one purifies one's own life so as to become more worthy of knowledge
It is a condition of all learning that one accepts a great deal on trust that one gives the teacher the benefit of the doubt
Otherwise one can learn nothing at all and remains shut out from all truth
To have faith means to take a deep breath to tear oneself away from the daily cares and concerns and to turn resolutely to a wider and more abiding reality
At first we are by ourselves too stupid and inexperienced to see the tracks which lead to salvation
So we must put our trust in the Sages of the past and listen intently to their words dimmed by distance and the noise of the present day but still just audible
One last word about tolerance without which faith remains raw and unsure of itself
It is a perpetual trial to our faith that we should constantly meet with people who believe differently
We are easily tempted to wish this irritant removed to coerce others if only by argument and to annihilate them if only by dubbing them fools
Intolerance for people of other faiths though often mistaken for ardor betrays nothing so much as doubts within oneself
We can of course always console ourselves by assuming that the others in their own way believe what we do and that in the end it all comes to the same thing
But that does not always sound very convincing and what we must I am afraid learn to do is to bear with their presence
Next to faith vigor
Little need be said about the need for being energetic if one wants to achieve something
Without vigor without strenuous effort without perseverance one obviously cannot make much progress
Everybody knows what vigor is although a generation which made the fortune of the discoverers of nightstarvation might wish that it had more of it
The fact that faith and vigor are virtues does not however imply that they are good all through and that regardless of the consequences they should be strengthened at all times
Excess is to be deprecated even in virtues
All the five virtues must be regarded as one whole
Their balance and harmony is almost as important as the virtues themselves
They support each other to some extent but they also stand in each other's way
The one must sometimes be used to correct the excess of the other
In this way concentration must come to the rescue of the latent faults of vigor
When vigor and energy have it all their own way tranquillity is in danger
We all know people with a large dash of adrenalin in their blood who are always busy perhaps even madly efficient but not particularly restful
Vigor by itself leads to excitement and has to be controlled by a development of concentrated calm
Similarly faith alone without wisdom can easily become mere credulity
Wisdom alone can teach what is worth believing
This can be illustrated by Don Quixote who in literature is perhaps the purest embodiment of faith and whose actions demonstrate that too much faith by itself is not necessarily a good thing
Cervantes' novel gives a fine and detailed description of all the chief attributes of faith
Don Quixote vigorously fearlessly without complaining and even serenely endures all tribulations because he wants to help others all of them equally according to their needs
When he dashes into the middle of the boiling lake he reaches the very height of selfabandonment of which faith as such is capable
And just when he does not know what will happen to him he finds himself among flowery fields beautiful beyond those of Elysium His faith has conquered the senses it transmutes the data of commonsense experience and the barber's basin becomes Mambrino's helmet
And yet when we consider the intellectual basis of his faith we find that it consists in nothing more than a belief in the truth and veracity of the Romances which describe the fictitious and not particularly edifying doings of the knighterrants of the past
This is the reason why his adventures form a sorry sight why he is a caricature even of a knight of the Middle Ages why shorn of all commonsense faith in this case becomes slightly pathological
Mr
Blyth claims that the Don Quixote of the First Part is Zen incarnate that the man who surpasses Hakuin Rinzai Eno Daruma and Shakyamuni himself is Don Quixote de la Mancha Knight Errant Zen it seems like all good things can be abused
It is not very probable that when the cloak of Zen is thrown over them all donkeys do become tigers all absurdities profundities
Irrationalism is not without its attractions but can be overdone
To suggest that one scripture one conviction one faith is as good as another smacks rather more of the spiritual nihilism of our present age than of the wisdom of Sengt'san
I admit that I have always liked Don Quixote for saying that the perfection of madness does not consist in going mad for some actual reason or other but in running mad without the least constraint or necessity But still I cannot help feeling that there is some difference intangible perhaps but nevertheless real between the perfection of madness and the perfection of wisdom
Don Quixote's faith was a rather puerile one because he had no judgment and his vision was defective
Blyth himself admits in the end that Don Quixote lacks the Confucian virtue of Prudence the balance of the powers of the mind
I am not so sure about prudence but the balance of the powers of the mind is certainly not only a Confucian but also a Buddhist virtue and a very essential one
Buddhaghosa whom I am expounding here leaves us in no doubt on this matter
What distinguishes a bhikkhu from a knighterrant is that he is essentially sober and calm that his view of the world is sweetly rational that he avoids violence in the pursuit of his aims and that his estimate of his own role in the world does not greatly exceed his actual size in relation to the universe
A Buddhist owes his soberness to the cultivation of the third virtue of mindfulness
Whereas faith and vigor when driven to excess must be restrained by their counterparts ie wisdom and tranquil concentration the virtue of mindfulness does not share this disability
Mindfulness should be strong everywhere
For it protects the mind from excitedness into which it might fall since faith vigor and wisdom may excite us and from indolence into which it might fall since concentration favors indolence
Therefore mindfulness is desirable everywhere like a seasoning of salt in all sauces like the prime minister in all state functions
Hence it is said 'The Lord has declared mindfulness to be useful everywhere for the mind finds refuge in mindfulness and mindfulness is its protector
Without mindfulness there can be no exertion or restraint of the mind' 
Although traces of it are not altogether absent in other religious and philosophical disciplines in Buddhism alone mindfulness occupies a central position
If one were asked what distinguishes Buddhism from all other systems of thought one would have to answer that it is the dharmatheory and the stress laid on mindfulness
Mindfulness is not only the seventh of the steps of the holy eightfold path the third of the five virtues and the first of the seven limbs of enlightenment
On occasions it is almost equated with Buddhism itself
So we read at the beginning of the Satipatthana Sutta that the four applications of mindfulness are the one and only way that leads beings to purity to the transcending of sorrow and lamentation to the appeasement of pain and sadness to entrance upon the right method and to the realization of Nirvana
What then is mindfulness
The Abhidharma guided by the etymology of the Sanskrit term defines it as an act of remembering which prevents ideas from floating away and which fights forgetfulness carelessness and distraction
This definition by itself though correct does not really make the function of this virtue very clear to us today
The theoretical assumptions which underlie the various practices summed up in the word mindfulness are too much taken for granted
What one assumes is that the mind consists of two disparate parts  a depth which is calm and quiet and a surface which is disturbed
The surface layer is in perpetual agitation and turmoil
The center at the bottom of the mind beyond both the conscious and the unconscious mind as modern psychologists understand it is quite still
The depth is however usually overlaid to such an extent that people remain incredulous when told of a submerged spot of stillness in their inmost hearts
In most cases the surface is so turbulent that the calm of the depth can be realized only in rare intervals
Mindfulness and concentration are the two virtues which are concerned with the development of inward calm
The principal enemies of spiritual quietude are the senses the movements of the body the passions wants and desires and discursive thinking
They have the power to be enemies when they are not subjected to any discipline and when the ego identifies itself with what takes place on the surface of the mind participating heartily in it and the illusion arises that these activities are my doings my concerns and the sphere in which I live and have my being
When thus busy with worldly things we have neither strength nor freedom
In order to conquer these enemies of spiritual quietude we must withdraw the senses from their objects as the tortoise draws in its limbs keep watch on our muscular movements cease wanting anything and dissociate all wants from the ego and cut off discursive thinking
By an effort of the imagination one must try to see oneself at rest floating freely with no force exerted on one's spiritual self
The practice of mindfulness then is a series of efforts which aim at maintaining this isolation
Mindfulness is the name given to the measures which we take to protect the patch of inner calm which may at first not seem very large
One as it were draws a line round this domain and at its boundaries keeps watch on trespassers
The expectation is that conscious attention will disintegrate the power of the enemies diminish their number and dissociate them from the ego
However diverse in nature the numerous exercises which come under the heading of mindfulness may seem to be they all have in common this one purpose that of guarding the incipient and growing calm in one's heart
First as regards the sensory stimuli there is the restraint of the senses also called the guarding of the doors of the senses For two reasons sense stimulation may disturb inner calm because it gives an occasion for undesirable states like greed hate etc to invade and flood the mind because attention to the sensory world however necessary and apparently innocuous distracts from the object of wisdom which is the emptiness of dharmas
One cannot grasp what is meant by restraint of the sense dominants if one regards it as quite a natural thing that the mind should dwell on senselinked objects
This is indeed most unnatural
In its natural purity thought abides in the calm contemplation of emptiness
The mind which sees hears etc is a fallen mind
The capacity of senseexperience to compel the mind to act in a certain way is greatly diminished if each sensory stimulus is examined at the point where it passes the threshold of consciousness
Attention normally passive involuntary and compulsive is subjected to voluntary control
In the process of imposing some control on the senses one will be surprised to find how keen they are to function how eager to find suitable objects with which to feed one's impulses and instincts one's hopes and fears one's interests and appetites satisfactions and grievances
It is not so bad that one should see things hear sounds etc but it is a threat to spiritual health when one gets interested and entranced when one takes up what is seen and heard and seizes on it as a sign of what matters
The practice of mindfulness is not confined to taking note of what enters the mind by way of the senseorgans
One also tries to determine what is allowed to enter and to generally reduce the number of sensory impacts by restraining the use of the physical organ for instance when one walks with eyes directed only a few feet or yards ahead
In addition by an effort of the will one refuses to cooperate with one's habitual impulses in building up a mere casual observation into a thing of moment to which one returns again and again
Finally the intruder is weakened and worn down by appropriate reflections
He is kept out of the heart and devalued  as trivial as already passed as nothing in particular and by thinking that this does not concern me at all this means nothing to me it is only a waste when salvation and Nirvana are considered
Secondly as regards the muscular movements of the body  an unquiet body is a concomitant of a disturbed mind both its cause and symptom
It is important to mindfulness that one should consciously notice the position and movement of the body when walking eating speaking etc and suppress and correct those movements which are uncontrolled hasty and uncoordinated
This practice can it is true not be carried out at all times
In London traffic for instance the unhurried and unflurried demeanor of the mindful has little survival value
Where however it can be applied we come to cherish this exercise which pulls us together sometimes to an amazing extent in an amazingly short time
Insignificant as it may seem compared with the splendors of Buddhist art and metaphysics this training is their indispensable foundation stone
It is by his dignified and selfpossessed deportment that the bhikkhu is recognized
And of course we should not forget that the mindful attention to muscular movements includes the breathing practices which are a most fruitful source of insight
Where we have to face the disturbance of the passions and of stray thoughts in general the defense of our inward calm becomes more difficult
Mindfulness itself turns into incipient concentration
At this point one may ask whether the practice of the five cardinal virtues from faith to wisdom is at all likely to be furthered by writing articles about them
It is of course not an entirely useless undertaking to guard the traditional teaching from current misunderstandings quite apart from the pleasure of putting fleas into peoples' ears and fomenting discussions about the importance of faith or the value of erudition
But what about the virtues themselves
Thomas a Kempis once said that he would rather feel compunction than know the definition of it
What matters to a Buddhist is that he should be strong in faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdom and what use to him is the knowledge of how they are defined
Detailed advice on how these virtues should be practiced it is true can never be given in articles written for the general reader
Such advice must always be addressed to one person at a time must take their individual constitution into account and can therefore be given only by word of mouth
On the other hand if mindfulness is a virtue then the ability to recollect one's own virtues is also a feature of the Buddhist life
And how can one attend to the presence or absence of mental states in oneself if one is unable to recognize them for what they are
The Satipatthana Sutta recommends systematic meditation on the wholesome and unwholesome mental states which arise in the mind
To quote the Sutta one knows for instance when there is vigor that there is vigor when there is no vigor that there is no vigor how the vigor which did not exist came to be produced and how and under what conditions it will grow to greater perfection
Psychology is so vital to Buddhist instruction because one cannot know anything definite about the furniture of one's mind unless one is acquainted with the categories into which mental conditions can be analyzed
A mindful man is well informed about his own mental condition
His capacity for introspection is highly developed
And his interest in his own mind will not really make him selfcentered as long as he remembers that he has to deal with the rise and fall of impersonal processes
In addition in the case of the higher mental states rational clarity is imperative if constant selfdeception and wasteful groping in the dark are to be avoided
In a new country a map is helpful so that one may know where one is
The manuals of mystical theology written by the practicing contemplatives of the Catholic Church are also rich in descriptions of the sublimer virtues
But this is not all
Where the Buddhist virtues are described for a lay audience one must not omit to mention the allimportant fact that the upper ranges of these virtues demand a reformation of the conduct of life which is greater than almost any layman is willing to undertake
The higher mindfulness and nearly the whole range of concentration and wisdom presuppose a degree of withdrawal from the world which is incompatible with the life of an ordinary citizen
Those who are unwilling to achieve a radical seclusion from the world can practice these virtues only in a very rudimentary form
It is quite idle to pretend that they do not involve a complete break with the established habits of life and thought
Unless we make the sacrifices involved in withdrawing from the world we are bound to remain strangers to the fullness of mindfulness concentration and wisdom
But if the monastic life is a necessary condition for these virtues why talk about them at all
Partly because it is salutary though painful that we should see their absence in us and partly because they constitute the subjective counterpart of the scriptures which we read
The Suttas describe the world as it appears on a spiritual level on which concentration and wisdom have come to maturity
The understanding of the scriptures is furthered by an understanding of the subjective attitude which corresponds to them
And so although we are forced to go beyond the range of our immediate experience and although the description tends to become more intangible as it rises to loftier heights we will now leaving aside the higher ranges of mindfulness try to explain the traditional definitions of concentration and wisdom as they are handed down to us
Concentration continues the work of mindfulness
It deepens our capacity to regain the peaceful calm of our inner nature
But here we are at once faced with the difficulty that in Buddhist psychology concentration occurs twice as a factor essential to all thought and as a special and rather rare virtue
In its simplest form concentration is the narrowing of the field of attention in a manner and for a time determined by the will
The mind is made onepointed does not waver does not scatter itself and it becomes steady like the flame of a lamp in the absence of wind
Without a certain degree of onepointedness no mental activity at all can take place
Each mental act lasts strictly speaking for one moment only and is at once followed by another
The function of concentration is to provide some stability in this perpetual flux by enabling the mind to stand in or on the same object without distraction for more than one moment
In addition it is a synthetic quality that binds together a number of mental states which arise at the same time as water binds the lather of soap
Buddhaghosa stresses the fact that intellectual concentration is also found in unwholesome thoughts
The mind must be undistracted so that the murderer's knife does not miss the theft does not miscarry
A mind of single intent is capable of doing what it does more effectively be it good or bad
The higher degrees of this kind of concentration owe much to the presence of the hunting instinct and can best be observed in a stoat following a rabbit
Intellectual concentration is a quality which is ethically and spiritually neutral
Many scientific workers have an unusually high capacity for concentrated thought
Anyone acquainted with the scientific humanists who inhabit our big cities will however agree that their intellectual achievements are not conducive to either peace of mind or spiritual progress
When Sir Isaac Newton boiled his watch instead of the egg his landlady had given him he thereby showed the intensity with which he focussed his mind on his intellectual task
But the result of his intellectual labors has been to cast a dark shadow over the spiritual radiance of the universe and ever since the celestial harmonies have become nearly inaudible
As HW
Longfellow in his poem on The Arsenal at Springfield has put it
How then does concentration as a spiritual virtue differ from concentration as a condition of the intellect
Spiritual or transic concentration results less from intellectual effort than from a rebirth of the whole personality including the body the emotions and the will
It cannot possibly be achieved without some discipline over the body since we must be able to endure the prescribed posture practice the prescribed breathing exercises and so on
It is further built on a change of outlook which we can well describe as ethical Tradition is quite unambiguous on this point
Before spiritual concentration can be even approached we must have stilled or suppressed five vices which are known as the five hindrances sense desire ill will sloth and torpor excitedness and sense of guilt and doubt
Where these hindrances are present where concentrated thought is fused with greed the desire to excel to get a good job etc there concentration as a spiritual virtue is not found
In this sense physical ease and selfpurification are the first two distinctive features of spiritual concentration
The third is the shift in attention from the sensory world to another subtler realm
The methods by which this shift is effected are traditionally known as the four trances and the four formless attainments
They are essentially a training in increasing introversion achieved by progressively diminishing the impact of the outer stimuli
As a result of their successful withdrawal and renunciation the spiritually concentrated release the inward calm which dwells in their hearts
This concentration cannot be won however unless no attention is given to sensory data and everything sensory is viewed as equally unimportant
Subjectively it is marked by a soft tranquil and pacified passivity objectively by the abstraction into an unearthly world of experience which lifts one above the world and bestows a certainty greater than anything the senses may teach
The experience is so satisfying that it burns up the world and only its cold ashes are found when one returns to it
And so we come to wisdom the highest virtue of all
Wisdom is based on concentration because of the saying 'One who is concentrated knows sees what really is' Is concentration then an indispensable precondition of wisdom
The answer lies in distinguishing three stages of wisdom according to whether it operates on the level of learning about what tradition has to say concerning the psychological and ontological categories which form the subjectmatter of wisdom discursive reflection on the basic facts of life and meditational development
The third alone requires the aid of transic concentration whereas without it there can be proficiency in the first two
And the wisdom which consists of learning and reflection should not be despised
The main stream of Buddhist tradition has always greatly esteemed learning
Our attitude to the apple of knowledge differs from that of many Christians
On the whole we regard it as rather more nourishing than baneful
The wisdom which is the fifth and crowning virtue is not the wisdom that can be found in the untutored child of nature the corny sage of the backwoods or the selfmade philosopher of the suburbs
It can operate only after a great deal of traditional information has been absorbed a great deal of sound learning acquired
The required skill in metaphysical and psychological analysis would be impossible without a good knowledge of the material on which this skill ought to be exercised
From this point of view learning is perhaps less to be regretted than its absence
The second stage after learning is reflection which is an operation of the intellect
Even the relative beginner can greatly increase his wisdom by discursive meditations on the basic facts of life
Finally it is on the level of mental development that this meditational technique reaches its maturity and then it does indeed require the aid of mindfulness and concentration
Wisdom is of course only a very approximate equivalent of prajna
To the average person nowadays wisdom seems to denote a compound made up of such qualities as sagacity prudence a welldeveloped sense of values serenity and sovereignty over the world won by the understanding of the mode of its operation
The Buddhist conception of wisdom is not unlike this but more precise
It is best clarified by first giving its connotations and then its actual definition
As for the connotations we read in the Dhammasangani On that occasion the dominant of wisdom is wisdom understanding search research search for dharma discernment discrimination differentiation erudition expert skill subtlety clarity reflection investigation amplitude sagacity a guide insight comprehension a goad wisdom wisdom as virtue wisdom as strength the sword of wisdom the lofty height of wisdom the light luster and splendor of wisdom the treasure of wisdom absence of delusion search for dharmas right view From mere cleverness wisdom is distinguished by its spiritual purpose and we are told expressly that it is designed to cut off the defilements
Now to the actual definition Wisdom penetrates into dharmas as they are in themselves
It disperses the darkness of delusion which covers up the ownbeing of dharmas
What then does wisdom meditate about
Wisdom may be held to concern itself with three possible topics true reality the meaning of life the conduct of life
Buddhist tradition assumes that the second and third depend on the first
In its essence wisdom is the strength of mind which permits contact with the true reality which is also called the realm of dharmas
Delusion folly confusion ignorance and selfdeception are the opposites of wisdom
It is because ignorance and not sin is the root evil that wisdom is regarded as the highest virtue
A holiness which is devoid of wisdom is not considered impossible but it cannot be gained by the path of knowledge to which alone these descriptions apply
The paths of faith of love of works etc have each their own several laws
As the unfaltering penetration into the true nature of objects wisdom is the capacity to meditate in certain ways about the dharmic constituents of the universe
The rules of that meditation have been laid down in the scriptures particularly in the Abhidharma and a superb description can be found in the latter part of Buddhaghosa's Path of Purification
Mindfulness and concentration were as we saw based on the assumption of a duality in the mind  between its calm depth and its excited surface
Wisdom similarly assumes a duality between the surface and depth of all things
Objects are not what they appear to be
Their true reality in which they stand out as dharmas is opposed to their appearance to commonsense and much strength of wisdom is required to go beyond the deceptive appearance and to penetrate to the reality of dharmas themselves
The king said Is it through wise attention that people become exempt from further rebirth  Yes that is due to wise attention and also to wisdom and the other wholesome dharmas  But is not wise attention the same as wisdom  No Your Majesty
Attention is one thing and wisdom another
Sheep and goats oxen and buffaloes camels and asses have attention but wisdom they have not  Well put Venerable Nagasena
The king said What is the mark of attention and what is the mark of wisdom  Consideration is the mark of attention cutting off that of wisdom  How is that
Give me a simile  You know barleyreapers I suppose  Yes I do  How then do they reap the barley  With the left hand they seize a bunch of barley in the right hand they hold a sickle and they cut the barley off with that sickle  Just so Your Majesty the yogin seizes his mental processes with his attention and by his wisdom he cuts off the defilements  Well put Venerable Nagasena
The king said When you just spoke of 'the other wholesome dharmas' which ones did you mean  I meant morality faith vigor mindfulness and concentration  And what is the mark of morality  Morality has the mark of providing a basis for all wholesome dharmas whatever they may be
When based on morality all the wholesome dharmas will not dwindle away  Give me an illustration  As all plants and animals which increase grow and prosper do so with the earth as their support with the earth as their basis just so the yogin with morality as his support with morality as his basis develops the five cardinal virtues ie the cardinal virtues of faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdom
Give me a further illustration
As the builder of a city when constructing a town first of all clears the site removes all stumps and thorns and levels it and only after that he lays out and marks off the roads and crossroads and so builds the city even so the yogin develops the five cardinal virtues with morality as his support with morality as his basis
The king said What is the mark of faith  Faith makes serene and it leaps forward  And how does faith make serene  When faith arises it arrests the five hindrances and the heart becomes free from them clear serene and undisturbed  Give me an illustration  A universal monarch might on his way together with his fourfold army cross over a small stream
Stirred up by the elephants and horses by the chariots and infantry the water would become disturbed agitated and muddy
Having crossed over the universal monarch would order his men to bring some water for him to drink
But the king would possess a miraculous waterclearing gem and his men in obedience to his command would throw it into the stream
Then at once all fragments of vegetation would float away the mud would settle at the bottom the stream would become clear serene and undisturbed and fit to be drunk by the universal monarch
Here the stream corresponds to the heart the monarch's men to the yogin the fragments of vegetation and the mud to the defilements and the miraculous waterclearing gem to faith
And how does faith leap forward  When the yogin sees that the hearts of others have been set free he leaps forward by way of aspiration to the various fruits of the holy life and he makes efforts to attain the yet unattained to find the yet unfound to realize the yet unrealized  Give me an illustration  Suppose that a great cloud were to burst over a hillslope
The water then would flow down the slope would first fill all the hill's clefts fissures and gullies and would then run into the river below making its banks overflow on both sides
Now suppose further that a great crowd of people had come along and unable to size up either the width or the depth of the river should stand frightened and hesitating on the bank
But then some man would come along who conscious of his own strength and power would firmly tie on his own loincloth and jump across the river
And the great crowd of people seeing him on the other side would cross likewise
Even so the yogin when he has seen that the hearts of others have been set free leaps forward by aspiration to the various fruits of the holy life and he makes efforts to attain the yet unattained to find the yet unfound to realize the yet unrealized
And this is what the Lord has said in the Samyutta Nikaya
Well put Nagasena
The king asked And what is the mark of vigor  Vigor props up and when propped up by vigor all the wholesome dharmas do not dwindle away  Give me a simile  If a man's house were falling down he would prop it up with a new piece of wood and so supported that house would not collapse
The king asked And what is the mark of mindfulness  Calling to mind and taking up
How is calling to mind a mark of mindfulness  When mindfulness arises one calls to mind the dharmas which participate in what is wholesome and unwholesome blamable and blameless inferior and sublime dark and light ie these are the four applications of mindfulness these the four right efforts these the four roads to psychic power these the five cardinal virtues these the five powers these the seven limbs of enlightenment this is the holy eightfold path this is calm this insight this knowledge and this emancipation
Thereafter the yogin tends those dharmas which should be tended and he does not tend those which should not be tended he partakes of those dharmas which should be followed and he does not partake of those which should not be followed
It is in this sense that calling to mind is a mark of mindfulness  Give me a simile  It is like the treasurer of a universal monarch who each morning and evening reminds his royal master of his magnificent assets 'So many elephants you have so many horses so many chariots so much infantry so many gold coins so much bullion so much property may Your Majesty bear this in mind' In this way he calls to mind his master's wealth
And how does mindfulness take up  When mindfulness arises the outcome of beneficial and harmful dharmas is examined in this way 'These dharmas are beneficial these harmful these dharmas are helpful these unhelpful' Thereafter the yogin removes the harmful dharmas and takes up the beneficial ones he removes the unhelpful dharmas and takes up the helpful ones
It is in this sense that mindfulness takes up  Give me a comparison  It is like the invaluable adviser of a universal monarch who knows what is beneficial and what is harmful to his royal master what is helpful and what is unhelpful
Thereafter what is harmful and unhelpful can be removed what is beneficial and helpful can be taken up
The king asked And what is the mark of concentration  It stands at the head
Whatever wholesome dharmas there may be they all are headed by concentration they bend towards concentration lead to concentration incline to concentration  Give me a comparison  It is as with a building with a pointed roof whatever rafters there are they all converge on the top bend towards the top meet at the top and the top occupies the most prominent place
So with concentration in relation to the other wholesome dharmas  Give me a further comparison  If a king were to enter battle with his fourfold army then all his troops  the elephants cavalry chariots and infantry  would be headed by him and would be ranged around him
Such is the position of concentration in relation to the other wholesome dharmas
The king then asked What then is the mark of wisdom  Cutting off is as I said before one mark of wisdom
In addition it illuminates  And how does wisdom illuminate  When wisdom arises it dispels the darkness of ignorance generates the illumination of knowledge sheds the light of cognition and makes the holy truths stand out clearly
Thereafter the yogin with his correct wisdom can see impermanence ill and notself  Give me a comparison  It is like a lamp which a man would take into a dark house
It would dispel the darkness would illuminate shed light and make the forms in the house stands out clearly  Well put Venerable Nagasena
 Milindapañha pp
 translated by Edward Conze
The five faculties are faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdom
Here what is faith
By this faith one has faith in four dharmas
Which four
He accepts the right view which assumes renewed becoming in the world of birthanddeath he puts his trust in the ripening of karma and knows that he will experience the fruit of any karma that he may have done even to save his life he does not do any evil deed
He has faith in the mode of life of a Bodhisattva and having taken up this discipline he does not long for any other vehicle
He believes when he hears all the doctrines which are characterized by the true clear and profound knowledge of conditioned coproduction by such terms as lack of self absence of a being absence of a soul absence of a person and by emptiness the signless and the wishless
He follows none of the false doctrines and believes in all the qualities of a Buddha his powers grounds of selfconfidence and all the rest and when in his faith he has left behind all doubts he brings about in himself those qualities of a Buddha
This is known as the virtue of faith
His vigor consists of his bringing about the dharmas in which he has faith
His mindfulness consists in his preventing the qualities which he brings about by vigor from being destroyed by forgetfulness
His concentration consists in his fixing his onepointed attention on these very same qualities
With the faculty of wisdom he contemplates those dharmas on which he has fixed his onepointed attention and penetrates to their reality
The cognition of those dharmas which arises in himself and which has no outside condition is called the virtue of wisdom
Thus these five virtues together are sufficient to bring forth all the qualities of a Buddha
 Akshayamati Sutra translated by Edward Conze
By taking your stand on mindfulness you must hold back from the senseobjects your senses unsteady by nature
Fire snakes and lightning are less inimical to us than our own senses so much more dangerous
For they assail us all the time
Even the most vicious enemies can attack only some people at some times and not at others but everybody is always and everywhere weighed down by his senses
And people do not go to hell because some enemy has knocked them down and cast them into it it is because they have been knocked down by their unsteady senses that they are helplessly dragged there
Those attacked by external enemies may or may not suffer injury to their souls but those who are weighed down by the senses suffer in body and soul alike
For the five senses are rather like arrows which have been smeared with the poison of fancies have cares for their feathers and happiness for their points and fly about in the space provided by the range of the senseobjects shot off by Kama the God of Love they hit men in their very hearts as a hunter hits a deer and if men do not know how to ward off these arrows they will be their undoing when they come near us we should stand firm in selfcontrol be agile and steadfast and ward them off with the great armor of mindfulness
As a man who has subdued his enemies can everywhere live and sleep at ease and free from care so can he who has pacified his senses
For the senses constantly ask for more by way of worldly objects and normally behave like voracious dogs who can never have enough
This disorderly mob of the senses can never reach satiety not by any amount of senseobjects they are rather like the sea which one can go on indefinitely replenishing with water
In this world the senses cannot be prevented from being active each in its own sphere
But they should not be allowed to grasp either the general features of an object or its particularities
When you have beheld a sightobject with your eyes you must merely determine the basic element and should not under any circumstances fancy it as say a woman or a man But if now and then you have inadvertently grasped something as a woman or a man you should not follow that up by determining the hairs teeth etc as lovely
Nothing should be subtracted from the datum nothing added to it it should be seen as it really is as what it is like in real truth
If you thus try to look continually for the true reality in that which the senses present to you covetousness and aversion will soon be left without a foothold
Coveting ruins those living beings who are bent on sensuous enjoyment by means of pleasing forms like an enemy with a friendly face who speaks loving words but plans dark deeds
But what is called aversion is a kind of anger directed towards certain objects and anyone who is deluded enough to pursue it is bound to suffer for it either in this or a future life
Afflicted by their likes and dislikes as by excessive heat or cold men will never find either happiness or the highest good as long as they put their trust in the unsteady senses
 Saundaranandakavya xiii  translated by Edward Conze
The Lord When he practices the perfection of meditation for the sake of other beings his mind becomes undistracted
For he reflects that even worldly meditation is hard to accomplish with distracted thoughts how much more so is full enlightenment
Therefore I must remain undistracted until I have won full enlightenment
Moreover Subhuti a Bodhisattva beginning with the first thought of enlightenment practices the perfection of meditation
His mental activities are associated with the knowledge of all modes when he enters into meditation
When he has seen forms with his eye he does not seize upon them as signs of realities which concern him nor is he interested in the accessory details
He sets himself to restrain that which if he does not restrain his organ of sight might give him occasion for covetousness sadness or other evil and unwholesome dharmas to reach his heart
He watches over the organ of sight
And the same with the other five senseorgans  ear nose tongue body and mind
Whether he walks or stands sits or lies down talks or remains silent his concentration does not leave him
He does not fidget with his hands or feet or twitch his face he is not incoherent in his speech confused in his senses exalted or uplifted fickle or idle agitated in body or mind
Calm is his body calm is his voice calm is his mind
His demeanor shows contentment both in private and public He is frugal easy to feed easy to serve of good life and habits though in a crowd he dwells apart even and unchanged in gain and loss not elated not cast down
Thus in happiness and suffering in praise and blame in fame and disrepute in life or death he is the same unchanged neither elated nor cast down
And so with foe or friend with what is pleasant or unpleasant with holy or unholy men with noises or music with forms that are dear or undear he remains the same unchanged neither elated nor cast down neither gratified nor thwarted
And why
Because he sees all dharmas as empty of marks of their own without true reality incomplete and uncreated
 Prajnaparamita ch translated by Edward Conze
This is the morality which consists in the restraint of the senses Here someone having seen a form with his eye does not seize on its general appearance or the details of it
That which might so long as he dwells unrestrained as to the force of the eye give occasion for covetous sad evil and unwholesome dharmas to flood him that he sets himself to restrain he guards the controlling force of the eye and brings about its restraint
And likewise when he has heard sounds with the ear smelled smells with the nose tasted tastes with the tongue touched touchables with the body cognized mindobjects with the mind
Having seen a form with his eye when he has seen a form with the visual consciousness which is capable of seeing forms and which in normal language is usually called the eye though it actually is its tool
For the Ancients have said The eye cannot see forms because it is without thought thought cannot see forms because it is without eye
When the object knocks against the door one sees with the thought which has eyesensibility for its basis In the expression one sees with the eye only accessory equipment is indicated just as one may say one shoots with a bow
Therefore the meaning here is having seen form with visual consciousness
He does not seize on its general appearance he does not seize on its appearance as man or woman or its appearance as attractive etc which makes it into a basis for the defiling passions
But he stops at what is actually seen
He does not seize on the details of it he does not seize on the variety of its accessory features like the hands or feet the smile the laughter the talk the looking here the looking away etc which are in common parlance called details because they manifest the defiling passions by again and again tainting with them
But he seizes only on that which is really there ie the impurity of the parts of the body like Mahatissa the Elder who lived on Mount Cetiya
Once that Elder went from Mount Cetiya to Anuradhapura to gather alms
In a certain family the daughterinlaw had quarreled with her husband and adorned and beautified like a heavenly maiden she left Anuradhapura early in the morning and went away to stay with some relatives
On the way she saw the Elder and as her mind was perverted she gave a loud laugh
The Elder looked to see what was the matter he acquired at the sight of her teeth the notion of repulsiveness and thereby reached Arahatship The husband who ran after her on same road saw the Elder and asked him whether he had by any chance seen a woman
The Elder replied
That which might etc that which might be the reason or that nonrestraint of the faculty of the eye which might be the cause why in this person when he dwells without having restrained the faculty of the eye with the gate of mindfulness ie when he has left the door of the eye open such dharmas as covetousness etc flood him ie pursue and submerge him
That he sets himself to restrain he sets himself to close this faculty of the eye with the gate of mindfulness
And one who sets himself to do that of him it is said that he guards the controlling force of the eye and brings about its restraint
But it is not with reference to the faculty of the eye itself that there is restraint or nonrestraint and it is not concerning the eye considered as a sensitive organ that mindfulness arises or the lack of it
But it is at the impulsive moment that there is lack of restraint if and when immorality arises then or lack of mindfulness or lack of cognition lack of patience or laziness
Nevertheless one speaks of the nonrestraint of the sense of sight
And why
Because when the mind is in that condition also the door is unguarded
The situation can be compared with that of a city when its four gates are unguarded then although in the interior of the city the doors of the houses the storerooms and private rooms are well guarded nevertheless all the property in the city is actually unguarded and unprotected and robbers can once they have entered through the city gates do whatever they like
In the same sense also the door is unguarded when in consequence of the arising of immorality etc there is lack of restraint at the impulsive moment
But when morality etc arise at that moment then the door also is guarded
Just again as with the city When the citygates are well guarded then although in the interior the doors of the houses etc are unguarded nevertheless all the property in the city is actually well guarded and well protected for the citygates being closed robbers cannot enter
Just so also the door is guarded when morality etc arise at the impulsive moment The same explanation applies to when he has heard sounds with the ear etc
The restraint of the senses thus consists in short in the avoiding of the seizing of the general appearance etc of sightobjects etc which lead to one's being pursued by the defiling passions
And it should be achieved through mindfulness
For it is effected by mindfulness in so far as the senseorgans when they are governed by mindfulness can no longer be influenced by convetousness etc
Therefore we should remember the Fire Sermon which says It were better monks if the eye were stroked with a heated iron bar afire ablaze aflame than that one should seize on either the general appearance or the details of the forms of which the eye is aware The disciple should achieve a thorough restraint of the senses in that by unimpaired mindfulness he prevents that seizing on the general appearance etc which makes the consciousness which proceeds through the door of the eye etc with forms etc for its range liable to be flooded by covetousness etc
And one should become like Cittagutta the Elder who lived in the great Kurandaka Cave
In that cave there was a delightful painting which showed the seven Buddhas leaving for the homeless life
One day numerous monks were wandering about in the cave going from lodging to lodging
They noticed the painting and said What a delightful painting Venerable Bhikkhu The Elder replied For more than sixty years brethren I have lived in this cave and I have never known whether there is a painting here or whether there is not
Today only I have learned it from you people who use your eyes For all that time during which the Elder had lived there he had never lifted up his eyes and looked more closely at the cave
At the entrance to the cave there was a large ironwood tree
To that also the Elder had never looked up but he knew that it was in flower when each year he saw the filaments which had fallen down on the ground
All the sons of good family who have their own welfare at heart should therefore remember
Visuddhimagga I   translated by Edward Conze
should by means of this sign attend to another sign which is more wholesome
or he should investigate the peril of these ideas Unwholesome truly are these ideas
Blameworthy are these ideas
Of painful result are these ideas
or he should pay no attention to these ideas
or he should attend to the composition of the factors which effect these ideas
or with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the gums he should by means of sheer mental effort hold back crush and burn out the thought
In doing so these evil and unwholesome ideas bound up with greed hate or delusion will be forsaken and disappear from their forsaking thought will become inwardly settled and calm composed and concentrated
This is called the effort to overcome
Unwholesome ideas may arise with reference to beings  be they desirable undesirable or unconsidered  or to things such as one's possessions or things which annoy like stumps or thorns
The wholesome counterideas which drive them out arise from the following practices which are directly opposed to them
Greed about beings Meditation about the repulsiveness of the body
Greed about things Attention to their impermanence
Hate for beings The development of friendliness
Hate for things Attention to the elements which of the physical elements composing the thing am I angry with
Delusion about beings and things
These are the direct and correct antidotes to the faulty ideas
He investigates them with the power of wisdom and rejects them like a snake's carcass
He should not remember those ideas not attend to them but become one who is otherwise engaged
He should be like someone who not wanting to see a certain sightobject just closes his eyes when these ideas arise in his mind he should take hold of his basic subject of meditation and become engaged in that
It may help him to break the spell of intruding thoughts and to occupy his mind otherwise if he recites with great faith a passage from the Scriptures or reads out a passage in praise of the Buddha or Dharma or he may sort out his belongings and enumerate them one by one these are the scissors this is the needle etc or he should do some sewing or he should do some good work for a given period of time
And after that he should return to his basic subject of meditation
He should analyze the conditions for these ideas and ask himself What is their cause what their condition what the reason for their having arisen
He should put forth great vigor and with a wholesome thought he should hold back an unwholesome one
 Majjhima Nikaya No and Papañcasudani translated by Edward Conze
There are these five faculties monks the faculty of faith the faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration and the faculty of wisdom
Where can the faculty of faith be seen
In the four characteristic qualities of a streamwinner
Where can the faculty of vigor be seen
In the four right efforts
Where can the faculty of mindfulness be seen
In the four foundations of mindfulness
Where can the faculty of concentration be seen
In the four meditative absorptions
Where can the faculty of wisdom be seen
In the Four Noble Truths
 Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
By accomplishment and perfection in the five faculties one is an arahant
If the faculties are weaker one is a nonreturner if they are still weaker one is a oncereturner or a streamwinner or a Dhammadevotee or a faithdevotee
Thus monks through the difference of faculties there is difference of result and the difference of results makes for the difference of individuals
 Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
Thus monks he who practices the five faculties to their perfection wins to perfection
He who practices them partially wins a partial result
Not barren I say are the five faculties
 Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
But he who is entirely in any degree and respect without these five faculties stands outside in the class of ordinary men
 Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
Thus I have heard
On one occasion when the Exalted One lived in the Eastern Cottage at Savatthi he addressed the Venerable Sariputta as follows
Do you believe Sariputta that the faculty of faith if cultivated and regularly practiced leads to the Deathless is bound for the Deathless ends in the Deathless that the faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom if cultivated and regularly practiced leads to the Deathless is bound for the Deathless ends in the Deathless
Herein O Lord I do not follow the Exalted One out of faith
Those by whom this is unknown unseen uncognized unrealized and unexperienced by wisdom they will herein follow others out of faith
But those by whom this is known seen cognized realized and experienced by wisdom they have no uncertainty no doubt about it that these five faculties if cultivated and regularly practiced lead to the Deathless are bound for the Deathless end in the Deathless
By me O Lord it has been known seen cognized realized and experienced by wisdom and I have no uncertainty no doubt about it that the faculty of faith the faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom if cultivated and regularly practiced leads to the Deathless is bound for the Deathless ends in the Deathless
Well said Sariputta well said spoke the Lord
 Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
It is through cultivating and regularly practicing one faculty that a cankerfree bhikkhu makes known his knowledge Ceased has rebirth fulfilled is the holy life the task is done nothing further remains after this Which is the one faculty
The faculty of wisdom
In a noble disciple endowed with wisdom faith that goes along with it is firmly established vigor that goes along with it is firmly established mindfulness that goes along with it is firmly established concentration that goes along with it is firmly established
This monks is the one faculty through the cultivating and regularly practicing of which a cankerfree bhikkhu makes known his knowledge Ceased has rebirth fulfilled is the holy life the task is done nothing further remains after this
 Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
Just as among all heartwood fragrances that of the red sandalwood is deemed best so monks among states that partake of enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is deemed best namely for the purpose of enlightenment
Which monks are the states partaking of enlightenment
The faculty of faith is a state partaking of enlightenment and it leads to enlightenment
The faculty of vigor the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom is a state partaking of enlightenment and it leads to enlightenment
And among them the faculty of wisdom is deemed best namely for the purpose of enlightenment
 Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
Thus I have heard
On one occasion the Exalted One dwelt among the Anga people at Apana a town of the Angas
There the Exalted One addressed the Venerable Sariputta as follows
A noble disciple Sariputta who has singleminded confidence in the Perfect One can he have uncertainty or doubt concerning the Perfect One's dispensation
A noble disciple Lord who has singleminded confidence in the Perfect One cannot have uncertainty or doubt concerning the Perfect One's dispensation
Of a noble disciple endowed with faith it can be expected Lord that he will live employing his vigor to the overcoming of unsalutary states and the acquisition of salutary states energetic with strenuous exertion unremittingly applying himself to things salutary
This vigor of his O Lord is his faculty of vigor
Of a noble disciple who is endowed with faith and employs his vigor it can be expected Lord that he will be mindful equipped with the highest mindfulness and circumspection and that he remembers well and keeps in mind what has been done and said long ago
This mindfulness of his Lord is his faculty of mindfulness
Of a noble disciple who is endowed with faith employing his vigor keeping his mindfulness alert it can be expected Lord that making the highest relinquishment his object he will obtain concentration will obtain unification of mind
This concentration of his Lord is his faculty of concentration
Of a noble disciple endowed with faith vigor and mindfulness and whose mind is concentrated it can be expected Lord that he will know this 'Without a conceivable beginning and end is this round of existence no first beginning can be perceived of beings hastening and hurrying on enveloped in ignorance and ensnared by craving
The entire fading away and cessation of this very ignorance which is a mass of darkness this is the state of peace this is the state sublime namely the quiescence of all formations the relinquishment of all substrata of existence the extinction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbana' This wisdom of his Lord is the faculty of wisdom
The noble disciple who has faith after thus striving again and again after thus applying mindfulness again and again after thus concentrating his mind again and again is now fully convinced 'These teachings which before I had only heard I now dwell in their personal experience and having penetrated them with wisdom I now see them' This faith of his Lord is his faculty of faith
Well said Sariputta well said spoke the Exalted One
Sutta translated by Nyanaponika Mahathera
Imparting balance to the faculties is the equalizing of the controlling faculties of faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdom
For if the faith faculty is strong and the others weak then the vigor faculty cannot perform its function of exerting the mindfulness faculty its function of attending to the object the concentration faculty its function of excluding distraction the wisdom faculty its function of seeing
So the strength of the faith faculty should be reduced by reflecting on the phenomenal nature and by not paying attention to what has caused the excessive strength of the faith faculty
Then if the vigor faculty is too strong the faith faculty cannot perform its function of convincing nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several functions
So in that case the excessive strength of the vigor faculty should be reduced by cultivating tranquillity concentration and equanimity
So too with the other factors for it should be understood that when any one of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several functions
However what is particularly recommended is the balancing of faith with wisdom and concentration with vigor
For one who is strong in faith and weak in wisdom places his confidence foolishly in an unworthy object
One strong in wisdom and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as a sickness caused by medicine
But with the balancing of the two faith and wisdom a man has confidence only in a deserving object
If there is too much of concentration and too little of vigor the mind will be overpowered by indolence to which concentration inclines
But if vigor is too strong and concentration too weak the mind will be overpowered by agitation to which vigor inclines
But concentration coupled with vigor cannot lapse into indolence and vigor coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitation
So these two should be balanced for absorption comes with the balancing of the two
Again
One working on concentration needs strong faith since it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorption
As to concentration and wisdom one working on concentration needs strong onepointedness of mind since that is how he reaches full absorption and one working on insight needs strong wisdom since that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics but with the balancing of the two he reaches full absorption as well
Strong mindfulness however is needed in all instances for mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith vigor and wisdom which tend to agitation and from lapsing into indolence through concentration which tends to indolence
So it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all curries as a prime minister in all the king's business
Hence it is said It was declared by the Exalted One that 'mindfulness indeed is of universal use' Why
Because the mind has mindfulness as its refuge and mindfulness is manifested as protection and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without mindfulness
 Visuddhimagga Adapted from Bhikkhu anamoli's translation The Path of Purification pp
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The philosophy of Buddhism is contained in the Four Noble Truths
The truth of suffering reveals that all forms of becoming all the various elements of existence comprised in the five aggregates or groups of existence  also called the five categories which are the objects of clinging  are inseparable from suffering as long as they remain objects of grasping or clinging
All corporeality all feelings and sensations all perceptions all mental formations and consciousness being impermanent are a source of suffering are conditioned phenomena and hence notself
Ceaseless origination and dissolution best characterize the process of existence called life for all elements of this flux of becoming continually arise from conditions created by us and then pass away giving rise to new elements of being according to one's actions or kamma
All suffering originates from craving and our very existence is conditioned by craving which is threefold the craving for sense pleasures craving for continued and renewed existence and craving for annihilation after death
This is the truth of the origin of suffering
The attainment of perfect happiness the breaking of the chain of rebirths and suffering through the realization of Nibbana is possible only through the utter extirpation of that threefold craving
This is the truth of suffering's cessation
The methods of training for the liberation from all suffering are applied by following the Noble Eightfold Path of Right Understanding Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Living Right Exertion Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration of Mind
The Noble Eightfold Path consists of three types of training summed up in virtuous conduct concentration and wisdom
This is the truth of the way that leads to the cessation of suffering
The prevalence of suffering and absence of freedom and happiness is due to man's subjection to the three roots of all unskill and evil and all unwholesome actions viz
lust hatred and delusion
Virtuous conduct casts out lust
The calm of true concentration and mental culture conquers hatred
Wisdom or right understanding also called direct knowledge resulting from meditation dispels all delusion
All these three types of training are possible only through the cultivation of constant mindfulness which forms the seventh link of the Noble Eightfold Path
Mindfulness is called a controlling faculty and a spiritual power and is also the first of the seven factors of enlightenment
Right Mindfulness has to be present in every skillful or karmically wholesome thought moment
It is the basis of all earnest endeavor for liberation and maintains in us the sense of urgency to strive for enlightenment or Nibbana
The Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness the Satipatthana Sutta is the tenth discourse of the Middle Length Collection of the Discourses of the Enlightened One
It is this version which is translated in the present publication
There is another version of it in the Collection of Long Discourses which differs only by a detailed explanation of the Four Noble Truths
The great importance of the Discourse on Mindfulness has never been lost to the Buddhists of the Theravada tradition
In Sri Lanka even when the knowledge and practice of the Dhamma was at its lowest ebb through centuries of foreign domination the Sinhala Buddhists never forgot the Satipatthana Sutta
Memorizing the Sutta has been an unfailing practice among the Buddhists and even today in Sri Lanka there are large numbers who can recite the Sutta from memory
It is a common sight to see on fullmoon days devotees who are observing the Eight Precepts engaged in community recital of the Sutta
Buddhists are intent on hearing this Discourse even in the last moments of their lives and at the bedside of a dying Buddhist either monks or laymen recite this venerated text
In the private shrine room of a Buddhist home the book of the Satipatthana Sutta is displayed prominently as an object of reverence
Monastery libraries of palmleaf manuscripts have the Sutta bound in highly ornamented covers
One such book with this Discourse written in Sinhala script on palmleaf has found its way from Sri Lanka as far as the State University Library of Bucharest in Rumania
This was disclosed while collecting material for the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism when an Esperantist correspondent gave us a list of a hundred books on Buddhism found in the Rumanian University Libraries
The subjects dealt with in the Satipatthana Sutta are corporeality feeling mind and mind objects being the universe of right Buddhist contemplation for deliverance
A very prominent place in the Discourse is occupied by the discussion on mindfulness of breathing
To make the present publication of greater practical value to the reader an introductory exposition of the methods of practicing that particular meditation will now be given
Mindfulness of breathing takes the highest place among the various subjects of Buddhist meditation
It has been recommended and praised by the Enlightened One thus This concentration through mindfulness of breathing when developed and practiced much is both peaceful and sublime it is an unadulterated blissful abiding and it banishes at once and stills evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they arise Though of such a high order the initial stages of this meditation are well within the reach of a beginner though he be only a lay student of the BuddhaDhamma
Both in the Discourse here translated and in the th Discourse of the same Collection which specifically deals with that meditation the initial instructions for the practice are clearly laid down
Herein monks a monk having gone to the forest or the root of a tree or to an empty place sits down with his legs crossed keeps his body erect and his mindfulness alert
Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in a long breath he knows I am breathing in a long breath breathing out a long breath he knows I am breathing out a long breath Breathing in a short breath he knows I am breathing in a short breath breathing out a short breath he knows I am breathing out a short breath Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself
Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out thus he trains himself
Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself
Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe out thus he trains himself
These are instructions given by the Enlightened One to the monks who after their alms round had the whole remaining day free for meditation
But what about the lay Buddhist who has a limited time to devote to this practice
Among the places described as fit for the practice of meditation one is available to all suññagara lit
empty house may mean any room in the house that has no occupant at that moment and one may in the course of the twentyfour hours of the day find a room in one's house that is empty and undisturbed
Those who work all day and feel too tired in the evening for meditation may devote the early hours of the morning to the practice of mindfulness of breathing
The other problem is the right posture for meditation
The full lotus posture of the yogi the padmasana as we see it in the Buddha statues proves nowadays rather difficult to many even to easterners
A youthful meditator however or even a middleaged one can well train himself in that posture in stages
He may for instance start with sitting on a low broad chair or bed bending only one leg and resting the other on the floor and so in gradual approximation he may finally master that posture
There are also other easier postures of sitting with legs bent for instance the halflotus posture
It will be worth one's effort to train oneself in such postures but if one finds them difficult and uncomfortable at the outset it will not be advisable to delay or disturb one's start with meditation proper on that account
One may allow a special time for sittingpractice using it as best as one can for contemplation and reflection but for the time being the practice of meditation aiming at higher degrees of concentration may better be done in a posture that is comfortable
One may sit on a straight backed chair of a height that allows the legs to rest comfortably on the floor without strain
As soon however as a crosslegged posture has become more comfortable one should assume it for the practice of mindfulness of breathing since it will allow one to sit in meditation for a longer time than is possible on a chair
The meditator's body and mind should be alert but not tense
A place with a dimmed light will be profitable since it will help to exclude diverting attention to visible objects
The right place time and posture are very important and often essential for a successful meditative effort
Though we have been breathing throughout our life we have done so devoid of mindfulness and hence when we try to follow each breath attentively we find that the Buddhist teachers of old were right when they compared the natural state of an uncontrolled mind to an untamed calf
Our minds have long been dissipated among visible data and other objects of the senses and of thought and hence do not yield easily to attempts at mindcontrol
Suppose a cowherd wanted to tame a wild calf he would take it away from the cow and tie it up apart with a rope to a stout post
Then the calf might dash to and fro but being unable to get away and tired after its effort it would eventually lie down by the post
So too when the meditator wants to tame his own mind that has long been reared on the enjoyment of sense objects he should take it away from places where these sense objects abound and tie the mind to the post of inbreaths and outbreaths with the rope of mindfulness
And though his mind may then dash to and fro when deprived of its liberty to roam among the sense objects it will ultimately settle down when mindfulness is persistent and strong
When practicing mindfulness of breathing attention should be focused at the tip of the nose or at the point of the upper lip immediately below where the current of air can be felt
The meditator's attention should not leave this focusing point from where the incoming and outgoing breaths can be easily felt and observed
The meditator may become aware of the breath's route through the body but he should not pay attention to it
At the beginning of the practice the meditator should concentrate only on the inbreaths and outbreaths and should not fall into any reflections about them
It is only at a later stage that he should apply himself to the arousing of knowledge and other states connected with the concentration
In this brief introduction only the first steps of the beginner can be discussed
For more information the student may refer to the English translation of the Visuddhimagga by Bhikkhu anamoli or to Mindfulness of Breathing by Bhikkhu anamoli and to The Heart of Buddhist Meditation by Nyanaponika Thera
The lay Buddhist who undertakes this practice will first take the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts he will review the reflections on the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha transmit thoughts of lovingkindness in all directions recollect that this meditation will help him to reach the goal of deliverance through direct knowledge and mental calm and only then should he start with the mindfulness of breathing proper first by way of counting
The Buddhist teachers of old recommend that a beginner should start the practice by counting the breaths mentally
In doing so he should not stop short of five or go beyond ten or make any break in the series
By stopping short of five breaths his mind has not enough room for contemplation and by going beyond ten his mind takes the number rather than the breaths for its objects and any break in the series would upset the meditation
When counting the meditator should first count when the inbreath or the outbreath is completed not when it begins
So taking the inbreath first he counts mentally 'one' when that inbreath is complete then he counts 'two' when the outbreath is complete 'three' after the next inbreath and so on up to ten and then again from one to ten and so he should continue
After some practice in counting at the completion of a breath breathing may becoming faster
The breaths however should not be made longer or shorter intentionally
The meditator has to be just mindful of their occurrence as they come and go
Now he may try counting 'one' when he begins to breathe in or breathe out counting up to five or ten and then again from one to five or ten
If one takes both the inbreath and outbreath as 'one' it is better to count only up to five
Counting should be employed until one can dispense with it in following the sequence of breaths successively
Counting is merely a device to assist in excluding stray thoughts
It is as it were a guideline or railing for supporting mindfulness until it can do without such help
There may be those who will feel the counting more as a complication than a help and they may well omit it attending directly to the flow of the respiration by way of connecting the successive breaths
After the counting has been discarded the meditator should now continue his practice by way of connecting that is by following mindfully the in and out breaths without recourse to counting and yet without a break in attentiveness
Here too the breaths should not be followed beyond the nostrils where the respiratory air enters and leaves
The meditator must strive to be aware of the whole breath in its entire duration and without missing one single phase but his attention must not leave the place of contact the nostrils or that point of the upper lip where the current of air touches
While following the inbreaths and outbreaths thus they become fainter and fainter and at times it is not easy to remain aware of that subtle sensation of touch caused by the respiration
Keener mindfulness is required to keep track of the breaths then
But if the meditator perseveres one day he will feel a different sensation a feeling of ease and happiness and occasionally there appears before his mental eye something like a luminous star or a similar sign which indicates that one approaches the stage of access concentration
Steadying the newly acquired sign one may cultivate full mental absorption or at least the preliminary concentration as a basis for practicing insight
The practice of mindfulness of breathing is meant for both mental calm and insight
Direct knowledge being the object of Buddhist meditation the concentration gained by the meditative practice should be used for the clear understanding of reality as manifest in oneself and in the entire range of one's experience
Though penetrative insight leading to Nibbana is the ultimate object progress in mindfulness and concentration will also bring many benefits in our daily lives
If we have become habituated to follow our breaths for a longer period of time and can exclude all intruding irrelevant thoughts mindfulness selfcontrol and efficiency are sure to increase in all our activities
Just as our breathing so also other processes of body and mind will become clearer to us and we shall come to know more of ourselves
It has been said by the Buddha Mindfulness of breathing developed and repeatedly practiced is of great fruit of great advantage for it fulfills the four foundations of mindfulness the four foundations of mindfulness developed and repeatedly practiced fulfill the seven enlightenment factors the seven enlightenment factors developed and repeatedly practiced fulfill clearvision and deliverance Clear vision and deliverance or direct knowledge and the bliss of liberation are the highest fruit of the application of mindfulness
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was living among the Kurus at Kammasadamma a market town of the Kuru people
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu thus Monks and they replied to him Venerable Sir The Blessed One spoke as follows
This is the only way monks for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the four foundations of mindfulness
What are the four
Herein a monk lives contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating feelings in feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief
And how does a monk live contemplating the body in the body
Herein monks a monk having gone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits down with his legs crossed keeps his body erect and his mindfulness alert
Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in a long breath he knows I am breathing in a long breath breathing out a long breath he knows I am breathing out a long breath breathing in a short breath he knows I am breathing in a short breath breathing out a short breath he knows I am breathing out a short breath
Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself
Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out thus he trains himself
Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself
Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe out thus he trains himself
Just as a skillful turner or turner's apprentice making a long turn knows I am making a long turn or making a short turn knows I am making a short turn just so the monk breathing in a long breath knows I am breathing in a long breath breathing out a long breath he knows I am breathing out a long breath breathing in a short breath he knows I am breathing in a short breath breathing out a short breath he knows I am breathing out a short breath Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself

Just as if there were a doublemouthed provision bag full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy paddy green gram cowpeas sesamum and husked rice and a man with sound eyes having opened that bag were to take stock of the contents thus This is hill paddy this is paddy this is green gram this is cowpea this is sesamum this is husked rice Just so monks a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the headhairs down thinking thus There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidney heart liver midriff spleen lungs intestines mesentery gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva nasal mucus synovial fluid urine

How monks does a monk live contemplating mental objects in the mental objects of the four noble truths
Herein monks a monk knows This is suffering according to reality he knows This is the origin of suffering according to reality he knows This is the cessation of suffering according to reality he knows This is the road leading to the cessation of suffering according to reality

Verily monks whosoever practices these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for seven years then one of these two fruits may be expected by him highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
O monks let alone seven years
Should any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for six years five years four years three years two years one year then one of these two fruits may be expected by him highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
O monks let alone a year
Should any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for seven months six months five months four months three months two months a month half a month then one of these two fruits may be expected by him highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
O monks let alone half a month
Should any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for a week then one of these two fruits may be expected by him highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
Because of this it was said This is the only way monks for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the four foundations of mindfulness
Thus spoke the Blessed One
Satisfied the monks approved of his words
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The essay that forms the first part of this booklet bears in its German original the title Pabbajja which in Pali the language of the Buddhist texts means Going forth namely from the household life to the homelessness of a Buddhist monk
The Pali word Pabbajja is also the term for the first ordination bestowed for entry into the Buddhist monastic Order by which the candidate becomes a Novice or Samanera like the author of the writings presented here whose illness and premature death deprived him of taking higher ordination
Fritze Stange the lay name of our author was a German by birth and received his novice ordination in at Matara under the nestor of the German Buddhist monks the Venerable Nyanatiloka Thera
Together with Sumano a Dutchman called Bergendahl was ordained as the Samanera Suñño
They were the first two pupils of the Venerable Nyanatiloka who on his part had received novice ordination in and higher ordination in both in Burma
As related in the Appendix of this booklet illness obliged Sumano to go back to Germany but in the same year he returned again to Ceylon together with the Venerable Nyanatiloka who had paid a short visit to Germany
He took ordination again and then lived in the undulating grassy hillocks of Bandarawela in Ceylon's upcountry  a landscape of ascetical bareness breathing seclusion and quietude
There he died and was cremated in January
A spout just by the spot where he lived still bears in the Sinhala language the name German Phihilla
Sumano was held in great reverence by the people for his deep piety
He was of an unassuming nature but his bearing emanated an atmosphere of saintliness and detachment of maturity and gentle firmness which obviously must have set him apart from the multitude
The same atmosphere of the true ascetic's sincere and forceful simplicity radiates from the pages of his little book Pabbajja
It's first publication in Germany in the year deeply impressed and inspired the members of the small circles of German Buddhists
An English version by Bhikkhu Silacara appeared in Ceylon the same year
This has been fully revised for the present edition after comparison with the German original
Sumano's letters appeared in print in a German Buddhist magazine Die Buddhistische Warte and are published here for the first time in an English version prepared by the Venerable Nyanaponika Thera
Both essays and letters served first to justify and explain Sumano's unusual step of entering Buddhist monkhood in the East
There is however nothing apologetic in his words no diffident defense they are rather a stirring call to kindred minds for proceeding on that hard but incomparably rewarding road towards the unshakable deliverance of mind In the same spirit they are offered here to the reader as a companion to another booklet in this series of Buddhist publications The Ascetic Ideal by Ronald Fussell
He is beside himself Marvelous is it O Lord extraordinary is it O Lord how the Exalted One has so clearly pointed out the Four Satipatthana which lead to the purification of beings to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation to the cessation of pain and grief to the attainment of the path to the realization of Nibbana
For we also Lord as householders have from time to time fixed our minds upon the Four Satipatthana  Whilst we thus dwell with earnest minds eager unweariedly the memories of household things pass from us and as they so pass the heart grows ever more steady becomes quieted and unified finds peace
The more frequently a man thus dwells all the more perceptibly does the alienation increase does the world die away from him for ever more clearly does the true nature of the world reveal itself to the mind through the persistent contemplation of this truth founded in experience
Always the same law always the same song
I know not Ananda even of a single form whereby pleasure and satisfaction in form does not pass into sorrow and lamentation pain grief despair since it is transient and changeable  and so with feeling and so with perception and so with the mental formations and so with consciousness
This world however seeks pleasure loves pleasure prizes pleasure
Only a few beings are stirred by things that are truly stirring in comparison with the greater number who remain unstirred by truly stirring things
And again there are only a few who being stirred earnestly strive in comparison with the greater number who being stirred yet do not earnestly strive
Unrestrained by the perception of the hollowness of things flows on the hot stream of foolish desire O that no birth lay before us no old age no death no sorrow no lamentation no pain no grief no despair
 but this is not to be obtained by mere desiring and not to get what one desires is suffering Ah
if only our parents would remain alive Ah
if only our loved one would not die Ah
the misery of this law of nature
How many millions daily sob and weep over graves
The misery of this law of nature
What dear to one brings sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair attachment is the root of suffering Hence the uprooting of suffering is nonattachment the way of escape from all this wretchedness is nonattachment denial renunciation
Whoso cleaves to woe follows after woe is bound up with woe and thus considers 'That belongs to me that I am that is my self  can such one really comprehend woe can such a one avoid the woe that encompasses him' But he who withdraws himself from attachment and learns to renounce to deny and to turn away deprives the heart's pain of its nourishment and by degrees brings about its extinction
The turning away of the will vanquishes all woe
This turning away comes into operation where there is an understanding of suffering of the arising of suffering of the cessation of suffering and of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering
Before understanding these truths man hastens from birth to death in the sea of existence without deriving therefrom any true gain for his deliverance  worn out for naught the body perishes It is through lack of understanding and insight into the Four Holy Truths ye disciples that we had travel so long the weary round of Samsara  both you and What think ye which is greater  the floods of tears which weeping and wailing ye have shed on this long journey ever and again hastening towards new birth and new death united to the undesired sundered from the desired  this or the waters of the four great seas
For long have ye experienced the death of a mother for long the death of a father for long the death of a son for long the death of a daughter for long the death of brothers and sisters for long ye were harassed by disease and whilst experiencing the death of mother of father of son of daughter of brothers and sisters the loss of property the torment of disease whilst being united with the undesired and sundered from the desired thus hastening from birth to death and from death to birth ye have verily shed more tears on this long journey than all the waters that are held in the four great seas
But how is that possible
Without beginning and without end is this Samsara unknowable is the beginning of beings sunk in ignorance who seized by craving ever and again are brought to renewed birth and so hastened through the endless round of rebirths
Thus for long have ye experienced suffering experienced torment experienced misery and filled the graveyards  long enough truly to have become dissatisfied with all existence long enough to turn away from all being long enough to seek release from it all
Who take this exhortation to themselves
Those whose minds are stirred by these thoughts
And being stirred they will learn to understand and will earnestly strive
For them delight and pleasure in the world gradually passes away they perceive the coarse as well as the subtle lures of Mara wearied are they of intoxication of selfdeception no longer do they shrink from the inevitable struggle for the overcoming of the world yea to this or that one the widespread misery in the world reveals itself to his mind so nakedly so powerfully that the cry for the end of it drowns every other voice Forth forth forth to the other shore Sunk am I in birth in old age and death in sorrow lamentation and pain in grief and despair sunk in suffering lost in suffering
O that it were possible to make an end of all this mass of suffering To such a comprehension to such a longing the meaning of asceticism becomes evident as that manner of living which really makes possible singleminded devotion to that most difficult of all tasks  the task of becoming perfectly good or pure or holy and thereby free from suffering and rebirth
If I truly understand the doctrine declared by the Exalted One it is not easy for one who remains in household life to fulfill point by point the wholly stainless wholly purified ascetic life Whoso lives in the house is busy overmuch is much occupied anxious about many things disturbed about many things he is not always entirely devoted to truthfulness not always and entirely zealous in self control chaste recollected given to renunciation
There has never been a householder Vaccha who without forsaking householdties has at the dissolution of the body made an end to suffering
Therefore whoso resolutely seeks the end After a time will leave behind a small property or leave behind a large property he forsakes a small circle of acquaintances or he forsakes a large circle of acquaintances and goes forth from home to homelessness  pabbajja
But father and mother wife and children love and duty
The sense of duty depends on understanding
Once a duty has been understood as the higher one it sets aside the lower conception of duty held formerly
For years a man may have devoted himself to the care of wife and child prizing nothing higher than his family's welfare
Then war comes to his country
The course of events stirs him profoundly he is affected by new ideas another view of things gain strength within him
Sweet it is to die for the fatherland The feeling overpowers him What care I for wife what care I for child Of his own free will he goes forth to meet the foes of the fatherland
The duty to his country now seems to him higher than the duty to his wife and children
Another man has in former days with full conviction solemnly vowed faithfully to stand by his country even to death
Later on in consequence of higher comprehension he gains a higher standpoint a wider outlook envisages politics as a citizen of the world thinks in universal terms This Frenchman is a fellow human being is a fellow sufferer
This Russian is a fellow human being is a fellow sufferer
Life is a sacred thing frightful barbaric is this wholesale killing called war  the visible aggravation of suffering No longer can he slay his fellowmen
In case of a call to arms he willingly allows himself to be shot by his own countrymen
The duty Thou shalt not kill stands higher in his eyes than any duty towards his fatherland
Yet another as pastor for many a year enjoyed a secure living with his family
By degrees his views undergo a change
He finds himself unable any longer to give his assent to dogmas to the doctrines of Revelation of Grace or of Forgiveness of Sins or Vicarious Atonement he can no longer believe in that deplorable and absurd doctrine of eternal damnation for the deeds of a brief spell of thirty years A higher knowledge has come to fruition within him
Clear and evident to him has become the universally ruling law the unchangeable equable relation of cause and effect the unfailingly just recompensations of right or wrong action
He burdens his mind neither with thoughts about the unfathomable nor with useless discussions he go on preaching as before
He will follow his altered convictions give up his position as pastor  come what may
Whoso acts according to his deepest understanding is always straight and candid ever acts in accordance with truth  at least relatively so for a man's truth is his degree of understanding
To a man now who has clearly perceived the pitiable condition of all beings that share a common existence what higher holier or more urgent task can there be than to become perfectly kind perfectly good or holy and thereby to get himself cured of this being born growing old and dying of this sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
Hence if he has truly recognized the significance and value of asceticism for the fulfillment of this highest duty and experienced the impossibility of its perfect realization in household life there follows the going forth into homelessness as necessarily as the fall of the drop that is full
No man can serve two masters  fully well
The man who devotedly strives for the fulfillment of the Doctrine experiences intensely the unsatisfactoriness of divided allegiance
Hence after a time he gives it up for the blessing of himself as well as of his family an inward law of development that is beyond dispute
Only a mother knows the pangs of childbirth and only a mother knows the succeeding joys of motherhood
Only he who has left home knows the relief of relinquishing accustomed bonds only he who has left home knows the happiness of being free an inward experience  indisputable
The joys of the family life and the joys of the homeless life  these are two different joys and the nobler of the two is the joy the homeless life
If millions of honest men in worldly life find Pabbajja the Going Forth obnoxious if they condemn the incomprehensible act as wrong as unnatural or deplore it as a mental aberration they are quite right from their own standpoint no intelligent man will contradict them
They act in accordance with their conception of duty and are great great in their place if before all things they care for beloved parents for wife and children and strive to fulfill the manifold important duties laid upon them by their life in the world
Also the few who have a bent for the ascetic life and honestly long for it but feel themselves bound one way or another to their wanted way of life and therefore remain in its bondage  they also are right from their own standpoint
So also are those individuals right who go forth being no longer bound inwardly
It is not the outward circumstances that bind a man by himself is man really bound by himself is he really free
By logic by reasoning or by eloquent words alone that act of going forth into homelessness can certainly not be argued or explained
But whoso sees this law whoso sees this truth no longer asks for proof
Quietly and with confidence he acts
What the world says about it leaves him unconcerned
There are two goals the holy goal and the unholy goal
But what is the unholy goal
One himself subject to birth seeks what also is subject to birth himself subject to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilement seeks what also is subject to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilement
But what is subject to birth old age sickness death pain and defilement
Wife and child are subject to birth old age sickness death pain and defilement servant and maid lamb and goat gold and silver are subject to birth old age sickness death pain and defilement
Subject to birth old age sickness death pain to defilement are these things
And allured blinded enchanted a man himself subject to birth to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilement seeks what also is subject to birth old age sickness death to pain to defilement
This is the unholy goal
But what is the holy goal
One himself subject to birth perceiving the misery of this law of nature seeks that which is free from birth the incomparable surety of Nibbana subject to old age to sickness to death to pain to defilement perceiving the misery of this law of nature seeks that which is free from old age sickness death pain and defilement the incomparable surety of Nibbana
This is the holy goal
Formerly when but a Bodhisatta myself subject to birth I sought what also was subject to birth myself subject to old age sickness death pain defilement sought what also was subject to old age sickness death pain defilement
And it occurred to me as follows 'Why myself subject to birth old age sickness death pain defilement do I seek what also is subject to birth old age sickness death pain defilement
What if now myself subject to birth perceiving the misery of this law of nature I were to seek the incomparable surety of Nibbana free from birth myself subject to old age sickness death pain defilement perceiving the misery of this law of nature I were to seek the incomparable surety of Nibbana free from old age sickness death pain defilement
And after a time while still young with coalblack hair possessed of radiant youth in the prime of my life against the wish of my weeping and wailing parents I had my hair and beard shaved off put on the yellow robe and went forth from the household life to the houseless one Whoso well in time sees the holy goal with penetrating clearness he can no longer tie matrimonial bonds
Whether however a man be old or young whether he be married or not  at whatever period of his life the urge in him for the ascetic life asserts itself then along with the other bonds binding to the worldly life the bonds of blood relationship also lose their force
The mother has become an elder sister the father has become a brother the wife has become a sister the son has become a brother fellow beings fellow sufferers
Attachment longing have died away alienation has set in
Such a one has no longer a place and use in the family
Another law works in the members a wider love
In love the ascetic goes forth from the family out of love he leaves it
Truly difficult to understand is the love in genuine ascetic mind yet relatives also learn to understand it
And if the families out of which those noble men have gone forth from home into homelessness think of these noble men with love for long will it make for their weal and happiness
Just as a man who out of true feelings gives alms at the same time makes richer his family though to outward appearance that family may suffer some loss in goods or money so truly bestows a householder a rich treasure to an understanding family if in a right frame of mind moved by the highest of duties he renounces the worldly life even though that family may lose its external support
This loss which not seldom is brought about by premature death can be made good and is unessential but essential is awakening from the slumber thoughtfulness insight the perspective of Anatta turning away detachment  that is what matters
Naught is the loss of relatives riches and honor but the loss of insight is the heaviest loss
Naught is the gain of relatives riches and honor but the gain of insight  that is the highest gain
Wherefore let your endeavor be Insight will be gain
Let this be your endeavor
And the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji had heard it said 'The monk Sangamaji has arrived in Savatthi' Then she took her child and went to the monastery at the Jeta Grove near Savatthi
At that time however the venerable Sangamaji sat at the foot of a tree to spend the afternoon there devoted to meditation
Then the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji betook herself thither and spoke to the venerable Sangamaji Look at thy little son here O ascetic
Give me food' But to these words the venerable Sangamaji maintained silence
A second and a third time the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji so spoke 'Look at thy little son here
Give me food' And a second and a third time did the venerable Sangamaji preserve silence
Then the wife of the venerable Sangamaji laid the child down in front of the venerable Sangamaji and went away saying 'There is thy son O ascetic give him food' The venerable Sangamaji however neither looked at the child nor uttered a word
Now when the former wife of the venerable Sangamaji having gone some distance turned round she saw that the venerable Sangamaji neither looked at the child nor said anything
Then she thought 'This ascetic cares not even for his child' turned back took up the child and went away
If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple
Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple
 Luke and 
Think not that I come to send peace on peace I came not to send peace but a sword
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw
And a man's foes shall be they of his own household
He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
 Matthew X
Let the dead bury their dead
 Luke IX
My kingdom is not of this world
 John 
Apart from the differences existing between the teachings of the Buddha and of the Christ all these sayings have these ideas in common
Void throughout is this world
Whoso hungers and thirsts to overcome this world will loosen all earthly bonds count them but dirt
Commentators and scribes there are in abundance but whoso has eyes will see
Day after day twentyfour hours older a hundred thousand heart beats nearer to the grave inevitably
O put all wishes aside save the desire to know truth recognize the truth and tell it come what may Whoso does not act in that way deceives himself and others
Whoso shrinks from the decision that truth demands puts obstacles in the way of himself and others though it may not always be obvious
Put not thy trust in friends or relatives and put not off thy salvation till the future for man will forget thee sooner than thou thinkest
It is better to provide now in time and do the right than to trust to help of another
If thou art not solicitous for thee in the future
Now is the time very precious now is the day of salvation
 Thomas a Kempis
None can do for another what is needed for deliverance
Here each has to rely on himself alone
Concern for oneself in that sense is far from being reprehensible egotism
It has nothing to do with the oppression or exploitation of others with harshness towards others
Once Lord in an hour of solitude and retirement the following thoughts came to me 'To whom is one's self dear to whom is it not dear' And this Lord occurred to me Those who do and speak and think evilly to these their self is not dear
And even though they say 'We love ourselves' yet they do not love themselves
And why not
Whatsoever unlovely thing they do to one unbeloved that they do to their own selves
Therefore is it that their self is not dear to them
Those however who act and speak and think rightly to them their self is dear
And even though they may say 'We love not ourselves' yet they do love themselves
And why
Whatsoever lovely thing they do to one beloved that they do to their own selves
Therefore is it that their self is dear to them  That is so great king
Not only is such true care for oneself unreprehensible but it is the only way to become hale and holy oneself and to help others to become likewise
A man may do ever so much good and take upon himself ever so many abnegations and yet as long as he does not know himself he will not reach deliverance  The only limitations he imposes upon himself are those arising from not knowing himself
In the degree however that he knows himself he is able to do greatest service a man can render for another namely to help him to help himself to bring him to a true knowledge of himself of his own inner power Hence the more ardently a man devotes himself to the work of his own deliverance all the sooner and more effectively can he become a blessing to others for all the sooner can he learn and experience what will help himself and others to win true deliverance the laws for it are the same for all
Any other helpful action however meritorious it may be is concerned with things external not with the world within
Can the blind lead the blind
Shall they not both fall into the ditch Whoso has ever offered to others bread for stones has first of all labored within himself lonely apart untiringly ardent and resolute
The inward worker who has lived the truth speaks from experience with the assurance of an expert So it is he says and not So it may be Therefore his words produce in susceptible minds an inner crisis never experienced before a crisis severe but wholesome The word of the wise heals As is the speech of the inwards worker so is his outward behavior true straight and firm serene aloof uncommon
Such venerable ones are the greatest benefactors of their fellow men the best physicians visible witnesses of the fact that detachment from the world is possible by their very lives they point to the way by which that what continually produces and feeds new suffering can be eliminated
Therefore whether householder or monk  above all win to a true vision for thyself
Know thyself  Be ever mindful of thyself
That Cunda one himself sunk into the mire should pull out of the mire another sunk therein  this cannot be
But that one himself not sunk in the mire can lift out of the mire another sunk therein  that may be
And that one himself not subdued not disciplined not attained to the extinction of delusion should lead others to become subdued and disciplined to attain to the extinction of delusion  this cannot be
But that one who himself is subdued and disciplined and has attained to the extinction of delusion should lead others also to become subdued and disciplined and to attain to the extinction of delusion  this may well be
The most likely possibility of escape from the mire of ignorance is offered by the life of a tree monk
Though the Buddha's Teaching has been described as running counter to the common current profound subtle and hard to realize there are those in the world who on hearing that Teaching feel irresistibly attracted to the monk life
There are those who once they become aware of the general misery of life and of the way of the speediest release from it lay everything else aside and without delay go forth into the homeless life  their insight needed only to be roused Others again are able after a severe struggle to break up all bridges behind them
Deeprooted desires and ideas coarse or subtle so strongly ingrained in ordinary life may obstruct for long an appreciation of the ascetic life hence people are not in a hurry to turn to it and the strength of character needed for renunciation is lacking
Even that state of mind Mahanama still exists in thee and causes thy heart to be overpowered at times by impulses of desire by impulses of anger by impulses of delusion
For Mahanama if that state of mind no longer had any place in thee thou wouldst not remain in the home life in the enjoyment of desires
It is quite true that noble characters can be found everywhere in society also in family life it is true that not a few householders die more ennobled in mind than many a monk it is true that an earnest devoted disciple by virtue of an unusually developed character due to his good Kamma of the past may without abandoning household ties attain to almost all stages of holiness that is up to the stage of the nonreturner
But no one who knows will maintain that he who is determined to make an end of suffering may to the same effect remain in the household life as lead the life of a monk
On the contrary the wisest of all times teach that such a man will choose a mode of life detached from all worldly bonds he will go the road that offers the least resistance to his aspirations
Separation isolation again and again is necessary for bringing suffering to an end
Just as the steam which is asleep in the water and awakened by fire does not develop its giant strength does not become a concentrated power unless it is shut in likewise man's inner potentialities for lack of seclusion for lack of isolation cannot develop cannot be converted into higher powers
Many live far below their possibilities because they continually surrender their individualities to others In the worldly life full selfrecollectedness full devotion to the goal do not come easily
The chaotic mass of uncontrolled impressions will divert and distract again and again and will lead astray
Sadly great is the sum of energy daily expended to no profit
In home life too much nutriment gross or subtle is supplied by the world of the five senses and this will ever and again disturb those thoughts that in the nobleminded are naturally directed towards higher things hence there is only very slow progress in discarding and uprooting obstructing qualities and evil propensities of the mind
Quite different is it in the homeless state in a life of solitude
There man is as it were forsaken by all the world and thrown back entirely upon himself without palliatives and selfdeceptions
There he learns to be profoundly ashamed of all that is base and feels himself impelled to strive for progress mindfully he breathes in mindfully he breathes out and he wins to the insight that frees from suffering
In secluded places  in the depth of the forest in a lonely cottage a mountain cave a cemetery  the five senses in the absence of their usual objects of craving are as it were put out of action and the sixth sense the mind alone detached undisturbed effectively collected can do its work can understand the workings of greed hatred and delusion can reject them
What are the characteristics of those venerable ones what is so special to them that people should say of them 'Truly these venerable ones have lost greed and hatred and delusion or are on the way to overcome them'
This question may be answered thus 'Those venerable ones seek out lonely places in the depth of the forest There are not to be found any forms entering the field of vision that can be looked at and craved for no sounds entering the field of hearing to be listened to and craved for no odors entering the field of smell to be smelled and craved for no flavors entering the field of taste that can be tasted and craved for no bodily contacts entering the field of touch that can be felt and craved for
Bodily isolation in secluded places facilitates isolation from craving and other hindrances
At the start this purification and concentration of mind comes only temporarily during specific meditative exercises but later on strengthened by these very exercises that pure and concentrated state of mind can be maintained for an increasingly longer time and will make possible a deep and penetrative insight into the true nature of things
And that vision when completely cleansed of delusion will finally bring about ultimate isolation the freedom of every kind of attachment
In other words to a disciple tirelessly meditating in solitude the transient painful and unsubstantial nature of all constituents of existence will become apparent with an increasing clarity and certainty
To the degree however that ignorance and delusion about this world disappear also desire for anything in it and hate or anger against anything in it will die away they will lose their objects their foothold their basis their sanction
Thus with the withdrawal of the fuel this terrible conflagration of suffering is brought to extinction sooner or later according to previous actionforce and present effort
True holiness is never born without solitude never is it perfected without struggle with the passions within
Yet the untiring activity of Gotama the Buddha and of many of his disciples demonstrate that solitude and the happiness of seclusion are not as many think the aim and end of the ascetic life but they are an essential means to the end and are an incomparable mine of strength and inspiration to him who resolutely strives for the goal
Ye should know that those people practice the most useful practices
Know ye that the kingdom is blessed where man is inwardly one
They produce more eternal gain in one moment than all works ever wrought outwardly
 Meister Eckehart
By a wrong view of life all ascetic endeavor will naturally be considered as egotism pure and simple but right understanding will never regard it like that
The true ascetic who has wholeheartedly taken up the training knows that in the absolute sense there is no ego nor anything belonging to it neither I nor mine
Neither corporeality nor feeling perception formations and consciousness contain any abiding substance because they are transient painful subject to change
Therefore no longer can one who has entered the path where deliverance is assured bestir himself for the sake of the ego his striving aims at the final cessation of the conditioned personality by the gradual elimination of all its roots
But during his more or less protracted struggle for final emancipation the Sekha is not yet entirely cured of all selfaffirmation of all impulses connected with I and Mine still the old Kamma clings to him
Only in the arahant the Holy One is the truth of Anatta fully realized and therewith all and every form of selfaffirmation is done away through the cessation rejection removal denial and relinquishment of all notions of I and Mine and all biases of selfconceit he has won perfect deliverance In other words
Ignorance is the root of all selfaffirmation
It is this very truth that none in this world period has as perfectly penetrated as perfectly taught as the Buddha
The entire hard struggle for deliverance was called by the Enlightened One briefly The liberation from the fetter of ignorance that is from selfillusion
Hence Sariputta thus should you train yourself 'Concerning this body endowed with consciousness there shall not arise any notions and biases shall not arise
And we shall abide in the attainment of this deliverance of the heart this deliverance by wisdom through which all these notions and biases cease' Thus Sariputta should you train yourself
And in so far Sariputta as a monk attains to this deliverance of the heart this deliverance by wisdom he is called one who has cut off craving removed the fetters of existence has made an end of suffering by the full elimination of selfconceit
The more devotedly one strives towards this goal the more selfless he becomes and the earlier will he make an end of all egotism
Sangham saranam gacchami
I take refuge in the Order of Monks
But to be sure mere outward asceticism is of no avail
Whether one remains in the household life or whether one goes forth from it to the homeless state if one lives wrongly I do not praise it
For whosoever either remains at home or departs from home if he lives wrongly on account of that wrong way of life he can gain nothing on the good path of the Dhamma  I do not ascribe asceticism to a robe wearer just because he wears a monk's robe
I do not ascribe asceticism to a forest hermit just because he lives in the forest
I do not ascribe asceticism to a knower of text just because he knows many texts Not because a man wears a robe dwells in the forest knows the texts speaks much about the Doctrine can he get rid of craving propensities can he get rid of hating propensities can he get rid of delusive propensities
There are people who void of faith go forth from home into homelessness hypocrites dissemblers shamascetics conceited men busy talkers and chatterers bad guardians of the doors of the senses without moderation at meals not devoted to wakefulness indifferent to asceticism without respect for the training fond of luxury importunate preferring what is detrimental shunning solitude as a heavy burden lazy without energy heedless and uncomprehending uncontrolled and distracted minds of small understanding and stupid
Such a monk's asceticism appears to me O monks like a murderous weapon meant for slaughter doubled edged well sharpened covered band wrapped round with a robe
A knife taken up by the blade wounds the hand misused asceticism drags one the downward path
In error ye wander O monks of Assaji upon a false path ye wander O monks of Assaji
How far apart have they strayed the foolish from this Doctrine and Discipline Hard it is to serve the Exalted One very hard it is to serve the Exalted One  meeting with this experience many a weak disciple discouraged or displeased has given up asceticism
Only to him who knows suffering only to one who true to the Doctrine earnestly works within fighting purposefully and persistently against Mara  to such a one only will the external circumstances of asceticism prove to be what actually they ought to be according to Buddha's declaration The most suitable conditions which the world can offer for the complete overcoming of the world
Again and again did the Master place before his disciples the hollowness and futility of halfhearted asceticism as well as the seriousness and difficulties of the true monk's life
Never did he attempt to persuade anyone to become his disciple or to lead the ascetic life under him
He lays the Doctrine before the people does not persuade them does not dissuade them He shows the nature of this world after he himself has understood and penetrated it
The doctrine excellent in the beginning excellent in the middle excellent in its consummation does he proclaim both in the spirit and in the letter he sets forth the holy life in its fullness and purity Now if the nature and purpose of this ascetic life becomes overwhelmingly clear to a householder or a householder's son he will become an ascetic of his own free will following his inner urge
Sunken I am in birth in old age and death in distress lamentation and pain in grief and despair sunken in suffering lost in suffering
Oh
that it might be possible to make an end of this whole mass of misery In such a state of mind filled with confidence he renounces the worldly life and such a renunciation is called in the texts rightminded renunciation
With such a true renunciation such a true Pabbajja has he arrived in a clearing   but no further
Whoso as a noble son has thus renounced what has he to do
Whoso finds no detachment from desires from evil states of mind whoso finds no joy and happiness or other still better gain his heart will be seized and bound by lust will be seized and bound by illwill will be seized and bound by sloth and torpor will be seized and bound by restlessness and worry will be seized and bound by doubt will be seized and bound by dissatisfaction will be seized and bound by attachment
But whoso finds detachment from desires from evil states of mind and finds joy and happiness and other states of mind and finds joy and happiness and other still better gain his heart will not be seized and bound by lust will not be seized and bound by illwill by sloth and torpor restlessness and worry by doubt dissatisfaction and attachment But this nobility of mind how is it acquired
Only through meditation and again meditation Here trees invite there lonely cottages
Go meditate
Be not slothful lest later ye repent
True asceticism is an obstinate mute struggle
Mighty is Mara
Fearfully deepembedded is delusion
Dying and becoming
Dying and becoming No standing still should be permitted no satisfaction with what has been attained
Ever more strong must ye become to reach what is still unreached to attain what is still unattained to realize what is still unrealized I declare unto you O monks I call upon you to give heed ye that aspire to the goal of asceticism see that the goal does not elude you while there is more to accomplish
Dying and becoming again and again  until nothing can any more become and hence there is nothing that can die
No rest no stopping before Nibbana is reached
Also to the world beyond I shall not cleave nor shall my consciousness be bound to that world
All nutriment is misery heavenly food as well
To be conscious is to be suffering An ascetic thus minded has found and finds ever greater and loftier results he is well satisfied with the ascetic life does not give up the noble effort It is called 'death' in the Order of the Holy One when a person gives up asceticism and turns back to the common life of the world  this he now appreciates depending upon none in that experience
As the moth that has caught sight of the light does not turn back to the darkness and as the ant dies on the sugar heap so he turns not back to the worldly way of life but devotes himself fully to the noble training so that he may reach the highest state Nibbana the extinction of delusion
And so he becomes fit to eradicate the taints and to attain in this very life time to the taintfree deliverance of the heart the deliverance by wisdom
Whoso monks practices the four Foundations of Mindfulness for seven years may expect one of the two results the Highest Knowledge in his present life time or if there is a remainder of clinging left the state of nonreturn
Setting aside seven years whoso monks thus practices the four Foundations of Mindfulness for six years five years four years three years two years one year  nay setting aside one year whoso practices the four Foundations of Mindfulness for seven months may expect one of the two results the Highest Knowledge in his present life time or if there is a remainder of clinging the state of nonreturn
Setting aside seven months whoso monks practices these four Foundations of Mindfulness for six months five months four months three months two months one month or half a month  nay setting aside half a month whoso practices these four Foundations of Mindfulness for seven days may expect one of these two results the Highest Knowledge in his present life time or if there is a remainder of clinging the state of nonreturn
If weak men only knew themselves
The hero verily slumbers in many a one
From your letter I hear the cry for deliverance
Deliverance is born of knowledge For attaining to that liberating knowledge I can from my own experience only give the advice to you who are otherwise fairly well prepared to imbibe for a period of years the spirit of the Discourses of the Buddha and to set to work accordingly
There will then be no need for you to believe that a system of thought can do justice to the world but you will know it
Buddhism does justice to the world even to such a degree that it leads to the overcoming of it
It is an unspeakably vast task to struggle through and beyond all apparent contradictions and to struggle free from the most subtle fetters
Gotama the Buddha says expressly Profound is this doctrine hard to understand hard to perceive tranquil sublime beyond the realm of logic intelligible only to the wise
You will hardly understand it without patience devotion guidance and effort But there are beings whose eyes are only little covered by dust
Not hearing the truth they will be lost
It is they who will understand the Dhamma For it has been said that there are two conditions of right understanding the voice of others and wise reflection
Furthermore Also in this doctrine and discipline is it possible to show a gradual training practice gradual progress
Gradually one will come to acquire a wise understanding of the teachings proclaimed by the Exalted One and then lofty results will gradually be experienced
You write that the spirit of Buddhism is repugnant to you owing to its rationalistic penetration of the world
I too had formerly that opinion but it disappears with a more exact knowledge about man's composite nature and his way of development as taught by the Master
Meditation rests upon the fact that mind is the forerunner in evolution
In brief what man thinks that he becomes
Meditation in the Buddhist sense includes what we in Christian lands call feeling heart love and so on
What commonly is called feeling or emotion is in fact only a clinging low or noble it is but ties and fetters gross or subtle
For me for instance music was formerly such an important factor that when listening particularly to Beethoven's symphonies I was clearly possessed by them ravished shaken
Even four or five years ago I busied myself with writing music and composition
My judgment of musical performances was generally appreciated
But art is just a means to lead us on to the comprehending of suffering and not only to an emotional experience of it it takes us from the particular to the general
But more subtle devices await us
All of them however are as the entire Teaching meant for letting go not for keeping a hold on them
You say that you have suffered much and yet you think that this world of suffering is a glorious place
But if you progress from the emotional experience of suffering to an understanding of life's general nature as ill then there will come a turning point in your ideas
You will come to reflect deeply upon the fact that the entire existence being something originated is bound up with impermanence
Everything originated is anicca
What ceases is woe is suffering and notself unsubstantial dukkham anatta
Among these three related characteristics of existence the most tangible one dukkha has been taken out fully stated and defined in the First Truth of suffering in the second its cause in the third its cessation and in the fourth the practical path of deliverance
He who has eyes will perceive these things
The better one understands and practices the Eightfold Path the less one will be assailed by suffering
Tanha that headed hydra will gradually die away  beginning with the grossest and ending with the most subtle craving which one notices only later
Then done is what ought to be done Suffering is transcended and thereby the world or life are transcended
Ceased has rebirth lived to its end is the holy life the work is done nothing more beyond this  thus he knows
To him who wishes to inquire further the following texts are recommended for thorough reflection the rd and nd Discourse of the Majjhima Nikaya and further the discourses and it is advisable to think slowly and carefully about causality
Enough for today
Though Buddhism as you say is for you partly still unpalatable yet in the first words of your letter you admit the strict consistency and inner strength of my own way of action
I have understood Buddha's logic and love the shortest way between two points is the straight line
The study of Pali will permit you as much quicker penetration of the teaching since all translations are makeshifts our words are insufficient and often they lead astray
If in addition you will learn by heart the most important Discourses fully or partly then you will have a solid foundation inwardly and with regard to your linguistic studies
 Letter of 
One who has understood the universality of suffering and the importance of the ascetic life for the speediest elimination of that suffering such a one will certainly sympathize with you
According to your valuable and frank confession you have strong sensuality You may know that asceticism or the holy life is mostly called brahmacariyam
It is significant that the same term is used in the third sila of the monk
Having abandoned unchastity he lives a life of chastity he keeps aloof and abstains from that vulgar practice sexual intercourse He keeps aloof that is he observes a prudent distance from women lest he lend a hand to Mara because he is still weak and in the process of growth
For the millions of those who live a worldly life sexual intercourse within the limits indicated in Majjh is not regarded as akusala but for the disciple proper who wishes to bring suffering to an end it is always akusala unwholesome wrong and conducive to suffering
How could he gain a deeper truly penetrating insight as long as that powerful affirmation of life vibrates through his organism and paralyzes his mind
Therefore kammachanda or kamaraga is the first Hindrance Fetter and Defilement and its opposite nekkhamma renunciation is the first help and aid in gaining samma samadhi right concentration which is required for the pure vision of truth
Though the entire realm of kama ie the five sense objects are a hindrance of samadhi yet one has to recognize the sexual sphere as the most portentous in the realm of sensuality
One knows what an enormous amount of energy is expended here
He who is infatuated will be aware of it only faintly but later when fighting and subduing his passion it will become clear to him that he was formerly but a miserable specimen of humanity a slave of Mara he will then appreciate that a mind kept in a violent tremor by strong emotions cannot possibly see reality as it is
The BuddhaDhamma is said to go against the current
The crowd goes along with the current lifeaffirmation lust hatred selfdelusion
The true disciple goes against that stream he negates it because he wishes to transcend the world get rid of it
The turning away of the will vanquishes all woe Our blind fellowbeings however who float along with the current will say But sexual desire is something natural It is that very fact which a perspicuous Buddhist knows and therefore turns away
He who understands that has achieved much
Also he who has strong sensual inclination can live brahmacariya the chaste life
There is one who is by nature lustful yet he preserves his chastity even if passion often makes him feel pain and torment but he is able though with pain and torment to live the noble pure life of chastity  
A disciple who has made himself familiar with the Buddha's instruction is able to fight the passions with quite different weapons than other folk but knowledge without application is dead
How then can a tendency be gradually expelled from one's nature for instance that to sensuality
By displacing eliminating and replacing
You may have observed how thoughts are placed in the sequence of time how they follow each other and how only one thought at one time can be present to consciousness if ever so briefly
Make a start now and take matters into your own hand
Instead of allowing your thoughts to roam about aimlessly in a confused way and impelled by emotions  you should first select a time of the day a short half an hour in which to give to your thoughtprocesses a definite direction by choosing a suitable subject of meditation
By doing so gradually a countertendency is developed because during the minutes of asubhabhavana lust has simply dropped out
If you now return to your routine life the tendency developed during your practice will produce an aftereffect which will grow more and more beneficial in proportion to the intensity and duration of the practice
Gradually with strengthened mindfulness that noble tendency will permeate almost whole thoughtprocess always ready to step in with its beneficial effect whenever Mara wishes to intrude
Most of our fellowbeings believe that they push while they are pushed themselves But the true disciple actually pushes matters himself because he has grasped the law of elimination by disuse and thus he displaces and eliminates so that passions die away until at the end there is nothing more to die away
First a Buddhist should suffuse and saturate himself with the Master's words like those in in the Sutta Nipata the Theragatha Suttas like Majjhima Nikaya No then if he has noble aspirations the powerful sexual urge will be reduced noticeably
According to the Master's injunction after listening there should be thorough reflection about it to be done best at a quiet place
You should contemplate and analyze this body as it is described in Majjhima Nikaya He contemplates this body from the sole of the feet upwards and from the crown of the head downward covered by the skin filled with many impurities He understands it as a putrifying corpse food for worms as a skeleton and as decaying bones My body too is of that nature will become like that and cannot escape it
After such thorough contemplation actual realization will unfailingly follow
If he now sees women he is no longer dominated by the animal urge of carnal desire but he sees through it he sees them as skeletons
Looking ahead he already now perceives the flesh now after death it will be devoured by worms and then his prevailing feeling will be compassion Soon these bodies will perish and will add to the charnel field
May beings awake from their frenzy so that it may no longer be said of them 'Worn out in vain the body dies away' but may their Kamma come gradually to rest
For him who is moved by such compassion will it be possible to use a being for satisfying his lust
Only selfishness will be able to do so even if it hides behind greatest learning
The Master has taught his disciples  of whom none was a eunuch  how to regulate that desire and how to bring it to rest
If you make substantial progress in that respect you will have achieved much
May you remain mindful of the fact that you do it for your own sake for other's sake and for the cause
 Sutta Nipata v

Not many details can be told about your first question
I became aware of the fact I am afflicted by birth oldage and death sunken into sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair submerged by suffering lost in suffering
Oh that it might be possible to make an end of that whole mass of suffering consider evolution in its widest sense
I mean to say Beings understand and follow the teaching of the Blessed One according to the degree of their own development
He who has eyes will see
Let us assume there is an intelligent person a man of understanding He perceives clearly the impermanency of all that is originated and he understands the conclusion what is impermanent that is liable to suffering and it is notself
Through both and he will understand the equation lifesuffering and now awake from his slumber he works with increasing intensity to make an end of suffering and thereby of life
But how
Deliverance results from knowledge That liberating knowledge is
to know suffering
to know the origin of suffering
to know the cessation of suffering
to know the path leading to suffering's cessation
This is the teaching particular to Enlightened Ones This only do I teach now as before suffering and the cessation of suffering Any doubt as to whether that knowledge is actually the only one needful to us now will disappear if one reflects carefully on the rd Discourse of Majjhima Nikaya
From experience I may give the assurance that man will grow in his detachment and that suffering will touch him less and less the more mindfully and energetically he walks the path
Tanha the direct cause of suffering is gradually brought to extinction
First its gross form dies away and later the more subtle one that is imperceptible at the start
Though as a rule only the genuine bhikkhu will be able to walk the path perfectly yet the opinion which one sometimes finds expressed that only the bhikkhu can do it at all is erroneous
Everyone who leads the home life  more especially if living alone  can tread the Path and progress on it very far according to the nature of his actions Everyone who has become a bhikkhu with the clear awareness of what he is doing has once lived the worldly life before but has prepared himself before he chose to lead the ascetic life that is so beneficial
Gotama Buddha in the rd Discourse addressed to the citizens of Sala has given very valuable instructions for right conduct in thoughts words and deeds
Adherence to that conduct will to the degree of one's success in doing so contribute considerably to the overcoming of suffering
Without having fully understood the importance of a virtuous life for purification and for mental concentration it will be premature if the disciple desires to attain the meditative absorptions
If you consider very carefully the following you will see clearly in that matter
We find in the texts the following threefold division of the Path
Usually the factors numbered and are mentioned first because the Path cannot be trodden without a degree of Right Understanding and Right Thought
In their perfected form however they constitute pañña the highest wisdom
Virtue comes first
Then follows Concentration comprising the th th and th factor of the Path Among them Right Effort consists of the Four Endeavors and these four are also called implements of concentration The four Foundations of Mindfulness which according to Discourse form the seventh Path factor are the objects of concentration and Concentration proper the th factor is explained by the four meditative absorptions
In other words firstly strong energy has to be developed and untiringly one should work that is meditate in accordance with the four Foundations of Mindfulness for providing the inner training required for the entry into the First Absorption
How then can such mighty energy be developed
If he sees with his eyes a visible object he does not take up its general features nor its details
Because lust and grief unwholesome and evil thoughts may overwhelm him who dwells with his sense of sight unrestrained he practices that restraint guards his sense of sight and watches over it The same holds good for the other four physical senses and mind as the sixth
Through the six senses we communicate with the outer world
From this is seen the immense importance of controlling that apparatus for the specific purpose of gaining mental concentration and for the general purpose of eliminating suffering
He who does not know and understand according to reality the eye visual objects visual consciousness visual impression the feelings produced by visual impression  he will be delighted in the eye being delighted in it and attached to it he will allow himself to be allured by it looking always for the enjoyment provided by it
To him the life process consisting of the five Groups will continue to accumulate and craving that leads to renewed existence finding delight here and there will continue to grow But he who knows and understands according to reality the eye will not be delighted in the eye seeing always the danger in it
To him the five Groups will decrease and craving will vanish
The concentration of one who has achieved that is Right Concentration
He who sees the Dependent Origination sees the Dhamma he who sees the Dhamma sees the Dependent Origination
This spiritual struggle will lead to victory chiefly through constant mindfulness and thought concerning the fact of origination in other words impermanence
For instance Now this unpleasant feeling has arisen in me produced by auditory impression and it is conditioned not unconditioned
Conditioned by what
By sense impression
And he knows impression is impermanent he knows feeling is impermanent Then his mind thus discerning the elements becomes gladdened serene strong and steady
So far about Energy or Right Effort being the implement by which to attain concentration
Information about the Four Foundations of Mindfulness will be found in Majjh
Then while he thus dwells earnest ardent and mindful the memories bound up with home life will vanish in him
I have experienced myself how important it is to meditate upon the four Foundations of Mindfulness
I have learned that Discourse by heart in Pali and daily I repeat one seventh part of it in my meditation every week has brought new revelations
But one must work for it
He who does not work cannot follow the truth It is not possible thus I teach to obtain assurance at once at the start but gradually fighting progressing step by step one will obtain assurance And because he makes determined effort he realizes for himself the highest truth and visualizes it by wise penetration He who attends to the preparatory work as indicated will avoid the illusions of wrong concentration and will steer straight towards Right Concentration because cultivation of samadhi means the cultivation of and the training in just these things ie Energy and Mindfulness
The fact that also householders can practice mindfulness is mentioned in Discourse We too O lord being householders have from time to time established our mind in the four Foundations of Mindfulness and we dwell O Lord contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending mindful having overcome covetousness and grief regarding the world
If you now read a Discourse like the th where the Master gives a connected summary you will have confirmation of that sequence of practice mentioned above first sila then the control of the senses and mindfulness
Also the five Hindrances which have to be overcome before one can enter the first Absorption are found in the th Discourse at the beginning of the fourth Foundation of Mindfulness
How difficult it is generally to gain the Absorptions is shown by the Buddha's statements in the th Discourse there profoundly and step by step the hindrances and their overcoming are shown But the difficulties mentioned there will not deter an earnest disciple
He knows that evolution does not proceed at a bound but that by an indefatigable application of the appropriate means progress undreamt of may be achieved in a short time However the fact cannot be concealed Profound is this teaching difficult to grasp you will hardly understand it without patience devotion effort and guidance and there are fools who study the teaching but though they have studied it they do not wisely examine the meaning of the teachings without wisely examining the teachings their contemplation will not yield satisfaction they do not grasp the purpose for which they have studied the teaching
To them their wrong grasp of the teaching will bring them harm and suffering for a long time
Yet it has been said that the teaching is intelligible to every person of understanding and that it grows in clarity for the earnest disciple
There are no ascetics who know and understand everything at once
That is impossible It is by training by indefatigable training that everything is nursed to maturity
What a monk considers and reflects upon for a long time to that his mind will incline
If once the fundamental truths have been thoroughly grasped and experienced and through a faithful devotion to the inner work the gradual perception of a great result has appeared then from such a soil a beneficial and powerful saddha concerning the future work will grow
This is the first of the five qualities of spiritual striving by the help of which the disciple may achieve his aim quickly
I am filled with an unshakable Saddha
A confidence rooted in understanding and experience surmounts difficulties met by one who is given to speculative thinking a hairsplitter or a petty critic
Though the way of expression may sometimes be difficult or strange and though in some instances the teachings given there may remain unintelligible for some time let us have Saddha
Enlightened Ones do not speak imperfectly Work Work as we have stressed above  that is the key word
Then the Dhamma will be realized experienced and no longer requires proof or guidance not even by a Buddha
In the Liberated One is the knowledge of Liberation Equal to me will be those victorious ones who have destroyed craving
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammasabuddhassa
Dear Mr
N
If you attach great significance to Mindfulness of Breathing you have perceived an important fact
As the four Foundations of Mindfulness may be called the heart of the doctrine so is Mindfulness of Breathing if rightly understood the heart of the heart
Mindfulness of Breathing if developed well and regularly practiced brings to perfection the four Foundations of Mindfulness thus it is said in the th Discourse
He who knows these means of deliverance and applies them will experience by himself that restlessness desire anger misapprehensions and thereby all deep sorrows will vanish and will reappear only and always when that mindfulness is absent
While our other fellowbeings millions of them  go on living without any substantial gain in liberation he who knows the laws of deliverance can purposefully take into his hands the work of their unfolding he can loosen and finally break the chains of slavery
First of all three things are required here
persistence
persistence
persistence
Without great devotion without extraordinary patience even one who is otherwise gifted will not be able to make progress
It is important that the beginner betakes himself to a quiet place as secluded as possible so that the habitual tanha  nourishment for the five senses  is reduced and the numerous sounds voices and noises which particularly at the beginning hinder so much any deeper concentration do not constantly interfere
You will not have missed the fact that it is expressly stated in the Discourses and that the disciple should resort to the forest an empty room etc
Thus whenever bonds of profession or family do not fetter you you should make haste to go out of your town like one who seeks hidden treasure and should choose a suitable spot in forest environment
Then you should sit down there in a posture that allows you the longest time of sitting immovably
Mindfully he breathes in mindfully he breathes out  that is the general practice of Anapanasati introducing the subsequent specific exercises and forming the transition from ordinary confused thinking to concentrated meditation focused upon a definite mental object
The former kind of thinking ordinary reflection is called vitakka ie discursive thinking By Mindfulness of Breathing that discursive thinking is suspended and silenced
Anapanasati bhavetabba vitakk'upacchedaya Mindfulness of Breathing ought to be practiced for cutting off discursive thinking How is it to be done
Breathing in long he knows 'I breathe in long' breathing out long he knows 'I breathe out long' Breathing in short he knows I breathe in short breathing out short he knows I breathe out short Now at one and the same time only one single thought can be clearly present to consciousness thoughts follow each other they are placed in time
All exclusion of evil thoughts effected by meditation rests upon that fact is made possible by that fact
He who thinks for one minute a thought of kindness has at that time no thought of hate in his mind he who thinks of a corpse for one minute has no lust while doing so he who contemplates impermanence for one minute will not have conceit
Whenever and as long as one knows I breathe in and out long or short for that time even if it is only for a fraction of a second other vitakka will be excluded
You will however experience that when you resolve to be strictly watchful the first breaths that follow will go in and out a clear awareness of them but after that habitual worldly thoughts will appear again during a single breath
But if one considers that the complete tranquilization and exclusion of discursive thoughts is tantamount to the entry into the Second Absorption one will in spite of all relapses persist in one's practice week by week month by month year by year and during a single session the meditator will apply mindfulness times or times or more
Gradually the law of development by use will show itself it works as reliably as the law of elimination by disuse
In one minute one may breathe times
If one is conscious of it even if only at the beginning one will have given a definite direction to one's mind times in minutes
If for about minutes no breath has been missed it is certainly an achievement though to a beginner some fatigue may be noticeable
The simile of the turner given in the th Discourse shows clearly how simply that exercise is meant
Generally spoken it is the most simple that is truly great and profound
From the foregoing it will become clear how important that simple and easily intelligible exercise is
If patiently sustained it is bound to result in the calmness and concentration of mind aspired by you
The Master teaches how to bind a second postulate a Must  mindfulness  to breathing which is the constant companion of man from birth to death
The first Must is faithful man must breathe constantly
The second Must has to be developed from it
In other words breathing cannot wait if it is not to escape unnoticed mindfulness must be present and alert
For one of confused mindfulness I say there is no Mindfulness of Breathing
There are people endowed with outstanding gifts
As soon as they know the method they will practice with zeal and determination
Perhaps you too will even after a short time attain genuine Absorption of mind will easily leave behind the Sensuous Sphere and realize one or more stages of meditation
Through those two exercises that degree of Samatha can be achieved only if the five Hindrances are removed the presence of which is incompatible with Absorption
But even if for a long time the meditator cannot attain to the absorptions other gratifying results of Anapanasati will become evident
Firstly the calm and concentration of mind as effected by meditative training in solitude can now be maintained for increasingly longer periods of time
Calm and concentration will gradually enter into the meditator's innermost being and will also manifest themselves outwardly in his daily behavior by a calmer and more composed way of speaking and by calmer bodily movements in going turning looking bending and stretching of limbs
Secondly what is incomparably more important there will be a keener insight into the nature of the world that is of the five Khandhas as impermanent liable to suffering and notself
A man with keen eye sight will excel in observation
Similarly greater tranquillity means deeper insight and again strengthened insight into suffering will be an incentive to achieve a greater power of concentration as a means to the end
It is a reciprocal process No meditative absorption without wisdom and no wisdom without absorption
Therefore after having practiced for some time the exercises No
and one may go over to No contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in and out
In doing so one should keep in mind that what is spoken of here are phenomena objects of thought pertaining to the fourth Foundation of Mindfulness
The four Satipatthanas may be regarded as stages at the first stage one learns to contemplate on the gross material body as it appears to simple observation
in the second Satipatthana the feelings likewise in their simple presentation
in the third an essential change should follow the knowledge gradually prepared and matured by the first three Satipatthanas that the entire world of plurality is only an object for each subject a manifestation of thought hanging only on a single thread consciousness
Then the passage in Majjh
 Thus is corporeality thus its end etc
 will appear in a different light because the proper light has dawned upon the meditator
Thus is corporeality appearances phenomena arising in consciousness with help of the likewise conditioned visual organ the auditory disappears again as a subjective process appearance anicca anatta
It is similar with the other Khandhas Thus is feeling thus is its origin thus its end Here one can learn to understand the whole of existence as an illusion as notself and the Egodelusion will dissolve quickly
This is so because all wishing longing hating disliking fearing grieving or being excited in brief all mental afflictions stem from the Attaidea If that delusion loses its hold a decisive change takes place a detachment a feeling of liberation as never experienced before
The person is now seen as a temporary combination of ever changing Khandhas and after sometime this person will disappear from the scene it has never harbored an eternal self
The idea of Anatta may get strengthened in us in a way somewhat like that
By such a contemplation one will become selfless allloving truly detached
and the word in Majjh
will become clear He lives independent and does not cling to anything in the world
By the power of thinking sharpened and made lucid by the exercises and of the facts of impermanence and notself will be visualized more strongly
Therefore I have given here that indication because it is insight that lastly leads to deliverance
Concentration is only the clarification of mind which however is indispensable just as in spectacles the glasses are the essential thing but one can look through them only after removing from them the dirt or moisture
I have mentioned today only the exercises No and
As you know talking is here of little avail doing practicing is all that matters
After some time you may communicate your experiences and if required ask for further information
You are quite right in saying that without explanation one cannot do much with the brief instructions particularly if the translation is unsatisfactory
But in the Canon you will find further elucidations about the single points
Dear Friend
A few words about givingup
It is better not to have cigars about oneself on principle
Similarly he who wishes to wean himself from alcohol will not carry a bottle with him
He who wants to give up desire for women will better not go to places where he will have to face temptation
To be sure of one's steps is important particularly at a stage of transition
Mara is on the lookout for any possible opening therefore he must not be given any chance
Once is not never He who has no cigars about himself cannot smoke
No fire can flare up without fuel for the present at least indulgence has been made impossible
Gradually the law of elimination by disuse will come into effect
The need and desire for the former enjoyment will weaken and finally cease
If someone says that he has got over smoking etc but he carries cigars about him for the sake of a test then he has not yet fully abandoned tanha
He who has entirely abolished that craving will no longer cherish such thoughts in that respect he is fully at peace and already thinks further ahead
Thus a disciple who has freed himself from sexual urge will though immune not seek temptations
More important things have to be done
No rest before Nibbana
Besides if he refrains from testing his power of resistance this will be more profitable to others in his environment who cannot see into his heart but observe only his external behavior and quite reasonably their confidence might be shaken by their observations though they may not talk about it
Doubtlessly the struggle against Mara is hard because for Mara it is actually a question of to be or not to be a fight of life or death for his kingdom of nature For long long times we have been his serfs
Now this serfdom is over for us
Nevermore shall we find lasting satisfaction anywhere in this Samsara
One who has taken the Buddha as his guide and master will understand the nature of Mara's Realm so poignantly that he can no longer find full satisfaction in the Realm of Nature where everything is impermanent
By seeing the misery of it we are on the road of escape from it
What now is the principal task for us who already possess a good deal of right understanding who at least have a knowledge of the doctrine and observe virtue
To watch watch watch
To be constantly on guard
In particular to try to remain mindful
Samadhi is the Buddhist practice proper
At the start of the practice the mind is not collected at all the capacity of concentration is weak
But as the Master explained by training by unceasing training the little child first constantly falling learns to toddle about till finally as a grownup man he can walk steadily and continuously for long stretches
If a man possessed of intelligence falls he has not been watchful was absentminded
Lax mindfulness produces new taints and strengthens the old ones unflinching mindfulness gives no room for new taints and destroys the old ones For instance one has seen innumerable times that all formations are impermanent one has also agreed with the Buddha's words Whatever corporeality exists one's own or of others beautiful or ugly all corporeality should with proper understanding be regarded as it truly is 'It is not mine' thus it will be abandoned will be rejected Very often the misery of corporeality has been felt most pungently and the misery of craving has been understood yet this or that object will still titillate our senses whenever watchfulness is lacking
But if one remains mindful and turns at once to an analysis of the perception one will not be enticed by any material from
One will see that the material form has been made up into an evanescent structure of this or another kind by the karmic formations which are impermanent in themselves one will see that material form is put together in a similar way as a potter shapes pots
Then his mind dissecting thus the elements will become joyful gladdened strong and steady
It is doubtlessly a hard way but gloriously safe
Truly in that manner one can perceptibly detach oneself from the world
Fritz Stange student of natural sciences  thus my late friend then a newly registered freshman was introduced to the academical association to which I belonged
A handsome young man with smooth blond hair and an elegant mustache with deeply blue and strikingly large eyes a gentle voice and a mild glance thus he stood before us
He was a gentle person and a keen student who in lonely hours used to comfort his soul by playing the violin he was an ardent admirer of Richard Wagner and if possible he did not miss a single performance of Wagner's operas
If anyone had said that a person like he would ever become a Buddhist ascetic he would have provoked general laughter
We liked each other from the beginning
Strange became my personal freshman
My other freshman was a great artist in the field of music and has now become an excellent though little known Sanskritist and Vedantist
The three of us united by bonds of closest friendship soon met regularly at the sessions of the Theosophical Society which everywhere has prepared the way for the Buddhist movement
Following the wish of his father Stange had to give up his studies so dear to him and donned the uniform of an official of the Postal Department
For none of us had the student life any special attraction and Stange himself saw in it only the karmic way by which we came together
As an official Stange remained a keen Theosophist lived as a vegetarian and plunged deeply into the study of those teachings which then we called Buddhism
Besides he was unusually capable in his profession and personally he was the favorite of all who knew him
When he was a probationer for the higher postal career at Kassel he began to study the Discourses of the Buddha in Neumann's translation under the guidance of a friend who was an ardent Buddhist and soon the resolution matured in him to seek deliverance from the grievous suffering that pervades the life of all beings
He had fully grasped the Truth of Suffering
But knowledge alone was not sufficient for his fervent pure and profound heart
Thus he left as a true follower of the Blessed One his home his property and his relations in order to enter the Sangha in distant Asia
Why does one go to the countries of Buddhism he wrote to me once
Briefly spoken because there and particularly in Burma all conditions are cut out for a life in the Sangha
One is relieved of all worldly cares for eating drinking clothing lodging etc in contrast to Europe one can live there the holy life first externally
How one detaches oneself inwardly is everyone's most personal affair Thus he came to Ceylon
The reception he wrote was so friendly the helpful response so strikingly unexpected that already a fortnight after my arrival in Ceylon I followed an invitation of the Bhikkhu Jinavaravamsa to stay at Chulla Lanka
There I have spent the holiest time of my life in meditation study of Pali and conversation about the teaching But this body 'that sickly thing' did not stand it On medical advice Stange decided to return to Europe to cure his lung disease
In summer he lived first at Wingendorf near Lauban afterwards following the invitation of a friendly physician with Buddhist leanings at Birkfield in Syria
On the th of October the ship took him out again hardly recovered
This time he went soon to the healthy up country of Ceylon to Bandarawela
Until his complete recuperation he took as preliminary step towards the Sangha the white dress of an Upasaka but soon he donned again the yellow robe of a Samanera
His intention was to return later to Europe together with Nyanatiloka for establishing the Sangha there
The time will come he wrote in his letter of   when a Sangha will be established in Germany by thoroughly trained Bhikkhus and thereby a firm basis will be formed for the dissemination of the Teaching that brings such unspeakable bliss
 Theragatha
How earnest he was in his determination is confirmed by the following words of his
And even if I had not met a single good Bhikkhu this would not have disconcerted me Rare are Enlightened Ones Small is the number of those who are not gripped by them These words of the Enlightened One are of general validity
A perceptive disciple will see in that fact an admonition to make all the quicker an end of suffering
So strongly have I become aware of the truth of this
Teaching and of its profundity that on the one hand to swerve from that path to another one has become an impossibility and on the other hand even my walking alone on that path would be done without hesitation or surprise
Now his striving within this present impermanent existence has come to an end
Just as his going forth from home was similar to that of his Lord and Master Gotama so it was the same illness dysentery which had dissolved the body of the Perfect one that also took away the dear heroic Samanera Sumano
Death is indeed the lot of everything born and originated
When Sumano started on his way to Homelessness he pointed out to his relatives the justification of that step in a beautifully lucid tract quoting in it especially sayings of Jesus of Nazareth
To the public he gave the work published a few weeks ago Pabbajja Going Forth into Homelessness Only by absorbing its contents fully we shall be able to measure the singleminded pure noble and yet firmly rooted work for deliverance done by our friend who is now free from the world of appearance
What I have to say about Sumano's death is the following In autumn last year Bhikkhu Nyanatiloka the Burmese monk Silavamsa and myself made a walking tour for a week through the South West of Ceylon via Adam's Peak and came also to Bandarawela
First the three of us went to the small mudhut hardly X meters in size where Sumano had lived and died
The hut is situated in a very lonely place outside of the village in the midst of bare grassy hillocks so that no sound can be heard from the village and no human habitation can be seen right around
It is desolate and lonely there as rarely anywhere else
The second hut which when Sumano died was inhabited by Suñño had already fallen into decay and the rain had washed away nearly every vestige of it
Afterwards we wanted also to go to the site of the cremation but we missed the place
Hence I went without Nyanatiloka once more there together with the Thera of the Bandarawela Monastery and I found there besides some pieces of molten glass a few small unburned splinters of bone
I picked them up and handed them over to Nyanatiloka who still keeps them at Dodanduwa as a token
The site of the cremation is on the top of one of those grassy hillocks about minutes distance from the hut
Boys planted a Bodhi tree at that spot
A great gathering is said to have been present at the cremation amongst them hundreds of Christians and Mohammedans who secretly respected the ascetic way of life led by Sumano After the cremation the ashes were distributed among the lay people and many a Christian Mohammedan and Hindu took them as gladly as a Buddhist The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
This discourse of the Buddha  the seventh in the Collection of Middle Length Texts  deals first with a set of sixteen defilements of the human mind and in its second part with the disciple's progress to the highest goal of Arahatship which can be achieved if  and only if  these impurities are gradually reduced and finally eliminated
While there are also defilements of insight which must be removed for the attainment of the goal the sixteen defilements dealt with here are all of an ethical nature and are concerned with man's social behavior
Only the last of these sixteen negligence may also refer to purely personal concerns as well as to one's relations with others
A glance through the list will show that all these sixteen defilements derive from greediness and selfishness from aversion selfassertion and conceit or their combinations
If we take for instance contempt being a weaker nuance of denigration we see that aversion and conceit contribute to it envy is fed by greediness and aversion
The pairs of contributive factors here exemplified do not of course occur at the same moment of consciousness but their repeated separate presence favors the arising of such derivatives as contempt and envy
On the other hand if those secondary defilements such as contempt and envy appear frequently they will bring about a close serial association of their feeders as for instance hate motivated by conceit or hate motivated by greed and these may easily become habitual sequences automatic chain reactions in our impulsive life
Interlocked in such a manner the negative forces in our mind  the defilements roots of evil and fetters  will become more powerful and much more difficult to dislodge
They will form closed systems hard to penetrate covering ever larger areas of our mind
What may first have been isolated occurrences of unwholesome thoughts and acts will grow into hardened traits of character productive of an unhappy destiny in future lives
And in all these grave consequences the secondary or derivative defilements have a great share
Hence it is of vital importance that we do not fall victim to the last in the list of those defilements  negligence  and are not negligent in watchfulness and selfcontrol
Out of regard for your own good it is proper to strive with heedfulness out of regard for others' good it is proper to strive with heedfulness out of regard for your own and others' good it is proper to strive with heedfulness
 Nidana Samy
No

As to others' good how much more pleasant and harmonious will be human relations individual and communal if there is less pettiness and peevishness fewer vanities and jealousies and less selfassertiveness in words and deeds
As already remarked if these minor blemishes are reduced the larger and more serious defilements will have fewer opportunities
How often do deadly conflicts and deep involvement in guilt arise from petty but unresolved resentments
The composition of our list of defilements alone makes it clear that the Buddha was well aware of the social impact of these impurities and the structure of the discourse shows that he regarded the removal of these defilements as an integral part of the mental training aiming at deliverance
Hence we may summarise this part of the discourse by saying that our social conduct strongly affects the chances of our spiritual progress
The nature of that influence is illustrated by the simile of the cloth
If the texture of our mind is tarnished by blemishes in our social behavior the new coloring of higher mentality and higher wisdom cannot penetrate
The stains that soil the single strands of thought will show through the superficial coloring and besides the impure matter will reduce the porosity of the tissue ie the receptivity of our mind and thus prevent full absorption of any results gained in meditation or understanding
Through the accumulating waste products of uninhibited defilements a mental atmosphere is created that resists any depth penetration of spiritual forces and values
First in accordance with the method of Satipatthana right mindfulness the presence of the defilements in one's behavior has to be clearly noticed and honestly acknowledged without attempts at evasion at minimizing or selfjustification for instance by giving them more respectable names
This is what is implied in the words of the discourse Knowing to be a defilement of the mind  Such knowledge by itself may often discourage the recurrence of the defilements or weaken the strength of their manifestations
According to the Buddhist Teachers of Old this knowledge should be extended to the nature of the defilements the causes and circumstances of their arising their cessation and the means of effecting their cessation
This is an example of how to apply to an actual situation the formula of the Four Noble Truths as embodied in the contemplation of mindobjects of the Satipatthana Sutta
Another example is the application of the four truths to higher states of mind the Divine Abidings for the purpose of developing insight
When the Noble Disciple on attaining to one of the higher paths sees himself freed from the defilements deep joy will arise in him enthusiasm for the goal and the way and an unshakable confidence in the Triple Gem
So says our text
But a foretaste of all these fruits and blessings can already be gained by him who has succeeded in noticeably weakening and reducing the defilements
Such enthusiasm and strengthened confidence being derived from his personal experience will be of great value to him adding wings to his further progress
To the extent of his experience he will have verified for himself the virtues of the Dhamma
Well proclaimed by the Blessed One is the Dhamma realisable here and now possessed of immediate result bidding you come and see accessible and knowable individually by the wise

Thus have I heard
Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks thus Monks  Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Monks suppose a cloth were stained and dirty and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye badly and be impure in color
And why is that
Because the cloth was not clean
So too monks when the mind is defiled an unhappy destination may be expected
Monks suppose a cloth were clean and bright and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye well and be pure in color
And why is that
Because the cloth was clean
So too monks when the mind is undefiled a happy destination may be expected
And what monks are the defilements of the mind
Covetousness and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind ill will is a defilement of the mind anger is a defilement of the mind hostility denigration domineering envy jealousy hypocrisy fraud obstinacy presumption conceit arrogance vanity negligence is a defilement of the mind
Knowing monks covetousness and unrighteous greed to be a defilement of the mind the monk abandons them
Knowing ill will to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing anger to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing hostility to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing denigration to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing domineering to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing envy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing jealousy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing hypocrisy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing fraud to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing obstinacy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing presumption to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing conceit to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing arrogance to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing vanity to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing negligence to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
When in the monk who thus knows that covetousness and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind this covetousness and unrighteous greed have been abandoned when in him who thus knows that ill will is a defilement of the mind this ill will has been abandoned when in him who thus knows that negligence is a defilement of the mind this negligence has been abandoned  
 he thereupon gains unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus 'Thus indeed is the Blessed One he is accomplished fully enlightened endowed with vision and conduct sublime knower of the worlds the incomparable guide of men who are tractable the teacher of gods and men enlightened and blessed'
 he gains unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus 'Well proclaimed by the Blessed One is the Dhamma realizable here and now possessed of immediate result bidding you come and see accessible and knowable individually by the wise
 he gains unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the good way has entered on the straight way has entered on the true way has entered on the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight types of persons this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the incomparable field of merit for the world'
When he has given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished in part he knows 'I am endowed with unwavering confidence in the Buddha in the Dhamma in the Sangha and he gains enthusiasm for the goal gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
When he is gladdened joy is born in him being joyous in mind his body becomes tranquil his body being tranquil he feels happiness and the mind of him who is happy becomes concentrated
He knows 'I have given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished in part' and he gains enthusiasm for the goal gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
When he is gladdened joy is born in him being joyous in mind his body becomes tranquil when his body is tranquil he feels happiness and the mind of him who is happy becomes concentrated
If monks a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hillrice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for him
Just as cloth that is stained and dirty becomes clean and bright with the help of pure water or just as gold becomes clean and bright with the help of a furnace so too if a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hillrice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for him
He abides having suffused with a mind of lovingkindness one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides suffusing the entire universe with lovingkindness with a mind grown great lofty boundless and free from enmity and ill will
He abides having suffused with a mind of compassion of sympathetic joy of equanimity one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides suffusing the entire universe with equanimity with a mind grown great lofty boundless and free from enmity and ill will
He understands what exists what is low what is excellent and what escape there is from this field of perception
When he knows and sees in this way his mind becomes liberated from the canker of sensual desire liberated from the canker of becoming liberated from the canker of ignorance
When liberated there is knowledge 'It is liberated' and he knows 'Birth is exhausted the life of purity has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to come' Such a monk is called 'one bathed with the inner bathing
Now at that time the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja was seated not far from the Blessed One and he spoke to the Blessed One thus But does Master Gotama go to the Bahuka River to bathe
What good brahman is the Bahuka River
What can the Bahuka River do
Truly Master Gotama many people believe that the Bahuka River gives purification many people believe that the Bahuka River gives merit
For in the Bahuka River many people wash away the evil deeds they have done
Then the Blessed One addressed the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja in these stanzas
When this was said the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja spoke thus
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were righting the overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
May I receive the going forth under Master Gotama may I receive the full admission
And the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission
And not long after his full admission dwelling alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Bharadvaja by his own realization understood and attained in this very life that supreme goal of the pure life for which men of good family go forth from home life into homelessness
And he had direct knowledge thus Birth is exhausted the pure life has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to come
And the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the Arahats
The defilements to appear frequently as a group in the discourses eg in Majjh while in Majjh
No
is omitted
A list of seventeen defilements appears regularly in each last discourse of Books to of the Anguttara Nikaya which carry the title Ragapeyyala the Repetitive Text on Greed
In these texts of the Anguttara Nikaya the first two defilements in the above list are called greed and hate to which delusion is added all the fourteen other defilements are identical with the above list
Knowing
SubComy Having known it either through the incipient wisdom or through the wisdom of the two lower paths
He knows the defilements as to their nature cause cessation and means of effecting cessation This application of the formula of the Four Noble Truths to the defilements deserves close attention
Abandons them
Comy He abandons the respective defilement through the noble path where there is 'abandoning by eradication' which according to SubComy
is the final abandoning
Before the attainment of the noble paths all abandoning of defilements is of a temporary nature
See Nyanatiloka Thera Buddhist Dictionary sv
pahana
According to the Comy the sixteen defilements are finally abandoned by the noble paths in the following order
If in the last group of terms covetousness is taken in a restricted sense as referring only to the craving for the five sense objects it is finally abandoned by the path of nonreturning and this is according to Comy
the meaning intended here
All greed however including the hankering after fine material and immaterial existence is eradicated only on the path of Arahatship hence the classification under the latter in the list above
Comy
repeatedly stresses that wherever in our text abandoning is mentioned reference is to the nonreturner for also in the case of defilements overcome on streamentry the states of mind which produce those defilements are eliminated only by the path of nonreturning
The disciple's direct experience of being freed of this or that defilement becomes for him a living test of his former still imperfectly proven trust in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Now this trust has become a firm conviction an unshakable confidence based on experience
Bhikkhu anamoli translates this paragraph thus And whatever has according to the limitation been given up has been dropped let go abandoned relinquished

In the Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka we read in the chapter Jhanavibhanga He is a bhikkhu because he has abandoned defilements limitedly or because he has abandoned defilements without limitation
Comy When reviewing  the abandonment of the defilements and his unwavering confidence strong joy arises in the nonreturner in the thought 'Such and such defilements are now abandoned by me' It is like the joy of a king who learns that a rebellion in the frontier region has been quelled
Enthusiasm
According to Comy the word veda occurs in the Pali texts with three connotations
scripture
joy
knowledge
Here it signifies joy and the knowledge connected with that joy
Attha and dhamma are a frequently occurring pair of terms obviously intended to supplement each other
Often they mean letter and spirit of the doctrine but this hardly fits here
These two terms occur also among the four kinds of analytic knowledge
Atthapatisambhida is explained as the discriminative knowledge of the result of a cause while dhammapatisambhida is concerned with the cause or condition
The Comy
applies now the same interpretation to our present textual passage saying Atthaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews his unwavering confidence dhammaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews 'the abandonment of the defilement in part' which is the cause of that unwavering confidence Hence the two terms refer to the joy that has as its object the unwavering confidence in the Buddha and so forth and the joy inherent in the knowledge
Our rendering of attha b goal is supported by Comy The unwavering confidence is called attha because it has to be reached ie to be approached in the sense of a limited goal or resultant blessing
Cf
Ang tasmim dhamme atthapatisamvedi ca hoti dhammapatisamvedi ca tassa atthapatisamvedino dhammapatisamvedino pamojjam jayati This text continues as our present discourse does with the arising of joy from gladness
Attha and dhamma refer here to the meaning and text of the Buddha word
 
Comy Having shown the nonreturner's meditation on the Divine Abidings the Blessed One now shows his practice of insight aiming at Arahatship and he indicates his attainment of it by the words 'He understands what exists' etc
This nonreturner having arisen from the meditation on any of the four Divine Abidings defines as 'mind' those very states of the Divine Abidings and the mental factors associated with them
He then defines as 'matter' the heart base being the physical support and the four elements which on their part are the support of the heart base
In that way he defines as 'matter' the elements and corporeal phenomena derived from them
When defining 'mind and matter' in this manner 'he understands what exists'
Hereby a definition of the truth of suffering has been given
Then in comprehending the origin of that suffering he understands 'what is low' Thereby the truth of the origin of suffering has been defined
Further by investigating the means of giving it up he understands 'what is excellent
Hereby the truth of the path has been defined

The Buddha's Discourse on Effacement is the eighth of the Collection of Middle Length Texts
Its subject matter is closely connected with that of preceding text The Simile of the Cloth these two discourses supplement each other in several ways
The Simile of the Cloth speaks of sixteen defilements of social conduct as impeding the progress on higher stages of the path to deliverance
The present Discourse on Effacement widens the range to fortyfour detrimental qualities of mind which must be effaced
These include thirteen of the sixteen defilements in M but they go beyond the realm of social ethics extending also to the hindrances the path factors etc and special attention is given to the effacement of wrong views
This discourse supplements M
also by dealing with the practical methods of effacement from the very beginning with thoughtarising on to avoidance etc and these methods apply as well to the purification from the sixteen defilements given in M
On the other hand the th discourse gives more details about the higher stages of progress that follow after the initial and partial purification
Effacement means the radical removal of detrimental qualities of mind
The fortyfour Modes of Effacement are enumerated in this discourse no less than five times and the first formulation is very significant Others will be harmful we shall not be harmful here and so forth through all the other items
This bespeaks of the Buddha's realistic outlook as befitting a world that cannot be improved by mere wishing nor by preaching at it
 There is no use nor hope in waiting for our neighbour to change his ways
Cleanup campaigns should start at our own door and then the neighbours may well be more responsive to our own example than to our preaching
Besides if the aim is the radical effacement of mental defilements we cannot afford to waste time and be deviated from our task by sidelong glances at the behavior of others
Here lurks in addition the danger of pride
Hence the Sutta Nipata warns that though possessing many a virtue one should not compare oneself with others by deeming oneself better or equal or inferior It is a virtue that squints that will deprive the progress on the path of the element of selfforgetting joyous spontaneity
There is yet another reason for the injunction not to look to others' behavior or misbehavior and this applies particularly to the defilements of social conduct mentioned in the Simile of the Cloth
It is quite human to feel disappointed if one's selflessness kindliness modesty and so on do not find much response in the behavior of others
Such disappointment may well discourage a person not only from continuing to live according to his moral standard but also from advancing further on the road to selflessness towards higher states of mental development
Such a person after an initial disappointment may easily be led to retire into the role of the disgruntled moralist as a respectable cloak for an egocentric life
Here we meet the limitations and risks of a morality solely motivated by the social response to it
To avoid such a blind alley on one's road of progress it is important to make from the very beginning that declaration of moral independence which we may summarize thus Others may act speak and think wrongly but we shall act speak and think rightly  thus effacement can be done
But the Buddha as a knower of the human heart was well aware that such a single or even repeated resolve will not always be strong enough to stir people into action
Hence as an encouragement to those who may feel disheartened by their failures he speaks now of the importance of the arising of thoughts aiming at carrying out those acts of effacement
But again these thoughts will not be effective unless they are regularly and systematically cultivated and are not allowed to lapse into oblivion
Then gradually they will be absorbed by our mind and heart and we shall fully identify ourselves with those values
In that way these thoughts and aspirations will grow stronger and will be able to overcome the resistance of inertia and antagonistic forces from within and without
The Master said To whatsoever one frequently gives attention and repeatedly reflects on to that the mind will turn
The great German mystic of the Middle Ages Meister Eckhart goes even a step further by saying If you do not have the longing have at least a longing for the longing
Next to cultivating the heart's resolve the first direct step towards effacing the defilements is to know them that is the clear and honest confrontation with them in one's own mind as we pointed out when considering the Simile of the Cloth
This will surely help in preventing their rearising
But for strengthening and extending that effect it is necessary to cultivate also the positive counterparts of those fortyfour negative qualities as taught in the instruction on avoidance
The Buddha's formulation in this section conveys the encouraging word that there actually exists such a road for avoiding or circumventing the wrong path
The Buddha said If it were not possible to give up what is evil I would not tell you to give it up if it were not possible to develop what is good I would not tell you to develop it
In the field of insight this method is called abandoning by the opposite but by extension we may apply this term also to the wider range of our present context
Apart from its highest purpose the cultivation of positive qualities of mind is on any level a road of progress a way that leads upwards It brings results here and now and leads to a favorable and happy rebirth
It will preserve and unfold what is best in us and prevent it from deterioration
Considering the fearful possibilities in man's own nature and in the realms of existence this is no mean benefit of training the mind for the final effacement of defilements even if the results remain modest for a long time
For him who has advanced so far there is now the warning in the text that he should not set himself up as a saviour of others while there is still more to do for him
At this stage the disciple may have effected some partial effacement but still the fires of greed hatred and delusion are not quenched in him or to express it with the other metaphor here used he is still immersed in the mire
Though his chances for freeing himself from that bog of samsara have improved any wrong step or just his negligence and lack of persevering effort may cause a setback
Hence a determined effort should now be made for the final quenching for radical effacement
This warning against an overestimation of one's position links up with the first sections of our text which we have still to consider
They likewise deal with the overrating of one's achievements here in the fields of insight and meditative absorptions
Even initial steps in these fields may result in experiences having such a strong impact on the mind that it is psychologically understandable if they lead to overestimation
This does not necessarily mean overrating oneself through pride but overrating the position of one's achievements on the path of progress
One may believe them to be complete in their field while they are only partial or to be final while they are only temporary suppressions
If confronted with wrong views on self and world one will at first sight be inclined to believe that any trace of them in oneself can be eliminated by intellectual refutation that is by proving to one's own satisfaction that they are untenable
And if one has a firm conviction in the truth of the Dhamma it will be easy to assume that one has discarded wrong views for good
In that overestimation one may even go as far as to believe that one has entirely overcome the first of the ten fetters personalitybelief and hence is on the way to streamentry or has even reached it
But this can never be achieved on the intellectual level alone nor even on the first stages of insightmeditation which in themselves are no mean achievement
Misconceptions of self and world which may be quite instinctive and unphilosophical are deeply anchored in man's nature
They are rooted not only in his intellectual opinions but also in his cravings and in his pride and selfassertion
All these three roots of wrong attitudes identify the alleged self or ego with the five aggregates comprising personalityandenvironment
These wrong attitudes towards self and world may manifest themselves on various levels as casual thoughtarisings as a habitual bias and in words and deeds
Only if the selfidentification with the actual objects of wrong views ie the five aggregates is radically dissolved on the stage of streamentry can it be said that wrong views of self and world have been totally eliminated together with the bias towards them
As also craving and pride are involved in the formation of wrong views efforts for their effacement have to be undertaken also on the level of ethical behavior
Hence the ethical part of the fortyfour Modes of Effacement has validity also for the removal of wrong views
The eight meditative attainments lift the human consciousness to sublime heights of refinement yet in the case of each the Buddha emphatically says that they are not states of effacement as he understands them
They can effect only temporary subsidence of defilements and if unsupported by mature virtue and insight they cannot penetrate deep enough into the recesses of the mind for a radical removal of moral and intellectual defilements
It comes as a kind of anticlimax that after mentioning those sublime meditative attainments the Buddha now speaks of such quite ordinary and earthbound ethical qualities as harmlessness and ascribes to them and not to the meditative absorptions the capacity of leading to effacement
This juxtaposition implies indeed a very strong emphasis on the necessity of a sound ethical foundation for any spiritual progress
Often we find that mystic thought in India and elsewhere evolving a monastic system from wrongly interpreted unificatory meditative experience has either ignored ethics or found it difficult to give it a convincing place and motivation in its system
The exultation of mystic experience also often leads the meditator to a premature feeling of having gone beyond good and evil Such developments illustrate the wisdom of the Buddha in insisting on a sound ethical basis instead of an exclusive reliance on mystic experience
When examining closely the structure of this discourse we find in it a repeated balancing of contrasting attitudes of mind and of complementary qualities required for progress on the path
Just now we have observed that meditative achievements have to be balanced with deeply rooted ethical virtues which will also provide a link between the lone meditator and common humanity With the last of the fortyfour Modes of Effacement the effacing of wrong views is taken up again linking up with the beginning of the discourse and balancing the stress on ethical values in most of the other modes
In the phrasing of that last mode we note the stress laid on the overcoming of opinionatedness and tenacity
This points to the fact that for the initial loosening up and final overcoming of wrong views the following ethical modes are of decisive importance amenability and an increasing freedom from a domineering attitude obstinacy and arrogance
The entire discourse seems to be designed to meet in a very thorough manner two opposite psychological obstacles on the path discouragement in the face of its difficulties and overrating of partial results
The first part of the discourse deals with the latter extreme by stressing the limitations of initial and partial progress
But for meeting any discouragement caused by these warnings the Compassionate Master speaks of the value of seemingly simple ethical virtues and stresses the importance of the heart's earnest resolve as the first step which anyone can take who is serious about treading the path of actual effacement
These features of the discourse without being stated explicitly are inherent in its very structure
They will reveal themselves by a close scrutiny as here attempted and particularly by the actual practice of the teachings concerned
The Buddha appears here as the great Teacher of the Middle Path and the incomparable guide of men's hearts deeply concerned that those who tread the path may avoid the pitfalls of extreme emotional reactions and of onesided emphasis on any single aspect of the threefold totality of training in virtue concentration and insight
As in the preceding discourse the rendering of the present one also has been chiefly based on anamoli Thera's manuscript translation
To a lesser extent use has been made of phrasings by Soma Thera and B
Horner and for some passages the Editor's own version has been included
Thus have I heard
Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then one evening the venerable MahaCunda rose from meditative seclusion and went to the Blessed One
Having paid homage to him he sat down at one side and spoke thus to the Blessed One
Venerable sir there are these various views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines or worlddoctrines
Does the abandoning and discarding of such views come about in a monk who is only at the beginning of his reflections
Cunda as to those several views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines and worlddoctrines if in which these views arise in which they underlie and become active is seen with right wisdom as it actually is thus 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'  then the abandoning of these views their discarding takes place in him
It may be Cunda that some monk detached from senseobjects detached from unsalutary ideas enters into the first absorption that is born of detachment accompanied by thoughtconception and discursive thinking and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that after the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking he gains the inner tranquillity and harmony of the second absorption that is free of thoughtconception and discursive thinking born of concentration and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that after the fading away of rapture the monk dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware and he experiences a happiness in his body of which the Noble Ones say 'Happily lives he who dwells in equanimity and is mindful'  that third absorption he wins and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and abides in the fourth absorption which is beyond pleasure and pain and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that with the entire transcending of perceptions of corporeality with the disappearance of perceptions of senseresponse' with nonattention to perceptions of variety thinking 'Space is infinite' some monk enters upon and abides in the sphere of infinite space and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite space thinking 'Consciousness is infinite' some monk enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness and he then might think I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of nothingness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble one's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
But herein Cunda effacement should be practiced by you
Cunda I say that even the arising of a thought concerned with salutary things is of great importance not to speak of bodily acts and words conforming
Therefore Cunda
Suppose Cunda there were an uneven road and another even road by which to avoid it and suppose there were an uneven ford and another even ford by which to avoid it
So too
Cunda as all unsalutary states lead downward and all salutary states lead upward even so Cunda
Cunda it is impossible that one who is himself sunk in the mire should pull out another who is sunk in the mire
But it is possible Cunda that one not sunk in the mire himself should pull out another who is sunk in the mire
It is not possible Cunda that one who is himself not restrained not disciplined and not quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenching
But it is possible Cunda that one who is himself restrained disciplined and fully quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenching
Even so Cunda
Thus Cunda I have shown to you the instruction on effacement I have shown to you the instruction on thought's arising I have shown to you the instruction on avoidance I have shown to you the instruction on the way upward I have shown to you the instruction on quenching
What can be done for his disciples by a Master who seeks their welfare and has compassion and pity on them that I have done for you Cunda
There are these roots of trees there are empty places
Meditate Cunda do not delay lest you later regret it
'This is my message to you
Thus spoke the Blessed One
Satisfied the venerable Cunda rejoiced in the Blessed One's words
According to the Comy the Thera's question concerns those who overrate the degree of their achievement ie those who believe that in their meditative practice they have achieved this or that result while actually they have not
Overestimation in that sense does not arise in ignorant common people who are entirely engrossed in worldly life nor does it arise in Noble Disciples because in a streamwinner the overestimation does not arise that he is a oncereturner etc
Selfoverestimation can occur only in one who actually practices and has temporarily subdued the defilements by way of tranquillity or insight
MahaCunda Thera being an arahant was no selfoverrater himself but in formulating his question he put himself in the place of one who is or as others say there may have been such selfoverraters among his pupils and for conveying to them the Buddha's reply he put his question
Underlie ie habitually occur
Comy This refers to views which having been indulged in repeatedly have become strong and have not been removed SubComy By ultimate elimination
Become active
Comy Wrong views have arrived at the doors of body and speech ie which have found expression in words and deeds
The common meaning of sallekha is austere practice or asceticism but in the Buddha's usage it is the radical effacing or removal of the defilements

The eight stages of meditation given here in the discourse consist of the four finematerial absorptions and the four immaterial absorptions
Comy
says that these meditative attainments are in common with the ascetics outside
Comy The overrater's meditative absorption is neither 'effacement' nor is it the 'path of practice for effacement'
And why not
Because that jhana is not used by him as a basis for insight that is after rising from jhana he does not scrutinize the formations
His jhana produces only onepointedness of mind and is as our text says an abiding in ease here and now
SubComy If one wishing to overcome the suffering of samsara goes with joyful confidence for refuge to the Triple Gem then this Refuge will be for him a supporting condition for higher virtue etc and it may gradually lead him to the attainment of the path of understanding
The Fortyfour Ways of Effacement
SubComy But why is harmlessness mentioned at the very beginning
Because it is the root of all virtues harmlessness namely is a synonym of compassion
Especially it is the rootcause of morality because it makes one refrain from immorality which has as its characteristic mark the harming of others
Just as the killing of living beings has the harming of others as its mark so also the taking away of others' property for 'robbing a man's wealth is worse than stabbing him' Similarly chastity removes the cause for the pains of child bearing etc and there is hardly a need to mention the harm done by adultery

Obvious is also the harm done to others by deception by causing dissension and by backbiting
The mark of harming others is also attached to gossip because it takes away what is beneficial and causes to arise what is not beneficial to covetousness as it causes one to take what is not given to ill will as it causes killing etc to wrong views as they are the cause of all that is unbeneficial
One who holds wrong views may in the conviction of acting righteously kill living beings and incite others to do likewise
There is nothing to say about other
Harmlessness has the characteristic mark of making one refrain from immorality which on its part has the mark of harming
Hence harmlessness is an especially strong productive cause of morality and morality again is the basis for concentration of mind while concentration is the basis for wisdom
In that way harmlessness is the root of all virtues
Furthermore in the case of the highest type of men who have noble aspirations who act considerately and wisely also their mental concentration and their wisdom just as their morality is conducive to the weal and happiness of others
In that way too compassion is the root of all virtues and therefore it has been mentioned at the beginning
Now the salutary courses of action are to show that these states are produced by harmlessness
Then follow the eight states of rightness to show that they must be brought about by basing them on morality which is the root of these virtues
Now the separation from the hindrances is included to indicate that this is the primary task for one intent on purifying the eightfold path
Then follows the cleansing from the defilements to indicate that effacement is accomplished by giving up anger etc
And the cleansing from the defilements will be successful when aided by amenability to advice noble friendship and heedful diligence
Now the seven noble qualities are included to show that they will come to perfection in him who is endowed with amenability and the other and that they on their part after having strengthened insight will lead to the paths of sanctitude

Finally the passage on 'misapprehending according to one's individual views' etc
is meant to indicate that for such a one that wrong attitude is an obstacle to the attainment of the supramundane virtues and is therefore to be avoided totally
This passage on misapprehending is also meant to show that one who by the right conduct here described is in the process of attaining one of the paths of sanctitude will be led to the acme of effacement
In this manner should be understood the purpose of stating these fortyfour modes of effacement as well as the order in which they appear in the discourse
Comy
says that a salutary thought is of great importance as it leads entirely to weal and happiness and as it is the cause for the subsequent actions conforming to it
Examples are given beginning with the intention to give almsfood to monks up to the aspiration for Buddhahood
The SubComy however says that in some cases the importance is not in the thought itself but only in the actual execution of it
This certainly applies to the intention to give alms etc
But in the efforts for effacing the defilements the formation of a mental attitude directed towards it in other words the heart's resolve is certainly an important factor
This section of the discourse has been condensed in the present translation
But he who has chosen the path of effacement as his way of practice is well advised to repeat all fortyfour items linking them with his heart's earnest resolve
Also the last two sections of the discourse have been condensed
Any salutary states of mind whether they produce rebirth or not and whether in a given rebirth they produce kamma results or not  all because of their type lead upwards
They are just like that because on the occasion of their yielding a kamma result that result will be desirable and pleasant
The connection is as follows just as unsalutary states lead downwards so it is with that one state of harmfulness for him who is harmful
Just as all salutary states lead upwards so it is with that one state of harmlessness for him who is harmless
Suppose there is a king who sends a letter to the border region and the people there unable to read it by themselves have the letter read to them by another able to do it
Having learned of the contents they respond with respect knowing it as the king's order
But they do not think that it is the letter reader's order he will receive praise only for his smooth and fluent reading of the letter
Similarly even if preachers of the ability of Sariputta Thera expound the Dhamma still they are just like readers of a letter written by another
Their sermon should truly be attributed to the Blessed One like the decree to the king
The preachers however receive their limited praise just because they expound the Dhamma with a smooth and fluent diction
Hence that statement in the discourse is correct
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
 Dhammapada 
The message of the Awakened Ones so stated as it is in the Dhammapada in the plain terms of good and evil upholds the same values that every great compassionate religion shares
But the seed of good has to grow in the soil of truth and how the tree grows depends upon the nature of the soil in which it is planted and whence it draws nourishment
With men as the custodians of the true the fulfillment of the good depends upon how truth is conceived by men to be
By their acts they verify it
So it was said of him at the time
But what then was the fundamental ground of that teaching
Of the many ways that such a question might be answered perhaps the simplest and best is this He expounded the teaching that is peculiar to Buddhas suffering origination cessation and a path
These four are known as the Four Noble Truths
This with the cognate teaching of No Self may be said to constitute the fundamental ground of the teaching of Buddhas this is what marks them sets them apart and entitles them to the unique epithet Buddha
The three discourses here presented display precisely in all its incomparably serene simplicity without assumptions that special fundamental teaching from which all Buddhism branches and to which it all points back
The first discourse displays this fourfold Truth as something to be realized and verified for oneself here and now the second discloses the contradictions which infect all self conceits the third echoes the second from another angle
The circumstances that lead up to the discovery of these four Truths and to the delivery of these discourses were briefly as follows
The Bodhisatta  as he then was before his awakening  was twenty nine when he left the house life where he enjoyed the extreme of luxury
He went into exile in order to find not a palliative but the true and incontrovertible way out of suffering
He studied and practiced under two of the foremost teachers of Samadhi and reached the highest meditative attainments possible thereby
But that was not enough He then spent the best part of the next six years in the practice of asceticism trying every sort of extreme selfmortification
During this time he was waited on by five ascetics who hoped that if he discovered the deathless state he would be able to communicate his discovery to them
This too failed
He decided to try once more the path of concentration attained through mindfulness of breathing though this time not pushed to the extremity of quiet but guided instead by ordered consideration
He now gave up selfmortification and took normal food again in order to restore to his emaciated body strength sufficient for his purpose
Then the five ascetics left him in disgust judging that he had failed and was merely reverting to what he had forsaken
But now in solitude his new balanced effort in the harmony of virtue unified in concentration and guided by the ordered consideration of insight with mindfulness at length brought success in discovery of the way to the goal he had sought for so long
Five faculties in perfect balance had brought him to his goal they were the four namely energy mindfulness concentration and understanding with faith in the efficacy of the other four  the five that merge into the Deathless
According to tradition the Awakening took place on the night of Vesakha full moon in the fruitful month of May
It was upon invitation that he resolved to communicate his discovery to others
For his first audience to whom to divulge it he chose the five ascetics who had shared his selfmortification but had later left him
They were now at Benares  India's eternal city  and so in due course he went there to rejoin them
Just two months after his awakening he preached his first sermon  the Setting Rolling of the Wheel of Truth or Bringing into Existence the Blessing of the True Ideal  with the five ascetics for his hearers
The tradition says it was the evening of the Asalha full moon in July the day before the rainy season begins and he began to speak at the moment when the sun was dipping and the full moon simultaneously rising
This his first sermon made one of his listeners the ascetic Kondañña a streamenterer with his attainment of the first of the four progressive stages of realization
The other four soon followed in his footsteps
The second sermon on the characteristic of NotSelf was preached to the same five and it brought them to the fourth and final stage that of arahatship and then as it is said there were six arahats in the world
These are the first two discourses presented here and they were the first two sermons ever uttered by the Buddha
The third the Fire Sermon was delivered some months later to an audience of a thousand ascetics converted from the heavenbent practice of fireworship
All three discourses deal only with understanding among the faculties mentioned above as required to be balanced
But understanding in order to reach perfection has indeed to be aided by the others or in other words to be founded upon virtue and to be fortified by concentration
Thus and no otherwise can it reach its goal of unshakable liberation
Now the hearers of all these three discourses were like the Buddha himself all ascetics already expert in the techniques and refinements of both virtue and concentration
So the Buddha had thus no need to tell them about what they already knew very well
Similarly he had no need to expound the doctrine of action and its ripening with which they were thoroughly acquainted through the ancient teachings
What he had to do was first to show how it is possible to go astray towards the opposite extremes of sensual indulgence and selftorment and second to describe the facts to show how things are clearly and succinctly enough to stir his hearers to the additional spontaneous movement of understanding essential and indispensable for the final discovery of deliverance each for himself

Now let the discourses speak for themselves
Their incalculable strength lies in their simplicity and in their actuality
The profound truth is there discoverable even through the misty medium of translation
Thus I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana
There he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five
Bhikkhus these two extremes ought not to be cultivated by one gone forth from the houselife
What are the two
There is devotion to indulgence of pleasure in the objects of sensual desire which is inferior low vulgar ignoble and leads to no good and there is devotion to selftorment which is painful ignoble and leads to no good
The middle way discovered by a Perfect One avoids both these extremes it gives vision it gives knowledge and it leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbana
And what is that middle way
It is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
That is the middle way discovered by a Perfect One which gives vision which gives knowledge and which leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbana
Suffering as a noble truth is this Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering association with the loathed is suffering dissociation from the loved is suffering not to get what one wants is suffering  in short suffering is the five categories of clinging objects
The origin of suffering as a noble truth is this It is the craving that produces renewal of being accompanied by enjoyment and lust and enjoying this and that in other words craving for sensual desires craving for being craving for nonbeing
Cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this It is remainderless fading and ceasing giving up relinquishing letting go and rejecting of that same craving
The way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this It is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
'Suffering as a noble truth is this' Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me before
'This suffering as a noble truth can be diagnosed' Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me before
'This suffering as a noble truth has been diagnosed' Such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me before
'The origin of suffering as a noble truth is this' Such was the vision 'This origin of suffering as a noble truth can be abandoned' Such was the vision 'This origin of suffering as a noble truth has been abandoned' Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me before
'Cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this' Such was the vision 'This cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be verified' Such was the vision 'This cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been verified' Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me before
'The way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this' Such was the vision 'This way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be developed' Such was the vision 'This way leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been developed' Such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me before
As long as my knowing and seeing how things are was not quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths I did not claim in the world with its gods its Maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans with its princes and men to have discovered the full awakening that is supreme
But as soon as my knowing and seeing how things are was quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths then I claimed in the world with its gods its Maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans its princes and men to have discovered the full awakening that is supreme
Knowing and seeing arose in me thus 'My heart's deliverance is unassailable
This is the last birth
Now there is no renewal of being' That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus of the group of five were glad and they approved his words
Now during this utterance there arose in the venerable Kondañña the spotless immaculate vision of the True Idea Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation
When the Wheel of Truth had thus been set rolling by the Blessed One the earthgods raised the cry At Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana the matchless Wheel of truth has been set rolling by the Blessed One not to be stopped by monk or divine or god or deathangel or high divinity or anyone in the world
On hearing the earthgods' cry all the gods in turn in the six paradises of the sensual sphere took up the cry till it reached beyond the Retinue of High Divinity in the sphere of pure form
And so indeed in that hour at that moment the cry soared up to the World of High Divinity and this tenthousandfold worldelement shook and rocked and quaked and a great measureless radiance surpassing the very nature of the gods was displayed in the world
Then the Blessed One uttered the exclamation Kondañña knows
Kondañña knows and that is how that venerable one acquired the name AññaKondañña  Kondañña who knows
Thus I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana
There he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five Bhikkhus  Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus form is notself
Were form self then this form would not lead to affliction and one could have it of form 'Let my form be thus let my form be not thus' And since form is notself so it leads to affliction and none can have it of form 'Let my form be thus let my form be not thus'
Bhikkhus feeling is notself
Bhikkhus perception is notself
Bhikkhus determinations are notself
Bhikkhus consciousness is not self
Were consciousness self then this consciousness would not lead to affliction and one could have it of consciousness 'Let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thus' And since consciousness is notself so it leads to affliction and none can have it of consciousness 'Let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thus'
Bhikkhus how do you conceive it is form permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable Sir  Now is what is impermanent painful or pleasant  Painful venerable Sir  Now is what is impermanent what is painful since subject to change fit to be regarded thus 'This is mine this is I this is my self'
 No venerable sir
Is feeling permanent or impermanent
Is perception permanent or impermanent
Are determinations permanent or impermanent
Is consciousness permanent or impermanent  Impermanent venerable sir  Now is what is impermanent pleasant or painful  Painful venerable sir  Now is what is impermanent what is painful since subject to change fit to be regarded thus 'This is mine this is I this is my self'
 No venerable sir
So bhikkhus any kind of form whatever whether past future or presently arisen whether gross or subtle whether in oneself or external whether inferior or superior whether far or near must with right understanding how it is be regarded thus 'This is not mine this is not I this is not myself'
Any kind of feeling whatever
Any kind of perception whatever
Any kind of determination whatever
Any kind of consciousness whatever whether past future or presently arisen whether gross or subtle whether in oneself or external whether inferior or superior whether far or near must with right understanding how it is be regarded thus 'This is not mine this is not I this is not my self'
Bhikkhus when a noble follower who has heard sees thus he finds estrangement in form he finds estrangement in feeling he finds estrangement in perception he finds estrangement in determinations he finds estrangement in consciousness
When he finds estrangement passion fades out
With the fading of passion he is liberated
When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated
He understands 'Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what can be done is done of this there is no more beyond' That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were glad and they approved his words
Now during this utterance the hearts of the bhikkhus of the group of five were liberated from taints through clinging no more
Thus I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Gaya at Gayasisa together with a thousand bhikkhus
There he addressed the bhikkhus
Bhikkhus all is burning
And what is the all that is burning
The eye is burning forms are burning eyeconsciousness is burning eyecontact is burning also whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with eyecontact for its indispensable condition that too is burning
Burning with what
Burning with the fire of lust with the fire of hate with the fire of delusion
I say it is burning with birth aging and death with sorrows with lamentations with pains with griefs with despairs
The ear is burning sounds are burning
The nose is burning odors are burning
The tongue is burning flavors are burning
The body is burning tangibles are burning
The mind is burning ideas are burning mindconsciousness is burning mindcontact is burning also whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with mindcontact for its indispensable condition that too is burning
Burning with what
Burning with the fire of lust with the fire of hate with the fire of delusion
I say it is burning with birth aging and death with sorrows with lamentations with pains with griefs with despairs
Bhikkhus when a noble follower who has heard sees thus he finds estrangement in the eye finds estrangement in forms finds estrangement in eyeconsciousness finds estrangement in eyecontact and whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainful norpleasant that arises with eyecontact for its indispensable condition in that too he finds estrangement
He finds estrangement in the ear in sounds
He finds estrangement in the nose in odors
He finds estrangement in the tongue in flavors
He finds estrangement in the body in tangibles
He finds estrangement in the mind finds estrangement in ideas finds estrangement in mindconsciousness finds estrangement in mindcontact and whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with mindcontact for its indispensable condition in that too he finds estrangement
When he finds estrangement passion fades out
With the fading of passion he is liberated
When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated
He understands 'Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what can be done is done of this there is no more beyond' That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were glad and they approved his words
Now during his utterance the hearts of those thousand bhikkhus were liberated from taints through clinging no more
THUS I HEARD Words spoken by Ananda Thera at the First Council when all the Discourses were recited three months after the Buddha's Parinibbana
PERFECT ONE The Pali word Tathagata has several alternative explanations including tatha agato tatha gato and tathalakkhanam agato
NIBBANA Pali nibbana Sanskrit nirvana
The meaning is extinction that is of the fires of lust hate and delusion or more briefly of craving and ignorance and so nibbana is a name for the third Truth as liberation
The word is made up of the prefix nir and vana probably the origin was a smith's fire which goes out or becomes extinguished if no longer blown on by the bellows but the simile most used is that of a lamp's extinguishment through exhaustion of wick and oil
NOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH The members of the path are defined in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta and elsewhere as follows
Right Intention governed by renunciation nonillwill and noncruelty
Right Speech in abstention from lying slander abuse and gossip
Right Action in abstention from killing stealing and sexual misconduct
Right Livelihood for bhikkhus as that allowed by the Rules of the Discipline and for laymen as avoidance of trading in weapons living beings meat intoxicants and poisons
Right Effort to avoid unarisen and to abandon arisen evil and to arouse unarisen and to develop arisen good
Right Mindfulness of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness as given in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta  that is contemplation of the body as a body of feelings as feelings of states of consciousness as states of consciousness and of ideas as ideas
Right Concentration as the four jhana meditations
Collectively the first two members are called Understanding the next three Virtue and the last three Concentration
The Noble Eightfold Path is developed in four progressive stages namely those of streamentry oncereturn nonreturn and Arahatship this being the end of craving which causes suffering
SUFFERING the Pali word dukkha made up of dur and kha extends its meaning from the actual suffering present in physical pain or mental grief to any unwelcome state of insecurity no matter how vague
TRUTH Pali sacca from the root sa and so literally a thereisness in the sense of a state that unlike a mirage does not deceive or disappoint
The common sense use of truth is by no means consistent and the word and the notion must therefore be handled with some care taking it here only as treated by the Buddha
As to individual philosophers' and divines' individual factional truths  that is to say The world is eternal or The world is not eternal or The world is finite or the world is infinite The soul is what the body is or The soul is one the body is another After death a Perfect One is or After death a Perfect One is not or After death a Perfect One both is and is not or After death a Perfect One neither is nor is not  when a bhikkhu has cast off all of these has renounced and rejected banished abandoned and relinquished them all he thus becomes one who has cast off all factional truths
But how is truth to be found which is not factional
There are five ideas that ripen here and now in two ways
What five
Faith preference hearsaylearning arguing upon evidence and liking through pondering a view
Now something may have faith well placed in it and yet be hollow empty and false and again something may have no faith placed in it and yet be factual true and no other than it seems and so with preference and the rest
If a man has faith then he guards truth when he says My faith is thus but on that account draws no unreserved conclusion Only this is true the other is wrong In this way he guards the truth but there is as yet no discovery of truth
And so with preference and the rest
How is truth discovered
Here a bhikkhu lives near some village or town
Then a householder or his son goes to him in order to test him in three kinds of ideas in ideas provocative of greed of hate and of delusion wondering Are there in this venerable one any such ideas whereby his mind being obsessed he might not knowing say 'I know' unseeing say 'I see' or to get others to do likewise which would be long for their harm and suffering While thus testing him he comes to find that there are no such ideas in him and he finds that The bodily and verbal behavior of that venerable one are not those of one affected by lust or hate or delusion
But the True Idea that this venerable one teaches is profound hard to see and discover yet it is the most peaceful and superior of all out of reach of logical ratiocination subtle for the wise to experience such a True Idea cannot be taught by one affected by lust or hate or delusion
It is as soon as by testing him he comes to see that he is purified from ideas provocative of lust hate and delusion that he then plants his faith in him
When he visits him he respects him when he respects him he gives ear one who gives ear hears the True Idea he remembers it he investigates the meaning of the ideas remembered
When he does that he acquires a preference by pondering the ideas
That produces interest
One interested is actively committed
So committed he makes a judgment
According to his judgment he exerts himself
When he exerts himself he comes to realize with the body the ultimate truth and he sees it by the penetrating of it with understanding
That is how there is discovery of truth
But there is as yet no final arrival at truth
How is truth finally arrived at
Final arrival at truth is the repetition the keeping in being the development of those same ideas
That is how there is final arrival at truth
This undeceptive truth so arrived at is the Four Noble Truths of which it is said
These four noble truths are what is real not unreal not other that is why they are called Noble Truths
 SaccaSamyutta
Besides this essential static unity of the four truths as undeceptiveness the dynamic structure of the transfiguration which they operate in combination is expressed as follows
Who sees suffering sees also the origin of suffering and the cessation of suffering and the way leading to cessation of suffering
 Sacca Samyutta
Of these four noble truths there is noble truth to be diagnosed there is noble truth to be abandoned there is noble truth to be verified and there is noble truth to be developed
 Sacca Samyutta
CATEGORIES this represents the Pali word khandha which is often rendered by aggregate The five are as given in the second Discourse
They are headings that comprise all that can be said to arise and that form the object of clinging
The clinging is neither the same of these five categories which are its objects nor is it something apart from them it is will and lust in regard to these five categories of clinging's objects that is the clinging there The five are respectively compared to a lump of froth a bubble a mirage a coreless plantainstem and a conjuring trick
CLINGING an unsatisfactory and inadequate but accepted rendering for the Pali upadana
The word means literally taking up By first metaphor it is used for the assumption and consumption that satisfies craving and produces existence
As such it is the condition sine qua non for being
What is consumed is the categories
The word clinging has to represent this meaning
Clinging's ending is nibbana
CRAVING though the word tanha doubtless once meant thirst it is never used in Pali in that sense
With ignorance it is regarded as a basic factor in the continuity of existence
Craving draws creatures on through greed and drives them on through hate while ignorance prevents their seeing the truth of how things are or where they are going
Denial is as much an activity of craving as assertion is
Denial maintains the denied
CESSATION nirodha meaning the cessation of suffering through the cessation of craving is regardable as the removal of a poison the curing of a disease not as the mere denial of it opposed to the assertion of it or the obstruction of it in conflict with the favoring of it since both assertion and denial confirm and maintain alike the basic idea or state that is required to be cured
Cessation therefore is not to be confounded with mere negativism or nihilism
Any pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on the world is gratification that the world is impermanent painhaunted and inseparable from the idea of change is the disappointment in the world the removal of desire and lust is the cure in the world The cure or escape is Cessation the Buddha would not claim awakening till he had diagnosed how these three things came to be
KNOWING AND SEEING HOW THINGS ARE the force of the Pali word yathabhuta come to be how is how exist lies in the direct allusion to the absolutely relative conditionedness of all being
It is given specially thus Seeing 'such is form such its origin such its going out' and so with the other four categories
THE VENERABLE KONDAA one of the five bhikkhus
See Introduction
FORM Pali rupa
As the first of five categories it is defined in terms of the four Great entities namely earth water fire and air along with the negative aspect of space from all of which are derived the secondary phenomena such as persons features shapes etc these are regarded as secondary because while form can appear without any of them they cannot appear without form
It is also defined as that which is being worn away thus underlining its general characteristics of instability
NOTSELF Together with the four truths this is taught only by Buddhas
Anatta is shown as a general characteristic without exception
The characteristic of impermanence does not become apparent because when rise and fall are not given attention it is concealed by continuity the characteristic of pain does not become apparent because when continuous oppression is not given attention it is concealed by the postures the characteristic of notself does not become apparent because when resolution into the various elements is not given attention it is concealed by compactness
 Visuddhimagga Ch
XXI
Selfidentification and hunger for permanence and bliss form the principal manifestations of craving guided by view that is wrong because it is not in conformity with undeceptive truth
When confronted with the contradictions and the impossibility of selfidentification with any of the five Categories of Clinging's objects craving seeks to satisfy this need by imagining a soul but since no such soul however conceived can escape falling within the five Categories of Clinging's objects this solution is always foredoomed to failure
Similarly any attempt to identify self with nibbana must always fail for the same reason
Nibbana conceived as identical or as apart from it or inside it or nibbana conceived as mine is misconceived
This does not prevent a Perfect One from using the speech that is current in the world in order to communicate though he does so without misapprehending it it as is shown in the Dhammapada
 Dhammapada Verses 
Similarly with the expression in oneself in the Second Discourse this is simply a convenient convention for the focus of the individual viewpoint not to be misapprehended
A bhikkhu heard the Buddha saying as in the Second Discourse here that the five Categories are not mine etc and he wondered So it seems form is notself feeling perception determinations and consciousness are notself
What self then will the action done by the notself affect He was severely rebuked by the Buddha for forgetting the conditionedness of all arisen things
It is impossible that anyone with right view should see any idea as self and Whatever philosophers and divines see self in its various forms they see only the five Categories or one or other of them 
FEELING this is always confined strictly to the affective feelings of pleasure and pain with the normally ignored neutral feeling of neitherpainnor pleasure These can be subdivided in various ways
PERCEPTION means simply recognition
DETERMINATIONS a great many different renderings of this term are current the next best of which is certainly formations The Pali word sankhara means literally a construction and is derived from the prefix sam plus the verb karoti compare the Latin conficere from con plus facere which gives the French confection
The Sanskrit means ritual acts with the purpose of bringing about good rebirth
As used in Pali by the Buddha it covers any aspects having to do with action willing making planning using choice etc and contact is often placed at the head of lists defining it
Otherwise defined as bodily verbal and mental action
CONSCIOUSNESS is here the bare being conscious left for consideration when the other four categories have been dealt with
It is only describable in individual plurality in terms of the other four Categories as fire is individualized only by the fuel it burns
Otherwise it is regardable as an infiniteness dependent upon the contemplation of it as such
It is only impermanent etc because however it arises it can only do so in dependence on the other Categories that is on conditions themselves impermanent painful and notself
It never arises unless accompanied by conascent perception and feeling
It has six doors for cognizing its objective fields but no more
ESTRANGEMENT the Pali noun nibbida and its verb nibbindati are made up of the prefix nir in its negative sense of out and the root vid
Nibbada is thus a finding out
What is thus found out is the intimate hidden contradictoriness in any kind of selfidentification based in any way on these things
Elsewhere the Buddha says
Whatever there is there of form feeling perception determinations or consciousness such ideas he sees as impermanent as subject to pain as a sickness as a tumor as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as an alienation as a disintegration as a void as notself
He averts his heart from those ideas and for the most peaceful the supreme goal he turns his heart to the deathless element that is to say the stilling of all determinations the relinquishment of all substance the exhaustion of craving the fading of passion cessation extinction
The stuff of life can also be seen thus
Normally the discovery of a contradiction is for the unliberated mind a disagreeable one
Several courses are then open
It can refuse to face it pretending to itself to the point of full persuasion and belief that no contradiction is there or one side of the contradiction may be unilaterally affirmed and the other repressed and forgotten or a temporary compromise may be found or else the contradiction may be faced in its truth and made the basis for a movement towards liberation
So too on finding estrangement thus two main courses are open either the search leaving craving for selfidentification intact can be continued for sops to allay the symptoms of the sickness or else a movement can be started in the direction of a cure for the underlying sickness of craving and liberation from the everlasting hunt for palliatives whether for oneself or others
In this sense alone Self protection is the protection of others and protection of others selfprotection
EYE etc the six beginning with the eye and ending with the mind are called the six Bases for Contact in oneself and are also known as the six Doors of perception
Their corresponding objects are called external bases since the emphasis here is on the subjective faculty of seeing etc not the associated piece of flesh seen in someone else or in the lookingglass which in so far as it is visible is not seeing but form as the external object of the seeing eye in oneself and insofar as it is tangible is the object of the bodybase in oneself and insofar as it is apprehended as a bodily feature is the object of the mindbase in oneself
Here the eye should be taken simply as the perspectivepointinginwardtoacenter in the otherwise uncoordinated visual field consisting of colors which makes them cognizable by eyeconsciousness and which is misconceivable as I The six Bases in Oneself are compared to an empty village and the six External Bases to villageraiding robbers
FORMS the first of the six External Bases respective objective fields or objects of the six Bases in Oneself
The Pali word rupa is used for the eye's object as for the first of the five Categories but here in the plural
Colors the basis for the visual perspective of the eye are intended primarily see also under FORM above
CONTACT the Pali word phassa comes from the verb phusati from which also comes the word photthabba
But here it is generalized to mean contact in the sense of presence of object to subject or presence of cognized to consciousness in all forms of consciousness
It is defined as follows Eyeconsciousness arises dependent on eye and on forms the coincidence of the three is contact and likewise in the cases of the ear nose tongue body and mind
Failing it no knowledge no consciousness of any sort whatever can arise at all This fundamental idea is sometimes placed at the head of lists of things defining Determinations
BODY the Pali word kaya is used both for the physical body and for any group as the English word body is
In Pali it is also used in the sense for the physical frame namely this body with its consciousness in a general sense sometimes called old action and then it forms the subject of body contemplation as set forth in the Satipatthana Sutta the aim of which is to analyze this conglomeration into its motley constituents
Or else it is used in a strict sense as here namely that door of the subjective bodysensitivity or tactile sense the perspectivepointinginwardstoacenter in the otherwise uncoordinated tactile field of tangibles consisting of the hard the hotorcold and the distendedandmovable
MIND the Pali word mano belongs to the root meaning to measure compare coordinate
Here it is intended as that special door in which the five kinds of consciousness arising in the other five doors combine themselves with their objective fields into a unitive perspectivepointinginwardstoacenter together with certain objects apprehendable in this minddoor such as infiniteness of space etc
Whatever is cognized in this door is cognized as an idea
And in the presence of ignorance it is misconceived as I It is thus the fusing of this heterogeneous stuff of experience into a coherent pattern when it also has the function of giving temporal succession and flow to that pattern by its presenting all ideas for cognition as preceded In the Abhidhamma but not in the Suttas the form which is the support for the mind is mentioned but not further specified
This would place mind on a somewhat similar basis to the eyeseeing as meant here in its relation to the objective piece of flesh
Later notions coupled it with the heart
Now fashion identifies it with the brain but such identifications are not easy to justify unilaterally and if they in any way depend upon a prior and always philosophically questionable assumption of a separate bodysubstance and a mindsubstance they will find no footing in the Buddha's teaching where substances are not assumed
MINDCONSCIOUSNESS if it is remarked that each of the six pairs of Bases the five consisting of eye ear nose tongue and body being coordinated by mind are open to any one's selfinspection and that consciousness is considered here as arising dependently upon each of these six pairs of Bases and in no other way whatsoever then this notion of mindconsciousness should present no special difficulty
IDEA the word dhamma is gerundive from the verb dharati thus it means literally a carryable a rememberable In this context of the six pairs of Bases it means the rememberables which form the mind's special object as distinct from the forms seen only with the eye the sounds heard with the ear the odors smelt with the nose the flavors tasted with the tongue and the tangibles touched with the body ideas are what are apprehended through the minddoor
These six cover all that can be known
But while the first are uncoordinated between themselves and have no direct access to each other in the minddoor the five find a common denominator and are given a coordinating perspective together with the mind's own special objects
So the idea as a rememberable is the aspect of the known apprehended by the mind whether coordinating the five kinds of consciousness or apprehending the ideas peculiar to it or whether apprehending its own special objects
This must include all the many other meanings of the word dhamma
Nibbana in so far as it is knowable  describable  is an object of the mind and is thus an idea
All ideas are notself What is inherently unknowable has no place in the Teaching
The first of these three discourses sets out the vision of the truth peculiar to Buddhas with its foundation of Suffering
The second then takes the five Categories given in the definition of Suffering in the first and it shows how in this comprehensive analysis every component can be diagnosed rightly that is to say in conformity with truth
It is this treatment that elicits the characteristic of Notself
The two characteristics of Impermanence and Suffering in the world were well recognized in ancient indian philosophies and have never been peculiar to Buddhism
This exposure of the inherent contradiction in the very nature of the idea of selfidentity to which craving cleaves with the wouldbe selfpreserving stranglehold of a drowning man upon his rescuer is here made the very basis for the movement to liberation
Craving is cured through coming to understand how things are while truth is being guarded
The consequent fading of lust is brought about by this discovery of truth and the understanding that there is no more of this beyond is the result of the final arrival at Truth by keeping it in being through development
In the third discourse the very same ground is gone over but described in different terms
The comprehensive analysis in terms of the five categories with their general rather than individual emphasis is replaced by the equally comprehensive and complementary analysis in terms of the six pairs of Bases which analyze the individual viewpoint without which no consciousness can arise
And instead of the dispassionate term Notself everything that could possibly be identified as self is without mentioning the term presented to the same effect in the colors of a conflagration of passion behind a mirage of deception
Only a Buddha whose heart is cooled by compassion can have the courage to venture so far in the search for truth and discover thereby the true state of peace
The Buddhas in the past accomplished and fully awakened those the Blessed Ones maintained the efficacy of action and of certain action to be done and so will those do in the future and so do I now
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The instruction of the Kalamas is justly famous for its encouragement of free inquiry the spirit of the sutta signifies a teaching that is exempt from fanaticism bigotry dogmatism and intolerance
The reasonableness of the Dhamma the Buddha's teaching is chiefly evident in its welcoming careful examination at all stages of the path to enlightenment
Indeed the whole course of training for wisdom culminating in the purity of the consummate one is intimately bound up with examination and analysis of things internal the eye and visible objects the ear and sounds the nose and smells the tongue and tastes the body and tactile impressions the mind and ideas
Thus since all phenomena have to be correctly understood in the field of Dhamma insight is operative throughout
In this sutta it is active in rejecting the bad and adopting the good way in the extracts given below in clarifying the basis of knowledge of conditionality and arhatship
Here it may be mentioned that the methods of examination in the Kalama Sutta and in the extracts cited here have sprung from the knowledge of things as they are and that the tenor of these methods are implied in all straight thinking
Further as penetration and comprehension the constituents of wisdom are the result of such thinking the place of critical examination and analysis in the development of right vision is obvious
Where is the wisdom or vision that can descend all of a sudden untouched and uninfluenced by a critical thought
The Kalama Sutta which sets forth the principles that should be followed by a seeker of truth and which contains a standard things are judged by belongs to a framework of the Dhamma the four solaces taught in the sutta point out the extent to which the Buddha permits suspense of judgment in matters beyond normal cognition
The solaces show that the reason for a virtuous life does not necessarily depend on belief in rebirth or retribution but on mental wellbeing acquired through the overcoming of greed hate and delusion
More than fifty years ago Moncure D
Conway the author of My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East visited Colombo
He was a friend of Ponnambalam Ramanathan and together with him Conway went to the Vidyodaya Pirivena to learn something of the Buddha's teaching from Hikkaduve Siri Sumangala Nayaka Thera the founder of the institution
The Nayaka Thera explained to them the principles contained in the Kalama Sutta and at the end of the conversation Ramanathan whispered to Conway Is it not strange that you and I who come from far different religions and regions should together listen to a sermon from the Buddha in favor of that free thought that independence of traditional and fashionable doctrines which is still the vital principle of human development  Conway Yes and we with the princes pronounce his doctrines good
Friend Savittha apart from faith apart from liking apart from what has been acquired by repeated hearing apart from specious reasoning and from a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over I know this I see this 'Decay and death are due to birth' Samyuttanikaya Nidanavagga Mahavagga Sutta No

Here a bhikkhu having seen an object with the eye knows when greed hate and delusion are within 'Greed hate and delusion are in me' he knows when greed hate and delusion are not within 'Greed hate and delusion are not in me' Bhikkhus have these things to be experienced through faith liking what has been acquired by repeated hearing specious reasoning or a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over  No venerable sir  Bhikkhus this even is the way by which a bhikkhu apart from faith liking what has been acquired by repeated hearing specious reasoning or a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over declares realization of knowledge thus I know that birth has been exhausted the celibate life has been lived what must be done has been done and there is no more of this to come
Samyuttanikaya Salyatanavagga Navapuranavagga Sutta No

I heard thus
Once the Blessed One while wandering in the Kosala country with a large community of bhikkhus entered a town of the Kalama people called Kesaputta
The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta Reverend Gotama the monk the son of the Sakyans has while wandering in the Kosala country entered Kesaputta
The good repute of the Reverend Gotama has been spread in this way Indeed the Blessed One is thus consummate fully enlightened endowed with knowledge and practice sublime knower of the worlds peerless guide of tamable men teacher of divine and human beings which he by himself has through direct knowledge understood clearly
He set forth the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle good in the end possessed of meaning and the letter and complete in everything and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly pure
Seeing such consummate ones is good indeed
Then the Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta went to where the Blessed One was
On arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side some exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable talk sat down on one side some saluted him raising their joined palms and sat down on one side some announced their name and family and sat down on one side some without speaking sat down on one side
The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting on one side said to the Blessed One There are some monks and brahmans venerable sir who visit Kesaputta
They expound and explain only their own doctrines the doctrines of others they despise revile and pull to pieces
Some other monks and brahmans too venerable sir come to Kesaputta
They also expound and explain only their own doctrines the doctrines of others they despise revile and pull to pieces
Venerable sir there is doubt there is uncertainty in us concerning them
Which of these reverend monks and brahmans spoke the truth and which falsehood
It is proper for you Kalamas to doubt to be uncertain uncertainty has arisen in you about what is doubtful
Come Kalamas
Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing nor upon tradition nor upon rumor nor upon what is in a scripture nor upon surmise nor upon an axiom nor upon specious reasoning nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over nor upon another's seeming ability nor upon the consideration 'The monk is our teacher' Kalamas when you yourselves know 'These things are bad these things are blamable these things are censured by the wise undertaken and observed these things lead to harm and ill' abandon them
What do you think Kalamas
Does greed appear in a man for his benefit or harm  For his harm venerable sir  Kalamas being given to greed and being overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by greed this man takes life steals commits adultery and tells lies he prompts another too to do likewise
Will that be long for his harm and ill  Yes venerable sir
What do you think Kalamas

Or how does it strike you  Undertaken and observed these things lead to harm and ill
Thus it strikes us here
Therefore did we say Kalamas what was said thus 'Come Kalamas

As if venerable sir a person were to turn face upwards what is upside down or to uncover the concealed or to point the way to one who is lost or to carry a lamp in the darkness thinking 'Those who have eyes will see visible objects' so has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the Blessed One
We venerable sir go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma for refuge and to the Community of Bhikkhus for refuge
Venerable sir may the Blessed One regard us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life from today
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
If we contemplate even a minute sector of life's vast range we are faced with a variety of living forms so tremendous that it defies all description
Yet three basic features can be discerned as common to everything that has animate existence from the microbe to man from the simplest sensations to the thoughts of a creative genius
These three basic facts were first found and formulated over years ago by the Buddha who was rightly called the Knower of the World
They are designated in Buddhist terminology the three characteristics  the invariable marks or signs of everything that springs into being the signata stamped upon the very face of life itself
Of the three the first and third apply directly to inanimate existence as well as to the animate for every concrete entity by its very nature undergoes change and is devoid of substance
The second feature suffering is of course only an experience of the animate
But the Buddha applies the characteristic of suffering to all conditioned things in the sense that for living beings everything conditioned is a potential cause of experienced suffering and is at any rate incapable of giving lasting satisfaction
Thus the three are truly universal marks pertaining even to what is below or beyond our normal range of perception
The Buddha teaches that life can be correctly understood only if these basic facts are understood
And this understanding must take place not only logically but in confrontation with one's own experience
Insightwisdom which is the ultimate liberating factor in Buddhism consists in just this experiential understanding of the three characteristics as applied to one's own bodily and mental processes and deepened and matured in meditation
To see things as they really are means to see them consistently in the light of the three characteristics
Not to see them in this way or to deceive oneself about their reality and range of application is the defining mark of ignorance and ignorance is by itself a potent cause of suffering knitting the net in which man is caught  the net of false hopes of unrealistic and harmful desires of delusive ideologies and of perverted values and aims
Ignoring or distorting the three basic facts ultimately leads only to frustration disappointment and despair
But if we learn to see through deceptive appearances and discern the three characteristics this will yield immense benefits both in our daily life and in our spiritual striving
On the mundane level the clear comprehension of impermanence suffering and nonself will bring us a saner outlook on life
It will free us from unrealistic expectations bestow a courageous acceptance of suffering and failure and protect us against the lure of deluded assumptions and beliefs
In our quest for the supramundane comprehension of the three characteristics will be indispensable
The meditative experience of all phenomena as inseparable from the three marks will loosen and finally cut the bonds binding us to an existence falsely imagined to be lasting pleasurable and substantive
With growing clarity all things internal and external will be seen in their true nature as constantly changing as bound up with suffering and as unsubstantial without an eternal soul or abiding essence
By seeing thus detachment will grow bringing greater freedom from egoistic clinging and culminating in Nibbana mind's final liberation from suffering

Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya was one of the great personalities of Theravada Buddhism in the twentieth century and it is testimony to his vast store of past merits that his life span stretched clear across this century from its beginning almost to its end
In the course of his exemplary life this outstanding Mahathera has held some of the most prestigious academic and ecclesiastical posts in the country
Yet such honor and fame hardly touched him inwardly at heart he always remained a simple monk whose greatest joy was quiet study and meditation at his small village temple near the town of Balangoda
For me it is a personal honor to be able to name Ven
Ananda Maitreya as my own ordination teacher the one who brought me into the Sangha and guided my first steps in the life of a bhikkhu
The background story to my meeting with the Mahanayaka Thera goes back to the year
At that time I was living at a Vietnamese Buddhist meditation center in Los Angeles
I had been ordained as a samanera in the Vietnamese Mahayana Order and was lecturing in world religions at a local university
One day our center received notice that a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka would be arriving in Los Angeles
We invited him to stay with us and give a series of lectures on Theravada Buddhism at our center
That Buddhist monk was none other than Ven
Piyadassi Nayaka Thera of Vajirarama
I served as Ven
Piyadassi's host during his stay drove him around town over Los Angeles's forbidding maze of freeways and accompanied him to the airport when it was time for him to leave
When we parted Ven
Piyadassi suggested to me that some day I should come to Sri Lanka where he could arrange for me to stay at a Buddhist monastery
The next year the decision had crystallized in my mind to go to Asia to take ordination as a Theravada Buddhist monk
I wrote to Ven
Piyadassi to remind him of his invitation and he wrote back giving me the name of a senior prelate who he said had previously ordained Westerners
The name was that of Ven
Balangoda Ananda Maitreya
I wrote to the Mahanayaka Thera telling him of my background and of my desire to come to Sri Lanka to ordain as a bhikkhu and to study Pali and Buddhism
The Venerable promptly replied extending me a warm welcome and assuring me that he could oversee my ordination and my instruction in the Dhamma
It was at the end of October that I at last arrived in Sri Lanka and a week later I made the trip out to Balangoda
I was accompanied on this trip by the late Ven
Baddegama Vimalavamsa Nayaka Thera who had been my host in Colombo and by Ven
Pimbure Sorata Nayaka Thera in whose vehicle we traveled to Balangoda
Though both spoke highly of the excellent qualities of my prospective guru all along the way I felt somewhat apprehensive about my impending meeting with the Venerable One
Again and again the doubts plagued my mind Would I make my prostrations in the correct manner
Would I fumble hopelessly for words
Would I make some blunder that would immediately convince the Mahathera that I was unsuited for ordination as a monk
We arrived in Balangoda in the middle of the afternoon and headed for the Sri Dhammananda Pirivena where we were to meet Ven
Ananda Maitreya
As we approached the room where he was awaiting us my mind was torn between a keen desire to see my chosen teacher and the anxious thoughts that played havoc with my good intentions
My anxiety increased even to the point where I wanted to flee  back to the familiar smogdrenched roadways of Los Angeles which I had left a few months earlier  abandoning this noble quest for the Dhamma as a foolish figment of youthful idealism
But there was no turning back the two Nayaka Theras had already entered the room and now it was my turn
As soon as I crossed the threshold and set eyes on the Ven
Ananda Maitreya all my fears were dispelled like the morning mist before the rising sun
It was no stern cold ascetic glare that met my questioning eyes but a bright radiant kindness a natural simplicity and a twinkling immediacy of presence which instantly put me at ease
At once I felt delighted that my kamma and the good offices of Ven
Piyadassi had brought me into contact with such a luminous being
My fears of bowing in the wrong way were also laid to rest
As soon as I came up close to the Mahanayaka Thera to begin my bow he waved me towards a chair as though he thought he should not impose Asian monastic formalities on a visitor from urbane America
Of course I did not accept his invitation but made the customary triple prostration  with no fear at all that a pair of censorious eyes would be watching to see where I would trip up
Later that afternoon after tea and light talk the two Nayaka Theras who had so kindly brought me out to Balangoda departed and the Ven
Ananda Maitreya a few novices a lay attendant and the American postulant piled into the quaint ancient Britishmade car that was to take us to Sri Nandaramaya the Mahanayaka Thera's temple in Udumulla a village about km from Balangoda town
A light rain had started to fall and after several stopovers along the way we entered the rough dirt road that led to Udumulla
By this time darkness was thickly descending and thus when we reached the temple I could barely see farther than the small area illuminated by the kerosene lantern I was given
Over the next few days I had the chance to explore the full extent of Sri Nandaramaya
Earlier while living in the US I had heard worrisome reports about the comfortable living standards that Sri Lankan prelates were inclined to stake out for themselves
Though Ven
Piyadassi had already warned me that I must be ready to rough it at Udumulla on my first morning there I had still been halfexpecting a monastic palace to emerge from the mist
Well one quick walk around the Mahanayaka Thera's temple was enough to pull the ground away from any bold generalizations about luxuryloving prelates
The temple was in a sense an external reflection of the Mahanayaka Thera's own character simple stripped to bare essentials without ostentation revealing an almost complete indifference even oblivion to the perks and privileges of high office
The main part of the temple the pansala or monks' residence was a simple wooden structure with tile roof mudandcowdung floor a plain verandah with a chipped wooden lattice facade and a few cells for the monks
These contained little more than beds book cases and wooden tables it was in one of these that Ven
Ananda Maitreya was living at the time
A primitive alms hall in the back could accommodate about ten monks none very comfortably
Behind the temple was a hill on which two kutis or cottages had recently been built and were still drying out one lower down on the hill was a wattleanddaub structure intended for myself the other higher up was made of concrete and was to be occupied by the Mahanayaka Thera
Over the next few months I came to learn as a hard lesson that the diet at Sri Nandaramaya conformed to the same austere standards as the temple's physical structures
No gourmet's delight here
Breakfast generally consisted of thin rice gruel with a few cream crackers and occasionally a couple of small bananas
The midday meal was usually country rice with a dhal curry and a single vegetable and a local confection for dessert
Occasionally a piece of papaya provided a special treat
For a year before I came to Sri Lanka I had already been a vegetarian but the fare at Udumulla was still too spartan for my needs
I soon enough learned how to go on alms round to the surrounding hamlets where I collected a variety of nutritious curries and could supply the monks in the temple with my surplus
For two and a half years I lived with Ven
Ananda Maitreya at Sri Nandaramaya
During this happy period I received regular instruction from him in Pali Suttanta and Abhidhamma fields in which his erudition was impeccable
The guidance he gave me so generously at that time has continued to benefit me right up to the present
In this early stage of my monk's life I faced considerable confusion trying to find the proper key to understand the Dhamma correctly
Western interpreters of Buddhism are often prone to invent their own versions of the Buddha's teachings which they then hail as the sole valid interpretation of the Dhamma
Without a reliable guide it is easy to get lost in the jungles of speculation and opinion littered with the landmines of pride contention and conceit
During this period the Mahanayaka Thera always reminded me of the importance of relying on the Theravada commentarial tradition in order to understand the Pali Dhamma correctly
He implanted in my mind a profound respect for the Atthakathas and Tikas the Commentaries and Subcommentaries an attitude which inspired and guided my study of the Suttas and the Abhidhamma
Although I subsequently came to see the need to distinguish among the various strata in the evolution of Theravada Buddhist thought this early advice from my teacher helped to steer me away from fruitless interpretations often rooted in little more than the pride and cleverness of the expositor
My meetings with the Mahanayaka Thera in those days were not all devoted to religious instruction
Ven
Ananda Maitreya was widely read had a rich store of experience and was an original thinker and writer
Thus every so often we would lay the books aside and he would dilate on his theories ranging from the origins of Christianity to the scientific basis for extrasensory perception
During this period I also discovered one of the secrets to the Venerable's health and vigour long walks
At this time he was already  years of age yet several times per month armed with a load of books we would make the km walk from his temple to the Balangoda pirivena and then after a short break at the pirivena would make another km walk back to the temple
I myself was some fifty years his junior but even then I had to hasten to keep up with him on these walks
Writers who have eulogized the Mahanayaka Thera after his death have often extolled his lofty titles his numerous writings and his extensive missionary work all over the world
A very different image of the Mahanayaka Thera remains fixed in my mind as a summation of his character and attitude towards life
The image stems from a scene I witnessed one afternoon about years ago
We were on our way back to Sri Nandaramaya from the pirivena and the Venerable decided to stop off at the Thumbagoda temple near the approach road to Udumulla
He often liked to stop off here on his way back to his own temple  to rest enjoy a cup of tea and chat with the incumbent monk a close friend of his for many years
On this particular afternoon the weather had been cool and rainy so the break was especially welcome
I sat out on the verandah sipping my tea while the Mahanayaka Thera and his friend spoke inside
About an hour later they still had not emerged
Darkness was starting to set in and the rain clouds were rumbling so I thought I should remind the Venerable of the time
I did not find the Mahanayaka in the main part of the temple though the incumbent monk was milling about there so I went all the way back into the kitchen
There I found him sitting on a small stool next to the fireplace chatting amiably with the temple servant who was sitting on a mat on the ground
I could not help being struck by the utter simplicity the lack of any sense of selfimportance the utterly unpretentious kindness of this man  the highest ranking prelate in the Amarapura Nikaya the most learned scholarmonk on the island yet never thinking for a moment he was too good or too high to sit almost on the same level with a simple kitchen hand extending to him the same gracious friendliness that he extended to everyone else who sought his guidance and help
In recent years I did not have frequent personal contact with Ven
Ananda Maitreya
He had spent long periods abroad and when he was in Sri Lanka he was residing at Balangoda while I have been in Kandy looking after the late Ven
Nyanaponika Mahathera and supervising the publications programme of the Buddhist Publication Society
But from the reports of newspapers and friends and from my own occasional meetings with him I often heard of the Venerable's successful missions abroad
I was especially glad to know that he had become a virtual Sangha father to the Western Bhikkhu Sangha based at the Amaravati and Chithurst monasteries in Britain
I was fortunate to have three delightful meetings with the Mahanayaka Thera in the past three years
During the Vassa of which he spent at Giriulla about halfway between Kandy and Colombo I went out with a friend to visit him
I was both amused and impressed to see how assiduously he had taken to the computer a skill he had learned at the ripe age of and in which he had become quite adept
It was altogether in character for him not to think he was too old to learn something new and to achieve an effortless mastery over it in minimal time
We even exchanged views on the relative merits of different software programmes and computers
At this meeting he told us he had a strong intuition that he would live to the age of
So sure was I that his intuition was correct that when I heard he was seriously ill in Colombo this past July I had no doubt that he would recover
A second meeting took place almost exactly a year before his death
With a group of friends I had gone to Colombo on Ven
Piyadassi's rd birthday to share a birthday dana with him
I had earlier heard that Ven
Ananda Maitreya was staying at his temple at Maharagama and I wanted to visit him too
I had a special reason for this visit
About a month earlier a group of Buddhists from Malaysia had called on me and presented me with a twovolume work they had published for free distribution The Great Chronicle of Buddhas by the Ven
Mingun Sayadaw of Myanmar
The work describes in detail the spiritual path of the bodhisattva and since I knew Ven
Ananda Maitreya followed this ideal the thought occurred to me to present him with this pair of books
Fortunately we were able to meet him and I could offer him the books which he started perusing even before we concluded our meeting
Just a few months earlier he had received Myanmar's highest ecclesiastical honor the title of Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru and he told us about his trip to that country to receive the honor
When we left his room we found to our astonishment a line of about thirty people waiting to see him
It seemed to us his room was like a doctor's office but these people waiting so patiently were seeking medicine for the spirit not for the body
My third meeting with the Mahanayaka Thera took place only a month before his death
On a trip down to Colombo this time to visit an ailing Ven
Piyadassi I had heard that Ven
Ananda Maitreya was also in the hospital warded on account of a buildup of phlegm in the lungs that had developed during a trip to Taiwan and Thailand that he made in May
Together with a few friends I went to the hospital to see him
On our arrival there we were told that the Venerable had been discharged that same morning and was now at his temple in Maharagama
We set out for the temple at once and found him in apparent good health though still complaining of a little phlegm trouble He told us about his trip and gave us an illuminating explanation of his approach to insight meditation
We expected him to be returning to Balangoda before the rains retreat and I was hoping to go out to Balangoda after the rainy season to spend a longer period with him at his temple
He seemed so fit so clearminded so full of vitality that we never doubted he would live on for at least a few more years
Yet that little phlegm trouble was to become the agent that only one month later would snatch him from our midst leaving us with only the pain of loss and the consolation of pleasant memories
As I drove out to Balangoda with some friends to attend the Venerable's cremation when our southbound road linked up with the crosscountry road leading to Balangoda I had a surprise that brought a knot to my throat and tears of joy to my eyes
All along the road for about km from Avissawela onwards every town was decked out in yellow and orange banners inscribed with words of homage to the Mahanayaka Thera
Almost every house and shop flew a yellow flag or strips of yellow cloth
Balangoda itself was ablaze with yellow and orange banners some with pictures of Ven
Ananda Maitreya most with inscriptions
When I saw this and when I saw the long lines of people that turned out to pay final respects to the body and the huge crowd that attended the cremation I realized how powerful an impact this simple monk had made on the people of this nation on people of all communities ethnic groups and religions whom he always regarded without the least discrimination
Though gross materialism has made its inroads here with alarming force though a futile ethnic conflict has raged on for over fifteen years though crime and social problems escalate daily the massive public expression of solidarity with this humble monk showed where peoples' sympathies and affections really lie  when they are given the right example
May the great Mahathera the light of Sri Lanka's Sangha in the second half of the twentieth century quickly attain the highest goal and shed the radiance of his wisdom and compassion over the entire world
The Most Venerable Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru Agga Mahapandita Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Maha Nayaka Thera passed away at the Sri Jayawardhanapura General Hospital on Saturday
He was years

Cabinet members and representatives from Myanmar Thailand India Japan Britain Canada Switzerland America France Australia and from several other countries are expected to participate in the funeral on Thursday
Ven
Ananda Maitreya was born in Kirindigala Balangoda on August and entered the Bhikkhu Sangha at the age of
He held the post of Vice Chancellor of Vidyodaya University and was appointed as the first President of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Mahasangha Sabha in
In recognition of his laudable service at the Chattha Sangayana the Great Council held in Myanmar in Myanmar conferred on him the title Agga Mahapandita
Last year Myanmar conferred on him the highest Sangha title Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru which is equivalent to Sangharaja in honor of his unique service to the Sasana
Ven
Ananda Maitreya visited Yangon to receive the ecclesiastical title in March last year
A disciplined Buddhaputra he was well versed in the doctrine and discipline
He has written nearly books on Sutra Vinaya and Abhidhamma and on Pali and Sanskrit grammar
His book Sakyasimhavadanaya hevat Buddha Carita is considered a textbook on the subject
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The word love  one of the most compelling in the English language  is commonly used for purposes so widely separated so gross and so rarefied as to render it sometimes nearly meaningless
Yet rightly understood love is the indispensable and essential foundation no less for the growth and purification of the individual as for the construction of a peaceful progressive and healthy society
Now love can be considered in two principal moods that of lovers for each other and that of a mother for her child
In its spiritualised form love can draw its inspiration from either the one or the other
Spiritual love idealizing the love of lovers is often conceived as a consuming flame and then it sometimes aspires to purification through torture and the violence of martyrdom
But spiritual love that looks for guidance to the love of a mother for her child uplifts itself to the ideal of the pure fount of all safety welfare and spiritual health
It is this latter kind which the Buddha takes as the basis for his teaching of universal love
Where Greek distinguishes between sensual eros and spiritual agape English makes do with only the one word love But the Pali language like the Sanskrit has many words covering many shades of meaning
The word chosen by the Buddha for this teaching is metta from mitta a friend
Metta in the Buddha's teaching finds its place as the first of four kinds of contemplation designed to develop a sound pacific relationship to other living beings
The four are metta which will be rendered henceforward by lovingkindness karuna which is compassion or pity mudita which is gladness at others' success and upekkha which is onlooking equanimity These four are called Divine Abidings perhaps because whoever can maintain any one of them in being for even a moment has lived for that moment as do the Highest Gods
In the Buddha's teaching these four Divine Abidings the greatest of all worldly merit if practiced alone without insight into the true nature of existence can lead to rebirth in the highest heavens
But all heavenly existence is without exception impermanent and at the end of the heavenly lifespan  no matter how long it may last  the being dies and is reborn according to his past actions
This is because some craving for existence and some sort of view of existence that is not in conformity with truth still remain latent in him to burst out again when the result of the good actions is spent
And where he will be reborn after that is unpredictable though it is certain that he will be reborn
The Buddha's teaching of Insight is  in as few words as possible  the training in knowledge and seeing of how it is that anything whatever it may be whether objective or subjective comes to be how it acquires existence only through dependence on conditions and is impermanent because none of the conditions for its existence is permanent and how existence always complex and impermanent is never safe from pain and is in need of a self  the willo'thewisp idea the rainbow mirage which lures it on and which it can never find for the comforting illusion has constantly to be renewed
And that teaching also shows how there is a true way out from fear of pain
In its concise form this is expressed as the Four Noble Truths the truth of suffering the truth of suffering's origin the truth of suffering's cessation and the truth of the way leading to suffering's cessation
These four truths are called the teaching peculiar to Buddhas since the discovery of them is what distinguishes Buddhas
The way is also called the Middle Way because it avoids the two extremes of sensual indulgence and of selfmortification
It's eight members are right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
The practice of lovingkindness alone will give effect in some measure to all the members except the first but it is only with right view that Nibbana can be reached
Right View gives insight into the real nature of existence of being and nonbeing with all its mirages and deceptions and it is only with its help that the practice of lovingkindness is perfected lifted out of the impermanence of even the highest heavens and directed to the true cessation of suffering
That true cessation comes with the elimination of deception by wrong views and with the exhaustion of the stream of craving in its two forms of lust and hate
This extinction of lust hate and delusion is called Nibbana
The discourses that follow show the wretchedness of all anger and hate the rewards of lovingkindness the practice of lovingkindness as a meditation and contemplation its result in rebirth the seeing of all things and all existence as impermanent suffering and notself that is needed in order to have a vision in conformity with truth without which the first stage of unshakable deliverance cannot be reached and lastly the attainment of arahantship by which all lust hate and delusion are overcome lust for being and even for nonbeing cured and rebirth ended for good
But first before coming to these discourses some details from the meditation manual the Visuddhimagga or Path of Purification will not be out of place
Metta is defined as follows Lovingkindness has the mode of friendliness for its characteristic
Its natural function is to promote friendliness
It is manifested as the disappearance of illwill
Its footing is seeing with kindness
When it succeeds it eliminates illwill
When it fails it degenerates into selfish affectionate desire
The Visuddhimagga recommends going to some quiet place where one can sit down in a comfortable position
Then before starting the actual meditation it is helpful to consider the dangers in hate and the benefits offered by forbearance for it is a purpose of this meditation to displace hate by forbearance and besides one cannot avoid dangers one has not come to see or cultivate benefits one does not yet know
Then there are certain types of persons towards whom lovingkindness should not be developed in the first stages
The attempt at the outset to regard a disliked person as dear to one is fatiguing and likewise trying to regard a dearly loved friend with neutrality and when an enemy is recalled anger springs up
Again it should not be directed towards members of the opposite sex to begin with for this may arouse lust
Right at the start the meditation of lovingkindness should be developed towards oneself repeatedly in this way May I be happy and free from suffering or May I keep myself free from hostility and trouble and live happily
It is by cultivating the thought May I be happy with oneself as example that one begins to be interested in the welfare and happiness of other living beings and to feel in some sense their happiness as if it were one's own Just as I want happiness and fear pain just as I want to live and not to die so do other beings So one should first become familiar with pervading oneself as example with lovingkindness
Only then should one choose someone who is liked and admired and much respected
The meditation can then be developed towards him remembering endearing words or virtues of his and thinking such thoughts about him as may he be happy 
When this has become familiar one can begin to practice lovingkindness towards a dearly beloved companion and then towards a neutral person as very dear or towards an enemy as neutral
It is when dealing with an enemy that anger can arise and all means must be tried in order to get rid of it
As soon as this has succeeded one will be able to regard an enemy without resentment and with lovingkindness in the same way as one does the admired person the dearly loved friend and the neutral person
Then with repeated practice jhana absorption should be attained in all cases
Lovingkindness can now be effectively maintained in being towards all beings or to certain groups of beings at a time or in one direction at a time to all or to certain groups in succession
Lovingkindness ought to be brought to the point where there are no longer any barriers set between persons and for this the following example is given Suppose a man is with a dear a neutral and a hostile person himself being the fourth then bandits come to him and say we need one of you for human sacrifice Now if that man thinks Let then take this one or that one he has not yet broken down the barriers and also if he thinks Let them take me but not these three he has not broken down the barriers either
Why not
Because he seeks the harm of him who he wishes to be taken and the welfare of only the other three
It is only when he does not see a single one among the four to be chosen in preference to the other three and directs his mind quite impartially towards himself and the other three that he has broken down the barriers
Lovingkindness has its enemy within in lust which easily gains entry in its wake and it must be well guarded against this
The remedy for lust is the contemplation of ugliness as in the Satipattana Sutta
Its enemy without is its opposite illwill which finds its opportunities in the intervals when lovingkindness is not being actively practiced
In many discourses the Buddha lays emphasis on the need to balance contemplative concentration with understanding
The one supplies the deficiencies of the other
Concentration alone lacks direction understanding alone is dry and tiring
In the discourses that follow the simile of a mother's love for her child is given
Now the incomparable value of a mother's love which sets it above all other kinds lies in the fact that she understands her child's welfare  her love is not blind
Not love alone nor faith alone can ever bring a man all the way to the cessation of suffering and that is why the Buddha as the Supreme Physician prescribes the development of five faculties in balanced harmony the faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and understanding
So concentration of love in its highest form  the form that only the Buddha and no one else has given  seen as a means to the end becomes absolutely purified in one who has gained personal experience of the supreme safety from bondage which is Nibbana as the ultimate welfare of beings
For he knows from his own experience that their welfare is only assured permanently when suffering has been diagnosed its origin abandoned its cessation realized and the way maintained in being
Then he has verified the Four Noble Truths for himself and can properly evaluate beings' welfare
Bhikkhus it is through not discovering not penetrating to four truths that both you and I have been trudging and traveling through the roundabout of rebirths for so long
For the benefit of all those who have not yet done this the way has been discovered and pointed out by the Buddha and its practicability attested by the arahants
The last discourse given in this collection in fact shows how this personal discovery and penetration to the Four Noble Truths can be achieved by using lovingkindness as the vehicle
References to the Anguttara Nikaya are to nipata followed by the number of the sutta
The reference to Samyutta Nikaya is to samyutta followed by the number of the sutta

Bhikkhus there are five modes of speech that others may use when they address you
Their speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh for good or harm and may be accompanied by thoughts of lovingkindness or by inner hate
Suppose a man came with a hoe and a basket and he said I shall make this great earth to be without earth and he dug here and there and strewed here and there and spat here and there and relieved himself here and there saying Be without earth be without earth What do you think bhikkhus would that man make this great earth to be without earth
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because this great earth is deep and measureless it cannot possibly be made to be without earth
So the man would reap weariness and disappointment
Suppose a man came with lak or gamboge or indigo or carmine and he said I shall draw pictures I shall make pictures appear on this empty space What do you think bhikkhus would that man draw pictures would he make pictures appear on that empty space
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because that empty space is formless and invisible he cannot possibly draw pictures make pictures appear there
So the man would reap weariness and disappointment
So too bhikkhus there are these five modes of speech that others may use when they address you
Their speech may be timely or untimely true or untrue gentle or harsh for good or for harm and may be accompanied by thoughts of lovingkindness or by inner hate
Now this is how you should train yourselves here Our minds will remain unaffected we shall utter no bad words we shall abide friendly and compassionate with thoughts of lovingkindness and no inner hate
We shall abide with lovingkindness in our hearts extending to that person and we shall dwell extending it to the entire world as our object with our hearts abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill That is how you should train yourselves
Even were bandits savagely to sever you limb from limb with a twohandled saw he who entertaineth hate on that account in his heart would not be one who carried out my teaching
Bhikkhus you should keep this instruction on the Simile of the Saw constantly in mind
Bhikkhus whatever kinds of worldly merit there are all are not worth one sixteenth part of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness in shining and beaming and radiance the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness far excels them
Just as whatever light there is of stars all is not worth one sixteenth part of the moon's in shining and beaming and radiance the moon's light far excels it and just as in the last month of the Rains in the Autumn when the heavens are clear the sun as it climbs the heavens drives all darkness from the sky with its shining and beaming and radiance and just as when night is turning to dawn the morning star is shining and beaming and radiating so too whatever kinds of worldly merit there are all are not worth one sixteenth part of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness in shining and beaming and radiance the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness far excels them
Bhikkhus when the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being made much of used as one's vehicle used as one's foundation established consolidated and properly managed then eleven blessings can be expected
What are the eleven
A man sleeps in comfort he wakes in comfort he dreams no evil dreams he is dear to human beings he is dear to nonhuman beings the gods guard him no fire or poison or weapon harms him his mind can be quickly concentrated the expression of his face is serene he dies without falling into confusion and even if he fails to penetrate any further he will pass on to the world of High Divinity to the Brahma world
Bhikkhus just as clans with many women and few men are readily ruined by robbers and bandits so too any bhikkhu who has not maintained in being and made much of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is readily ruined by nonhuman beings
And just as clans with few women and many men are not readily ruined by robbers and bandits so too any bhikkhu who maintains in being and makes much of the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is not readily ruined by nonhuman beings
So bhikkhus you should train in this way The heartdeliverance of lovingkindness will be maintained in being and made much of by us used as our vehicle used as our foundation established consolidated and properly managed
That is how you should train
Bhikkhus if a bhikkhu cultivates lovingkindness for as long as a fingersnap he is called a bhikkhu
He is not destitute of jhana meditation he carries out the Master's teaching he responds to advice and he does not eat the country's alms food in vain
So what should be said of those who make much of it
Here friends a bhikkhu might say When the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being and made much of by me used as my vehicle used as my foundation established consolidated and properly managed illwill nevertheless still invades my heart and remains He should be told Not so
Let the worthy one not say so
Let him not misrepresent the Blessed One
It is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One
The Blessed One would not express it thus Friends it is impossible it cannot happen that when the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being and made much of used as one's vehicle used as one's foundation established consolidated and properly managed illwill can invade the heart and remain for this that is to say the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is the escape from illwill
The heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified extension with specified extension and with directional extension
That with unspecified extension is practiced in five ways as follows May all beings be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss
May all breathing things all creatures all persons May all those who are embodied be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss
That with specified extension is practiced in seven ways as follows May all women be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss
May all men all Noble Ones all who are not Noble Ones all deities all human beings may all those in the states of deprivation be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss
That with directional extension is practiced in ten ways as follows
May all beings in the eastern direction be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss
May all beings in the western direction in the northern direction in the southern direction in the eastern intermediate direction in the western intermediate direction in the northern intermediate direction in the southern intermediate direction in the downward direction May all those in the upward direction be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss
May all breathing things
May all creatures
May all persons
May all who are embodied
May all women
May all men
May all Noble Ones
May all who are not Noble Ones
May all deities
May all human beings
May all those in the states of deprivation in the eastern direction be freed from enmity distress and anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss May all those in states of deprivation in the upward direction be freed from enmity distress anxiety and may they guide themselves to bliss
And how does a bhikkhu abide with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one direction
Just as he would feel friendliness on seeing a dearly beloved person so he extends lovingkindness to all creatures
Master Gotama I have heard it said that the Monk Gotama teaches the path to the retinue of the High Divinity
It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me that
Then listen and attend carefully to what I shall say
Even so sir the student Subha Todeyyaputta replied
The Blessed One said this
And what is the path to the retinue of the High Divinity
Here a bhikkhu abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing world
While this heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being in this way no action restricted by limited measurement is found there none persists there
Just as a vigorous trumpeter could easily make himself heard in the four directions so too when the heartdeliverance of lovingkindness is maintained in being in this way no action restricted by limited measurement is found there none persists there
This is a path to the retinue of the High Divinity
Here bhikkhus a certain person abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing world
He finds gratification in that finds it desirable and looks to it for his wellbeing steady and resolute thereon he abides much in it and if he dies without losing it he reappears among the gods of a High Divinity's retinue
Now the gods of a High Divinity's retinue have a lifespan of one aeon
An ordinary person stays there for his lifespan but after he has used up the whole lifespan enjoyed by those gods he leaves it all and he may go down even to hell or to an animal womb or to the ghost realm
But one who has given ear to the Perfect One stays there for his lifespan and after he has used up the whole lifespan enjoyed by those gods he eventually attains complete extinction of lust hate and delusion in that same kind of heavenly existence
It is this that distinguishes that differentiates the wise hearer who is ennobled from the unwise ordinary man when that is to say there is a destination for reappearance
Here bhikkhus a certain person abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over the allencompassing world
Now whatever therein exists classifiable as form classifiable as a feeling classifiable as perception classifiable as determinative acts or classifiable as consciousness such ideas he sees as impermanent as liable to suffering as a disease as a cancer as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as alien as being worn away as void as notself
On the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the retinue of the Gods of the Pure Abodes
And this kind of reappearance is not shared by ordinary men
Thus I heard
On one occasion the venerable Nandaka was living at Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery Migara's Mother's Palace
Then Migara's grandson Salha and Pekhuniya's grandson Rohana went to the venerable Nandaka and after salutation they sat down at one side
When they had done so the venerable Nandaka said to Migara's grandson Salha
Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with tradition or with legendary lore or with what has come down in scriptures or with conjecture or with logical inference or with weighing evidence or with a liking for a view after pondering it or with someone else's ability or with the thought 'The monk is our teacher' When you know in yourself 'These things are unprofitable liable to censure condemned by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to harm and suffering' then you should abandon them
What do you think
Is there greed  Yes venerable sir  Covetousness is the meaning of that I say
Through greed a covetous man kills breathing things takes what is not given commits adultery and utters falsehood and he gets another to do likewise
Will that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir  What do you think is there hate  Yes venerable sir  Illwill is the meaning of that I say
Through hate a malevolent man kills breathing things Will that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir  What do you think
Is there delusion  Yes venerable sir  Ignorance is the meaning of that I say
Through ignorance a deluded man kills breathing things Will that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir
What do you think
Are these things profitable or unprofitable  Unprofitable venerable sir  Reprehensible or blameless  Reprehensible venerable sir  Condemned or commended by the wise  Condemned by the wise venerable sir  Being adopted and put into effect do they lead to harm and suffering or do they not or how does it appear to you in this case  Being adopted and put into effect venerable sir they lead to harm and suffering
So it appears in this case  Now that was the reason why I told you 'Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay When you know in yourself These things are unprofitable then you should abandon them'
Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with the thought 'The monk is our teacher' When you know in yourself 'These things are profitable blameless commended by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to welfare and happiness' then you should practice them and abide in them
What do you think
Is there nongreed  Yes venerable sir  Uncovetousness is the meaning of that I say
Through nongreed an uncovetous man does not kill breathing things or take what is not given or commits adultery or utter falsehood and he gets another to do likewise
Will that be long for his welfare and happiness  Yes venerable sir  What do you think
Is there nonhate  Yes venerable sir  Non illwill is the meaning of that I say
Through non illwill an unmalevolent man does not kill breathing things Will that be long for his welfare and happiness  Yes venerable sir  What do you think
Is there nondelusion  Yes venerable sir  True knowledge is the meaning of that I say
Through nondelusion a man with true knowledge does not kill breathing things Will that be long for his welfare and happiness  Yes venerable sir
What do you think
Are these things profitable or unprofitable  Profitable venerable sir  Reprehensible or blameless  Blameless venerable sir  Condemned or commended by the wise  Commended by the wise venerable sir  Being adopted and put into effect do they lead to welfare and happiness or do they not or how does it appear to you in this case  Being adopted and put into effect venerable sir they lead to welfare and happiness
So it appears to us in this case  Now that was the reason why I told you 'Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay when you know in yourself These things are profitable then you should practice them and abide in them'
Now a disciple who is ennobled who has rid himself in this way of covetousness and illwill and is undeluded abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing world
He abides with his heart imbued with compassion gladness equanimity extending over the allencompassing world
Now he understands this state of contemplation in this way 'There is this
There is what has been abandoned
There is a superior goal
And there is an ultimate escape from this whole field of perception'
When he knows and sees in this way his heart is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When liberated there comes thereafter the knowledge that it is liberated
He knows that birth is ended that the Divine Life has been lived out that what had to be done is done and that there is no more of this to come
He understands thus 'Formerly there was greed which was bad and now there is none which is good
Formerly there was hate which was bad and now there is none which is good
Formerly there was delusion which was bad and now there is none which is good' So here and now in this very life he is parched no more extinguished and cooled out experiencing bliss he abides divinely pure in himself
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Four sublime states of mind have been taught by the Buddha
In Pali the language of the Buddhist scriptures these four are known under the name of Brahmavihara
This term may be rendered by excellent lofty or sublime states of mind or alternatively by Brahmalike godlike or divine abodes
These four attitudes are said to be excellent or sublime because they are the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beings
They provide in fact the answer to all situations arising from social contact
They are the great removers of tension the great peacemakers in social conflict and the great healers of wounds suffered in the struggle of existence
They level social barriers build harmonious communities awaken slumbering magnanimity long forgotten revive joy and hope long abandoned and promote human brotherhood against the forces of egotism
The Brahmaviharas are incompatible with a hating state of mind and in that they are akin to Brahma the divine but transient ruler of the higher heavens in the traditional Buddhist picture of the universe
In contrast to many other conceptions of deities East and West who by their own devotees are said to show anger wrath jealousy and righteous indignation Brahma is free from hate and one who assiduously develops these four sublime states by conduct and meditation is said to become an equal of Brahma
If they become the dominant influence in his mind he will be reborn in congenial worlds the realms of Brahma
Therefore these states of mind are called Godlike Brahmalike
They are called abodes because they should become the mind's constant dwellingplaces where we feel at home they should not remain merely places of rare and short visits soon forgotten
In other words our minds should become thoroughly saturated by them
They should become our inseparable companions and we should be mindful of them in all our common activities
As the Metta Sutta the Song of Lovingkindness says
These four  love compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity  are also known as the boundless states because in their perfection and their true nature they should not be narrowed by any limitation as to the range of beings towards whom they are extended
They should be nonexclusive and impartial not bound by selective preferences or prejudices
A mind that has attained to that boundlessness of the Brahmaviharas will not harbor any national racial religious or class hatred
But unless rooted in a strong natural affinity with such a mental attitude it will certainly not be easy for us to effect that boundless application by a deliberate effort of will and to avoid consistently any kind or degree of partiality
To achieve that in most cases we shall have to use these four qualities not only as principles of conduct and objects of reflection but also as subjects of methodical meditation
That meditation is called Brahmaviharabhavana the meditative development of the sublime states
The practical aim is to achieve with the help of these sublime states those high stages of mental concentration called jhana meditative absorption The meditations on love compassion and sympathetic joy may each produce the attainment of the first three absorptions while the meditation on equanimity will lead to the fourth jhana only in which equanimity is the most significant factor
Generally speaking persistent meditative practice will have two crowning effects first it will make these four qualities sink deep into the heart so that they become spontaneous attitudes not easily overthrown second it will bring out and secure their boundless extension the unfolding of their allembracing range
In fact the detailed instructions given in the Buddhist scriptures for the practice of these four meditations are clearly intended to unfold gradually the boundlessness of the sublime states
They systematically break down all barriers restricting their application to particular individuals or places
In the meditative exercises the selection of people to whom the thought of love compassion or sympathetic joy is directed proceeds from the easier to the more difficult
For instance when meditating on lovingkindness one starts with an aspiration for one's own wellbeing using it as a point of reference for gradual extension Just as I wish to be happy and free from suffering so may that being may all beings be happy and free from suffering Then one extends the thought of lovingkindness to a person for whom one has a loving respect as for instance a teacher then to dearly beloved people to indifferent ones and finally to enemies if any or those disliked
Since this meditation is concerned with the welfare of the living one should not choose people who have died one should also avoid choosing people towards whom one may have feelings of sexual attraction
After one has been able to cope with the hardest task to direct one's thoughts of lovingkindness to disagreeable people one should now break down the barriers 
Without making any discrimination between those four types of people one should extend one's lovingkindness to them equally
At that point of the practice one will have come to the higher stages of concentration with the appearance of the mental refleximage access concentration will have been reached and further progress will lead to the full concentration of the first jhana then the higher jhanas
For spatial expansion the practice starts with those in one's immediate environment such as one's family then extends to the neighboring houses to the whole street the town country other countries and the entire world
In pervasion of the directions one's thought of lovingkindness is directed first to the east then to the west north south the intermediate directions the zenith and nadir
The same principles of practice apply to the meditative development of compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity with due variations in the selection of people
Details of the practice will be found in the texts
The ultimate aim of attaining these Brahmaviharajhanas is to produce a state of mind that can serve as a firm basis for the liberating insight into the true nature of all phenomena as being impermanent liable to suffering and unsubstantial
A mind that has achieved meditative absorption induced by the sublime states will be pure tranquil firm collected and free of coarse selfishness
It will thus be well prepared for the final work of deliverance which can be completed only by insight
The preceding remarks show that there are two ways of developing the sublime states first by practical conduct and an appropriate direction of thought and second by methodical meditation aiming at the absorptions
Each will prove helpful to the other
Methodical meditative practice will help love compassion joy and equanimity to become spontaneous
It will help make the mind firmer and calmer in withstanding the numerous irritations in life that challenge us to maintain these four qualities in thoughts words and deeds
On the other hand if one's practical conduct is increasingly governed by these sublime states the mind will harbor less resentment tension and irritability the reverberations of which often subtly intrude into the hours of meditation forming there the hindrance of restlessness Our everyday life and thought has a strong influence on the meditative mind only if the gap between them is persistently narrowed will there be a chance for steady meditative progress and for achieving the highest aim of our practice
Meditative development of the sublime states will be aided by repeated reflection upon their qualities the benefits they bestow and the dangers from their opposites
As the Buddha says What a person considers and reflects upon for a long time to that his mind will bend and incline
Here monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with lovingkindness likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with lovingkindness abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distress
Here monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with compassion likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with compassion abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distress
Here monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with sympathetic joy likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with sympathetic joy abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distress
Here monks a disciple dwells pervading one direction with his heart filled with equanimity likewise the second the third and the fourth direction so above below and around he dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart filled with equanimity abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and free from distress
 Digha Nikaya 
Love without desire to possess knowing well that in the ultimate sense there is no possession and no possessor this is the highest love
Love without speaking and thinking of I knowing well that this socalled I is a mere delusion
Love without selecting and excluding knowing well that to do so means to create love's own contrasts dislike aversion and hatred
Love embracing all beings small and great far and near be it on earth in the water or in the air
Love embracing impartially all sentient beings and not only those who are useful pleasing or amusing to us
Love embracing all beings be they nobleminded or lowminded good or evil
The noble and the good are embraced because love is flowing to them spontaneously
The lowminded and evilminded are included because they are those who are most in need of love
In many of them the seed of goodness may have died merely because warmth was lacking for its growth because it perished from cold in a loveless world
Love embracing all beings knowing well that we all are fellow wayfarers through this round of existence  that we all are overcome by the same law of suffering
Love but not the sensuous fire that burns scorches and tortures that inflicts more wounds than it cures  flaring up now at the next moment being extinguished leaving behind more coldness and loneliness than was felt before
Rather love that lies like a soft but firm hand on the ailing beings ever unchanged in its sympathy without wavering unconcerned with any response it meets
Love that is comforting coolness to those who burn with the fire of suffering and passion that is lifegiving warmth to those abandoned in the cold desert of loneliness to those who are shivering in the frost of a loveless world to those whose hearts have become as if empty and dry by the repeated calls for help by deepest despair
Love that is a sublime nobility of heart and intellect which knows understands and is ready to help
Love that is strength and gives strength this is the highest love
Love which by the Enlightened One was named the liberation of the heart the most sublime beauty this is the highest love
And what is the highest manifestation of love
To show to the world the path leading to the end of suffering the path pointed out trodden and realized to perfection by Him the Exalted One the Buddha
The world suffers
But most men have their eyes and ears closed
They do not see the unbroken stream of tears flowing through life they do not hear the cry of distress continually pervading the world
Their own little grief or joy bars their sight deafens their ears
Bound by selfishness their hearts turn stiff and narrow
Being stiff and narrow how should they be able to strive for any higher goal to realize that only release from selfish craving will effect their own freedom from suffering
It is compassion that removes the heavy bar opens the door to freedom makes the narrow heart as wide as the world
Compassion takes away from the heart the inert weight the paralyzing heaviness it gives wings to those who cling to the lowlands of self
Through compassion the fact of suffering remains vividly present to our mind even at times when we personally are free from it
It gives us the rich experience of suffering thus strengthening us to meet it prepared when it does befall us
Compassion reconciles us to our own destiny by showing us the life of others often much harder than ours
Behold the endless caravan of beings men and beasts burdened with sorrow and pain
The burden of every one of them we also have carried in bygone times during the unfathomable sequence of repeated births
Behold this and open your heart to compassion
And this misery may well be our own destiny again
He who is without compassion now will one day cry for it
If sympathy with others is lacking it will have to be acquired through one's own long and painful experience
This is the great law of life
Knowing this keep guard over yourself
Beings sunk in ignorance lost in delusion hasten from one state of suffering to another not knowing the real cause not knowing the escape from it
This insight into the general law of suffering is the real foundation of our compassion not any isolated fact of suffering
Hence our compassion will also include those who at the moment may be happy but act with an evil and deluded mind
In their present deeds we shall foresee their future state of distress and compassion will arise
The compassion of the wise man does not render him a victim of suffering
His thoughts words and deeds are full of pity
But his heart does not waver unchanged it remains serene and calm
How else should he be able to help
May such compassion arise in our hearts
Compassion that is sublime nobility of heart and intellect which knows understands and is ready to help
Compassion that is strength and gives strength this is highest compassion
And what is the highest manifestation of compassion
To show to the world the path leading to the end of suffering the path pointed out trodden and realized to perfection by Him the Exalted One the Buddha
Not only to compassion but also to joy with others open your heart
Small indeed is the share of happiness and joy allotted to beings
Whenever a little happiness comes to them then you may rejoice that at least one ray of joy has pierced through the darkness of their lives and dispelled the gray and gloomy mist that enwraps their hearts
Your life will gain in joy by sharing the happiness of others as if it were yours
Did you never observe how in moments of happiness men's features change and become bright with joy
Did you never notice how joy rouses men to noble aspirations and deeds exceeding their normal capacity
Did not such experience fill your own heart with joyful bliss
It is in your power to increase such experience of sympathetic joy by producing happiness in others by bringing them joy and solace
Let us teach real joy to men
Many have unlearned it
Life though full of woe holds also sources of happiness and joy unknown to most
Let us teach people to seek and to find real joy within themselves and to rejoice with the joy of others
Let us teach them to unfold their joy to ever sublimer heights
Noble and sublime joy is not foreign to the Teaching of the Enlightened One
Wrongly the Buddha's Teaching is sometimes considered to be a doctrine diffusing melancholy
Far from it the Dhamma leads step by step to an ever purer and loftier happiness
Noble and sublime joy is a helper on the path to the extinction of suffering
Not he who is depressed by grief but one possessed of joy finds that serene calmness leading to a contemplative state of mind
And only a mind serene and collected is able to gain the liberating wisdom
The more sublime and noble the joy of others is the more justified will be our own sympathetic joy
A cause for our joy with others is their noble life securing them happiness here and in lives hereafter
A still nobler cause for our joy with others is their faith in the Dhamma their understanding of the Dhamma their following the Dhamma
Let us give them the help of the Dhamma
Let us strive to become more and more able ourselves to render such help
Sympathetic joy means a sublime nobility of heart and intellect which knows understands and is ready to help
Sympathetic joy that is strength and gives strength this is the highest joy
And what is the highest manifestation of sympathetic joy
To show to the world the path leading to the end of suffering the path pointed out trodden and realized to perfection by Him the Exalted One the Buddha
Equanimity is a perfect unshakable balance of mind rooted in insight
Looking at the world around us and looking into our own heart we see clearly how difficult it is to attain and maintain balance of mind
Looking into life we notice how it continually moves between contrasts rise and fall success and failure loss and gain honor and blame
We feel how our heart responds to all this with happiness and sorrow delight and despair disappointment and satisfaction hope and fear
These waves of emotion carry us up and fling us down and no sooner do we find rest than we are in the power of a new wave again
How can we expect to get a footing on the crest of the waves
How can we erect the building of our lives in the midst of this ever restless ocean of existence if not on the Island of Equanimity
A world where that little share of happiness allotted to beings is mostly secured after many disappointments failures and defeats
a world where only the courage to start anew again and again promises success
a world where scanty joy grows amidst sickness separation and death
a world where beings who were a short while ago connected with us by sympathetic joy are at the next moment in want of our compassion  such a world needs equanimity
But the kind of equanimity required has to be based on vigilant presence of mind not on indifferent dullness
It has to be the result of hard deliberate training not the casual outcome of a passing mood
But equanimity would not deserve its name if it had to be produced by exertion again and again
In such a case it would surely be weakened and finally defeated by the vicissitudes of life
True equanimity however should be able to meet all these severe tests and to regenerate its strength from sources within
It will possess this power of resistance and selfrenewal only if it is rooted in insight
What now is the nature of that insight
It is the clear understanding of how all these vicissitudes of life originate and of our own true nature
We have to understand that the various experiences we undergo result from our kamma  our actions in thought word and deed  performed in this life and in earlier lives
Kamma is the womb from which we spring and whether we like it or not we are the inalienable owners of our deeds
But as soon as we have performed any action our control over it is lost it forever remains with us and inevitably returns to us as our due heritage
Nothing that happens to us comes from an outer hostile world foreign to ourselves everything is the outcome of our own mind and deeds
Because this knowledge frees us from fear it is the first basis of equanimity
When in everything that befalls us we only meet ourselves why should we fear
If however fear or uncertainty should arise we know the refuge where it can be allayed our good deeds
By taking this refuge confidence and courage will grow within us  confidence in the protecting power of our good deeds done in the past courage to perform more good deeds right now despite the discouraging hardships of our present life
For we know that noble and selfless deeds provide the best defense against the hard blows of destiny that it is never too late but always the right time for good actions
If that refuge in doing good and avoiding evil becomes firmly established within us one day we shall feel assured More and more ceases the misery and evil rooted in the past
And this present life  I try to make it spotless and pure
What else can the future bring than increase of the good And from that certainty our minds will become serene and we shall gain the strength of patience and equanimity to bear with all our present adversities
Then our deeds will be our friends
Likewise all the various events of our lives being the result of our deeds will also be our friends even if they bring us sorrow and pain
Our deeds return to us in a guise that often makes them unrecognizable
Sometimes our actions return to us in the way that others treat us sometimes as a thorough upheaval in our lives often the results are against our expectations or contrary to our wills
Such experiences point out to us consequences of our deeds we did not foresee they render visible halfconscious motives of our former actions which we tried to hide even from ourselves covering them up with various pretexts
If we learn to see things from this angle and to read the message conveyed by our own experience then suffering too will be our friend
It will be a stern friend but a truthful and wellmeaning one who teaches us the most difficult subject knowledge about ourselves and warns us against abysses towards which we are moving blindly
By looking at suffering as our teacher and friend we shall better succeed in enduring it with equanimity
Consequently the teaching of kamma will give us a powerful impulse for freeing ourselves from kamma from those deeds which again and again throw us into the suffering of repeated births
Disgust will arise at our own craving at our own delusion at our own propensity to create situations which try our strength our resistance and our equanimity
The second insight on which equanimity should be based is the Buddha's teaching of noself
This doctrine shows that in the ultimate sense deeds are not performed by any self nor do their results affect any self
Further it shows that if there is no self we cannot speak of my own It is the delusion of a self that creates suffering and hinders or disturbs equanimity
If this or that quality of ours is blamed one thinks I am blamed and equanimity is shaken
If this or that work does not succeed one thinks My work has failed and equanimity is shaken
If wealth or loved ones are lost one thinks What is mine has gone and equanimity is shaken
To establish equanimity as an unshakable state of mind one has to give up all possessive thoughts of mine beginning with little things from which it is easy to detach oneself and gradually working up to possessions and aims to which one's whole heart clings
One also has to give up the counterpart to such thoughts all egoistic thoughts of self beginning with a small section of one's personality with qualities of minor importance with small weaknesses one clearly sees and gradually working up to those emotions and aversions which one regards as the center of one's being
Thus detachment should be practiced
To the degree we forsake thoughts of mine or self equanimity will enter our hearts
For how can anything we realize to be foreign and void of a self cause us agitation due to lust hatred or grief
Thus the teaching of noself will be our guide on the path to deliverance to perfect equanimity
Equanimity is the crown and culmination of the four sublime states
But this should not be understood to mean that equanimity is the negation of love compassion and sympathetic joy or that it leaves them behind as inferior
Far from that equanimity includes and pervades them fully just as they fully pervade perfect equanimity
How then do these four sublime states pervade and suffuse each other
Unbounded love guards compassion against turning into partiality prevents it from making discriminations by selecting and excluding and thus protects it from falling into partiality or aversion against the excluded side
Love imparts to equanimity its selflessness its boundless nature and even its fervor
For fervor too transformed and controlled is part of perfect equanimity strengthening its power of keen penetration and wise restraint
Compassion prevents love and sympathetic joy from forgetting that while both are enjoying or giving temporary and limited happiness there still exist at that time most dreadful states of suffering in the world
It reminds them that their happiness coexists with measureless misery perhaps at the next doorstep
It is a reminder to love and sympathetic joy that there is more suffering in the world than they are able to mitigate that after the effect of such mitigation has vanished sorrow and pain are sure to arise anew until suffering is uprooted entirely at the attainment of Nibbana
Compassion does not allow that love and sympathetic joy shut themselves up against the wide world by confining themselves to a narrow sector of it
Compassion prevents love and sympathetic joy from turning into states of selfsatisfied complacency within a jealouslyguarded petty happiness
Compassion stirs and urges love to widen its sphere it stirs and urges sympathetic joy to search for fresh nourishment
Thus it helps both of them to grow into truly boundless states
Compassion guards equanimity from falling into a cold indifference and keeps it from indolent or selfish isolation
Until equanimity has reached perfection compassion urges it to enter again and again the battle of the world in order to be able to stand the test by hardening and strengthening itself
Sympathetic joy holds compassion back from becoming overwhelmed by the sight of the world's suffering from being absorbed by it to the exclusion of everything else
Sympathetic joy relieves the tension of mind soothes the painful burning of the compassionate heart
It keeps compassion away from melancholic brooding without purpose from a futile sentimentality that merely weakens and consumes the strength of mind and heart
Sympathetic joy develops compassion into active sympathy
Sympathetic joy gives to equanimity the mild serenity that softens its stern appearance
It is the divine smile on the face of the Enlightened One a smile that persists in spite of his deep knowledge of the world's suffering a smile that gives solace and hope fearlessness and confidence Wide open are the doors to deliverance thus it speaks
Equanimity rooted in insight is the guiding and restraining power for the other three sublime states
It points out to them the direction they have to take and sees to it that this direction is followed
Equanimity guards love and compassion from being dissipated in vain quests and from going astray in the labyrinths of uncontrolled emotion
Equanimity being a vigilant selfcontrol for the sake of the final goal does not allow sympathetic joy to rest content with humble results forgetting the real aims we have to strive for
Equanimity which means evenmindedness gives to love an even unchanging firmness and loyalty
It endows it with the great virtue of patience
Equanimity furnishes compassion with an even unwavering courage and fearlessness enabling it to face the awesome abyss of misery and despair which confront boundless compassion again and again
To the active side of compassion equanimity is the calm and firm hand led by wisdom  indispensable to those who want to practice the difficult art of helping others
And here again equanimity means patience the patient devotion to the work of compassion
In these and other ways equanimity may be said to be the crown and culmination of the other three sublime states
The first three if unconnected with equanimity and insight may dwindle away due to the lack of a stabilizing factor
Isolated virtues if unsupported by other qualities which give them either the needed firmness or pliancy often deteriorate into their own characteristic defects
For instance lovingkindness without energy and insight may easily decline to a mere sentimental goodness of weak and unreliable nature
Moreover such isolated virtues may often carry us in a direction contrary to our original aims and contrary to the welfare of others too
It is the firm and balanced character of a person that knits isolated virtues into an organic and harmonious whole within which the single qualities exhibit their best manifestations and avoid the pitfalls of their respective weaknesses
And this is the very function of equanimity the way it contributes to an ideal relationship between all four sublime states
Equanimity is a perfect unshakable balance of mind rooted in insight
But in its perfection and unshakable nature equanimity is not dull heartless and frigid
Its perfection is not due to an emotional emptiness but to a fullness of understanding to its being complete in itself
Its unshakable nature is not the immovability of a dead cold stone but the manifestation of the highest strength
In what way now is equanimity perfect and unshakable
Whatever causes stagnation is here destroyed what dams up is removed what obstructs is destroyed
Vanished are the whirls of emotion and the meanderings of intellect
Unhindered goes the calm and majestic stream of consciousness pure and radiant
Watchful mindfulness has harmonized the warmth of faith with the penetrative keenness of wisdom it has balanced strength of will with calmness of mind and these five inner faculties have grown into inner forces that cannot be lost again
They cannot be lost because they do not lose themselves any more in the labyrinths of the world in the endless diffuseness of life
These inner forces emanate from the mind and act upon the world but being guarded by mindfulness they nowhere bind themselves and they return unchanged
Love compassion and sympathetic joy continue to emanate from the mind and act upon the world but being guarded by equanimity they cling nowhere and return unweakened and unsullied
Thus within the arahant the Liberated One nothing is lessened by giving and he does not become poorer by bestowing upon others the riches of his heart and mind
The arahant is like the clear wellcut crystal which being without stains fully absorbs all the rays of light and sends them out again intensified by its concentrative power
The rays cannot stain the crystal with their various colors
They cannot pierce its hardness nor disturb its harmonious structure
In its genuine purity and strength the crystal remains unchanged
Just as all the streams of the world enter the great ocean and all the waters of the sky rain into it but no increase or decrease of the great ocean is to be seen  even so is the nature of holy equanimity
Holy equanimity or  as we may likewise express it  the arahant endowed with holy equanimity is the inner center of the world
But this inner center should be well distinguished from the numberless apparent centers of limited spheres that is their socalled personalities governing laws and so on
All of these are only apparent centers because they cease to be centers whenever their spheres obeying the laws of impermanence undergo a total change of their structure and consequently the center of their gravity material or mental will shift
But the inner center of the arahant's equanimity is unshakable because it is immutable
It is immutable because it clings to nothing
Says the Master
For one who clings motion exists but for one who clings not there is no motion
Where no motion is there is stillness
Where stillness is there is no craving
Where no craving is there is neither coming nor going
Where no coming nor going is there is neither arising nor passing away
Where neither arising nor passing away is there is neither this world nor a world beyond nor a state between
This verily is the end of suffering
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The Buddha declares that he teaches the Dhamma for the sole purpose of leading beings to freedom from suffering
If moved by that teaching we resolve to make an end of suffering it is of prime importance that we understand the problem of suffering clearly in its true width and depth
If our grasp of the problem is too glaringly incomplete our endeavors to eliminate it will also be incomplete incapable of garnering the strength needed to yield fully satisfactory results
When asked Why end suffering the obvious answer is that one wishes to end suffering because it is the natural innermost urge of one's being to be free from affliction
However in aspiring to the extinction of suffering we should think not only of our own affliction but also of the pain and sorrow we inflict upon others as long as we have not reached the perfect harmlessness of a passionfree heart and the clear vision of a liberated mind
If we regularly recollect the fact that on our way through samsaric existence we inevitably add to the suffering of others too we shall feel an increased urgency in our resolve to enter earnestly the path leading to our own liberation
The suffering we may inflict upon our fellowbeings includes first those cases where other beings become passive objects of our harmful actions
Our greed robs impoverishes deprives and detracts soils and violates
Our hate kills and destroys hurts and rouses fear
The turbid waters of our interfering ignorance flood and devastate the neighbor's peaceful shores our misjudgments lead him astray and leave him in calamity
Then there is a second and even more detrimental way our defilements may cause harm to others
Our evil or impure actions often provide in others a harmful response that entangles them still more in the meshes of their defilements
Our own greed increases the competitive greed of others our own lust rouses in others lustful desires which might have slumbered had we not awakened them
Our own hate and anger provoke hostility in return starting thus the endless round of mutual revenge
Our prejudices become infectious
By our own illusions we deceive others who by believing them lend them increased weight and influence
Our wrong judgments false values and erroneous views sometimes only casually expressed are taken up and expanded by others into extensive systems of deceptive and perverted notions working untold harm on people's minds
In all these cases a good part of the responsibility will be ours
How careful we must be in what we speak and write
A third way we may cause suffering to others is due to the limited and varying lifetime of our emotions
Our own love towards a certain person may die a natural death while the person whom we loved still loves us and thus suffers under our neglect
Or in reverse while the other's love for us has died our own still lives and constantly urges him encroaches upon his need for freedom disturbs his peace and tears at his heart causing him sorrow because he cannot help us
These are quite common situations in human relationships and their consequences are often tragic
We feel their poignancy particularly strongly because no moral guilt seems to be involved only the stern impassive law of impermanence impressing its painful stamp upon this scene of life
Yet here too a moral principle applies though it is a matter of definition whether we use the word guilt Understood rightly the situation presents a case of lust attachment or craving causing pain through lack of fulfillment
Looking at this case in this light how clear will become the second noble truth Craving is the origin of suffering And so too that seeming paradox From what is dear to us suffering arises When deeply contemplating that little specimen of life's suffering as presented here we shall feel indeed Truly this alone is enough to turn away from all forms of existence to become disenchanted with them to become detached from them
We still have not exhausted all the ways our own imperfections may draw others into the whirlpool of suffering
But it may suffice here to add a fourth and last point
Our own passions and ignorance whether they involve another directly or only as an observer may contribute to his harm by destroying his trust in man his belief in high ideals and his will to contribute to the fund of goodness in the world
Our own imperfections may thus induce him to become egocentric out of disappointment a cynic or a misanthrope out of personal or impersonal resentment
Owing to our own imperfections the forces of Good will again have been weakened not only in us but in others too
There are many who will reply to the Buddhist doctrine of suffering by saying We are well aware that happiness and beauty joy and pleasure have to be paid for by a certain amount of suffering
But we are willing to pay the price without grumbling even the last price death and we think it is worth the price and that it adds zest to our enjoyment Before those who speak thus we may place the facts indicated above and ask them Are you aware that the price you are speaking of is paid not only by your own suffering but also by the suffering of others
Do you think that it is right and fair for you to make others pay for your happiness
Will you still find 'added zest' if you look at your happiness from that angle And our partner  provided he is honest and nobleminded  will pensively say I did not think of that
It is true I must not make others pay for my shortcomings
If I consider it unfair and ignoble to do so in my everyday dealings should it not likewise be so in relation to these higher problems of life We may then be sure that we have planted the seed in his mind and conscience which will sprout in due time
We return now to our initial line of thought
We have seen how our actions may affect others through many channels how our shortcomings may drag others into suffering entanglement and guilt
Thus our constantly accumulating responsibility for much of the suffering and unhappiness in the world should be an additional and powerful incentive for us to become holy and whole for the sake of others too
Certainly our own wholeness and health will not cure others at least not directly and not in all cases
Our own harmlessness will only rarely keep others from doing harm
But by winning to spiritual health we shall diminish at least by one the sources of infection in the world and our own harmlessness will lessen the fuel nourishing the fires of hate which ravage this earth
By remaining conscious of the suffering we cause and the suffering we might prevent we add two powerful motives to those already urging us to enter the liberating path the challenging sense of manly responsibility and the fullness of motherly love and compassion
These complementary ideals of duty and love which we may call the male and the female principles will help to keep us unswervingly on the path
Love and compassion towards those who might become the victims of our own imperfections will urge us to fulfill our duty towards them in the only way possible by fulfilling our duty towards ourselves
The above lines of thought are tersely expressed by a saying of the Buddha that is much too little known
In the light of the observations made above these simple yet profound words of the Master will become still more translucent charged with a magical power stirring the very depth of our being
By contemplating how our own defiled actions can have detrimental effects upon others we shall still better understand that both statements in this passage are complementary by guarding ourselves we are doing our best to protect others wishing to protect others against the suffering we ourselves can cause we shall do our utmost to guard ourselves
Therefore for our own sake and for the sake of our fellowbeings we have to be watchful of every step we take
Only by a high degree of mindfulness shall we succeed
Thus it is said in the same discourse that the method of practicing that twofold protection is the firm establishing of mindfulness which here too proves to be the sole way
I shall protect myself thus the establishing of mindfulness has to be cultivated
I shall protect others thus the establishing of mindfulness has to be cultivated
The same idea and method is expressed in a passage of the Buddha's Advice to Rahula
After reflecting again and again actions by deed word and thought should be done Before doing such actions by deed word and thought while doing them and after doing them one should reflect thus Does this action lead to the harm of myself to the harm of others to the harm of both After reflecting again and again one should purify one's actions by deed word and thought
Thus O Rahula should you train yourself
Again it is said
Thus O monks should you train yourselves Considering one's own welfare this is sufficient to strive untiringly
Considering the welfare of others this is sufficient to strive untiringly
Considering the welfare of both this is sufficient to strive untiringly
These three sayings of the Master will illuminate each other
By reminding us of the right motives of our quest and supplying us with the right methods for accomplishing our task they will be infallible guides in treading the path

Vedanta and Buddhism are the highlights of Indian philosophical thought
Since both have grown in the same spiritual soil they share many basic ideas both of them assert that the universe shows a periodical succession of arising existing and vanishing and that this process is without beginning and end
They believe in the causality which binds the result of an action to its cause and in rebirth conditioned by that nexus
Both are convinced of the transitory and therefore sorrowful character of individual existence in the world they hope to attain gradually to a redeeming knowledge through renunciation and meditation and they assume the possibility of a blissful and serene state in which all worldly imperfections have vanished for ever
The original form of these two doctrines shows however strong contrast
The early Vedanta formulated in most of the older and middle Upanishads in some passages of the Mahabharata and the Puranas and still alive today as the basis of several Hinduistic systems teaches an ens realissimum as the primordial cause of all existence from which everything has arisen and with which it again merges either temporarily or for ever
With the monistic metaphysics of the Vedanta contrasts the pluralistic Philosophy of Flux of the early Buddhism of the Pali texts which up to the present time flourishes in Ceylon Burma and Siam
It teaches that in the whole empirical reality there is nowhere anything that persists neither material nor mental substances exist independently by themselves there is no original entity or primordial Being in whatsoever form it may be imagined from which these substances might have developed
On the contrary the manifold world of mental and material elements arises solely through the causal cooperation of the transitory factors of existence which depend functionally upon each other that is the material and mental universe arises through the concurrence of forces that according to the Buddhists are not reducible to something else
It is therefore obvious that deliverance from the Samsara ie the sorrowladen round of existence cannot consist in the reabsorption into an eternal Absolute which is at the root of all manifoldness but can only be achieved by a complete extinguishing of all factors which condition the processes constituting life and world
The Buddhist Nirvana is therefore not the primordial ground the eternal essence which is at the basis of everything and form which the whole world has arisen but the reverse of all that we know something altogether different which must be characterized as a nothing in relation to the world but which is experienced as highest bliss by those who have attained to it
Vedantists and Buddhists have been fully aware of the gulf between their doctrines a gulf that cannot be bridged over
According to Majjhima Nikaya Sutta a doctrine that proclaims The same is the world and the self
This I shall be after death imperishable permanent eternal was styled by the Buddha a perfectly foolish doctrine
On the other side the KathaUpanishad does not see a way to deliverance in the Buddhist theory of dharmas He who supposes a profusion of particulars gets lost like rain water on a mountain slope the truly wise man however must realize that his Atman is at one with the Universal Atman and that the former if purified from dross is being absorbed by the latter just as clear water poured into clear water becomes one with it indistinguishably
Vedanta and Buddhism have lived side by side for such a long time that obviously they must have influenced each other
The strong predilection of the Indian mind for a doctrine of universal unity has led the representatives of Mahayana to conceive Samsara and Nirvana as two aspects of the same and single true reality for Nagarjuna the empirical world is a mere appearance as all dharmas manifest in it are perishable and conditioned by other dharmas without having any independent existence of their own
Only the indefinable Voidness to be grasped in meditation and realized in Nirvana has true reality
This socalled Middle Doctrine of Nagarjuna remains true to the Buddhist principle that there can be nowhere a substance in so far as Nagarjuna sees the last unity as a kind of abyss characterized only negatively which has no genetic relation to the world
Asanga and Vasubandhu however in their doctrine of Consciousness Only have abandoned the Buddhist principle of denying a positive reality which is at the root all phenomena and in doing so they have made a further approach to Vedanta
To that mahayanistic school of Yogacaras the highest reality is a pure and undifferentiated spiritual element that represents the non relative substratum of all phenomena
To be sure they thereby do not assert as the Vedanta does that the ens realissimum is identical with the universe the relation between the two is rather being defined as being neither different nor not different It is only in the later Buddhist systems of the Far East that the undivided absolute consciousness is taken to be the basis of the manifold world of phenomena
But in contrast to the older Vedanta it is never maintained that the world is an unfoldment from the unchangeable eternal blissful Absolute suffering and passions manifest in the world of plurality are rather traced back to worldly delusion
On the other hand the doctrines of later Buddhist philosophy had a farreaching influence on Vedanta
It is well known that Gaudapada and other representatives of later Vedanta taught an illusionistic acosmism for which true Reality is only the eternally pure eternally awakened eternally redeemed universal spirit whilst all manifoldness is only delusion the Brahma has therefore not developed into the world as asserted by the older Vedanta but it forms only the world's unchangeable background comparable to the white screen on which appear the changing images of an unreal shadow play
In my opinion there was in later times especially since the Christian era much mutual influence of Vedanta and Buddhism but originally the systems are diametrically opposed to each other
The Atman doctrine of the Vedanta and the Dharma theory of Buddhism exclude each other
The Vedanta tries to establish an Atman as the basis of everything whilst Buddhism maintains that everything in the empirical world is only a stream of passing Dharmas which therefore has to be characterized as Anatta ie being without a persisting self without independent existence
Again and again scholars have tried to prove a closer connection between the early Buddhism of the Pali texts and the Vedanta of the Upanishads they have even tried to interpret Buddhism as a further development of the Atman doctrine
There are eg two books which show that tendency The Vedantic Buddhism of the Buddha by JG
Jennings and in German language The Soul Problem of Early Buddhism by Herbert Guenther
The essential difference between the conception of deliverance in Vedanta and in Pali Buddhism lies in the following ideas Vedanta sees deliverance as the manifestation of a state which though obscured has been existing from time immemorial for the Buddhist however Nirvana is a reality which differs entirely from all dharmas as manifested in Samsara and which only becomes effective if they are abolished
To sum up the Vedantin wishes to penetrate to the last reality which dwells within him as an immortal essence or seed out of which everything has arisen
The follower of Pali Buddhism however hopes by complete abandoning of all corporeality all sensations all perceptions all volitions and acts of consciousness to realize a state of bliss which is entirely different from all that exists in the Samsara
After these introductory remarks we shall now discuss systematically the relation of original Buddhism and Vedanta
First of all we have to clarify to what extent a knowledge of Upanishadic texts may be assumed for the canonical Pali scriptures
The five old prose Upanishads are on reasons of contents and language generally held to be preBuddhistic
The younger Upanishads in any case those beginning from Maitrayana were certainly written at a time when Buddhism already existed
The number of passages in the Pali canon dealing with Upanishadic doctrines is very small
It is true that early Buddhism shares many doctrines with the Upanishads but these tenets were so widely held in philosophical circles of those times that we can no longer regard the Upanishads are the direct source from which the Buddha has drawn
The special metaphysical concern of the Upanishads the identity of the individual and the universal Atman has been mentioned and rejected only in a few passages in the early Buddhist texts for instance in the saying of the Buddha quoted earlier
Nothing shows better the great distance that separates the Vedanta and the teachings of the Buddha than the fact that the two principal concepts of Upanishadic wisdom Atman and Brahman do not appear anywhere in the Buddhist texts with the clear and distinct meaning of a primordial ground of the world core of existence ens realissimum or similarly
As this holds likewise true for the early Jaina literature one must assume that early Vedanta was of no great importance in Magadha at the time of the Buddha and the Mahavira otherwise the opposition against if would have left more distinct traces in the texts of these two doctrines
It is of decisive importance for examining the relation between Vedanta and Buddhism clearly to establish the meaning of the words atta and anatta in Buddhist literature
The meaning of the word attan divides into two groups in daily usage attan serves for denoting one's own person and has the function of a reflexive pronoun
This usage is for instance illustrated in the th Chapter of the Dhammapada
As a philosophical term attan denotes the individual soul as assumed by the Jainas and other schools but rejected by the Buddhists
This individual soul was held to be an eternal unchangeable spiritual monad perfect and blissful by nature although its qualities may be temporarily obscured through its connection with matter
Starting from this view held by the heretics the Buddhists further understand by the term self any eternal unchangeable individual entity in other words that which Western metaphysics calls a substance something existing through and in itself and not through something else nor existing attached to or inherent in something else In the philosophical usage of the Buddhists attan is therefore any entity of which the heretics wrongly assume that it exists independently of everything else and that it has existence on its own strength
The word anattan is a noun and means notself in the sense of an entity that is not independent
The word anatman is found in its meaning of what is not the Soul also in brahmanical Sanskrit sources
Its frequent use in Buddhism is accounted for by the Buddhist' characteristic preference for negative nouns
Phrases like rupam anatta are therefore to be translated corporeality is a notself or corporeality is not an independent entity
As an adjective the word anattan changes from the consonantal to the adeclension anatta eg Samyutta PTS III p
 anattam rupam anatte sankare na pajanati
The word anatta is therefore to be translated here by not having the nature of a self nonindependent without a self without an substance etc
The passage anattam rupam anatta rupan ti yathabhutam na pajanati has to be rendered With regard to corporeality having not the nature of a self he does not know according to truth 'Corporeality is a notself' The noun attan and the adjective anatta can both be rendered by without a self without an independent essence without a persisting core since the Buddhists themselves do not make any difference in the use of these two grammatical forms
This becomes particularly evident in the case of the word anatta which may be either a singular or a plural noun
In the wellknown phrase sabbe sankhara anicca sabbe dhamma anatta all conditioned factors of existence are transitory all factors existent whatever are without a self it is undoubtedly a plural noun for the Sanskrit version has sarve dharma anatmanah
The fact that the Anatta doctrine only purports to state that a dharma is void of a self is evident from the passage in the Samyutta Nikaya where it is said rupa sunna attena va attaniyenava forms are void of a self and of anything pertaining to a self
Where Guenther has translated anattan or anatta as not the self one should use a self instead of the self because in the Pali canon the word atman does not occur in the sense of universal soul
It is not necessary to assume that the existence of indestructible monads is a necessary condition for a belief in life after death
The view that an eternal immortal persisting soul substance is the conditio sine qua non of rebirth can be refuted by the mere fact that not only in the older Upanishads but also in Pythagoras and Empedocles rebirth is taught without the assumption of an imperishable soul substance
Guenther can substantiate his view only through arbitrary translations which contradict the whole of Buddhist tradition
This is particularly evident in those passages where Guenther asserts that the Buddha meant the same by Nirvana and atman and that Nirvana is the true nature of man For in Udana Nirvana is expressly described as anattam which is rightly rendered by Dhammapala's commentary as attavirahita and in Vinaya V p Nirvana is said to be just as the conditioned factors of existence without a self
Neither can the equation atmannirvana be proved by the wellknown phrase attadipa viharatha dhammadipa for whether dipa here means lamp or island of deliverance this passage can after all only refer to the monks taking refuge in themselves and in the doctrine and attan and dhamma cannot possibly be interpreted as Nirvana
In the same way too it is quite preposterous to translate Dhammapada atta hi attano natho as Nirvana is for a man the leader for the chapter is concerned only with the idea that we should strive hard and purify ourselves
Otherwise Guenther would have to translate in the following verse attana va katam papam attajam attasambhavam By Nirvana evil is done it arises out of Nirvana it has its origin in Nirvana It is obvious that this kind of interpretation must lead to manifestly absurd consequences
As far as I can see there is not a single passage in the Pali canon where the word atta is used in the sense of the Upanishadic Atman
This is not surprising since the word atman current in all Indian philosophical systems has the meaning of universal soul ens realissimum the Absolute exclusively in the panentheistic and theopantistic Vedanta but in that sense it is alien to all other brahmanical and nonBuddhist doctrines
Why then should it have a Vedantic meaning in Buddhism
As far as I know no one has ever conceived the idea of giving to the term atman a Vedantic interpretation in the case of Nyaya Vaisesika classical Sankhya Yoga Mimamsa or Jainism
The fact that in the Pali canon all worldly phenomena are said to be anatta has induced some scholars of the West to look for an Atman in Buddhism
For instance the following great syllogism was formulated by George Grimm What I perceive to arise and to cease and to cause suffering to me on account of that impermanence cannot be my ego
Now I perceive that everything cognizable in me and around me arises and ceases and causes me suffering on account of its impermanence
Therefore nothing cognizable is my ego From that Grimm concludes that there must be an eternal egosubstance that is free from all suffering and above all cognizability
This is a rash conclusion
By teaching that there is nowhere in the world a persisting Atman the Buddha has not asserted that there must be a transcendental Atman
This kind of logic resembles that of a certain Christian sect which worships its masters as Christs on earth and tries to prove the simultaneous existence of several Christs from Mark where it is said False Christs and false prophets shall arise for if there are false Christs there must also be genuine Christs
The denial of an imperishable Atman is common ground for all systems of Hinayana as well as Mahayana and there is therefore no reason for the assumption that Buddhist tradition unanimous on that point has deviated from the original doctrine of the Buddha
If the Buddha contrary to the Buddhist tradition had actually proclaimed a transcendental Atman a reminiscence of it would have been preserved somehow by one of the older sects
It is remarkable that even the Pudgalavadins who assume a kind of individual soul never appeal to texts in which an Atman in this sense is proclaimed
He who advocates such a revolutionary conception of the Buddha's teachings has also the duty to show evidence how such a complete transformation started and grew suddenly or gradually
But non of those who advocate the Attatheory has taken to comply with that demand which is indispensable to a historian
In addition to the aforementioned reasons there are other grounds too which speak against the supposition that the Buddha has identified Atman and Nirvana
It remains quite incomprehensible why the Buddha should have used this expression which is quite unsuitable for Nirvana and would have aroused only wrong associations in his listeners
Though it is true that Nirvana shares with the Vedantic conception of Atman the qualification of eternal peace into which the liberated ones enter forever on the other hand the Atman is in brahmanical opinion something mental and conscious a description which does not hold true for Nirvana
Furthermore Nirvana is not like the Atman the primordial ground or the divine principle of the world nor is it that which preserves order in the world it is also not the substance from which everything evolves nor the core of all material elements
Since the scholarly researches made by Otto Rosenberg Th
Stcherbatsky and the great work of translation done by Louis de la Vallee Poussin Abhidharmakosa there cannot be any doubt about the basic principle of Buddhist philosophy
In the light of these researches all attempts to give to the Atman a place in the Buddhist doctrine appear to be quite antiquated
We know now that all Hinayana and Mahayana schools are based on the anatmadharma theory
This theory explains the world through the causal cooperation of a multitude of transitory factors arising in mutual functional dependence
This theory maintains that the entire process of liberation consists in the tranquilization of these incessantly arising and disappearing factors
For that process of liberation however is required apart from moral restraint and meditative concentration the insight that all conditioned factors of existence are transitory without a permanent independent existence and therefore subject to grief and suffering
The Nirvana which the saint experiences already in this life and which he enters for ever after death is certainly a reality but as it neither arises nor vanishes it is not subject to suffering and is thereby distinguished from all conditioned realities
Nirvana being a dharma is likewise anatta just as the transitory conditioned dharmas of the Samsara which as caused by volitions  are themselves also called samskara
Like them Nirvana is no individual entity which could act independently
For it is the basic idea of the entire system that all dharmas are devoid of Atman and without cogent reasons we cannot assume that the Buddha himself has thought something different from that which since more than two thousand years his followers have considered to be the quintessence of their doctrine

The introductory notes to the last three texts have been supplied by the editor of this series
Sigala was the son of a Buddhist family residing at Rajagaha
His parents were devout followers of the Buddha but the son was indifferent to religion
The pious father and mother could not by any means persuade their son to accompany them to visit the Buddha or his disciples and hear the noble Doctrine
The son thought it practically useless to pay visits to the Sangha as such visits may entail material loss
He was only concerned with material prosperity to him spiritual progress was to no avail
Constantly he would say to his father I will have nothing to do with monks
Paying homage to them would make my back ache and my knees stiff
I should have to sit on the ground and soil and wear out my clothes
And when at the conversations with them after so sitting one gets to know them one has to invite them and give them offerings and so one only loses by it
Finally as the father was about to die he called his son to his deathbed and enquired whether he would at least listen to his parting advice
Most assuredly dear father I shall carry out any order you may be pleased to enjoin on me he replied
Well then dear son after your morning bath worship the six quarters The father asked him to do so hoping that one day or other while the son was so engaged the Buddha or his disciples would see him and make it an occasion to preach an appropriate discourse to him
And since deathbed wishes are to be remembered Sigala carried out his father's wish not however knowing its true significance
Now it was the custom of the Buddha to rise from his sleep at four o'clock and after experiencing Nibbanic Bliss for an hour to pervade the whole world with his boundless thoughts of lovingkindness
It is at this hour that he surveys the world with his great compassion to find out what fellow being he could be of service on that day
One morning Sigala was caught in the net of the Buddha's compassion and with his vision the Buddha seeing that Sigala could be shown a better channel for his acts of worship decided This day will I discourse to Sigala on the layman's Vinaya
That discourse will be of benefit to many folk
There must I go The Buddha thereon came up to him on his way for alms to Rajagaha and seeing him engaged in his worship of the six quarters delivered this great discourse which contains in brief the whole domestic and social duty of the layman
Commenting on this Sutta the Venerable Buddhaghosa says Nothing in the duties of a householder is left unmentioned
This Sutta is called the Vinaya of the householder
Hence in one who practices what he has been taught in it growth is to be looked for not decay And Mrs
Rhys Davids adds The Buddha's doctrine of love and goodwill between man and man is here set forth in a domestic and social ethics with more comprehensive detail than elsewhere
And truly we may say even now of this Vinaya or code of discipline so fundamental are the human interests involved so sane and wide is the wisdom that envisages them that the utterances are as fresh and practically as binding today and here as they were then at Rajagaha
'Happy would have been the village or clan on the banks of the Ganges where the people were full of the kindly spirit of fellowfeeling the noble spirit of justice which breathes through these naive and simple sayings' Not less happy would be the village or the family on the banks of the Thames today of which this could be said
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary near Rajagaha
Now at that time young Sigala a householder's son rising early in the morning departing from Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worshipped with joined hands the various quarters  the East the South the West the North the Nadir and the Zenith
Then the Exalted One having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and robe and entered Rajagaha for alms
Now he saw young Sigala worshipping thus and spoke to him as follows
Wherefore do you young householder rising early in the morning departing from Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these various quarters  the East the South the West the North the Nadir and the Zenith
My father Lord while dying said to me The six quarters dear son you shall worship
And I Lord respecting revering reverencing and honoring my father's word rise early in the morning and leaving Rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these six quarters
It is not thus young householder the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble
How then Lord should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of the noble
It is well Lord if the Exalted One would teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble
Well young householder listen and bear it well in mind I shall speak  Very good Lord responded young Sigala
And the Exalted One spoke as follows
Inasmuch young householder as the noble disciple has eradicated the four vices in conduct inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways inasmuch as he pursues not the six channels for dissipating wealth he thus avoiding these fourteen evil things covers the six quarters and enters the path leading to victory in both worlds he is favored in this world and in the world beyond
Upon the dissolution of the body after death he is born in a happy heavenly realm
What are the four vices in conduct that he has eradicated
The destruction of life householder is a vice and so are stealing sexual misconduct and lying
These are the four vices that he has eradicated
Thus spoke the Exalted One
And when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet again
In which four ways does one commit no evil action
Led by desire does one commit evil
Led by anger does one commit evil
Led by ignorance does one commit evil
Led by fear does one commit evil
But inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire anger ignorance and fear he commits no evil
Thus spoke the Exalted One
And when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet again
What are the six channels for dissipating wealth which he does not pursue
There are young householder these six evil consequences in indulging in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessness
There are young householder these six evil consequences in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours
There are young householder these six evil consequences in frequenting theatrical shows
He is ever thinking
There are young householder these six evil consequences in indulging in gambling
There are young householder these six evil consequences in associating with evil companions namely any gambler any libertine any drunkard any swindler any cheat any rowdy is his friend and companion
There are young householder these six evil consequences in being addicted to idleness
He does no work saying
Living in this way he leaves many duties undone new wealth he does not get and wealth he has acquired dwindles away
Thus spoke the Exalted One
And when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet again
One is a bottle friend one says 'friend friend' only to one's face one is a friend and an associate only when it is advantageous
Sleeping till sunrise adultery irascibility malevolence evil companions avarice  these six causes ruin a man
The man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways to ruin does he fall in both worlds  here and the next
Dice women liquor dancing singing sleeping by day sauntering at unseemly hours evil companions avarice  these nine causes ruin a man
Who plays with dice and drinks intoxicants goes to women who are dear unto others as their own lives associates with the mean and not with elders  he declines just as the moon during the waning half
Who is drunk poor destitute still thirsty whilst drinking frequents the bars sinks in debt as a stone in water swiftly brings disrepute to his family
Who by habit sleeps by day and keeps late hours is ever intoxicated and is licentious is not fit to lead a household life
Who says it is too hot too cold too late and leaves things undone the opportunities for good go past such men
But he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and who does his duties manfully does not fall away from happiness
These four young householder should be understood as foes in the guise of friends
In four ways young householder should one who appropriates be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend
In four ways young householder should one who renders lipservice be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend
In four ways young householder should one who flatters be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend
In four ways young householder should one who brings ruin be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend
Thus spoke the Exalted One
And when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet again
These four young householder should be understood as warmhearted friends
In four ways young householder should a helpmate be understood as a warmhearted friend
In four ways young householder should one who is the same in happiness and sorrow be understood as a warmhearted friend
In four ways young householder should one who gives good counsel be understood as a warmhearted friend
In four ways young householder should one who sympathises be understood as a warmhearted friend
Thus spoke the Exalted One
And when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet again
And how young householder does a noble disciple cover the six quarters
The following should be looked upon as the six quarters
The parents should be looked upon as the East teachers as the South wife and children as the West friends and associates as the North servants and employees as the Nadir ascetics and brahmans as the Zenith
In five ways young householder a child should minister to his parents as the East
In five ways young householder the parents thus ministered to as the East by their children show their compassion
In these five ways do children minister to their parents as the East and the parents show their compassion to their children
Thus is the East covered by them and made safe and secure
In five ways young householder a pupil should minister to a teacher as the South
In five ways young householder do teachers thus ministered to as the South by their pupils show their compassion
The teachers thus ministered to as the South by their pupils show their compassion towards them in these five ways
Thus is the South covered by them and made safe and secure
In five ways young householder should a wife as the West be ministered to by a husband
The wife thus ministered to as the West by her husband shows her compassion to her husband in five ways
In these five ways does the wife show her compassion to her husband who ministers to her as the West
Thus is the West covered by him and made safe and secure
In five ways young householder should a clansman minister to his friends and associates as the North
The friends and associates thus ministered to as the North by a clansman show compassion to him in five ways
The friends and associates thus ministered to as the North by a clansman show their compassion towards him in these five ways
Thus is the North covered by him and made safe and secure
In five ways should a master minister to his servants and employees as the Nadir
The servants and employees thus ministered to as the Nadir by their master show their compassion to him in five ways
The servants and employees thus ministered to as the Nadir show their compassion towards him in these five ways
Thus is the Nadir covered by him and made safe and secure
In five ways young householder should a householder minister to ascetics and brahmans as the Zenith
The ascetics and brahmans thus ministered to as the Zenith by a householder show their compassion towards him in six ways
In these six ways do ascetics and brahmans show their compassion towards a householder who ministers to them as the Zenith
Thus is the Zenith covered by him and made safe and secure Thus spoke the Exalted One
And when the Master had thus spoken he spoke yet again
When the Exalted One had spoken thus Sigala the young householder said as follows
Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if Lord a man were to set upright that which was overturned or were to reveal that which was hidden or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness so that those who have eyes may see
Even so has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted One
I take refuge Lord in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
May the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower as one who has taken refuge from this very day to life's end
This famous text cherished highly in all Buddhist lands is a terse but comprehensive summary of Buddhist ethics individual and social
The thirtyeight blessings enumerated in it are an unfailing guide on life's journey
Rightly starting with avoidance of bad company which is basic to all moral and spiritual progress the Blessings culminate in the achievement of a passionfree mind unshakable in its serenity
To follow the ideals set forth in these verses is the sure way to harmony and progress for the individual as well as for society nation and mankind
The Mahamangala Sutta shows that the Buddha's instructions do not always take negative forms that they are not always a series of classifications and analysis or concerned exclusively with monastic morality
Here in this sutta we find family morality expressed in most elegant verses
We can imagine the happy blissful state household life attained as a result of following these injunctions
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindika's monastery in Jeta's Grove near Savatthi
Now when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted him and stood at one side
Standing thus he addressed the Exalted One in verse
Not to associate with the foolish but to associate with the wise and to honor those who are worthy of honor  this is the greatest blessing
To reside in a suitable locality to have done meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right course  this is the greatest blessing
To have much learning to be skillful in handicraft welltrained in discipline and to be of good speech  this is the greatest blessing
To support mother and father to cherish wife and children and to be engaged in peaceful occupation  this is the greatest blessing
To be generous in giving to be righteous in conduct to help one's relatives and to be blameless in action  this is the greatest blessing
To loathe more evil and abstain from it to refrain from intoxicants and to be steadfast in virtue  this is the greatest blessing
To be respectful humble contented and grateful and to listen to the Dhamma on due occasions  this is the greatest blessing
To be patient and obedient to associate with monks and to have religious discussions on due occasions  this is the greatest blessing
Selfrestraint a holy and chaste life the perception of the Noble Truths and the realisation of Nibbana  this is the greatest blessing
A mind unruffled by the vagaries of fortune from sorrow freed from defilements cleansed from fear liberated  this is the greatest blessing
Those who thus abide ever remain invincible in happiness established
These are the greatest blessings
While the Mangala Sutta deals with the way of life conducive to progress and happiness the Parabhava Sutta supplements it by pointing out the causes of downfall
He who allows himself to become tarnished by these blemishes of conduct blocks his own road to worldly moral and spiritual progress and lowers all that is truly noble and human in man
But he who is heedful of these dangers keeps open the road to all those thirtyeight blessings of which human nature is capable
Thus have I heard
Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindika's monastery in the Jeta Grove near Savatthi
Now when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted Him and stood at one side
Standing thus he addressed the Exalted One in verse
Having come here with our questions to the Exalted One we ask thee O Gotama about man's decline
Pray tell us the cause of downfall
The Buddha
Easily known is the progressive one easily known he who declines
He who loves Dhamma progresses he who is averse to it declines
Thus much do we see this is the first cause of one's downfall
Pray tell us the second cause
The Buddha
The wicked are dear to him with the virtuous he finds no delight he prefers the creed of the wicked  this is a cause of one's downfall
Being fond of sleep fond of company indolent lazy and irritable  this is a cause of one's downfall
Though being welltodo not to support father and mother who are old and past their youth  this is a cause of one's downfall
To deceive by falsehood a brahman or ascetic or any other mendicant  this is a cause of one's downfall
To have much wealth and ample gold and food but to enjoy one's luxuries alone  this is a cause of one's downfall
To be proud of birth of wealth or clan and to despise one's own kinsmen  this is a cause of one's downfall
To be a rake a drunkard a gambler and to squander all one earns  this is a cause of one's downfall
Not to be contented with one's own wife and to be seen with harlots and the wives of others  this is a cause of one's downfall
Being past one's youth to take a young wife and to be unable to sleep for jealousy of her  this is a cause of one's downfall
To place in authority a woman given to drink and squandering or a man of a like behavior  this is a cause of one's downfall
To be of noble birth with vast ambition and of slender means and to crave for rulership  this is a cause of one's downfall
Knowing well these causes of downfall in the world the noble sage endowed with insight shares a happy realm
In this sutta the Buddha instructs rich householders how to preserve and increase their prosperity and how to avoid loss of wealth
Wealth alone however does not make a complete man nor a harmonious society
Possession of wealth all too often multiplies man's desires and he is ever in the pursuit of amassing more wealth and power
This unrestrained craving however leaves him dissatisfied and stifles his inner growth
It creates conflict and disharmony in society through the resentment of the underprivileged who feel themselves exploited by the effects of unrestrained craving
Therefore the Buddha follows up on his advice on material welfare with four essential conditions for spiritual welfare confidence virtue liberality and wisdom
These four will instill in man a sense of higher values
He will then not only pursue his own material concern but also be aware of his duty towards society
To mention only one of the implications a wisely and generously employed liberality will reduce tensions and conflicts in society
Thus the observing of these conditions of material and spiritual welfare will make for an ideal citizen in an ideal society
Thus have I heard
Once the Exalted One was dwelling amongst the Koliyans in their market town named Kakkarapatta
Then Dighajanu a Koliyan approached the Exalted One respectfully saluted Him and sat on one side
Thus seated he addressed the Exalted One as follows
We Lord are laymen who enjoy worldly pleasure
We lead a life encumbered by wife and children
We use sandalwood of Kasi
We deck ourselves with garlands perfume and unguents
We use gold and silver
To those like us O Lord let the Exalted One preach the Dhamma teach those things that lead to weal and happiness in this life and to weal and happiness in future life
Four conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householder's weal and happiness in this very life
Which four
The accomplishment of persistent effort the accomplishment of watchfulness good friendship and balanced livelihood
What is the accomplishment of persistent effort
Herein Vyagghapajja by whatsoever activity a householder earns his living whether by farming by trading by rearing cattle by archery by service under the king or by any other kind of craft  at that he becomes skillful and is not lazy
He is endowed with the power of discernment as to the proper ways and means he is able to carry out and allocate
This is called the accomplishment of persistent effort
What is the accomplishment of watchfulness
Herein Vyagghapajja whatsoever wealth a householder is in possession of obtained by dint of effort collected by strength of arm by the sweat of his brow justly acquired by right means  such he husbands well by guarding and watching so that kings would not seize it thieves would not steal it fire would not burn it water would not carry it away nor illdisposed heirs remove it
This is the accomplishment of watchfulness
What is good friendship
Herein Vyagghapajja in whatsoever village or market town a householder dwells he associates converses engages in discussions with householders or householders' sons whether young and highly cultured or old and highly cultured full of faith full of virtue full of charity full of wisdom
He acts in accordance with the faith of the faithful with the virtue of the virtuous with the charity of the charitable with the wisdom of the wise
This is called good friendship
What is balanced livelihood
Herein Vyagghapajja a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his income
Just as the goldsmith or an apprentice of his knows on holding up a balance that by so much it has dipped down by so much it has tilted up even so a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his income
If Vyagghapajja a householder with little income were to lead an extravagant life there would be those who say  'This person enjoys his property like one who eats woodapple' If Vyagghapajja a householder with a large income were to lead a wretched life there would be those who say  'This person will die like a starveling'
The wealth thus amassed Vyagghapajja has four sources of destruction
 Debauchery drunkenness gambling friendship companionship and intimacy with evildoers
Just as in the case of a great tank with four inlets and outlets if a man should close the inlets and open the outlets and there should be no adequate rainfall decrease of water is to be expected in that tank and not an increase even so there are four sources for the destruction of amassed wealth  debauchery drunkenness gambling and friendship companionship and intimacy with evildoers
There are four sources for the increase of amassed wealth abstinence from debauchery abstinence from drunkenness nonindulgence in gambling friendship companionship and intimacy with the good
Just as in the case of a great tank with four inlets and four outlets if a person were to open the inlets and close the outlets and there should also be adequate rainfall an increase in water is certainly to be expected in that tank and not a decrease even so these four conditions are the sources of increase of amassed wealth
These four conditions Vyagghapajja are conducive to a householder's weal and happiness in this very life
Four conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householder's weal and happiness in his future life
Which four
The accomplishment of faith the accomplishment of virtue the accomplishment of charity and the accomplishment of wisdom
What is the accomplishment of faith
Herein a householder is possessed of faith he believes in the Enlightenment of the Perfect One Thus indeed is that Blessed One he is the pure one fully enlightened endowed with knowledge and conduct wellgone the knower of worlds the incomparable leader of men to be tamed the teacher of gods and men allknowing and blessed
This is called the accomplishment of faith
What is the accomplishment of virtue
Herein a householder abstains from killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and from intoxicants that cause infatuation and heedlessness
This is called the accomplishment of virtue
What is the accomplishment of charity
Herein a householder dwells at home with heart free from the stain of avarice devoted to charity openhanded delighting in generosity attending to the needy delighting in the distribution of alms
This is called the accomplishment of charity
What is the accomplishment of wisdom
Herein a householder is wise he is endowed with wisdom that understands the arising and cessation he is possessed of the noble penetrating insight that leads to the destruction of suffering
This is called the accomplishment of wisdom
These four conditions Vyagghapajja conduce to a householder's weal and happiness in his future life
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Most writings on the doctrine of kamma emphasize the strict lawfulness governing kammic action ensuring a close correspondence between our deeds and their fruits
While this emphasis is perfectly in place there is another side to the working of kamma  a side rarely noted but highly important
This is the modifiability of kamma the fact that the lawfulness which governs kamma does not operate with mechanical rigidity but allows for a considerably wide range of modifications in the ripening of the fruit
If kammic action were always to bear fruits of invariably the same magnitude and if modification or annulment of kammaresult were excluded liberation from the samsaric cycle of suffering would be impossible for an inexhaustible past would ever throw up new obstructive results of unwholesome kamma
Hence the Buddha said
If one says that in whatever way a person performs a kammic action in that very same way he will experience the result  in that case there will be no religious life and no opportunity would appear for the complete ending of suffering
But if one says that a person who performs a kammic action that is variably experienceable will reap its results accordingly  in that case there will be a religious life and an opportunity for making a complete end of suffering
Like any physical event the mental process constituting a kammic action never exists in isolation but in a field and thus its efficacy in producing a result depends not only on its own potential but also upon the variable factors of its field which can modify it in numerous ways
We see for example that a particular kamma either good or bad may sometimes have its result strengthened by supportive kamma weakened by counteractive kamma or even annulled by destructive kamma
The occurrence of the result can also be delayed if the conjunction of outer circumstances required for its ripening is not complete and that delay may again give a chance for counteractive or destructive kamma to operate
It is however not only these extraneous conditions which can cause modification
The ripening also reflects the kamma's internal field or internal conditions  that is the total qualitative structure of the mind from which the action issues
To one rich in moral or spiritual qualities a single offense may not entail the weighty results that the same offence will have for one who is poor in such protective virtues
Also analogously to human law a first offender's punishment will be milder than that of a reconvicted criminal
Of this type of modified reaction the Buddha speaks in the continuation of the discourse quoted above
Now take the case when a minor evil deed has been committed by a certain person and it takes him to hell
But if the same minor offense is committed by another person its result might be experienced during his lifetime and not even the least will appear not to speak about a major
Now what is the kind of person whom a minor offense takes to hell
It is one who has not cultivated the body not cultivated virtue and thought nor has he developed any wisdom he is narrowminded of low character and even for trifling things he suffers
It is such a person whom even a minor offense may take to hell
And what is the person by whom the result of the same small offense will be experienced in his lifetime without the least
He is one who has cultivated the body who has cultivated virtue and thought and who has developed wisdom he is not limited by is a great character and he lives unbounded
It is such a person who experiences the result of the same small offense during his lifetime without the least future residue
Now suppose a man throws a lump of salt into a small cup of water
What do you think monks would that small quantity of water in the cup become salty and undrinkable through that lump of salt  It would Lord  And why so  The water in the cup is so little that a lump of salt can make it salty and undrinkable  But suppose monks that lump of salt is thrown into the river Ganges
Would it make the river Ganges salty and undrinkable  Certainly not Lord  And why not  Great Lord is the mass of water in the Ganges
It will not become salty and undrinkable by a lump of salt
Further O monks suppose a person has to go to jail for a matter of a halfpenny a penny or a hundred pence and another man does not have to go to jail on that account
Now what is the kind of person that has to go to jail for a matter of a halfpenny a penny or a hundred pence
It is one who is poor without means or property
But he who is rich a man of means and property does not have to go to jail for such a matter
Hence we must say that it is an individual's accumulation of good or evil kamma and also his dominating character traits good or evil which affect the kammic result
They determine the greater or lesser weight of the result and may even spell the difference between whether or not it occurs at all
But even this does not exhaust the existing possibilities of modifications in the weight of kammic reaction
A glance into the life histories of people we know may well show us a person of good and blameless character living in secure circumstances yet a single mistake perhaps even a minor one suffices to ruin his entire life  his reputation his career and his happiness  and it may also lead to a serious deterioration of his character
This seemingly disproportionate crisis might have been due to a chainreaction of aggravating circumstances beyond his control to be ascribed to a powerful counteractive kamma of his past
But the chain of bad results may have been precipitated by the person's own action  decisively triggered by his initial mistake and reinforced by subsequent carelessness indecision or wrong decisions which of course are unskillful kamma in themselves
This is a case when even a predominantly good character cannot prevent the ripening of bad kamma or soften the full force of the results
The good qualities and deeds of that person will certainly not remain ineffective but their future outcome might well be weakened by any presently arisen negative character changes or actions which might form a bad counteractive kamma
Consider too the converse situation A person deserving to be called a thoroughly bad character may on a rare occasion act on an impulse of generosity and kindness
This action may turn out to have unexpectedly wide and favorable repercussions on his life
It might bring about a decisive improvement in his external circumstances soften his character and even initiate a thorough change of heart
How complex indeed are situations in human life even when they appear deceptively simple
This is so because the situations and their outcome mirror the still greater complexity of the mind their inexhaustible source
The Buddha himself has said The mind's complexity surpasses even the countless varieties of the animal kingdom For any single individual the mind is a stream of everchanging mental processes driven by the currents and crosscurrents of kamma accumulated in countless past existences
But this complexity already great is increased still very much more by the fact that each individual lifestream is interwoven with many other individual lifestreams through the interaction of their respective kammas
So intricate is the net of kammic conditioning that the Buddha declared kammaresult to be one of the four unthinkables and warned against creating it as a subject of speculation
But though the detailed workings of kamma escape our intellection the practically important message is clear the fact that kammic results are modifiable frees us from the bane of determinism and its ethical corollary fatalism and keeps the road to liberation constantly open before us
The potential openness of a given situation however also has a negative side the element of risk and danger a wrong response to the situation might open a downward path
It is our own response which removes the ambiguity of the situation for better or worse
This reveals the kamma doctrine of the Buddha as a teaching of moral and spiritual responsibility for oneself and others
It is truly a human teaching because it corresponds to and reflects man's wide range of choices a range much wider than that of an animal
Any individual's moral choice may be severely limited by the varying load of greed hatred and delusion and their results which he carries around yet every time he stops to make a decision or a choice he has the opportunity to rise above all the menacing complexities and pressures of his unfathomable kammic past
Indeed in one short moment he can transcend aeons of kammic bondage
It is through right mindfulness that man can firmly grasp that fleeting moment and it is mindfulness again that enables him to use it for making wise choices
Every kammic action as soon as it is performed first of all affects the doer of the deed himself
This holds with as much truth for bodily and verbal deeds directed towards others as it does for volitional thoughts that do not find outward expression
To some extent we can control our own response to our actions but we cannot control the way others respond to them
Their response may turn out to be quite different from what we expect or desire
A good deed of ours might be met with ingratitude a kind word may find a cold or even hostile reception
But though these good deeds and kind words will then be lost to the recipient to his own disadvantage they will not be lost to the doer
The good thoughts that inspired them will ennoble his mind even more so if he responds to the negative reception with forgiveness and forbearance rather than anger and resentment
Again an act or word meant to harm or hurt another may not provoke him to a hostile reaction but only meet with selfpossessed calmness
Then this unaccepted present will fall back to the giver as the Buddha once told a brahmin who had abused him
The bad deed and words and the thoughts motivating them may fail to harm the other but they will not fail to have a damaging effect on the character of the doer and it will affect him even worse if he reacts to the unexpected response by rage or a feeling of resentful frustration
Hence the Buddha says that beings are the responsible owners of their kamma which is their inalienable property
They are the only legitimate heirs of their actions inheriting their legacy of good or bad fruits
It will be a wholesome practice to remind oneself often of the fact that one's deeds words and thoughts first of all act upon and alter one's own mind
Reflecting thus will give a strong impetus to true selfrespect which is preserved by protecting oneself against everything mean and evil
To do so will also open a new practical understanding of a profound saying of the Buddha
In this fathomlong body with its perceptions and thoughts there is the world the origin of the world the ending of the world and the path leading to the ending of the world
 AN
The world of which the Buddha speaks is comprised in this aggregate of bodyandmind
For it is only by the activity of our physical and mental sense faculties that a world can be experienced and known at all
The sights sounds smells tastes and bodily impressions which we perceive and our various mental functions conscious and unconscious  this is the world in which we live
And this world of ours has its origin in that very aggregate of physical and mental processes that produces the kammic act of craving for the six physical and mental sense objects
If Ananda there were no kamma ripening in the sphere of the senses would there appear any sensesphere existence  Surely not Lord
 AN
Thus kamma is the womb from which we spring the true creator of the world and of ourselves as the experiencer of the world
And through our kammic actions in deed word and thought we unceasingly engage in building and rebuilding this world and worlds beyond
Even our good actions as long as they are still under the influence of craving conceit and ignorance contribute to the creation and preservation of this world of suffering
The Wheel of Life is like a treadmill set in perpetual motion by kamma chiefly by its three unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusion
The end of the world cannot be reached by walking on a treadmill this only creates the illusion of progress
It is only by stopping that vain effort that the end can be reached
It is through the elimination of greed hatred and delusion that the concatenation of kamma comes to an end
And this again can happen nowhere else than in the same aggregate of bodyandmind where suffering and its causes originate
It is the hopeful message of the third noble truth that we can step out of the weary round of vain effort and misery
If despite our knowledge of the possibility of release we keep walking on the treadmill of life that is because of an ageold addiction hard to break the deeply rooted habit of clinging to the notions of I mine and self But here again there is the hopeful message in the fourth noble truth with its Noble Eightfold Path the therapy that can cure the addiction and gradually lead us to the final cessation of suffering
And all that is required for the therapy is again found in our own body and mind
The treatment proper starts with correctly understanding the true nature of kamma and thereby our situation in the world
This understanding will provide a strong motivation for ensuring a prevalence of good kamma in one's life
And as it deepens by seeing the human condition still more clearly this same understanding will become the spur for breaking the chains of kammic bondage
It will impel one to strive diligently along the path and to dedicate all one's actions and their fruits to the greatest end of action  the final liberation of oneself and all sentient beings

The Buddha repeatedly discouraged any excessive veneration paid to him personally
He knew that an excess of purely emotional devotion can obstruct or disturb the development of a balanced character and thus may become a serious obstacle to progress on the path to deliverance
The history of religion has since proved him right as illustrated by the extravagancies of emotional mysticism in East and West
The suttas relate the story of the monk Vakkali who full of devotion and love for the Buddha was ever desirous to behold him bodily
To him the Buddha said What shall it profit you to see this impure body
He who sees the Dhamma sees me
Shortly before the Buddha passed away he said If a monk or a nun a devout man or a devout woman lives in accordance with the Dhamma is correct in his life walks in conformity with the Dhamma  it is he who rightly honors reverences venerates holds sacred and reveres the Perfect One with the worthiest homage
A true and deep understanding of the Dhamma together with a conduct that is in conformity with that understanding  these are vastly superior to any external homage or mere emotional devotion
That is the instruction conveyed by these two teachings of the Master
It would be a mistake however to conclude that the Buddha disparaged a reverential and devotional attitude of mind when it is the natural outflow of a true understanding and a deep admiration of what is great and noble
It would also be a grievous error to believe that the seeing of the Dhamma is identical with a mere intellectual appreciation and purely conceptual grasp of the doctrine
Such a onesided abstract approach to the very concrete message of the Buddha all too often leads to intellectual smugness
In its barrenness it will certainly not be a substitute for the strong and enlivening impulse imparted by a deepfelt devotion to what is known as great noble and exemplary
Devotion being a facet and natural accompaniment of confidence is a necessary factor in the balance of faculties required for final deliverance
Confidence in all its aspects including the devotional is needed to resolve any stagnation and other shortcomings resulting from a onesided development of the intellectual faculties
Such development often tends to turn around in circles endlessly without being able to effect a breakthrough
Here devotion confidence and faith  all aspects of the Pali term saddha  may be able to give quick and effective help
Though the Buddha refused to be made the object of an emotional personality cult he also knew that respect and homage paid to those who are worthy of it is a great blessing The Buddha made this statement in the very first stanza of one of his principal ethical injunctions the Discourse on Blessings
Mentioning the value of a respectful reverential attitude together with the blessings avoiding fools and associating with the wise the Buddha obviously regarded such an attitude as fundamental for individual and social progress and for the acquisition of any further higher benefits
One who is incapable of a reverential attitude will also be incapable of spiritual progress beyond the narrow limits of his present mental condition
One who is so blind as not to see or recognize anything higher and better than the little mudpool of his petty self and environment will suffer for a long time from retarded growth
And one who out of a demonstrative selfassertion scorns a reverential attitude in himself and in others will remain imprisoned in his selfconceit  a most formidable bar to a true maturity of character and to spiritual growth
It is by recognizing and honoring someone or something higher that one honors and enhances one's own inner potentialities
Since respect reverence and devotion are partial aspects of the Buddhist concept of confidence one will now understand why confidence has been called the seed of all other beneficial qualities
The nobler the object of reverence or devotion the higher is the blessing bestowed by it
Those who have joyous confidence in the highest the highest fruit will be theirs
The supreme objects of a Buddhist's reverence and devotion are his Three Refuges also called the Three Jewels or Ideals the Buddha his Teaching and the Community of saintly monks and nuns
Here too the Buddha is revered not as a personality of such a name nor as a deity but as the embodiment of Enlightenment
A text often recurring in the Buddhist scriptures says that a devout lay disciple has confidence he believes in the Enlightenment of the Perfect One This confidence however is not the outcome of blind faith based on hearsay but is derived from the devotee's reasoned conviction based on his own understanding of the Buddha Word which speaks to him clearly with a voice of unmistakable Enlightenment
This derivation of his assurance is emphasized by the fact that along with confidence wisdom also is mentioned among the qualities of an ideal lay follower
We may now ask Is it not quite natural that feelings of love gratitude reverence and devotion seek expression through the entire personality through acts of body and speech as well as through our thoughts and unexpressed sentiments
Will one for instance hide one's feelings towards parents and other loved ones
Will one not rather express them by loving words and deeds
Will one not cherish their memory in suitable ways as for instance by preserving their pictures in one's home by placing flowers on their graves by recalling their noble qualities
In such a way one who has become critical of the devotional aspects of religion may seek to understand the outward acts of homage customary in Buddhist lands when with reverential gesture flowers and incense are placed before a Buddha image and devotional texts are recited not as prayers but as meditation
Provided that such practice does not deteriorate into a thoughtless routine a follower of the Dhamma will derive benefit if he takes up some form of a devotional practice adapting it to his personal temperament and to the social customs of his environment
Buddhism however does not in the least impose upon its followers a demand to observe any outward form of devotion or worship
This is entirely left to the choice of individuals whose emotional devotional and intellectual needs are bound to differ greatly
No Buddhist should feel himself forced into an ironcast mould be it of a devotional or a rationalistic shape
As a follower of the middle way he should however also avoid onesided judgment of others and try to appreciate that their individual needs and preferences may differ from his own
More important and of greater general validity than outward forms of devotion is the basic capacity for respect and reverence discussed at the beginning of this essay and also the practice of meditations or contemplations of a devotional character
Many benefits accrue from these and hence it was for good reasons that the Enlightened One strongly and repeatedly recommended the meditative recollection of the Buddha along with other kindred devotional recollections
Here again the reference is to the embodied ideal thus the Buddha as a being freed from all traces of vanity and egotism could venture to recommend to his disciples a meditation on the Buddha
What then are the benefits of such devotional meditations
Their first benefit is mental purification
They have been called by the Buddha efficacious procedures for purifying a defiled mind
When a noble disciple contemplates upon the Enlightened One at that time his mind is not enwrapped in lust nor in hatred nor in delusion
At such a time his mind is rightly directed it has got rid of lust is aloof from it is freed from it
Lust is here a name for the five sense desires
By cultivating this contemplation many beings become purified
If by practicing that devotional meditation one endeavors to live as it were in the Master's presence one will feel ashamed to do speak or think anything unworthy one will shrink back from evil and as a positive reaction one will feel inspired to high endeavor in emulation of the Master's great example
Images and not abstract concepts are the language of the subconscious
If therefore the image of the Enlightened One is often created within one's mind as the embodiment of man perfected it will penetrate deeply into the subconscious and if sufficiently strong will act as an automatic brake against evil impulses
In such a way the subconscious normally so often the hidden enemy in gaining selfmastery may become a powerful ally of such an endeavor
For that purpose of educating the subconscious it will be helpful to use a Buddha image or picture as an aid in visualization
In that way concentration of mind may be attained fairly soon
For evoking and deeply absorbing some features of the Buddha's personality his qualities should be contemplated for instance in the way described in the Visuddhimagga
The recollection of the Buddha being productive of joy is an effective way of invigorating the mind of lifting it up from the states of listlessness tension fatigue and frustration which occur during meditation as well as in ordinary life
The Buddha himself advised If in contemplation of the body bodily agitation including sense desires or mental lassitude or distraction should arise then the meditator should turn his mind to a gladdening elevating subject
And here the teachers of old recommend especially the recollection of the Buddha
When those hindrances to concentration vanish under its influence the meditator will be able to return to his original meditation subject
For a beginner especially attempts at gaining concentration are often frustrated by an uneasy selfconsciousness the meditator as it were squints back upon himself
He becomes disturbingly aware of his body with its little discomforts and of his mind struggling against obstacles which only grow stronger the more he struggles
This may happen when the subject of meditation is one's one physical or mental processes but it may also occur with other subjects
In such a situation it will be profitable to follow the advice given earlier and to turn one's attention from one's own personality to the inspiring visualization of the Buddha and the contemplation of his qualities
The joyful interest thus produced may bring about that selfforgetfulness which is such an important factor for gaining concentration
Joy produces calm calm leads to ease and ease to concentration
Thus devotional meditation can serve as a valuable aid in attaining mental concentration which is the basis of liberating insight
This function of devotional meditation cannot be better described than in the words of the Master
When a noble disciple contemplates upon the Enlightened One at that time his mind is not enwrapped in lust nor in hatred nor in delusion
At such a time his mind is rightly directed towards the Perfect One
And with a rightly directed mind the noble disciple gains enthusiasm for the goal enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains the delight derived from the Dhamma
In him thus delighted joy arises to one who is joyful body and mind become calm calmed in body and mind he feels at ease and if at ease the mind finds concentration
Such a one is called a noble disciple who among humanity gone wrong has attained to what is right who among a humanity beset by troubles dwells free of troubles

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Faith involves not merely a belief in the existence of a thing or in the truth of a creedal formula but also confidence in the power of its object
Religious faith is the belief and confidence in the power of the Supreme Good and Buddhist faith in particular the belief in the incomparable power of the Noble Eightfold Path the confidence in its purifying and liberating efficacy
Among those calling themselves believers or religious people or in our case Buddhists there are still too few who have that kind of genuine faith in the actual power of the Good to transform and elevate the life of the individual and of society to secure them against the resistance of the evil in themselves and in the world outside
Too few dare to entrust themselves to the powerful current of the Good too many secretly believe in spite of a vague sort of faith that the power of the evil in themselves and the world is stronger  too strong to be contended with
Many politicians everywhere in the world seem to believe the same particularly those who call themselves realists obviously implying that only the evil is real They think that of necessity they have to submit to its greater power
If they are not willing to put it to the test it is no wonder that they cannot achieve much good
To be sure in face of the great forces of evil and stupidity this kind of genuine faith in the Good requires a certain amount of courage
But no progress of any kind is possible without courage
Progress means to overcome the natural inertia of present unsatisfactory conditions in the individual and in society
It certainly requires courage to take the first step in breaking through that resistance of the natural inertia and the selfpreserving tendency of things and minds
But just that courage is the preliminary condition of success
The ancient teachers of the Buddhist doctrine were well aware that courage is an essential feature of true faith
They therefore compared faith to a strong and courageous hero who plunges ahead into the turbulent waters of a stream to lead safely across the weaker people who timidly stop at the shore or excitedly and in vain run up and down the bank engaged in useless arguments about the proper place to cross
This simile can be applied to the social as well as to the inner life
In the case of social life the weaker people are those who are willing to follow and support a leader but who cannot make a start by themselves
In the case of the inner life the weaker people are those qualities necessary for spiritual progress which are either undeveloped or isolated from their supplementary virtues
Two factors of inner progress which supplement support and balance each other are intellect and faith
If intellect remains without the confidence devotion and zeal of faith it will stop short at a mere theoretical understanding and intellectual appreciation of teachings meant to be lived and not only thought or talked about
In the words of our simile intellect if not helped by the hero of faith will merely run up and down the bank of the stream an activity with a very busy and important appearance but with few actual results
Intellect separated from faith will lack the firm belief in its own power to be the guide on the path of life
Without this inner conviction it will hesitate to follow in earnest its own conclusions and commands it will lack the courage to make an actual start on the task of crossing over
Faith as a supplementary quality supported by the vigor and endurance of energy will give wings to the intellect enabling it to rise above the barrenness of unapplied knowledge and the futile wordy wars of conceptual thought
In exchange intellect will give to faith discriminative judgment and reliable guidance
It will prevent faith from becoming exhausted from wasting its energies by ineffective emotional effusions and misdirected efforts
Therefore faith and intellect should always be harmonized
With right mindfulness keeping them balanced the two together will prove to be ideal companions able to meet by their combined efforts any dangers and difficulties on the road to liberation

Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics

These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Since my presentation is entitled A Buddhist Response to Contemporary Dilemmas of Human Existence I should begin by spelling out what I mean by the expression contemporary dilemmas of human existence By this phrase I do not refer explicitly to the momentous social and political problems of our time  global poverty ethnic hostility overpopulation the spread of AIDS the suppression of human rights environmental despoliation etc
I recognize fully well that these problems are of major concern to contemporary religion which has the solemn responsibility of serving as the voice of conscience to the world which is only too prone to forsake all sense of conscience in blind pursuit of selfinterest
However I see many of these particular problems as symptoms or offshoots of a more fundamental dilemma which is essentially spiritual in nature and it is this I am particularly concerned to address
Our root problem it seems to me is at its core a problem of consciousness
I would characterize this problem briefly as a fundamental existential dislocation a dislocation having both cognitive and ethical dimensions
That is it involves both a disorientation in our understanding of reality and a distortion or inversion of the proper scale of values the scale that would follow from a correct understanding of reality
Because our root problem is one of consciousness this means that any viable solution must be framed in terms of a transformation of consciousness
It requires an attempt to arrive at a more accurate grasp of the human situation in its full depth and breadth and a turning of the mind and heart in a new direction a direction commensurate with the new understanding one that brings light and peace rather than strife and distress
Before I discuss some of the responses that religion might make to the outstanding dilemmas of our age I propose to offer a critique of the existential dislocation that has spread among such significant portion of humankind today
Through most of this century the religious point of view has been defensive
It may now be the time to take the offensive by scrutinizing closely the dominant modes of thought that lie at the base of our spiritual malaise
I see the problem of existential dislocation to be integrally tied to the ascendancy world wide of a type of mentality that originates in the West but which today has become typical of human civilization as a whole
It would be too simple to describe this frame of mind as materialism first because those who adopt it do not invariably subscribe to materialism as a philosophical thesis and second because obsession with material progress is not the defining characteristic of this outlook but a secondary manifestation
If I were to coin a single a single expression to convey its distinctive essence I would call it the radical secularization of human life
The underlying historical cause of this phenomenon seems to lie in an unbalanced development of the human mind in the West beginning around the time of the European Renaissance
This development gave increasing importance to the rational manipulative and dominative capacities of the mind at the expense of its intuitive comprehensive sympathetic and integrative capacities
The rise to dominance of the rational manipulative facets of human consciousness led to a fixation upon those aspects of the world that are amenable to control by this type of consciousness  the world that could be conquered comprehended and exploited in terms of fixed quantitative units
This fixation did not stop merely with the pragmatic efficiency of such a point of view but became converted into a theoretical standpoint a standpoint claiming validity
In effect this means that the material world as defined by modern science became the founding stratum of reality while mechanistic physics its methodological counterpart became a paradigm for understanding all other types of natural phenomena biological psychological and social
The early founders of the Scientific Revolution in the seventeenth century  such as Galileo Boyle Descartes and Newton  were deeply religious men for whom the belief in the wise and benign Creator was the premise behind their investigations into lawfulness of nature
However while they remained loyal to the theistic premises of Christian faith the drift of their thought severely attenuated the organic connection between the divine and the natural order a connection so central to the premodern world view
They retained God only as the remote Creator and lawgiver of Nature and sanctioned moral values as the expression of the Divine Will the laws decreed for man by his Maker
In their thought a sharp dualism emerged between the transcendent sphere and the empirical world
The realm of hard facts ultimately consisted of units of senseless matter governed by mechanical laws while ethics values and ideals were removed from the realm of facts and assigned to the sphere of an interior subjectivity
It was only a matter of time until in the trail of the socalled Enlightenment a wave of thinkers appeared who overturned the dualistic thesis central to this world view in favor of the straightforward materialism
This development was not a following through of the reductionistic methodology to its final logical consequences
Once sense perception was hailed as the key to knowledge and quantification came to be regarded as the criterion of actuality the logical next step was to suspend entirely the belief in a supernatural order and all it implied
Hence finally an uncompromising version of mechanistic materialism prevailed whose axioms became the pillars of the new world view
Matter is now the only ultimate reality and divine principle of any sort dismissed as sheer imagination
The triumph of materialism in the sphere of cosmology and metaphysics had the profoundest impact on human selfunderstanding
The message it conveyed was that the inward dimensions of our existence with its vast profusion of spiritual and ethical concerns is mere adventitious superstructure
The inward is reducible to the external the invisible to the visible the personal to the impersonal
Mind becomes a higher order function of the brain the individual a node in a social order governed by statistical laws
All humankind's ideals and values are relegated to the status of illusions they are projections of biological drives sublimated wishfulfillment
Even ethics the philosophy of moral conduct comes to be explained away as a flowery way of expressing personal preferences
Its claim to any objective foundation is untenable and all ethical judgments become equally valid
The ascendancy of relativism is complete
I have sketched the intellectual background to our existential dislocation in a fair degree of detail because I think that any attempt to comprehend the contemporary dilemmas of human existence in isolation from this powerful cognitive underpinning would be incomplete and unsatisfactory
The cognitive should not be equated with the merely theoretical abstract and ineffectual
For the cognitive can in subtle ways that defy easy analysis exercise a tremendous influence upon the affective and practical dimensions of our lives doing so behind the back as it were of our outwardly directed consciousness
Thus once the world view which extols the primacy of the external dimension of reality over the internal gained widespread acceptance on the cognitive front it infiltrated the entire culture entailing consequences that are intensely practical and personal
Perhaps the most characteristic of these might be summed up in the phrase I used at the outset of this paper the radical secularization of life
The dominance of materialism in science and philosophical thought penetrated into the religious sphere and sapped religious beliefs and values of their binding claims on the individual in public affairs
These beliefs and values were relegated to the private sphere as matters of purely personal conscience while those spheres of life that transcend the narrowly personal were divested of religious significance
Thus in an early stage the evolution of modern society replicated the dualism of philosophical theory the external sphere becomes entirely secular while ethical value and spirituality are confined to the internal
In certain respects this was without doubt a major step in the direction of human liberation for it freed individuals to follow the dictates of personal conscience and reduced considerably the pressures placed upon them to conform to the prevailing system of religious beliefs
But while this advantage cannot be underestimated the triumph of secularism in the domain of public life eventually came to throw into question the cogency of any form of religious belief or commitment to a transcendent guarantor of ethical values and this left the door open for widespread moral deterioration often in the name of personal freedom
While a dualistic division of the social order characterized the early phase of the modern period as in the case of philosophy dualism does not have the last word
For the process of secularization does not respect even the boundaries of the private and personal
Once a secular agenda engulfs the social order the entire focus of human life shifts from the inward to the outward and from the Eternal to the Here and Now
Secularization invades the most sensitively private arenas of our lives spurred on by a social order driven by the urge for power profits and uniformity
Our lives become devoured by temporal mundane preoccupations even to the extent that such notions as redemption enlightenment and deliverance  the watchwords of spirituality  at best serve as evokers of a sentimental piety
The dominant ends of secular society create a situation in which any boundary line of inward privacy comes to be treated as a barrier that must be surmounted
Hence we find that commercial interests and political organizations are prepared to explore and exploit the most personal frontiers of desire and fantasy in order to secure their advantage and enhance their wealth and power
The ascendancy of secularization in human life in no way means that most people in secular society openly reject religion and acknowledge the finality of thisworldly aims
Far from it
The human mind displays an astounding ability to operate simultaneously on different levels even when those levels are sustained by opposing principles
Thus in a given culture the vast majority will still pay homage to God or to the Dhamma they will attend church or the temple they will express admiration of religious ideals they will conform to the routine observances expected of them by their ancestral faith
Appeals to religious sentiment will be a powerful means of stirring up waves of emotion and declarations of loyalty even of mobilizing whole sections of the population in support of sectarian stands on volatile issues
This affirmation of allegiance to religious ideals is not done out of sheer hypocrisy but from a capacity for inward ambivalence that allows us to live in a state of selfcontradiction
People in secular society will genuinely profess reverence for religion will vigorously affirm religious beliefs
But their real interests lie elsewhere riveted tightly to the temporal
The ruling motives of human life are no longer purification but production no longer the cultivation of character but the consumption of commodities and the enjoyment of sense pleasures
Religion may be permitted to linger at the margins of the mind indeed may even be invited into the inward chamber so long as it does not rudely demand of us that we take up any crosses
This existential dislocation has major repercussions on a variety of fronts
Most alarming in its immediate impact on our lives is the decline in the efficacy of timehonored moral principles as guides to conduct
I do not propose painting our picture of the past in rosy colors
Human nature has never been especially sweet and the books of history speak too loudly of man's greed blindness and brutality
Often I must sadly add organized religion has been among the worst offenders
However while aware of this I would also say that at least during certain past epochs our ancestors esteemed ethical ideals as worthy of emulation and sanctioned moral codes as the proper guidelines of life
For all its historical shortcomings religion did provide countless people in any given culture with a sense of meaning to their existence a sense that their lives were rooted in the Ultimate Reality and were directed towards that Reality as their final goal
Now however that we have made the radical turn away from the Transcendent we have lost the polestar that guided our daily choices and decisions
The result is evident in the moral degeneration that proliferates at a frightening rate through every socalled civilized part of the world
In the selfstyled Developed World the cities have become urban jungles the use of liquor and drugs spreads as an easy escape route from anxiety and despair sexually provocative entertainment takes on more and more degrading forms the culture of the gun hooks even middleclass youths itching to break the tedium of their lives with murder and mayhem
Most lamentably the family has lost its crucial function of serving as the training ground where children learn decency and personal responsibility
Instead it has become merely a convenient and fragile arrangement for the personal gratification of its members who too often seek their gratification at the expense of each other
While such trends have not yet widely inundated Sri Lanka we can already see their germs beginning to sprout and as modernization spreads extraordinary vigilance will be required to withstand them
As humanity moves ever closer to the st century the existential rift at the heart of our inner life remains
Its pain is exacerbated by our repeated failures to solve so many of the social political and economic problems that seem on the surface as though they should be easily manageable by our sophisticated technological capabilities
The stubborn persistence of these problems  and the constant emergence of new problems as soon as the old ones recede  seems to make a mockery of all our wellintentioned attempts to establish a utopian paradise on utterly secular premises
I certainly do not think that the rediscovery of the religious consciousness is in itself a sufficient remedy for these problems which spring from a wide multiplicity of causes far too complex to be reduced to any simplistic explanation
But I do believe that the religious crisis of modern humanity is intimately connected to these diverse social and political tragedies at many levels
Some of these levels I would add lie far beyond the range of rational comprehension and defy analysis in terms of linear causality
I would see the connection as that of coarisen manifestations of a corrosive sickness in the human soul  the sickness of selfishness and craving  or as karmic backlashes of the three root defilements pinpointed by Buddhism  greed hatred and delusion  which have become so rampant today
I therefore think that any hopes we may cherish towards healing our community our planet and our world must involve us in a deep level process of healing ourselves
And since this healing in my view can only be successfully accomplished by reorienting our lives towards the Ultimate Reality and Supreme Good the process of healing necessarily takes on a religious dimension
It is hardly within my capacity as a very limited individual to delineate in this paper all the elements that would be required to restore the religious dimension to its proper role in human life
But I will first briefly mention two religious approaches that have sprung up in response to our existential dislocation but which I consider to be inadequate even false bypaths
Then I will sketch in a tentative and exploratory manner several responses religion must make if it is to answer the deep yearnings that stir in the hearts of presentday humanity
The two religious phenomena that in my view are false detours which must finally be rejected are fundamentalism and spiritual eclecticism
Both have arisen as reactions to the pervasive secularism of our time both speak to the widespread hunger for more authentic spiritual values than our commercial sensualist culture can offer
Yet neither I would argue provides a satisfactory solution to our needs
Fundamentalism no doubt bears the character of a religious revival
However in my opinion it fails to qualify as a genuinely spiritual type of religiosity because it does not meet the criterion of true spirituality
This criterion I would describe in broad terms as the quest to transcend the limitations of the egoconsciousness
As I understand fundamentalism it draws its strength from its appeal to human weakness by provoking the egoconsciousness and the narrow volatile interests of the small self
Its psychological mood is that of dogmatism it polarizes the human community into the opposed camps of insiders and outsiders it dictates a policy of aggression that entails either violence against the outsiders or attempts to proselytize them
It does not point us in the direction of selflessness understanding acceptance of others based on love the ingredients of true spirituality
Spiritual eclecticism  omnipresent in the West today  is governed by the opposite logic
It aims to amalgamate to draw into a whole a sundry variety of quasireligious disciplines yoga spiritualism channeling astrology faith healing meditation I Ching special diets Cabbala etc
These are all offered to the seeker on a pickandchoose basis everything is valid anything goes
This eclecticism often reveals a longing for genuine spiritual experience for a vision of reality more encompassing than pragmatic materialism
It fails because it tears profound disciplines out from their context in a living faith and blends them together into a shapeless mixture without spine or substance
Its psychological mood is that of a romantic promiscuous yearning for easy gratification rather than that of serious commitment
Owing to its lack of discrimination it often shades off into the narcissistic and the occult occasionally into the diabolical
I believe that a viable solution to humanity's spiritual hunger can arise only from within the fold of the great classical religious traditions
I must also state frankly that I am convinced that the religious tradition that best addresses the crucial existential problems of our time is Buddhism especially in its early form based on the Pali canon
However to speak in terms of a more general application I would maintain that if any great religion is to acquire a new relevance it must negotiate some very delicate very difficult balances
It must strike a happy balance between remaining faithful to the seminal insights of its Founder and ancient masters and acquiring the skill and flexibility to formulate these insights in ways that directly link up with the pressing existential demands of oldage
It is only too easy to veer towards one of these extremes at the expense of the other either to adhere tenaciously to ancient formulas at the expense of present relevance or to bend fundamental principles so freely that one drains them of their deep spiritual vitality
The middle way which fuses fidelity to tradition and relevance to contemporary concerns is always the most difficult
Above all I think any religion today must bear in mind an important lesson impressed on us so painfully by past history the task of religion is to liberate not to enslave
Its purpose should be to enable its adherents to move towards the realization of the Ultimate Good and to bring the power of this realization to bear upon life in the world
The purpose is not to subordinate the individual to the institution to multiply the numbers of the faithful and to sacrifice the individual conscience upon the altar of the Establishment
Despite the vast differences between the belief systems of the major religions I think there are vitally important areas of common concern which unite them in this Age of Confusion
With the world torn between senseless violence and vulgar frivolity it is critically necessary that representatives of the great religions meet to exchange insights and to seek to understand each other more deeply
Cooperation between the great religions is certainly necessary if they are to contribute a meaningful voice towards the solution of the momentous spiritual dilemmas that confront us
Here I will mention several challenges that confront the major religious traditions today and I will also sketch very briefly the ways such challenges may be met from within the horizons of the religion which I follow Theravada Buddhism
I leave it to the Christian scholars involved in this dialogue to decide for themselves whether these points are of sufficient gravity to merit their own attention and to work out solutions from the perspective of their own faith
The first challenge I will discuss is primarily philosophical in scope though with profound and farreaching practical implications
This is the task of overcoming the fundamental dichotomy which scientific materialism has posited between the realm of real fact ie impersonal physical processes and the realm of value
By assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity the materialistic world view as I mentioned earlier threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for morality
The result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness today
To counter this tendency I do not think mere moral exhortation is sufficient
If morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct it cannot be propounded as a selfjustifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal order
Religion must affirm in the clearest terms that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion not subjective superstructure but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of reality
In the Buddha's teaching the objective foundation for morality is the law of kamma and its corollary the teaching of rebirth
According to the principle of kamma our intentional actions have a builtin potential for generating consequences for ourselves that correspond to the moral quality of the deeds
Our deeds come to fruition sometimes in this life sometimes in future lives but in either case an inescapable impersonal law connects our actions to their fruits which rebound upon us exactly in the way we deserve
Thus our morally determinate actions are the building blocks of our destiny we must ultimately reap the fruits of our own deeds and by our moral choices and values we construct our happiness and suffering in this life and in future lives
In the Buddha's teaching the law of kamma is integral to the very dynamics of the universe
The Buddhist texts speak of five systems of cosmic law each perfectly valid within its own domain the laws of inorganic matter the laws of living organisms the laws of consciousness the laws of kamma or moral deeds and their fruits and the laws of spiritual development
The science that dominates the West has flourished through its exclusive attention to the first two systems of law
As a Buddhist I would argue that a complete picture of actuality must take account of all five orders and that by arriving at such a complete picture we can restore moral and spiritual values to their proper place within the whole
A second challenge closely related to the first is to propose concrete guidelines to right conduct capable of lifting us from our morass of moral confusion
While the first project I mentioned operates on the theoretical front this one is more immediately practical in scope
Here we are not so much concerned with establishing a valid foundation for morality as with determining exactly what guidelines to conduct are capable of promoting harmonious and peaceful relations between people
On this front I think that the unsurpassed guide to the ethical good is still the Five Precepts taught by Buddhism
According to the Buddhist texts these precepts are not unique to the Buddha Sasana but constitute the universal principles of morality upheld in every culture dedicated to virtue
The Five Precepts can be considered in terms of both the actions they prohibit and the virtues they inculcate
At the present time I think it is necessary to place equal stress on both aspects of the precepts as the Buddha himself has done in the Suttas
These precepts are
The rule to abstain from stealing which implies honesty respect for the possessions of others and concern for the natural environment
The rule to abstain from sexual misconduct which implies responsibility and commitment in one's marital and other interpersonal relationships
The rule to abstain from lying which implies a commitment to truth in dealing with others
The rule to abstain from alcoholic drinks drugs and intoxicants which implies the virtues of sobriety and heedfulness
In presenting the case for these precepts it should be shown that quite apart from their longterm karmic effect which is a matter of faith they conduce to peace and happiness for oneself right here and now as well as towards the welfare of those whom one's actions affect
A third project for religion is to formulate on the basis of its fundamental doctrinal traditions an incisive diagnosis of the contemporary human condition
From the Buddhist perspective I think the analysis that the Buddha offered in his Four Noble Truths still remains perfectly valid
Not only does it need not the least revision or reinterpretation but the course of twentyfive centuries of world history and the presentday human situation only underscores its astuteness and relevance
The core problem of human existence the First Truth announces is suffering
The canonical texts enumerate different types of suffering  physical psychological and spiritual in the present age we should also highlight the enormous volume of social suffering that plagues vulnerable humanity
The cause of suffering according to the Second Truth lies nowhere else than in our own minds  in our craving and ignorance in the defilements of greed hatred and delusion
The solution to the problem is the subject of the Third Noble Truth which states that liberation from suffering must also be effected by the mind through the eradication of the defilements responsible for suffering
And the Fourth Truth gives us the method to eradicate the defilements the Noble Eightfold Path with its three stages of training in moral discipline meditation and wisdom
The next point is a practical extension of the third
Once a religion has offered us a diagnosis of the human condition which reveals the source of suffering in the mind it must offer us concrete guidance in the task of training and mastering the mind
Thus I think that a major focus of presentday religion must be the understanding and transformation of the mind
This requires experiential disciplines by which we can arrive at deeper insight into ourselves and gradually effect very fundamental inward changes
Buddhism provides a vast arsenal of timetested teachings and methods for meeting this challenge
It contains comprehensive systems of psychological analysis and potent techniques of meditation that can generate experiential confirmation of its principles
In the present age access to these teachings and practices will cease to remain the exclusive preserve of the monastic order but will spread to the lay community as well as has already been occurring throughout the Buddhist world both in the East and in the West
The spirit of democracy and the triumph of the experimental method demand that the means of minddevelopment be available to anyone who is willing to make the effort
The experiential dimension of religion is an area where Christianity can learn a great deal from Buddhism and I believe that Christianity must rediscover its own contemplative heritage and make available deeper transformative disciplines to both its clergy and its lay followers if it is to retain its relevance to humanity in the future
The last challenge I will discuss is the need for religions to reaffirm and to actively demonstrate those values that are particularly critical for the human race to attain the status of an integrative harmonious community
They must translate into concrete programs of action the great virtues of love and compassion
Because the world has become more closely knit than ever before we have to recognize the enormous responsibility that we each bear for the welfare of the whole
What all religions need to stress in the face of so much cruelty and violence is the development of a sense of global responsibility a concern for the welfare and happiness of all living beings as well as for the protection of our natural environment
Love and compassion must issue forth in active endeavor to alleviate the sufferings of others and to ensure that the oppressed and afflicted are granted all the opportunities that have hitherto been denied them
This is an area where Christianity with its Social Gospel has shown far greater initiative than Buddhism which too often has subscribed to a false fatalistic interpretation of the karma doctrine that stifles social action
But the foundation for a socially oriented expression of Buddhism is already found in the Dhamma especially in its formula of the four Brahma Viharas or Divine Abodes as the ideal social virtues loving kindness towards all beings compassion for those who suffer altruistic joy for those who are well and equanimity as freedom from arbitrary discrimination
Already a socially engaged form of Buddhism has emerged and no doubt it will become an important development in the future of the religion
I wish to conclude this talk by drawing attention to the fact that religion today has two crucial tasks to accomplish in responding to the vital problems of our time
One is to help the individual fathom the ultimate truth about his or her own personal existence to move in the direction of the Ultimate Good the Unconditioned Reality wherein true liberation is to be found
The other task is to address the problem of the Manifest Good the problem of the human community of promoting peace harmony and fellowship
The urgency of combining these two tasks was beautifully summed up by the Buddha in a short discourse in the Satipatthana Samyutta
There the Blessed One said
He then explains that the expression protecting oneself one protects others refers to the practice of meditation which purifies the mind of its defilements and gives insight into the real nature of the world
By protecting others one protects oneself he means the development of the virtues of patience loving kindness and compassion by which one safeguards others from harm and suffering
I believe that a commitment to these two great principles  pañña and karuna in Buddhist terms gnosis and love in Christian terms  is essential if religion today is to guide humanity from the brink of darkness and despair to the realm of spiritual light and freedom
Quite contradictory views have been expressed in Western literature on the attitude of Buddhism toward the concept of God and gods
From a study of the discourses of the Buddha preserved in the Pali canon it will be seen that the idea of a personal deity a creator god conceived to be eternal and omnipotent is incompatible with the Buddha's teachings
On the other hand conceptions of an impersonal godhead of any description such as worldsoul etc are excluded by the Buddha's teachings on Anatta nonself or unsubstantiality
In Buddhist literature the belief in a creator god is frequently mentioned and rejected along with other causes wrongly adduced to explain the origin of the world as for instance worldsoul time nature etc
Godbelief however is placed in the same category as those morally destructive wrong views which deny the kammic results of action assume a fortuitous origin of man and nature or teach absolute determinism
These views are said to be altogether pernicious having definite bad results due to their effect on ethical conduct
Theism however is regarded as a kind of kammateaching in so far as it upholds the moral efficacy of actions
Hence a theist who leads a moral life may like anyone else doing so expect a favorable rebirth
He may possibly even be reborn in a heavenly world that resembles his own conception of it though it will not be of eternal duration as he may have expected
If however fanaticism induces him to persecute those who do not share his beliefs this will have grave consequences for his future destiny
For fanatical attitudes intolerance and violence against others create unwholesome kamma leading to moral degeneration and to an unhappy rebirth
Although belief in God does not exclude a favorable rebirth it is a variety of eternalism a false affirmation of permanence rooted in the craving for existence and as such an obstacle to final deliverance
Among the fetters that bind to existence theism is particularly subject to those of personalitybelief attachment to rites and rituals and desire for finematerial existence or for a heaven of the sense sphere as the case may be
As an attempt at explaining the universe its origin and man's situation in his world the Godidea was found entirely unconvincing by the Buddhist thinkers of old
Through the centuries Buddhist philosophers have formulated detailed arguments refuting the doctrine of a creator god
It should be of interest to compare these with the ways in which Western philosophers have refuted the theological proofs of the existence of God
But for an earnest believer the Godidea is more than a mere device for explaining external facts like the origin of the world
For him it is an object of faith that can bestow a strong feeling of certainty not only as to God's existence somewhere out there but as to God's consoling presence and closeness to himself
This feeling of certainty requires close scrutiny
Such scrutiny will reveal that in most cases the Godidea is only the devotee's projection of his ideal  generally a noble one  and of his fervent wish and deeply felt need to believe
These projections are largely conditioned by external influences such as childhood impressions education tradition and social environment
Charged with a strong emotional emphasis brought to life by man's powerful capacity for imageformation visualization and the creation of myth they then come to be identified with the images and concepts of whatever religion the devotee follows
In the case of many of the most sincere believers a searching analysis would show that their Godexperience has no more specific content than this
Yet the range and significance of Godbelief and Godexperience are not fully exhausted by the preceding remarks
The lives and writings of the mystics of all great religions bear witness to religious experiences of great intensity in which considerable changes are effected in the quality of consciousness
Profound absorption in prayer or meditation can bring about a deepening and widening a brightening and intensifying of consciousness accompanied by a transporting feeling of rapture and bliss
The contrast between these states and normal conscious awareness is so great that the mystic believes his experience to be manifestations of the divine and given the contrast this assumption is quite understandable
Mystical experiences are also characterized by a marked reduction or temporary exclusion of the multiplicity of senseperceptions and restless thoughts and this relative unification of mind is then interpreted as a union or communion with the One God
All these deeply moving impressions and the first spontaneous interpretations the mystic subsequently identifies with his particular theology
It is interesting to note however that the attempts of most great Western mystics to relate their mystical experiences to the official dogmas of their respective churches often resulted in teachings which were often looked upon askance by the orthodox if not considered downright heretical
The psychological facts underlying those religious experiences are accepted by the Buddhist and wellknown to him but he carefully distinguishes the experiences themselves from the theological interpretations imposed upon them
After rising from deep meditative absorption the Buddhist meditator is advised to view the physical and mental factors constituting his experience in the light of the three characteristics of all conditioned existence impermanency liability to suffering and absence of an abiding ego or eternal substance
This is done primarily in order to utilize the meditative purity and strength of consciousness for the highest purpose liberating insight
But this procedure also has a very important sideeffect which concerns us here the meditator will not be overwhelmed by any uncontrolled emotions and thoughts evoked by his singular experience and will thus be able to avoid interpretations of that experience not warranted by the facts
Hence a Buddhist meditator while benefiting by the refinement of consciousness he has achieved will be able to see these meditative experiences for what they are and he will further know that they are without any abiding substance that could be attributed to a deity manifesting itself to the mind
Therefore the Buddhist's conclusion must be that the highest mystic states do not provide evidence for the existence of a personal God or an impersonal godhead
Buddhism has sometimes been called an atheistic teaching either in an approving sense by freethinkers and rationalists or in a derogatory sense by people of theistic persuasion
Only in one way can Buddhism be described as atheistic namely in so far as it denies the existence of an eternal omnipotent God or godhead who is the creator and ordainer of the world
The word atheism however like the word godless frequently carries a number of disparaging overtones or implications which in no way apply to the Buddha's teaching
Those who use the word atheism often associate it with a materialistic doctrine that knows nothing higher than this world of the senses and the slight happiness it can bestow
Buddhism is nothing of that sort
In this respect it agrees with the teachings of other religions that true lasting happiness cannot be found in this world nor the Buddha adds can it be found on any higher plane of existence conceived as a heavenly or divine world since all planes of existence are impermanent and thus incapable of giving lasting bliss
The spiritual values advocated by Buddhism are directed not towards a new life in some higher world but towards a state utterly transcending the world namely Nibbana
In making this statement however we must point out that Buddhist spiritual values do not draw an absolute separation between the beyond and the here and now
They have firm roots in the world itself for they aim at the highest realization in this present existence
Along with such spiritual aspirations Buddhism encourages earnest endeavor to make this world a better place to live in
The materialistic philosophy of annihilationism is emphatically rejected by the Buddha as a false doctrine
The doctrine of kamma is sufficient to prove that Buddhism does not teach annihilation after death
It accepts survival not of an eternal soul but of a mental process subject to renewed becoming thus it teaches rebirth without transmigration
Again the Buddha's teaching is not a nihilism that gives suffering humanity no better hope than a final cold nothingness
On the contrary it is a teaching of salvation or deliverance which attributes to man the faculty to realize by his own efforts the highest goal Nibbana the ultimate cessation of suffering and the final eradication of greed hatred and delusion
Nibbana is far from being the blank zero of annihilation yet it also cannot be identified with any form of Godidea as it is neither the origin nor the immanent ground or essence of the world
Buddhism is not an enemy of religion as atheism is believed to be
Buddhism indeed is the enemy of none
A Buddhist will recognize and appreciate whatever ethical spiritual and cultural values have been created by Godbelief in its long and checkered history
We cannot however close our eyes to the fact that the Godconcept has served too often as a cloak for man's will to power and the reckless and cruel use of that power thus adding considerably to the ample measure of misery in this world supposed to be an allloving God's creation
For centuries free thought free research and the expression of dissident views were obstructed and stifled in the name of service to God
And alas these and other negative consequences are not yet entirely things of the past
The word atheism also carries the innuendo of an attitude countenancing moral laxity or a belief that manmade ethics having no divine sanction rest on shaky foundations
For Buddhism however the basic moral law is inherent in life itself
It is a special case of the law of cause and effect needing neither a divine lawgiver nor depending upon the fluctuating human conceptions of socially conditioned minor moralities and conventions
For an increasing section of humanity the belief in God is breaking down rapidly as well as the accustomed motivations for moral conduct
This shows the risk of basing moral postulates on divine commandments when their alleged source rapidly loses credence and authority
There is a need for an autonomous foundation for ethics one that has deeper roots than a social contract and is capable of protecting the security of the individual and of human institutions
Buddhism offers such a foundation for ethics
Buddhism does not deny that there are in the universe planes of existence and levels of consciousness which in some ways may be superior to our terrestrial world and to average human consciousness
To deny this would indeed be provincial in this age of space travel
Bertrand Russell rightly says It is improbable that the universe contains nothing better than ourselves
Yet according to Buddhist teachings such higher planes of existence like our familiar world are subject to the law of impermanence and change
The inhabitants of such worlds may well be in different degrees more powerful than human beings happier and longerlived
Whether we call those superior beings gods deities devas or angels is of little importance since it is improbable that they call themselves by any of those names
They are inhabitants of this universe fellowwanderers in this round of existence and though more powerful they need not be wiser than man
Further it need not be denied that such worlds and such beings may have their lord and ruler
In all probability they do
But like any human ruler a divine ruler too might be inclined to misjudge his own status and power until a greater one comes along and points out to him his error as our texts report of the Buddha
These however are largely matters beyond the range and concern of average human experience
They have been mentioned here chiefly for the purpose of defining the Buddhist position and not to serve as a topic of speculation and argument
Such involvement can only divert attention and effort from what ought to be our principal object the overcoming of greed hatred and delusion where they are found in the here and now
An ancient verse ascribed to the Buddha in the Questions of King Milinda says
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
To present to the reading public a treatise on Buddhist meditation needs no word of apology today
In wide circles of the West Buddhist meditation is no longer regarded as a matter of purely academic or exotic interest
Under the stress and complexity of modern life the need for mental and spiritual regeneration is now widely felt and in the field of the mind's methodical development the value of Buddhist meditation has been recognized and tested by many
It is in particular the Buddha's Way of Mindfulness that has been found invaluable because it is adaptable to and beneficial in widely different conditions of life
The present treatise is based on this method of cultivating mindfulness and awareness which ultimately aims at the mind's final liberation from greed hatred and delusion
The author of this treatise the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw is a Buddhist monk of contemporary Burma and an eminent meditation master
A brief sketch of his life is included in this volume
The path of meditation described in these pages was and still is taught by him in his meditation center called Thathana Yeiktha in Rangoon and is also set forth in his lectures and books in the Burmese language
The framework of the treatise is provided by the classical seven stages of purification just as in Acariya Buddhaghosa's famous Visuddhimagga
On gradually reaching these stages various phases of insight knowledge are developed leading on to the stages of ultimate liberation
The approach followed is that of bare insight where by direct observation one's own bodily and mental processes are seen with increasing clarity as being impermanent liable to suffering and without a self or soul
The meditational practice begins with a few selected subjects of bodycontemplation which are retained up to the very end of the road
With the gradually increasing strength of mindfulness and concentration the range widens and the vision deepens until the insight knowledges unfold themselves in due order as a natural outcome of the practice
This approach to the ultimate goal of Buddhist meditation is called bare insight because insight into the three characteristics of existence is made use of exclusively here dispensing with the prior development of full concentrative absorption
Nevertheless and it hardly needs mention here too a high degree of mental concentration is required for perseverance in the practice for attaining to insight knowledge and for reaping its fruits
As stated in the treatise itself it is not the author's purpose to give a detailed introduction to the practice for the use of beginners
The foremost concern in this work is with a stage where after diligent preliminary practice the insight knowledges have begun to emerge leading up to the highest crest of spiritual achievement arahantship
Of the basic exercises the treatise gives only a brief indication at the beginning of Chapter Detailed instruction about these may be gathered by the student from the author's Practical Insight Meditation or the translator's book The Heart of Buddhist Meditation
Also a knowledge of the Buddha's original Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness will be indispensable
This treatise was first written in the Burmese language and later in a Pali version of it was composed by the author
As the treatise deals chiefly with the advanced stages of the practice it was originally not intended for publication
Handwritten or typed copies of the Burmese or Pali version were given only to those who with some measure of success had concluded a strict course of practice at the meditation center
For the use of meditators from foreign countries only a few cyclostyled sheets in English briefly describing the phases of insight knowledge were issued instead of the treatise itself
This was done to enable the meditator to identify his personal experience with one or other of the stages described so that he might direct his further progress accordingly without being diverted or misled by any secondary phenomena that may have appeared during his practice
In the Venerable Author agreed to a printed edition of the Pali version in Burmese script and after this first publication he also permitted at the translator's request the issue of an English version
He had the great kindness to go carefully through the draft translation and the Notes with the linguistic help of an experienced Burmese lay meditator U Pe Thin who for many years had ably served as an interpreter for meditators from foreign countries
The translator's gratitude is due to both his Venerable Meditation Master the author and to U Pe Thin
Homage to Him the Great Omniscient Sage Who spread the net of rays of His Good Law
These rays of His Good Law  His very message true  Long may they shed their radiance o'er the world
This treatise explains the progress of insight together with the corresponding stages of purification
It has been written in brief for the benefit of meditators who have obtained distinctive results in their practice so that they may more easily understand their experience
It is meant for those who in their practice of insight have taken up as their main subject either the tactile bodily process of motion evident in the rising and falling movement of the abdomen or the tactile bodily process based on three of the primary elements of matter evident in the sensation of touch
It is meant for those who by attending to these exercises have gained progressive insight as well into the whole bodyandmind process arising at the six sense doors and have finally come to see the Dhamma to attain to the Dhamma to understand the Dhamma to penetrate the Dhamma who have passed beyond doubt freed themselves from uncertainty obtained assurance and achieved independence of others in the Master's dispensation
Purification of conduct means here in the case of male and female devotees the acceptance of the precepts and the proper guarding and protecting of their observance  whether it be the Five Precepts the Eight Uposatha Precepts or the Ten Precepts
In the case of bhikkhus purification of conduct is the wellkept purity of the fourfold conduct incumbent upon monks beginning with restraint according to the disciplinary rules of bhikkhus called the Patimokkha
Of that fourfold conduct the restraint according to the Patimokkha rules is of first importance because only when that restraint is pure will one be able to accomplish the development of meditation
There are two kinds of meditation development tranquillity and insight
A person who of these two has first developed tranquillity and after having established himself in either access concentration or full concentration subsequently contemplates the five groups of grasping is called a samathayanika one who has tranquillity as his vehicle
As to his method of attaining insight the Papañcasudani commenting on the Dhammadayada Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya says Herein a certain person first produces access concentration or full concentration this is tranquillity
He then applies insight to that concentration and to the mental states associated with it seeing them as impermanent etc this is insight In the Visuddhimagga too it is said He whose vehicle is tranquillity should first emerge from any finematerial or immaterial jhana except the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he should then discern according to characteristic function etc the jhana factors consisting of applied thought etc and the mental states associated with them
He however who has neither produced access concentration nor full concentration but from the very start applies insight to the five groups of grasping is called suddhavipassanayanika one who has pure insight as his vehicle As to his method of attaining insight it is said in the same Commentary to the Dhammadayada Sutta There is another person who even without having produced the aforesaid tranquillity applies insight to the five groups of grasping seeing them as impermanent etc In the Visuddhimagga too it is said thus One who has pure insight as his vehicle contemplates the four elements
In the Susimaparibbajaka Sutta of the Nidanavagga Samyutta too it is said by the Buddha First arises the knowledge comprehending the actual happening of things and afterwards arises the knowledge realizing Nibbana
When purification of conduct has been established the meditator who has chosen pure insight as his vehicle should endeavor to contemplate the bodyandmind
In doing so he should contemplate according to their characteristics the five groups of grasping that is the bodily and mental processes that become evident to him in his own lifecontinuity
Insight must in fact be developed by noticing according to their specific and general characteristics the bodily and mental processes that become evident at the six sense doors
At the beginning however it is difficult to follow and to notice clearly all bodily and mental processes that incessantly appear at the six sense doors
Therefore the meditator who is a beginner should first notice the perfectly distinct process of touch perceived through the door of bodily sensitivity because the Visuddhimagga says that in insight meditation one should take up what is distinct
When sitting there occurs the bodily process of touch by way of the sitting posture and through touch sensitivity in the body
These processes of tactile sensitivity should be noticed as Sitting  touching  and so forth in due succession
Further at the seated meditator's abdomen the tactile process of bodily motion which has breathing as its condition is perceptible continuously as the rise and fall of the abdomen
That too should be noticed as rising falling and so forth
While the meditator is thus engaged in noticing the element of motion which impinges continuously on the door of bodily sensitivity in the abdomen it becomes evident to him in its aspects of stiffening of vibrating and of pushing and pulling
Here the aspect of stiffening shows the motion element's characteristic nature of supporting the aspect of vibrating shows its essential function of movement and the aspect of pushing and pulling shows its manifestation of impelling
Hence the meditator noticing the tactile bodily process of rise and fall of the abdomen accomplishes the observation of the bodily process by getting to know the characteristic nature etc of the element of motion
Later when he has accomplished the observation of mind and the observation of both body and mind he will also come to know the general characteristics of the processes concerned  their impermanence liability to suffering and their being void of a self
But while he is engaged in just noticing the rising and falling of the abdomen and other tactile processes there will appear thoughts of desire etc feelings of pleasure etc or acts such as adjusting various parts of the body
At that time these activities must be noticed too
After noticing them he should turn again to the continuous noticing of the tactile process of the rising and falling of the abdomen which is the basic object of mindfulness in this practice
This is a brief sketch of the methodical practice of insight
It is not the place here to treat it in detail because this is a brief essay on the progress of insight through the stages of purification it is not a treatise explaining in detail the methodical practice of insight
During the early part of the methodical practice as long as the meditator's mind is not yet fully purified wandering thoughts arisen by his thinking of objects of sense desire etc will also appear intermittently between thoughts of noticing
Sometimes the beginning meditator will perceive occurrence and sometimes he will not
But even if he perceives them it will be only after a short time has elapsed after their appearance
For then the momentary concentration of his mind is still very tender and weak
So these wandering thoughts continue to hinder his mind while it is occupied in developing the practice of noticing
Hence these wandering thoughts are called hindering thoughts
When however the momentary concentration of his mind has become strong the thought process of noticing becomes well concentrated
Hence when attending to the objects to be noticed  the abdominal movement sitting touching bending stretching seeing hearing etc
 his noticing thoughts now appear as if falling upon these objects as if striking at them as if confronting them again and again
Then as a rule his mind will no longer go elsewhere
Only occasionally and in a slight degree will this happen and even in those cases he will be able to notice any such stray thought at its very arising as expressed in common speech or to be exact he will notice the stray thought immediately after its actual arising
Then that stray thought will subside as soon as it is noticed and will not arise again
Immediately afterwards he will also be able to resume continuous noticing of any object as it becomes evident to him
That is why his mind at that time is called unhindered
While the meditator is thus practicing the exercise of noticing with unhindered mind the noticing mind will close in upon and fix on whatever object is being noticed and the act of noticing will proceed without break
At that time there arises in him in uninterrupted succession the concentration of mind lasting for a moment directed to each object noticed
This is called purification of mind
Though that concentration has only momentary duration its power of resistance to being overwhelmed by opposition corresponds to that of access concentration
In the Commentary to the Visuddhimagga in the explanation of the chapter relating to mindfulness of breathing it is said thus  'Momentary unification of mind' means the concentration of mind lasting only for a moment
For that too when it occurs uninterruptedly with its respective object in a single mode and is not overcome by opposition fixes the mind immovably as if in absorption
It occurs uninterruptedly with its respective object refers to the uninterrupted continuity of the thoughts engaged in noticing after noticing one object one attends in the same manner to another that follows immediately again having noticed that object one turns to the next one and so on
In a single mode means though the objects to be noticed as they present themselves are numerous and varied yet the force of concentration of the mind uninterruptedly engaged in noticing remains virtually on the same level
For what is meant here is just as the first object was noticed with a certain degree of concentration so the second third and other subsequent objects are noticed in each case with the same degree of concentration
Is not overcome by opposition this means that the momentary concentration in its uninterrupted flow is not overwhelmed by the mental hindrances
As if in absorption this means that the strength of the momentary concentration is similar to that of concentration which has reached full mental absorption
However such similarity of momentary concentration with fully absorbed concentration will become evident when the methodical practice of insight reaches its culmination
But is it not said in the Commentaries that the term purification of mind applies only to access concentration and fully absorbed concentration
That is true but one has to take this statement in the sense that momentary concentration is included in access concentration
For in the Commentary to the Satipatthana Sutta it is said The remaining twelve exercises are subjects of meditation leading only to Access Concentration Now in the case of the subjects dealt with in the sections of the Satipatthana Sutta on postures clear comprehension and elements the concentration of one who devotes himself to these exercises will be definitely only momentary concentration
But as the latter is able to suppress the hindrances just as access concentration does and since it is the neighbourhood of the noblepath attainment concentration therefore that same momentary concentration is spoken of by the name of access and also the meditation subjects that produce that momentary concentration are called meditation subjects leading to access concentration Hence it should be understood that momentary concentration having the capacity to suppress the hindrances has also the right to the name access and purification of mind Otherwise purification of mind could not come about in one who has made bare insight his vehicle by employing only insight without having produced either access concentration or fully absorbed concentration
Endowed with purification of mind and continuing the practice of noticing the meditator now comes to know bodyandmind analytically as follows The rising of the abdomen is one process the falling is another sitting is another touching is another etc
In this way he comes to know how to distinguish each bodily process that he notices
Further he realizes The knowing of the rising movement is one process the knowing of the falling movement is another In that way he comes to know each mental act of noticing
Further he realizes The rising movement is one process the knowing of it is another
The falling movement is one process the knowing of it is another and so on
In that way he comes to know how to distinguish each bodily and mental process
All that knowledge comes from simply noticing not from reasoning that is to say it is knowledge by direct experience arrived at by the mere act of noticing and not knowledge derived from ratiocination
Thus when seeing a visual object with the eye the meditator knows how to distinguish each single factor involved The eye is one the visual object is another seeing is another and knowing it is another The same manner applies in the case of the other sense functions
For at the time in each act of noticing the meditator comes to know analytically the mental processes of noticing and those of thinking and reflecting knowing them for himself through direct knowledge by his experience thus They have the nature of going towards an object inclining towards an object cognizing an object On the other hand he knows analytically the material processes going on in the whole body  which are here described as the rising and falling movements of the abdomen sitting etc knowing them thus These have not the nature of going or inclining towards an object or of cognizing an object Such knowing is called knowing matter by its manifestation of nondetermining For it is said in the MulaTika the Principal Subcommentary to the Abhidhamma Vibhanga In other words 'nondetermining' should be understood as having no faculty of cognizing an object
Such knowledge as this which analyzes in each act of noticing both the bodily process noticed and the mental process engaged in noticing according to their true essential nature is called analytical knowledge of body and mind
When that knowledge has come to maturity the meditator understands thus At the moment of breathing in there is just the rising movement of the abdomen and the knowing of the movement but there is no self besides at the moment of breathing out there is just the falling movement of the abdomen and the knowing of the movement but there is no self besides Understanding it thus in these and other instances he knows and sees for himself by noticing thus There is here only that pair a material process as object and a mental process of knowing it and it is to that pair alone that the terms of conventional usage 'being' 'person' or 'soul' 'I' or 'another' 'man' or 'woman' refer
But apart from that dual process there is no separate person or being I or another man or woman
This is called purification of view
When purification of view has come to maturity the conditions necessary for the bodily and mental processes observed will also become evident
Firstly the consciousness that is the condition of the bodily process will be evident
How
For instance when bending the arms or legs the consciousness intending to bend these limbs is evident
So the meditator first notices that consciousness and next he notices the act of bending and so on
Then he understands by direct experience When there is consciousness intending to bend a limb the bodily process of bending arises when there is consciousness intending to stretch a limb the bodily process of stretching arises And in the same way he understands other instances too by direct experience
Again he also understands by direct experience the condition for the mental process in the following manner In the case of consciousness desirous of running off the track there arises first a corresponding consciousness giving initial attention
If that consciousness is not noticed then there arises a consciousness that runs off the track
But if the consciousness of initial attention to the distracting object is noticed and known no stray thought will arise
It is similar in the case of other
When both the sense door of the eye and a visual object are present there arises visual consciousness otherwise visual consciousness will not arise and so it is in the case of the other sense doors
If there is a noticeable or recognizable object then there arises consciousness engaged in noticing or thinking or reasoning or understanding as the case may be otherwise no such consciousness arises
Similarly he understands what occurs in every other instance
At that time the meditator will generally experience many different painful feelings arising in his body
Now while one of these feelings is being noticed another feeling will arise elsewhere and while that is being noticed again another will appear elsewhere
Thus the meditator follows each feeling as it arises and notices it
But though he is engaged in noticing these feelings as they arise he will only perceive their initial phase of arising and not their final phase of dissolution
Also many mental images of various shapes will then appear
The shape of a dagoba a monk a man a house a tree a park a heavenly mansion a cloud and many other such images will appear
Here too while the meditator is still engaged in noticing one of these mental images another will show itself while still noticing that yet another will appear
Following thus the mental images as they arise he goes on noticing them
But though he is engaged in noticing them he will perceive only their initial phase not the final phase
He now understands Consciousness arises in accordance with each object that becomes evident
If there is an object there arises consciousness if there is no object no consciousness arises
Between sequences of noticing he also by considering inferentially comes to know thus It is due to the presence of such causes and conditions as ignorance craving kamma etc that bodyandmind continue
Such discernment through direct experience and through inference as described when noticing bodyandmind with their conditions is called knowledge of discerning conditionality
When that knowledge has come to maturity the meditator perceives only bodyandmind processes occurring in strict accordance with their particular and appropriate conditions and he comes to the conclusion Here is only a conditioning bodyandmind process and a conditioned bodyandmind process
Apart from these there is no person who performs the bending of the limbs etc or who experiences feelings of pain etc
This is called purification by overcoming doubt
When this purification by overcoming doubt has reached maturity the meditator will discern distinctly the initial middle and final phases of any object noticed by him
Then in the case of various objects noticed he will discern distinctly that only after each earlier process has ceased does there arise a subsequent process
For instance only when the rising movement of the abdomen has come to an end does there arise the falling movement only when that has ended is there again a rising movement
So also in the case of walking only when the lifting of the foot has come to an end does there arise the carrying forward of the foot only when that has been completed does there follow the placing of the foot on the ground
In the case of painful feelings only after each single feeling occurring at its particular place has ceased will another new feeling arise at another place
On noticing the respective painful feeling repeatedly twice thrice or more the meditator will see that it gradually grows less and at last ceases entirely
In the case of the variously shaped images that enter the mind's field it is only after each single image noticed has vanished that another new object will come into the mind's focus
On noticing them attentively twice thrice or more he will see well that these mental objects which are being noticed move from one place to another or they become gradually smaller and less distinct until at last they disappear entirely
The meditator however does not perceive anything that is permanent and lasting or free from destruction and disappearance
Seeing how each object even while being noticed comes to destruction and disappearance the meditator comprehends it as impermanent in the sense of undergoing destruction
He further comprehends it as suffering in the sense of breaking up after each arising
Having seen how various painful feelings arise in continuous succession  how if one painful feeling ceases another arises and when that has ceased again another arises  having seen that he comprehends the respective objects as just a conglomeration of suffering
Further he comprehends the object as consisting of mere impersonal phenomena without a master in the sense of not arising of themselves but arising subject to conditions and then breaking up
This comprehension of an object noticed as being impermanent painful and without a self through knowing its nature of impermanency etc by means of simply noticing without reflecting and reasoning is called knowledge by comprehension through direct experience
Having thus seen the three characteristics once or several times by direct experience the meditator by inference from the direct experience of those objects noticed comprehends all bodily and mental processes of the past present and future and the whole world by coming to the conclusion They too are in the same way impermanent painful and without a self This is called knowledge of comprehension by inference
Alluding to this very knowledge it is said in the Patisambhidamagga Whatever there is of materiality past present or future internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all materiality he defines as impermanent
That is one kind of comprehension and so on
Also in the Commentary to the Kathavatthu it is said Even if the impermanence of only a single formation is known there may be consideration of the rest by induction thus 'All formations are impermanent' 
The words All formations are impermanent refer to an understanding by induction and not to an understanding by perceiving a object at the same moment

Also in the Commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya it is said Because in the case of the realm of neitherperceptionnornonperception the insight into the sequence of mental factors belongs to the Buddhas alone and not to the disciples he said thus thereby indicating the insight by groups 
When the meditator in the exercise of noticing is able to keep exclusively to the present bodyandmind process without looking back to past processes or ahead to future ones then as a result of insight a brilliant light will appear to him
To one it will appear like the light of a lamp to others like a flash of lightning or like the radiance of the moon or the sun and so on
With one it may last for just one moment with others it may last longer
There will also arise in him strong mindfulness pertaining to insight
As a result all the successive arisings of bodily and mental processes will present themselves to the consciousness engaged in noticing as if coming to it of themselves and mindfulness too seems as if alighting on the processes of itself
Therefore the meditator then believes There is no bodyandmind process in which mindfulness fails to engage
His knowledge consisting in insight here called noticing will be likewise keen strong and lucid
Consequently he will discern clearly and in separate forms all the bodily and mental processes noticed as if cutting to pieces a bamboo sprout with a wellsharpened knife
Therefore the meditator then believes There is no bodyandmind process that cannot be noticed When examining the characteristics of impermanence etc or other aspects of reality he understands everything quite clearly and at once and he believes it to be the knowledge derived from direct experience
Further strong faith pertaining to insight arises in him
Under its influence the meditator's mind when engaged in noticing or thinking is serene and without any disturbance and when he is engaged in recollecting the virtues of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha his mind quite easily gives itself over to them
There arise in him the wish to proclaim the Buddha's Teaching joyous confidence in the virtues of those engaged in meditation the desire to advise dear friends and relatives to practice meditation grateful remembrance of the help received from his meditation master his spiritual mentor etc
These and many other similar mental processes will occur
There arises also rapture in its five grades beginning with minor rapture
When purification of mind is gained that rapture begins to appear by causing gooseflesh tremor in the limbs etc and now it produces a sublime feeling of happiness and exhilaration filling the whole body with an exceedingly sweet and subtle thrill
Under its influence he feels as if the whole body had risen up and remained in the air without touching the ground or as if it were seated on an air cushion or as if it were floating up and down
There arises tranquillity of mind with the characteristic of quietening the disturbances of consciousness and its mental concomitants and along with it appear mental agility etc
When walking standing sitting or reclining there is under the influence of these mental qualities no disturbance of consciousness and its mental concomitants nor heaviness rigidity unwieldiness sickness or crookedness
Rather his consciousness and its mental concomitants are tranquil through having reached the supreme relief in nonaction
They are agile in always functioning swiftly they are pliant in being able to attend to any object desired they are wieldy in being able to attend to an object for any length of time desired they are quite lucid through their proficiency that is through the ease with which insight penetrates the object they are also straight through being directed inclined and turned only towards wholesome activities
There also arises a very sublime feeling of happiness suffusing all his body
Under its influence he becomes exceedingly joyous and he believes Now I am happy all the time or Now indeed I have found happiness never felt before and he wants to tell others of his extraordinary experience
With reference to that rapture and happiness which are aided by the factors of tranquillity etc it was said
 Dhammapada vv

There arises in him energy that is neither too lax nor too tense but is vigorous and acts evenly
For formerly his energy was sometimes lax and so he was overpowered by sloth and torpor hence he could not notice keenly and continuously the objects as they became evident and his understanding too was not clear
And at other times his energy was too tense and so he was overpowered by agitation with the same result of being unable to notice keenly etc
But now his energy is neither too lax nor too tense but is vigorous and acts evenly and so overcoming these shortcomings of sloth torpor and agitation he is able to notice the objects present keenly and continuously and his understanding is quite clear too
There also arises in him strong equanimity associated with insight which is neutral towards all formations
Under its influence he regards with neutrality even his examination of the nature of these formations with respect to their being impermanent etc and he is able to notice keenly and continuously the bodily and mental processes arising at the time
Then his activity of noticing is carried on without effort and proceeds as it were of itself
Also in adverting to the objects there arises in him strong equanimity by virtue of which his mind enters as it were quickly into the objects of advertence
There arises further a subtle attachment of a calm nature that enjoys the insight graced with the brilliant light and the other qualities here described
The meditator however is not able to discern it as a corruption but believes it to be just the very bliss of meditation
So meditators speak in praise of it thus Only now do I find full delight in meditation
Having felt such rapture and happiness accompanied by the brilliant light and enjoying the very act of perfect noticing which is ably functioning with ease and rapidity the meditator now believes Surely I must have attained to the supramundane path and fruition
Now I have finished the task of meditation This is mistaking what is not the path for the path and it is a corruption of insight which usually takes place in the manner just described
But even if the meditator does not take the brilliant light and the other corruptions as an indication of the path and fruition still he feels delight in them
This is likewise a corruption of insight
Therefore the knowledge consisting in noticing even if quick in its functioning is called the early stage of knowledge of arising and passing away if it is beset and corrupted by those corruptions
For the same reason the meditator is at that time not in a position to discern quite distinctly the arising and passing away of bodily and mental processes
While engaged in noticing the meditator either by himself or through instructions from someone else comes to this decision The brilliant light and the other things experienced by me are not the path
Delight in them is merely a corruption of insight
The practice of continuously noticing the object as it becomes evident  that alone is the way of insight
I must go on with just the work of noticing This decision is called purification by knowledge and vision of what is path and notpath
After noticing these manifestations of brilliant light and the others or after leaving them unheeded he goes on continuously as before with the act of noticing the bodily and mental processes as they become evident at the six sense doors
While thus engaged in noticing he gets over the corruptions relating to brilliant light rapture tranquillity happiness attachment etc and his knowledge remains concerned exclusively with the arising and passing away of the processes noticed
For then at each act of noticing he sees The noticed object having arisen disappears instantly It also becomes clear to him that each object disappears just where it arises it does not move on to another place
In that way he understands by direct experience how bodily and mental processes arise and break up from moment to moment
It is such knowledge and understanding resulting from the continuous noticing of bodily and mental processes as they arise and dissolve moment after moment and the discernment in separate sections of the arising and passing away of each of them while being free from the corruptions that is called final knowledge of contemplation of arising and passing away This is the beginning of purification by knowledge and vision of the course of practice which starts from this insight and extends to adaptation knowledge
Noticing the bodily and mental processes as they arise he sees them part by part link by link piece by piece fraction by fraction Just now it arises just now it dissolves When that knowledge of arising and passing away becomes mature keen and strong it will arise easily and proceed uninterruptedly as if borne onward of itself also the bodily and mental processes will be easily discernible
When keen knowledge thus carries on and formations are easily discernible then neither the arising of each bodily and mental process nor its middle phase called presence nor the continuity of bodily and mental processes called occurrence as unbroken flux is apparent to him nor are the shape of the hand the foot the face the body and so on apparent to him
But what is apparent to him is only the ceasing of bodily and mental processes called vanishing or passing away or dissolution
For instance while noticing the rising movement of the abdomen neither its initial nor middle phase is apparent but only the ceasing or vanishing which is called the final phase is apparent and so it is also with the falling movement of the abdomen
Again in the case of bending an arm or leg while noticing the act of bending neither the initial nor the middle phase of bending is apparent nor is the form of the limb apparent but only the final phase of ceasing and vanishing is apparent
It is similar in the other cases of stretching a limb and so on
For at that time each object that is being noticed seems to him to be entirely absent or to have become nonexistent
Consequently at this stage of knowledge it seems to him as if he were engaged in noticing something which has already become absent or nonexistent by having vanished and the consciousness engaged in noticing appears to have lost contact with the object that is being noticed
It is for that reason that a meditator may here think I have lost the insight but he should not think so
For formerly his consciousness normally took delight in conceptual objects of shapes etc and even up to the knowledge of arising and passing away the idea of formations with their specific features was always apparent to him
Hence his mind took delight in a plainly distinguishable object consisting of formations with its particular structure and its particular featureidea
But now that his knowledge has developed in the way described no such idea of the formations' features or structure appears to him still less any other cruder concept
At such a stage the arising of formations that is the first phase of the process is not apparent but there is apparent only the dissolution that is the final phase having the nature of vanishing
Therefore the meditator's mind does not take delight in it at first but he may be sure that soon after becoming familiar his mind will delight in the cessation too which is called their dissolution
With this assurance he should again turn to the practice of continuous noticing
When thus engaged he perceives that in each act of noticing there are always present two factors an objective factor and a subjective one  the object noticed and the mental state of knowing it  which dissolve and vanish by pairs one pair after the other
For in each single instance of a rising movement of the abdomen there are in fact numerous physical processes constituting the rising movement which are seen to dissolve serially
It is like seeing the continuous successive vanishing of a summer mirage moment by moment or it is like the quick and continuous bursting of bubbles produced in a heavy shower by thick rain drops falling on a water surface or it is like the quick successive extinction of oillamps or candles blown out by the wind as these lights are being offered at a shrine by devotees
Similar to that appears the dissolving and vanishing moment by moment of the bodily processes noticed
And the dissolution of consciousness noticing those bodily processes is apparent to him along with the dissolution of the bodily processes
Also while he is noticing other bodily and mental processes their dissolution too will be apparent to him in the same manner
Consequently the knowledge will come to him that whatever part of the whole body is noticed that object ceases first and after it the consciousness engaged in noticing that object follows in its wake
From that the meditator will understand very clearly in the case of each successive pair the dissolution of any object whatsoever and the dissolution of the consciousness noticing that very object

It is the perfectly clear understanding of the dissolution of the two things pair by pair  that is of the visual or other object appearing at any of the six sense doors and of the consciousness noticing that very object  that is called knowledge of dissolution
When that knowledge of dissolution is mature there will gradually arise just by seeing the dissolution of all objectandsubjectformations awareness of fearfulness and other knowledges together with their respective aspects of fear and so on
Having seen how the dissolution of two things  that is any object noticed and the insightthought engaged in noticing it  takes place moment by moment the meditator also understands by inference that in the past too every conditioned thing has broken up in the same way that just so it will break up also in the future and that at the present it breaks up too
And just at the time of noticing any formations that are evident these formations will appear to him in their aspect of fearfulness
Therefore during the very act of noticing the meditator will also come to understand These formations are indeed fearful
Such understanding of their fearfulness is called knowledge of the awareness of fearfulness it has also the name knowledge of fear At that time his mind itself is gripped by fear and seems helpless
When he has realized the fearfulness through the knowledge of fear and keeps on noticing continuously then the knowledge of misery will arise in him before long
When it has arisen all formations everywhere  whether among the objects noticed or among the states of consciousness engaged in noticing or in any kind of life or existence that is brought to mind  will appear insipid without a vitalizing factor and unsatisfying
So he sees at that time only suffering only unsatisfactoriness only misery
Therefore this state is called knowledge of misery
Seeing thus the misery in conditioned things his mind finds no delight in those miserable things but is entirely disgusted with them
At times his mind becomes as it were discontented and listless
Even so he does not give up the practice of insight but spends his time continuously engaging in it
He therefore should know that this state of mind is not dissatisfaction with meditation but is precisely the knowledge of disgust that has the aspect of being disgusted with the formations
Even if he directs his thought to the happiest sort of life and existence or to the most pleasant and desirable objects his mind will not take delight in them will find no satisfaction in them
On the contrary his mind will incline and lean and tend only towards Nibbana
Therefore the following thought will arise in him between moments of noticing The ceasing of all formations that are dissolving from moment to moment  that alone is happiness
When through this knowledge he feels disgust with regard to every formation noticed there will arise in him a desire to forsake these formations or to become delivered from them
The knowledge relating to that desire is called knowledge of desire for deliverance At that time usually various painful feelings arise in his body and also an unwillingness to remain long in one particular bodily posture
Even if these states do not arise the comfortless nature of the formations will become more evident than ever
And due to that between moments of noticing he feels a longing thus Oh may I soon get free from that
Oh may I reach the state where these formations cease
Oh may I be able to give up these formations completely At this juncture his consciousness engaged in noticing seems to shrink from the object noticed at each moment of noticing and wishes to escape from it
Being thus desirous of escaping from the formations the meditator makes stronger effort and continues the practice of noticing these very formations with the single purpose of forsaking them and escaping from them
For that reason the knowledge arising at that time is called knowledge of reobservation The term reobservation has the same meaning as renoticing or recontemplation Then the nature of the formations  their being impermanent suffering and without a self  will be clearly evident to him and among these three the aspect of suffering will be particularly distinct
At this stage too there will usually arise in his body various kinds of pains which are severe sharp and of growing intensity
Hence his whole bodily and mental system will seem to him like an unbearable mass of sickness or a conglomeration of suffering
And a state of restlessness will usually manifest itself making him incapable of keeping to one particular posture for any length of time
For then he will not be able to hold any one position long but will soon want to change it
This state however simply manifests the unbearable nature of the formations
Though he wants to change his bodily posture still he should not give in easily to that wish but should endeavor to remain motionless for a longer period in the same posture and continue to carry on the practice of noticing
By doing so he will be able to overcome his restlessness
Now his insight knowledge is quite strong and lucid and by virtue of it even his painful feelings will at once cease as soon as they are firmly noticed
Even if a painful feeling does not cease completely he will perceive that it is dissolving part by part from moment to moment
That is to say the ceasing vanishing and disappearing of each single moment of feeling will become apparent separately in each corresponding act of noticing
In other words now it will not be as it was at the time of the knowledge of comprehension when the constant flow or continuity of feelings of the same kind was apparent as a single unit
But if without abandoning the practice that feeling of pain is firmly and continuously noticed it will entirely cease before long
When it ceases in that way it does so for good and will not arise again
Though in that way the insight knowledge may have become strong and perfectly lucid still he is not satisfied with that much
He will even think My insight knowledge is not clear He should however dismiss such thoughts by applying the act of noticing to them and he should go on with his task of continuously noticing the bodily and mental formations as they occur
If he perseveres thus his noticing will become more and more clear as the time passes in minutes hours and days
Then he will overcome the painful feelings and the restlessness in being unable to remain long in one particular posture and also the idea that his insight knowledge is not yet clear enough
His noticing will then function rapidly and at every moment of noticing he will understand quite clearly any of the three characteristics of impermanence etc
This understanding of any of the three characteristics of impermanence etc through the act of noticing which functions with promptness in quick succession is called strong knowledge of reobservation
When this knowledge of reobservation is mature there will arise knowledge perceiving evident bodily and mental processes in continuous succession quite naturally as if borne onward of itself
This is called knowledge of equanimity about formations
Now in the act of noticing effort is no longer required to keep formations before the mind or to understand them
After the completion of each single act of noticing the object to be noticed will then appear of itself and insight knowledge too will of itself notice and understand it
It is as if no further effort need be made by the meditator
Formerly owing to seeing the dissolution of formations there arose in successive order the aspect of fearfulness the perception of misery the aspect of disgust the desire for deliverance and dissatisfaction with the knowledge so far acquired
But now these mental states no longer arise even though in the present state too the breaking up of formations which are dissolving more rapidly is closely perceived
Even if a painful feeling arises in the body no mental disturbance arises and there is no lack of fortitude in bearing it
Generally however at this stage pains will be entirely absent that is they do not arise at all
Even if the meditator thinks about something fearful or sad no mental disturbance will arise be it in the form of fear or of sorrow
This firstly is the abandoning of fear at the stage of equanimity about formations
At the earlier stage on attaining knowledge of arising and passing away great joy had arisen on account of the clarity of insight
But now this kind of joy does not arise even though there is present the exceedingly peaceful and sublime clarity of mind belonging to equanimity about formations Though he actually sees desirable objects conducive to joy or though he thinks about various enjoyable things no strong feeling of joy will arise
This is the abandoning of delight at the stage of equanimity about formations
He cherishes no desire nor hate with regard to any object desirable or undesirable that comes into the range of his sense doors but taking them as just the same in his act of noticing he understands them
This is equable vision at the stage of equanimity about formations
Of these three qualities just mentioned it is said in the Path of Purification Having discarded fear and delight he is impartial and neutral towards all formations
If he resumes the practice of noticing with the thought Now I will do it vigorously again then before long the noticing will function efficiently as if borne onward of itself
From now onwards there is no need for the meditator to make further effort
Though he does not make a effort his noticing will proceed in a continuous and steady flow for a long time it will go on even for two or three hours without interruption
This is the state of longlasting  of equanimity about formations
Referring to this it is said in the Patisambhidamagga  'The wisdom lasting long' is the knowledge present in the mental states of equanimity about formations The Great Commentary to the Path of Purification explains as follows This is said with reference to knowledge functioning in a continuous flow
Now when noticing functions spontaneously as if borne onward of itself the mind even if sent out towards a variety of objects generally refuses to go and even if it does go it will not stay long but will soon return to the usual object to be noticed and will resume continuous noticing
In this connection it was said He shrinks recoils and retreats he does not go forth to it
So through knowledge of equanimity about formations which is endowed with many virtues blessings and powers he notices the formations as they occur
When this knowledge is mature having become keen strong and lucid on reaching its culmination point it will understand any of the formations as being impermanent or painful or without self just by seeing their dissolution
Now that act of noticing any one characteristic out of the three which is still more lucid in its perfect understanding manifests itself two or three times or more in rapid succession
This is called insight leading to emergence
Thereupon immediately after the last consciousness in the series of acts of noticing belonging to this insight leading to emergence the meditator's consciousness leaps forth into Nibbana which is the cessation of all formations taking it as its object
Then there appears to him the stilling of all formations called cessation
This mode of realization of Nibbana has been mentioned in many discourses of the Master for example The vision of truth arose whatsoever has the nature of arising is bound to cease Herein the words bound to cease indicate the aspect of realizing the stilling and ceasing of all formations which have the nature of arising
Also in the Questions of King Milinda it is said His consciousness while carrying on the practice of bringing to mind passes beyond the continuous occurrence of phenomena and alights upon nonoccurrence
One who having practiced in the correct manner has alighted upon nonoccurrence O king is said to have realized Nibbana
The meaning is this the meditator who wishes to realize Nibbana should repeatedly bring to mind through the practice of noticing every bodily and mental process that appears at any of the six sense doors
When he brings them to mind thus his consciousness engaged in noticing  here called bringing to mind  will until adaptation knowledge is reached fall at every moment upon the bodily and mental formations called here continuous occurrence because they go on occurring over and over again in an unbroken flow like a river's current
But in the last phase instead of falling upon that continuous occurrence consciousness passes beyond it and alights upon nonoccurrence which is the very opposite of the bodily and mental formations called here occurrence In other words it arrives at nonoccurrence that is to say it reaches as if it alights upon cessation which is the stilling of the formations
When the meditator having already before practiced correctly and without deviation by way of the knowledge of arising and passing away and the other knowledges has in this manner arrived at nonoccurrence he is said to have realized Nibbana He is called one who has made Nibbana a direct experience and has actually seen it
Here the knowledge by way of noticing that occurs last in the series constituting insight leading to emergence is called knowledge of adaptation
This is the end of the purification by knowledge and vision of the course of practice
Immediately afterwards a type of knowledge manifests itself that as it were falls for the first time into Nibbana which is void of formations since it is the cessation of them
This knowledge is called maturity knowledge
It is followed immediately by knowledge that abides in that same Nibbana which is void of formations since it is the cessation of them
This is called path knowledge It is also called purification by knowledge and vision
That again is immediately followed by knowledge that belongs to the final stage and continues in the course of its predecessor
It abides in that same Nibbana which is void of formations since it is the cessation of them
This is called fruition knowledge
The duration of that threefold knowledge of maturity path and fruition is however not long
It is very short and lasts for just an instant like the duration of a single thought of noticing
Subsequently there arises knowledge of reviewing Through that knowledge of reviewing the meditator discerns that the insight leading to emergence came along with the very rapid function of noticing and that immediately after the last phase of noticing the path consciousness entered into the cessation
This is knowledge reviewing the path
He also discerns that the consciousness abided in that same state of cessation during the intervening period between the path and reviewing
This is knowledge reviewing fruition
He further discerns that the object just experienced is void of all formations
This is knowledge reviewing Nibbana
In this connection it is said in the Path of Purification  'By that path indeed I have come' thus he reviews the path
'That blessing was obtained' thus he reviews the fruition
'That state has been penetrated as an object by me' thus he reviews the Deathless Nibbana
Some meditators but not all have reviewing of defilements
After having reviewed in this way the meditator still continues the practice of noticing bodily and mental processes as they become evident
But while he is thus engaged in noticing the bodily and mental processes appear to him quite coarse not subtle as before at the time of the knowledge of equanimity about formations
Why is this so
This is so because the knowledge present now has the nature of the knowledge of arising and passing away
For when the noble disciples resume the practice of insight the knowledge of arising and passing away usually arises at the beginning
This is the usual course of order in this respect
However when some meditators emerge from the attainment of path and fruition great faith happiness rapture and tranquillity produced by virtue of the attainment arise flooding the whole body
Owing to that they are unable to carry out the practice of noticing anything apparent at that time
Even if they make double effort and attempt to proceed with the practice of insight they fail to discern the phenomena clearly and separately at the moment of their occurrence
They continue to experience only rapture tranquillity and happiness which occur with great force
This state of mind which is extraordinarily serene through the strong faith prevailing lasts for one hour two hours or more without break
Because of this meditators feel as if they were in some such place as a wide open space suffused with radiance and most delightful
The rapture and happiness of a serene character that then arise are praised by meditators thus Surely I have never before felt and experienced such happiness After two or three hours have passed that faith happiness rapture and tranquillity will fade
The meditators can once again proceed with noticing the bodily and mental processes as they occur distinguishing them separately and they will be able to discern them clearly
But at that time too first the knowledge of arising and passing away will appear
While he is thus engaged in noticing his insight knowledge will gradually grow and soon will again reach the stage of equanimity about formations
If his power of concentration is still short of perfection only the equanimity about formations will go on repeating itself
But if his concentration has reached perfection then in the case of one who does the insight practice of noticing with a view of attaining only to the first path and fruition the fruition consciousness of the first path alone reaches cessation of formations by way of the attainment of fruition
This occurs in precisely the same way as the path and fruition consciousness that occurred earlier in the consciousnesssequence belonging to the initial attainment of the first path
The only difference here is the capacity of the fruition attainment to last long
One should also set one's mind resolutely upon the further tasks to be able to repeat the achievement of fruition attainment to achieve it rapidly and at the time of achievement to abide in it a long time say for six ten fifteen or thirty minutes or for an hour or more
In one who applies himself to achieving the attainment of fruition knowledge of arising and passing away will arise at the beginning
Advancing from there in the due sequence soon the knowledge of equanimity about formations is reached
But when skill in the practice has been acquired the knowledge of equanimity about formations will arise quickly even after four or five acts of noticing
If the power of concentration has reached perfection the fruition consciousness will repeatedly become absorbed in cessation by way of fruition attainment
The mind can thus reach absorption even while one is walking up and down or while taking a meal and the fruition attainment can remain for any length of time resolved upon
During the fruition attainment the mind will abide only in the cessation of formations and will not be aware of anything else
When the meditator has thus become skilled in achieving the fruition attainment he should resolutely set his mind upon the task of attaining to the higher paths and fruitions
What should now be done by one who has set himself that task
Just as before he should carry out the practice of noticing at the six sense doors
Hence the meditator should notice any bodily and mental process that becomes evident to him at the six sense doors
While he is thus engaged he will see at the stage of knowledge of arising and passing away that the first objects consisting of formations appear to him rather coarse and that his mind is not well concentrated
The development of insight belonging to the higher paths is in fact not as easy as that of insight belonging to the fruition attainment already achieved by the meditator
It is in fact somewhat difficult due to the fact that insight has to be developed anew
It is however not so very difficult as it was at the first time when beginning the practice
In a single day or even in a single hour he can gain the knowledge of equanimity about formations
This statement is made here basing it on the experience usually gained by persons of the present day who had to be given guidance from the start and who did not possess particularly strong intelligence
Here it is applied by inference to similar types of persons in general
But although equanimity about formations has been attained if the spiritual faculties have not yet reached full maturity it just goes on repeating itself
Though he who has won fruitions may be able to enter into it several times within one hour yet if his spiritual faculties are immature he cannot attain the next higher path within as much as one day two three or more days
He abides merely in equanimity about formations
If however he then directs his mind to reach the fruition already attained he will reach it perhaps in two or three minutes
When however the spiritual faculties are mature one who carries out the practice of insight for attaining to a higher path will find that immediately after equanimity about formations has reached its culmination the higher path and fruition arise in the same way as before that is to say it is preceded by the stages of adaptation and maturity
After the fruition the stages of reviewing etc that follow are also the same as before
Anything else concerning the method of practice for insight and the progress of knowledge right up to arahantship can be understood in precisely the same way as described
Hence there is no need to elaborate it any further
Now the present treatise on the Progress of Insight through the Stages of Purification has been written in a concise form so that meditators can easily comprehend it
Hence complete details have not been given here
And since it was written with a view to making it easily intelligible in many passages of this treatise relevant canonical references have not been quoted and there are repetitions and other faults of literary composition
But these shortcomings of presentation and the incompleteness of canonical references may here be overlooked by the reader
Only the meaning and purpose should be heeded well by the wise
It is to this that I would invite the reader's attention
Though in the beginning it was mentioned that this treatise has been written for those who have already obtained distinctive results in their practice others may perhaps read it with advantage too
Now these are my concluding good wishes for the latter type of readers Just as a very delicious appetizing tasty and nutritious meal can be appreciated fully only by one who has himself eaten it and not without partaking of it in the same way the whole series of knowledges described here can be understood fully only by one who has himself seen it by direct experience and not otherwise
So may all good people reach the stage of indubitable understanding of this whole series of knowledges
May they also strive to attain it

Mahasi Sayadaw the Venerable U Sobhana Mahathera was the son of U Kan Htaw and Daw Shwe Ok of Seikkhun village which is about seven miles to the west of Shwebo Town a onetime capital of the founder of the last Burmese dynasty
He was born on the third waning of the month of second Waso in the year of the Burmese Era
At the age of six he began his studies at a monastic school in the same village and at the age of twelve he was ordained a samanera
On reaching the age of twenty he was ordained a bhikkhu on the fifth waning of the month of Tazaungmon in the year of the Burmese Era
He then passed the Government Pali examinations in all the three classes of Pathamange Pathamalat and Pathamagyi in the following three successive years
In the fourth year after his bhikkhu ordination he proceeded to Mandalay  a former capital of Burma  where he continued his further studies in the Khinmagan Kyaung Taik under various monks of high scholastic fame
In the fifth year he went to Moulmein where he took up the work of teaching the Buddhist scriptures at a monastery known as Taung Waing Galay Taik Kyaung
In the eighth year after his ordination he and another monk left Moulmein equipped with the bare necessities of a bhikkhu and went in search of a clear and effective method in the practice of meditation
At Thaton he met the wellknown meditation instructor the Venerable U Narada who is also known as Mingun Jetawun Sayadaw the First He then placed himself under the guidance of the Sayadaw and at once proceeded with an intensive course of meditation
After this practical course of meditation he returned to Moulmein and continued with his original work of teaching Buddhist scriptures
He sat for the Pali Lecturership Examination held by the Government of Burma in June and succeeded in passing completely at the first attempt
He was awarded the title of Sasanadhaja Siri Pavara Dhammacariya
In the year of the Burmese Era and in the eighteenth year of his bhikkhu ordination he returned to his native village and resided at a monastery known as MahaSi Kyaung because a drum of unusually big size is housed there
He then introduced the systematic practical course of Satipatthana meditation
Many people bhikkhus as well as laymen gathered round him and took up the strict practical course and were greatly benefited by his careful instructions
They were happy because they began to understand the salient features of Satipatthana and had also learned the proper method of continuing the practice by themselves
In the year BE
the then Prime Minister of Burma U Nu and Sir U Thwin executive members of the Buddha Sasananuggha Association requested the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw to come to Rangoon and give training in meditative practice
In his twentysixth year of bhikkhu ordination he therefore went to Rangoon and resided at the Thathana Yeiktha the headquarters of the Association where since then intensive training courses have been held up to the present day
Over persons have since been trained in that center alone and altogether over persons have been trained throughout Burma where there are more than branches for the training in the same method
This method has also spread widely in Thailand and in Sri Lanka
Mahasi Sayadaw was awarded the title of AggaMahaPandita in the year
He carried out the duties of the Questioner at the Sixth Buddhist Council held at Rangoon for two years culminating in the year of the Buddhist Era
To appreciate fully the importance of this role it may be mentioned that the Venerable MahaKassapa as Questioner put questions at the First Council held three months after the passing away of the Buddha
Then the Venerable Upali and the Venerable Ananda answered the questions
At the Sixth Council it was Tipitakadhara Dhammabhandagarika Ashin Vicittasarabhivamsa who answered the questions put by the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw
The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was also a member of the committee that was responsible as the final authority for the codification of all the texts passed at the Sixth Council
He has written several books on meditation and the following notable works may be mentioned
Burmese translation of the Mahasatipatthana Sutta with notes
Visuddhiñanakatha
Burmese translation of the Visuddhimagga with notes
Burmese translation of the Visuddhimagga MahaTika with notes  volumes
PaticcaSamuppada  volumes
A large number of his discourses based on the Pali Suttas have been translated into English and published by the Buddha Sasananuggha Association 
Mahasi Sayadaw passed away on August following a brief illness
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The nucleus of the present book is a medieval compendium of Buddhist philosophy entitled the Abhidhammattha Sangaha
This work is ascribed to Acariya Anuruddha a Buddhist savant about whom so little is known that even his country of origin and the exact century in which he lived remain in question
Nevertheless despite the personal obscurity that surrounds the author his little manual has become one of the most important and influential textbooks of Theravada Buddhism
In nine short chapters occupying about fifty pages in print the author provides a masterly summary of that abstruse body of Buddhist doctrine called the Abhidhamma
Such is his skill in capturing the essentials of that system and in arranging them in a format suitable for easy comprehension that his work has become the standard primer for Abhidhamma studies throughout the Theravada Buddhist countries of South and Southeast Asia
In these countries particularly in Burma where the study of Abhidhamma is pursued most assiduously the Abhidhammattha Sangaha is regarded as the indispensable key to unlock this great treasurestore of Buddhist wisdom
At the heart of the Abhidhamma philosophy is the Abhidhamma Pitaka one of the divisions of the Pali canon recognized by Theravada Buddhism as the authoritative recension of the Buddha's teachings
This canon was compiled at the three great Buddhist councils held in India in the early centuries following the Buddha's demise the first at Rajagaha convened three months after the Buddha's Parinibbana by five hundred senior monks under the leadership of the Elder Mahakassapa the second at Vesali a hundred years later and the third at Pataliputta two hundred years later
The canon that emerged from these councils preserved in the Middle Indian language now called Pali is known as the Tipitaka the three baskets or collections of the teachings
The first collection the Vinaya Pitaka is the book of discipline containing the rules of conduct for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis  the monks and nuns  and the regulations governing the Sangha the monastic order
The Sutta Pitaka the second collection brings together the Buddha's discourses spoken by him on various occasions during his active ministry of fortyfive years
And the third collection is the Abhidhamma Pitaka the basket of the Buddha's higher or special doctrine
This third great division of the Pali canon bears a distinctly different character from the other two divisions
Whereas the Suttas and Vinaya serve an obvious practical purpose namely to proclaim a clearcut message of deliverance and to lay down a method of personal training the Abhidhamma Pitaka presents the appearance of an abstract and highly technical systemization of the doctrine
The collection consists of seven books the Dhammasangani the Vibhanga the Dhatukatha the Puggalapaññatti the Kathavatthu the Yamaka and the Patthana
Unlike the Suttas these are not records of discourses and discussions occurring in reallife settings they are rather fullblown treatises in which the principles of the doctrine have been methodically organized minutely defined and meticulously tabulated and classified
Though they were no doubt originally composed and transmitted orally and only written down later with the rest of the canon in the first century BC they exhibit the qualities of structured thought and rigorous consistency more typical of written documents
In the Theravada tradition the Abhidhamma Pitaka is held in the highest esteem revered as the crown jewel of the Buddhist scriptures
As examples of this high regard in Sri Lanka King Kassapa V had the whole Abhidhamma Pitaka inscribed on gold plates and the first book set in gems while another king Vijayabahu used to study the Dhammasangani each morning before taking up his royal duties and composed a translation of it into Sinhala
On a cursory reading however this veneration given to the Abhidhamma seems difficult to understand
The texts appear to be merely a scholastic exercise in manipulating sets of doctrinal terms ponderous and tediously repetitive
The reason the Abhidhamma Pitaka is so deeply revered only becomes clear as a result of thorough study and profound reflection undertaken in the conviction that these ancient books have something significant to communicate
When one approaches the Abhidhamma treatises in such a spirit and gains some insight into their wide implications and organic unity one will find that they are attempting nothing less than to articulate a comprehensive vision of the totality of experienced reality a vision marked by extensiveness of range systematic completeness and analytical precision
From the standpoint of Theravada orthodoxy the system that they expound is not a figment of speculative thought not a mosaic put together out of metaphysical hypotheses but a disclosure of the true nature of existence as apprehended by a mind that has penetrated the totality of things both in depth and in the finest detail
Because it bears this character the Theravada tradition regards the Abhidhamma as the most perfect expression possible of the Buddha's unimpeded omniscient knowledge
It is his statement of the way things appear to the mind of a Fully Enlightened One ordered in accordance with the two poles of his teaching suffering and the cessation of suffering
The system that the Abhidhamma Pitaka articulates is simultaneously a philosophy a psychology and an ethics all integrated into the framework of a program for liberation
The Abhidhamma may be described as a philosophy because it proposes an ontology a perspective on the nature of the real
This perspective has been designated the dhamma theory
Briefly the dhamma theory maintains that ultimate reality consists of a multiplicity of elementary constituents called dhammas
The dhammas are not noumena hidden behind phenomena not things in themselves as opposed to mere appearances but the fundamental components of actuality
The dhammas fall into two broad classes the unconditioned dhamma which is solely Nibbana and the conditioned dhammas which are the momentary mental and material phenomena that constitute the process of experience
The familiar world of substantial objects and enduring persons is according to the dhamma theory a conceptual construct fashioned by the mind out of the raw data provided by the dhammas
The entities of our everyday frame of reference possess merely a consensual reality derivative upon the foundational stratum of the dhammas
It is the dhammas alone that possess ultimate reality determinate existence from their own side independent of the mind's conceptual processing of the data
Such a conception of the nature of the real seems to be already implicit in the Sutta Pitaka particularly in the Buddha's disquisitions on the aggregates sense bases elements dependent arising etc but it remains there tacitly in the background as the underpinning to the more pragmatically formulated teachings of the Suttas
Even in the Abhidhamma Pitaka itself the dhamma theory is not yet expressed as an explicit philosophical tenet this comes only later in the Commentaries
Nevertheless though as yet implicit the theory still comes into focus in its role as the regulating principle behind the Abhidhamma's more evident task the project of systemization
This project starts from the premise that to attain the wisdom that knows things as they really are a sharp wedge must be driven between those types of entities that possess ontological ultimacy that is the dhammas and those types of entities that exist only as conceptual constructs but are mistakenly grasped as ultimately real
Proceeding from this distinction the Abhidhamma posits a fixed number of dhammas as the building blocks of actuality most of which are drawn from the Suttas
It then sets out to define all the doctrinal terms used in the Suttas in ways that reveal their identity with the ontological ultimates recognized by the system
On the basis of these definitions it exhaustively classifies the dhammas into a net of predetermined categories and modes of relatedness which highlight their place within the system's structure
And since the system is held to be a true reflection of actuality this means that the classification pinpoints the place of each dhamma within the overall structure of actuality
The Abhidhamma's attempt to comprehend the nature of reality contrary to that of classical science in the West does not proceed from the standpoint of a neutral observer looking outwards towards the external world
The primary concern of the Abhidhamma is to understand the nature of experience and thus the reality on which it focuses is conscious reality the world as given in experience comprising both knowledge and the known in the widest sense
For this reason the philosophical enterprise of the Abhidhamma shades off into a phenomenological psychology
To facilitate the understanding of experienced reality the Abhidhamma embarks upon an elaborate analysis of the mind as it presents itself to introspective meditation
It classifies consciousness into a variety of types specifies the factors and functions of each type correlates them with their objects and physiological bases and shows how the different types of consciousness link up with each other and with material phenomena to constitute the ongoing process of experience
This analysis of mind is not motivated by theoretical curiosity but by the overriding practical aim of the Buddha's teaching the attainment of deliverance from suffering
Since the Buddha traces suffering to our tainted attitudes  a mental orientation rooted in greed hatred and delusion  the Abhidhamma's phenomenological psychology also takes on the character of a psychological ethics understanding the term ethics not in the narrow sense of a code of morality but as a complete guide to noble living and mental purification
Accordingly we find that the Abhidhamma distinguishes states of mind principally on the basis of ethical criteria the wholesome and the unwholesome the beautiful factors and the defilements
Its schematization of consciousness follows a hierarchical plan that corresponds to the successive stages of purity to which the Buddhist disciple attains by practice of the Buddha's path
This plan traces the refinement of the mind through the progression of meditative absorptions the finematerialsphere and immaterialsphere jhanas then through the stages of insight and the wisdom of the supramundane paths and fruits
Finally it shows the whole scale of ethical development to culminate in the perfection of purity attained with the mind's irreversible emancipation from all defilements
All three dimensions of the Abhidhamma  the philosophical the psychological and the ethical  derive their final justification from the cornerstone of the Buddha's teaching the program of liberation announced by the Four Noble Truths
The ontological survey of dhammas stems from the Buddha's injunction that the noble truth of suffering identified with the world of conditioned phenomena as a whole must be fully understood
The prominence of mental defilements and requisites of enlightenment in its schemes of categories indicative of its psychological and ethical concerns connects the Abhidhamma to the second and fourth noble truths the origin of suffering and the way leading to its end
And the entire taxonomy of dhammas elaborated by the system reaches its consummation in the unconditioned element which is Nibbana the third noble truth that of the cessation of suffering
The great Buddhist commentator Acariya Buddhaghosa explains the word Abhidhamma as meaning that which exceeds and is distinguished from the Dhamma the prefix abhi having the sense of preponderance and distinction and dhamma here signifying the teaching of the Sutta Pitaka
When the Abhidhamma is said to surpass the teaching of the Suttas this is not intended to suggest that the Suttanta teaching is defective in any degree or that the Abhidhamma proclaims some new revelation of esoteric doctrine unknown to the Suttas
Both the Suttas and the Abhidhamma are grounded upon the Buddha's unique doctrine of the Four Noble Truths and all the principles essential to the attainment of enlightenment are already expounded in the Sutta Pitaka
The difference between the two in no way concerns fundamentals but is rather partly a matter of scope and partly a matter of method
As to scope the Abhidhamma offers a thoroughness and completeness of treatment that cannot be found in the Sutta Pitaka
Acariya Buddhaghosa explains that in the Suttas such doctrinal categories as the five aggregates the twelve sense bases the eighteen elements and so forth are classified only partly while in the Abhidhamma Pitaka they are classified fully according to different schemes of classification some common to the Suttas others unique to the Abhidhamma
Thus the Abhidhamma has a scope and an intricacy of detail that set it apart from the Sutta Pitaka
The other major area of difference concerns method
The discourses contained in the Sutta Pitaka were expounded by the Buddha under diverse circumstances to listeners with very different capacities for comprehension
They are primarily pedagogical in intent set forth in the way that will be most effective in guiding the listener in the practice of the teaching and in arriving at a penetration of its truth
To achieve this end the Buddha freely employs the didactic means required to make the doctrine intelligible to his listeners
He uses simile and metaphor he exhorts advises and inspires he sizes up the inclinations and aptitudes of his audience and adjusts the presentation of the teaching so that it will awaken a positive response
For this reason the Suttanta method of teaching is described as pariyayadhammadesana the figurative or embellished discourse on the Dhamma
In contrast to the Suttas the Abhidhamma Pitaka is intended to divulge as starkly and directly as possible the totalistic system that underlies the Suttanta expositions and upon which the individual discourses draw
The Abhidhamma takes no account of the personal inclinations and cognitive capacities of the listeners it makes no concessions to particular pragmatic requirements
It reveals the architectonics of actuality in an abstract formalistic manner utterly devoid of literary embellishments and pedagogical expedients
Thus the Abhidhamma method is described as the nippariyayadhammadesana the literal or unembellished discourse on the Dhamma
This difference in technique between the two methods also influences their respective terminologies
In the Suttas the Buddha regularly makes use of conventional language and accepts conventional truth truth expressed in terms of entities that do not possess ontological ultimacy but can still be legitimately referred to them
Thus in the Suttas the Buddha speaks of I and you of man and woman of living beings persons and even self as though they were concrete realities
The Abhidhamma method of exposition however rigorously restricts itself to terms that are valid from the standpoint of ultimate truth dhammas their characteristics their functions and their relations
Thus in the Abhidhamma all such conceptual entities provisionally accepted in the Suttas for purposes of meaningful communication are resolved into their ontological ultimates into bare mental and material phenomena that are impermanent conditioned and dependently arisen empty of any abiding self or substance
But a qualification is necessary
When a distinction is drawn between the two methods this should be understood to be based on what is most characteristic of each Pitaka and should not be interpreted as an absolute dichotomy
To some degree the two methods overlap and interpenetrate
Thus in the Sutta Pitaka we find discourses that employ the strictly philosophical terminology of aggregates sense bases elements etc and thus come within the bounds of the Abhidhamma method
Again within the Abhidhamma Pitaka we find sections even a whole book that depart from the rigorous manner of expression and employ conventional terminology thus coming within the range of the Suttanta method
Apart from its strict adherence to the philosophical method of exposition the Abhidhamma makes a number of other noteworthy contributions integral to its task of systemization
One is the employment in the main books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka of a matika  a matrix or schedule of categories  as the blueprint for the entire edifice
This matrix which comes at the very beginning of the Dhammasangani as a preface to the Abhidhamma Pitaka proper consists of modes of classification special to the Abhidhamma method
Of these twentytwo are triads sets of three terms into which the fundamental dhammas are to be distributed the remaining hundred are dyads sets of two terms used as a basis for classification
The matrix serves as a kind of grid for sorting out the complex manifold of experience in accordance with principles determined by the purposes of the Dhamma
For example the triads include such sets as states that are wholesome unwholesome indeterminate states associated with pleasant feeling painful feeling neutral feeling states that are kamma results productive of kamma results neither and so forth
The dyads include such sets as states that are roots not roots states concomitant with roots not so concomitant states that are conditioned unconditioned states that are mundane supramundane and so forth
By means of its selection of categories the matrix embraces the totality of phenomena illuminating it from a variety of angles philosophical psychological and ethical in nature
A second distinguishing feature of the Abhidhamma is the dissection of the apparently continuous stream of consciousness into a succession of discrete evanescent cognitive events called cittas each a complex unity involving consciousness itself as the basic awareness of an object and a constellation of mental factors exercising more specialized tasks in the act of cognition
Such a view of consciousness at least in outline can readily be derived from the Sutta Pitaka's analysis of experience into the five aggregates among which the four mental aggregates are always inseparably conjoined but the conception remains there merely suggestive
In the Abhidhamma Pitaka the suggestion is not simply picked up but is expanded into an extraordinarily detailed and coherent picture of the functioning of consciousness both in its microscopic immediacy and in its extended continuity from life to life
A third contribution arises from the urge to establish order among the welter of technical terms making up the currency of Buddhist discourse
In defining each of the dhammas the Abhidhamma texts collate long lists of synonyms drawn mostly from the Suttas
This method of definition shows how a single dhamma may enter under different names into different sets of categories
For example among the defilements the mental factor of greed may be found as the taint of sensual desire the taint of existence the bodily knot of covetousness clinging to sensual pleasures the hindrance of sensual desire etc among the requisites of enlightenment the mental factor of wisdom may be found as the faculty and power of wisdom the enlightenment factor of investigation of states the path factor of right view etc
In establishing these correspondences the Abhidhamma helps to exhibit the interconnections between doctrinal terms that might not be apparent from the Suttas themselves
In the process it also provides a precisionmade tool for interpreting the Buddha's discourses
The Abhidhamma conception of consciousness further results in a new primary scheme for classifying the ultimate constituents of existence a scheme which eventually in the later Abhidhamma literature takes precedence over the schemes inherited from the Suttas such as the aggregates sense bases and elements
In the Abhidhamma Pitaka the latter categories still loom large but the view of mind as consisting of momentary concurrences of consciousness and its concomitants leads to a fourfold method of classification more congenial to the system
This is the division of actuality into the four ultimate realities consciousness mental factors material phenomena and Nibbana the first three comprising conditioned reality and the last the unconditioned element
The last novel feature of the Abhidhamma method to be noted here  contributed by the final book of the Pitaka the Patthana  is a set of twentyfour conditional relations laid down for the purpose of showing how the ultimate realities are welded into orderly processes
This scheme of conditions supplies the necessary complement to the analytical approach that dominates the earlier books of the Abhidhamma
The method of analysis proceeds by dissecting apparent wholes into their component parts thereby exposing their voidness of any indivisible core that might qualify as self or substance
The synthetic method plots the conditional relations of the bare phenomena obtained by analysis to show that they are not isolated selfcontained units but nodes in a vast multilayered web of interrelated interdependent events
Taken in conjunction the analytical method of the earlier treatises of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and the synthetic method of the Patthana establish the essential unity of the twin philosophical principles of Buddhism nonself or egolessness and dependent arising or conditionality
Thus the foundation of the Abhidhamma methodology remains in perfect harmony with the insights that lie at the heart of the entire Dhamma
Although modern critical scholarship attempts to explain the formation of the Abhidhamma by a gradual evolutionary process Theravada orthodoxy assigns its genesis to the Buddha himself
According to the Great Commentary quoted by Acariya Buddhaghosa What is known as Abhidhamma is not the province nor the sphere of a disciple it is the province the sphere of the Buddhas The commentarial tradition holds moreover that it was not merely the spirit of the Abhidhamma but the letter as well that was already realized and expounded by the Buddha during his lifetime
The Atthasalini relates that in the fourth week after the Enlightenment while the Blessed One was still dwelling in the vicinity of the Bodhi Tree he sat in a jewel house in the northwest direction
This jewel house was not literally a house made of precious stones but was the place where he contemplated the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka
He contemplated their contents in turn beginning with the Dhammasangani but while investigating the first six books his body did not emit rays
However upon coming to the Patthana when he began to contemplate the twentyfour universal conditional relations of root object and so on his omniscience certainly found its opportunity therein
For as the great fish Timiratipingala finds room only in the great ocean yojanas in depth so his omniscience truly finds room only in the Great Book
Rays of six colors  indigo golden red white tawny and dazzling  issued from the Teacher's body as he was contemplating the subtle and abstruse Dhamma by his omniscience which had found such opportunity
Theravada orthodoxy thus maintains that the Abhidhamma Pitaka is authentic Word of the Buddha in this respect differing from an early rival school the Sarvastivadins
This school also had an Abhidhamma Pitaka consisting of seven books considerably different in detail from the Theravada treatises
According to the Sarvastivadins the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka were composed by Buddhist disciples several being attributed to authors who appeared generations after the Buddha
The Theravada school however holds that the Blessed One himself expounded the books of the Abhidhamma except for the detailed refutation of deviant views in the Kathavatthu which was the work of the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa during the reign of Emperor Asoka
The Pali Commentaries apparently drawing upon an old oral tradition maintain that the Buddha expounded the Abhidhamma not in the human world to his human disciples but to the assembly of devas or gods in the Tavatimsa heaven
According to this tradition just prior to his seventh annual rains retreat the Blessed One ascended to the Tavatimsa heaven and there seated on the Pandukambala stone at the foot of the Paricchattaka tree for the three months of the rains he taught the Abhidhamma to the devas who had assembled from the ten thousand worldsystems
He made the chief recipient of the teaching his mother Mahamayadevi who had been reborn as a deva
The reason the Buddha taught the Abhidhamma in the deva world rather than in the human realm it is said is because in order to give a complete picture of the Abhidhamma it has to be expounded from the beginning to the end to the same audience in a single session
Since the full exposition of the Abhidhamma requires three months only devas and Brahmas could receive it in unbroken continuity for they alone are capable of remaining in one posture for such a length of time
However each day to sustain his body the Buddha would descend to the human world to go on almsround in the northern region of Uttarakuru
After collecting almsfood he went to the shore of Anotatta Lake to partake of his meal
The Elder Sariputta the General of the Dhamma would meet the Buddha there and receive a synopsis of the teaching given that day in the deva world Then to him the Teacher gave the method saying 'Sariputta so much doctrine has been shown' Thus the giving of the method was to the chief disciple who was endowed with analytical knowledge as though the Buddha stood on the edge of the shore and pointed out the ocean with his open hand
To the Elder also the doctrine taught by the Blessed One in hundreds and thousands of methods became very clear
Having learned the Dhamma taught him by the Blessed One Sariputta in turn taught it to his own circle of pupils and thus the textual recension of the Abhidhamma Pitaka was established
To the Venerable Sariputta is ascribed the textual order of the Abhidhamma treatises as well as the numerical series in the Patthana
Perhaps we should see in these admissions of the Atthasalini an implicit acknowledgement that while the philosophical vision of the Abhidhamma and its basic architecture originate from the Buddha the actual working out of the details and perhaps even the prototypes of the texts themselves are to be ascribed to the illustrious Chief Disciple and his entourage of students
In other early Buddhist schools too the Abhidhamma is closely connected with the Venerable Sariputta who in some traditions is regarded as the literal author of Abhidhamma treatises
A brief outline of the contents of the seven canonical Abhidhamma books will provide some insight into the plethora of textual material to be condensed and summarized by the Abhidhammattha Sangaha
The first book the Dhammasangani is the fountainhead of the entire system
The title may be translated Enumeration of Phenomena and the work does in fact undertake to compile an exhaustive catalog of the ultimate constituents of existence
Opening with the matika the schedule of categories which serves as the framework for the whole Abhidhamma the text proper is divided into four chapters
The first States of Consciousness takes up about half of the book and unfolds as an analysis of the first triad in the matika that of the wholesome the unwholesome and the indeterminate
To supply that analysis the text enumerates types of consciousness classified by way of their ethical quality
Each type of consciousness is in turn dissected into its concomitant mental factors which are individually defined in full
The second chapter On Matter continues the inquiry into the ethically indeterminate by enumerating and classifying the different types of material phenomena
The third chapter called The Summary offers concise explanations of all the terms in the Abhidhamma matrix and the Suttanta matrix as well
Finally a concluding Synopsis provides a more condensed explanation of the Abhidhamma matrix but omits the Suttanta matrix
The Vibhanga the Book of Analysis consists of eighteen chapters each a selfcontained dissertation dealing in turn with the following aggregates sense bases elements truths faculties dependent arising foundations of mindfulness supreme efforts means to accomplishment factors of enlightenment the eightfold path jhanas illimitables training rules analytical knowledges kinds of knowledge minor points and the heart of the doctrine a psychocosmic topography of the Buddhist universe
Most of the chapters in the Vibhanga though not all involve three subsections an analysis according to the methodology of the Suttas an analysis according to the methodology of the Abhidhamma proper and an interrogation section which applies the categories of the matrix to the subject under investigation
The Dhatukatha the Discourse on Elements is written entirely in catechism form
It discusses all phenomena with reference to the three schemata of aggregates sense bases and elements seeking to determine whether and to what extent they are included or not included in them and whether they are associated with them or dissociated from them
The Puggalapaññatti Concepts of Individuals is the one book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka that is more akin to the method of the Suttas than to the Abhidhamma proper
The work begins with a general enumeration of types of concepts and this suggests that it was originally intended as a supplement to the other books in order to take account of the conceptual realities excluded by the strict application of the Abhidhamma method
The bulk of the work provides formal definitions of different types of individuals
It has ten chapters the first deals with single types of individuals the second with pairs the third with groups of three etc
The Kathavatthu Points of Controversy is a polemical treatise ascribed to the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa
He is said to have compiled it during the time of Emperor Asoka years after the Buddha's Parinibbana in order to refute the heterodox opinions of the Buddhist schools outside the Theravadin fold
The Commentaries defend its inclusion in the Canon by holding that the Buddha himself foreseeing the errors that would arise laid down the outline of rebuttal which Moggaliputta Tissa merely filled in according to the Master's intention
The Yamaka the Book of Pairs has the purpose of resolving ambiguities and defining the precise usage of technical terms
It is so called owing to its method of treatment which throughout employs the dual grouping of a question and its converse formulation
For instance the first pair of questions in the first chapter runs thus Are all wholesome phenomena wholesome roots
And are all wholesome roots wholesome phenomena The book contains ten chapters roots aggregates sense bases elements truths formations latent dispositions consciousness phenomena and faculties
The Patthana the Book of Conditional Relations is probably the most important work of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and thus is traditionally designated the Great Treatise
Gigantic in extent as well as in substance the book comprises five volumes totalling pages in the Burmesescript Sixth Council edition
The purpose of the Patthana is to apply its scheme of twentyfour conditional relations to all the phenomena incorporated in the Abhidhamma matrix
The main body of the work has four great divisions origination according to the positive method according to the negative method according to the positivenegative method and according to the negativepositive method
Each of these in turn has six subdivisions origination of triads of dyads of dyads and triads combined of triads and dyads combined of triads and triads combined and of dyads and dyads combined
Within this pattern of twentyfour sections the twentyfour modes of conditionality are applied in due order to all the phenomena of existence in all their conceivable permutations
Despite its dry and tabular format even from a profane humanistic viewpoint the Patthana can easily qualify as one of the truly monumental products of the human mind astounding in its breadth of vision its rigorous consistency and its painstaking attention to detail
To Theravada orthodoxy it is the most eloquent testimony to the Buddha's unimpeded knowledge of omniscience
The books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka have inspired a voluminous mass of exegetical literature composed in order to fill out by way of explanation and exemplification the scaffoldings erected by the canonical texts
The most important works of this class are the authorized commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa
These are three in number the Atthasalini The Expositor the commentary to the Dhammasangani the Sammohavinodani The Dispeller of Delusion the commentary to the Vibhanga and the Pañcappakarana Atthakatha the combined commentary to the other five treatises
To this same stratum of literature also belongs the Visuddhimagga The Path of Purification also composed by Buddhaghosa
Although this last work is primarily an encyclopedic guide to meditation its chapters on the soil of understanding lay out the theory to be mastered prior to developing insight and thus constitute in effect a compact dissertation on Abhidhamma
Each of the commentaries in turn has its subcommentary by an elder of Sri Lanka named Acariya Ananda and these in turn each have a subsubcommentary by Ananda's pupil Dhammapala
When the authorship of the Commentaries is ascribed to Acariya Buddhaghosa it should not be supposed that they are in any way original compositions or even original attempts to interpret traditional material
They are rather carefully edited versions of the vast body of accumulated exegetical material that Buddhaghosa found at the Mahavihara in Anuradhapura
This material must have preceded the great commentator by centuries representing the collective efforts of generations of erudite Buddhist teachers to elucidate the meaning of the canonical Abhidhamma
While it is tempting to try to discern evidence of historical development in the Commentaries over and beyond the ideas embedded in the Abhidhamma Pitaka it is risky to push this line too far for a great deal of the canonical Abhidhamma seems to require the Commentaries to contribute the unifying context in which the individual elements hang together as parts of a systematic whole and without which they lose important dimensions of meaning
It is thus not unreasonable to assume that a substantial portion of the commentarial apparatus originated in close proximity to the canonical Abhidhamma and was transmitted concurrently with the latter though lacking the stamp of finality it was open to modification and amplification in a way that the canonical texts were not
Bearing this in mind we might briefly note a few of the Abhidhammic conceptions that are characteristic of the Commentaries but either unknown or recessive in the Abhidhamma Pitaka itself
One is the detailed account of the cognitive process
While this conception seems to be tacitly recognized in the canonical books it now comes to be drawn out for use as an explanatory tool in its own right
The functions of the cittas the different types of consciousness are specified and in time the cittas themselves come to be designated by way of their functions
The term khana moment replaces the canonical samaya occasion as the basic unit for delimiting the occurrence of events and the duration of a material phenomenon is determined to be seventeen moments of mental phenomena
The division of a moment into three submoments  arising presence and dissolution  also seems to be new to the Commentaries
The organization of material phenomena into groups though implied by the distinction between the primary elements of matter and derived matter is first spelled out in the Commentaries as is the specification of the heartbase as the material basis for mind element and mindconsciousness element
The Commentaries introduce many of the categories for classifying kamma and work out the detailed correlations between kamma and its results
They also close off the total number of mental factors
The phrase in the Dhammasangani or whatever other conditionally arisen immaterial phenomena there are on that occasion apparently envisages an openended universe of mental factors which the Commentaries delimit by specifying the orwhatever states
Again the Commentaries consummate the dhamma theory by supplying the formal definition of dhammas as things which bear their own intrinsic nature
The task of defining specific dhammas is finally rounded off by the extensive employment of the fourfold defining device of characteristic function manifestation and proximate cause a device derived from a pair of old exegetical texts the Petakopadesa and the Nettipakarana
As the Abhidhamma system already massive in its canonical version grew in volume and complexity it must have become increasingly unwieldy for purposes of study and comprehension
Thus at a certain stage in the evolution of Theravada Buddhist thought the need must have become felt for concise summaries of the Abhidhamma as a whole in order to provide the novice student of the subject with a clear picture of its main outlines  faithfully and thoroughly yet without an unmanageable mass of detail
To meet this need there began to appear perhaps as early as the fifth century and continuing well through the twelfth short manuals or compendia of the Abhidhamma
In Burma these are called letthan or littlefinger manuals of which there are nine
Among these the work that has dominated Abhidhamma studies from about the twelfth century to the present day is the first mentioned the Abhidhammattha Sangaha The Compendium of Things contained in the Abhidhamma Its popularity may be accounted for by its remarkable balance between concision and comprehensiveness
Within its short scope all the essentials of the Abhidhamma are briefly and carefully summarized
Although the book's manner of treatment is extremely terse even to the point of obscurity when read alone when studied under a qualified teacher or with the aid of an explanatory guide it leads the student confidently through the winding maze of the system to a clear perception of its entire structure
For this reason throughout the Theravada Buddhist world the Abhidhammattha Sangaha is always used as the first textbook in Abhidhamma studies
In Buddhist monasteries especially in Burma novices and young bhikkhus are required to learn the Sangaha by heart before they are permitted to study the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and its Commentaries
Detailed information about the author of the manual Acariya Anuruddha is virtually nonexistent
He is regarded as the author of two other manuals cited above and it is believed in Buddhist countries that he wrote altogether nine compendia of which only these three have survived
The Paramatthavinicchaya is written in an elegant style of Pali and attains a high standard of literary excellence
According to the colophon its author was born in Kaveri in the state of Kañcipura in South India
Acariya Buddhadatta and Acariya Buddhaghosa are also said to have resided in the same area and the subcommentator Acariya Dhammapala was probably a native of the region
There is evidence that for several centuries Kañcipura had been an important center of Theravada Buddhism from which learned bhikkhus went to Sri Lanka for further study
It is not known exactly when Acariya Anuruddha lived and wrote his manuals
An old monastic tradition regards him as having been a fellow student of Acariya Buddhadatta under the same teacher which would place him in the fifth century
According to this tradition the two elders wrote their respective books the Abhidhammattha Sangaha and the Abhidhammavatara as gifts of gratitude to their teacher who remarked Buddhadatta has filled a room with all kinds of treasure and locked the door while Anuruddha has also filled a room with treasure but left the door open Modern scholars however do not endorse this tradition maintaining on the basis of the style and content of Anuruddha's work that he could not have lived earlier than the eighth century more probably between the tenth and early twelfth centuries
In the colophon to the Abhidhammattha Sangaha Acariya Anuruddha states that he wrote the manual at the Mulasoma Monastery which all exegetical traditions place in Sri Lanka
There are several ways to reconcile this fact with the concluding stanzas of the Paramatthavinicchaya which state that he was born in Kañcipura
One hypothesis is that he was of South Indian descent but came to Sri Lanka where he wrote the Sangaha
Another advanced by GP
Malalasekera holds that he was a native of Sri Lanka who spent time at Kañcipura
Still a third hypothesis proposed by Ven
AP
Buddhadatta Mahathera asserts that there were two different monks named Anuruddha one in Sri Lanka who was the author of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha another in Kañcipura who wrote the Paramatthavinicchaya
Owing to its extreme concision the Abhidhammattha Sangaha cannot be easily understood without explanation
Therefore to elucidate its terse and pithy synopsis of the Abhidhamma philosophy a great number of tikas or commentaries have been written upon it
In fact this work has probably stimulated more commentaries than any other Pali text written not only in the Pali language but also in Burmese Sinhala Thai etc
Since the fifteenth century Burma has been the international center of Abhidhamma studies and therefore we find many commentaries written on it by Burmese scholars both in Pali and in Burmese
Commentaries on the Sangaha in Pali alone number nineteen of which the following are the most important
The Abhidhammattha Sangaha contains nine chapters
It opens by enumerating the four ultimate realities  consciousness mental factors matter and Nibbana
The detailed analysis of these is the project set for its first six chapters
Chapter I is the Compendium of Consciousness which defines and classifies the and cittas or types of consciousness
In scope this first chapter covers the same territory as the States of Consciousness chapter of the Dhammasangani but it differs in approach
The canonical work begins with an analysis of the first triad in the matika and therefore initially classifies consciousness on the basis of the three ethical qualities of wholesome unwholesome and indeterminate then within those categories it subdivides consciousness on the basis of plane into the categories of sense sphere finematerial sphere immaterial sphere and supramundane
The Sangaha on the other hand not being bound to the matika first divides consciousness on the basis of plane and then subdivides it on the basis of ethical quality
The second chapter the Compendium of Mental Factors first enumerates the fiftytwo cetasikas or concomitants of consciousness divided into four classes universals occasionals unwholesome factors and beautiful factors
Thereafter the factors are investigated by two complimentary methods first the method of association which takes the mental factors as the unit of inquiry and elicits the types of consciousness with which they are individually associated and second the method of inclusion or combination which takes the types of consciousness as the unit of inquiry and elicits the mental factors that enter into the constitution of each
This chapter again draws principally upon the first chapter of the Dhammasangani
The third chapter entitled Compendium of the Miscellaneous classifies the types of consciousness along with their factors with respect to six categories root feeling function door object and base
The first three chapters are concerned principally with the structure of consciousness both internally and in relation to external variables
In contrast the next two chapters deal with the dynamics of consciousness that is with its modes of occurrence
According to the Abhidhamma consciousness occurs in two distinct but intertwining modes  as active process and as passive flow
Chapter IV explores the nature of the cognitive process Chapter V the passive processfreed flow which it prefaces with a survey of the traditional Buddhist cosmology
The exposition here is largely based upon the Abhidhamma Commentaries
Chapter VI Compendium of Matter turns from the mental realm to the material world
Based primarily on the second chapter of the Dhammasangani it enumerates the types of material phenomena classifies them in various ways and explains their modes of origination
It also introduces the commentarial notion of material groups which it treats in detail and describes the occurrence of material processes in the different realms of existence
This chapter concludes with a short section on the fourth ultimate reality Nibbana the only unconditioned element in the system
With the sixth chapter Acariya Anuruddha has completed his analytical exposition of the four ultimate realities but there remain several important subjects which must be explained to give a complete picture of the Abhidhamma
These are taken up in the last three chapters
Chapter VII the Compendium of Categories arranges the ultimate realities into a variety of categorical schemes that fall under four broad headings a compendium of defilements a compendium of mixed categories which include items of different ethical qualities a compendium of the requisites of enlightenment and a compendium of the whole an allinclusive survey of the Abhidhamma ontology
This chapter leans heavily upon the Vibhanga and to some extent upon the Dhammasangani
Chapter VIII the Compendium of Conditionality is introduced to include the Abhidhamma teaching on the interrelatedness of physical and mental phenomena thereby complementing the analytical treatment of the ultimate realities with a synthetical treatment laying bare their functional correlations
The exposition summarily presents two alternative approaches to conditionality found in the Pali canon
One is the method of dependent arising prominent in the Suttas and analyzed from both Suttanta and Abhidhamma angles in the Vibhanga
This method examines conditionality in terms of the causeandresult pattern that maintains bondage to samsara the cycle of birth and death
The other is the method of the Patthana with its twentyfour conditional relations
This chapter concludes with a brief account of concepts thereby drawing in the Puggalapaññatti at least by implication
The ninth and final chapter of the Sangaha is concerned not with theory but with practice
This is the Compendium of Meditation Subjects
This chapter functions as a kind of summary of the Visuddhimagga
It concisely surveys all the methods of meditation exhaustively explained in the latter work and it sets forth condensed accounts of the stages of progress in both systems of meditation concentration and insight
Like the masterwork it summarizes it concludes with an account of the four types of enlightened individuals and the attainments of fruition and cessation
This arrangement of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha perhaps serves to underscore the ultimate soteriological intent of the Abhidhamma
All the theoretical analysis of mind and matter finally converges upon the practice of meditation and the practice culminates in the attainment of the supreme goal of Buddhism the liberation of the mind by nonclinging
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The Satipatthana Sutta the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness is generally regarded as the canonical Buddhist text with the fullest instructions on the system of meditation unique to the Buddha's own dispensation
The practice of Satipatthana meditation centers on the methodical cultivation of one simple mental faculty readily available to all of us at any moment
This is the faculty of mindfulness the capacity for attending to the content of our experience as it becomes manifest in the immediate present
What the Buddha shows in the sutta is the tremendous but generally hidden power inherent in this simple mental function a power that can unfold all the mind's potentials culminating in final deliverance from suffering
To exercise this power however mindfulness must be systematically cultivated and the sutta shows exactly how this is to be done
The key to the practice is to combine energy mindfulness and clear comprehension in attending to the phenomena of mind and body summed up in the four arousings of mindfulness body feelings consciousness and mental objects
Most contemporary meditation teachers explain Satipatthana meditation as a means for generating insight
While this is certainly a valid claim we should also recognize that satipatthana meditation also generates concentration
Unlike the forms of meditation which cultivate concentration and insight sequentially Satipatthana brings both these faculties into being together though naturally in the actual process of development concentration will have to gain a certain degree of stability before insight can exercise its penetrating function
In Satipatthana the act of attending to each occasion of experience as it occurs in the moment fixes the mind firmly on the object
The continuous attention to the object even when the object itself is constantly changing stabilizes the mind in concentration while the observation of the object in terms of its qualities and characteristics brings into being the insight knowledges
To practice Satipatthana successfully a student will generally require a sound theoretical knowledge of the practice along with actual training preferably under the guidance of a qualified teacher
The best source of theoretical knowledge indeed the indispensable source is the Satipatthana Sutta itself
However though the sutta is clear and comprehensible enough as it stands the instructions it offers are extremely concise often squeezing into a few simple guidelines directions that might need several pages to explain in a way adequate for successful practice
For this reason from an early period the ancient masters of Buddhist meditation began to supply more detailed instructions based on their own practical experience
These instructions eventually evolved into a lengthy commentary on the Satipatthana Sutta which was then incorporated into the complete commentaries on the two collections in which the sutta appears namely the Digha Nikaya and the Majjhima Nikaya
The two commentaries that have come down to us today based on the older Sinhala commentaries are called the Sumangalavilasini and the Papañcasudani
These commentaries are ascribed to Acariya Buddhaghosa an Indian thera who worked in Sri Lanka in the th century AC but are securely based on the old commentaries which record the explanations devised by the ancient masters of the Dhamma
The commentary has in turn been further elucidated by a subcommentary or tika by Acariya Dhammapala who worked in South India near Kancipura perhaps a century or two after the time of Buddhaghosa
This book The Way of Mindfulness contains all the authorized instructions on Satipatthana meditation passed down in the Theravada tradition the Satipatthana Sutta stemming from the Buddha himself the commentary by Buddhaghosa and selections from the tika by Dhammapala
While the volume of material found here will certainly exceed the amount a beginner needs to start the practice the book will prove itself useful at successive stages and will eventually become a trusted friend and advisor in all its manifold details
Thus the reader should not be intimidated by the detail and the sometimes formidable technical terminology but should continue reading selecting whatever material is found useful and leaving until later whatever presently seems difficult to grasp
The book was originally compiled in the late s by Ven
Soma Thera a bhikkhu of Sri Lanka and has been maintained in print since the early s
The Buddhist Publication Society in Kandy has published the work since in several editions
This latest version contains several minor changes in terminology authorized by the present writer
Christine Chan and her friends in the Buddhist Communities in Malaysia as well as Rev
Suddhinand Janthagul from Thailand who helped in the proofreading of the Pali texts deserve our congratulations and appreciation for their hard work in transcribing the book and for making it available for free distribution
I am sure this book will prove an invaluable road map for anyone who has entered the steep and rugged road of Satipatthana meditation leading to final deliverance from suffering
Directing attention to the four truly genuine stages of arahantship in this universe the Buddha says Here O Bhikkhus are the First Ascetic the Second Ascetic the Third Ascetic and the Fourth Ascetic empty of Ascetics are the other ways of thought
Resound thus O Bhikkhus your swelling diapason of just rejoicing
Later the Buddha states why he affirms that nowhere outside his System of Deliverance are genuine arahants to be found
It is because the Goal Perfection is One not Multiple and the views of man are many
In a Buddha's system of Deliverance there are no views instead there is right understanding of things as they really are
The Tathagata O Bhikkhus the arahant the Fully Enlightened One declares himself fully aware of all forms of clinging and he makes known to perfection the science of the same
In a doctrine and discipline of this sort O Bhikkhus what joy there is in the Buddha is to be proclaimed perfect what joy there is in the Dhamma is to be proclaimed perfect what observance of Virtue there is proclaimed perfect what pleasure and happiness there be amongst fellowdisciples is proclaimed perfect
And for what reason
Because truly O Bhikkhus clearly explained leading to the Deliverance conducive to the Peace taught by a Supreme Sambuddha
In the subject now presented to the reader The Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness  the peerless Teacher gives an aspirant details of how to use the weapon of Mind if he wishes to make an end of the Bonds of Suffering
The reader will note a certain abruptness almost jerkiness of expression in the text
This is even more so in the commentary
This effect is brought about partly by the concise way in which a complex subject of many details is treated
But actually the text reflects the course of the aspirant's progress in watchful thinking even as verses in a gallop rhythm can picture the speeding rider and the steady beat of a horse's hooves
He who begins this practice of Satipatthana finds that indeed he needs must rein in his thoughts sharply and often
No racing steed can equal thought which now here looking at the Temple Bo Tree is in a moment at Buddhagaya's Shrine and next instant visualizing the poplars in an English park
But as a rider slides as it were into the way of its doing on a bicycle or a trotting horse  so in this practice the Yogi gradually falls in with its way till after a while its working seems smooth and clear
The Translator is a Bhikkhu well qualified for the task
For him it was a happy labor of love and a tribute to his Teachers in that secluded manycelled Arama in far Burma where he and another young Bhikkhu from Lanka held out to the last in a long course of instruction in Satipatthana method
A Maha Thera as wellknown there as he was qualified in learning and temperament supervised the course
The Discipline was strict but just and the Teacher firm compassionate and a seer beyond the normal
The lodging and diet were simple to a degree
The Maha Thera's own teacher of old master of meditation and expert in practical teaching for all that he was a layman was deputed to instruct the yogins
Like all older Burmese he had aforetime himself been a wearer of the yellow robe his experience was vast and his learning profound
The course started with a crowd of aspirants many of whom were pious lay folk but as the weeks passed and endurance gave way the class of pupils was sadly thinned out
Some after a time gave up the effort
Others perhaps through a difference in preparation or temperament completed the course early
Others again went on and on with the training until at last the two earnest ones from Lanka were left to face the calm Teacher whose evenness of mind was in no way disturbed by the recurring phenomenon of dwindling enthusiasm or numbers in those courses of hard life and abstruse thought
The training was beyond price
Keener at the close than even at the start of that course our Translator today is yet happily and earnestly following that trail
These are indeed difficult times for layman and Bhikkhu alike
The seven year maximum has not yet passed and indeed we are woefully weak for the Sutta's seven days minimum for results  that is arahantship or failing that the Anagami stage of Awakening
Yet the strenuous will press on 
 Theragatha 
In  while living with my teacher in Burma I had the opportunity of knowing the practice of the Buddhist method of meditation called The Development of Insight
The enthusiasm with which many persons there took up the practice and continued in it and the kindliness and understanding which prevailed among those who had gone through the course of training patiently to the end made me and a fellowbhikkhu from Lanka to take up the practice
Many began to train along with us
Some of them gave up the effort in a short time and some continued the practice to the end
The time taken to complete the course varied according to the individual
We were among the last to complete the training
The details and the spirit of the method are shown in the commentaryexcerpts translated here
These were at first intended for the use of a few friends
Later when a group of sympathetic students of the Dhamma decided to get these printed a translation of the Discourse had to be included to make the compilation coherent to the general reader
I wish to record here my warm appreciation of the kindness of the members of the Saccanubodha Samiti Nandana Asgiriya Kandy especially Mr
Richard Abeyasekere the Hon
Secretary and Mr
W
J
Soysa in getting this book published and encouraging me in my humble effort to serve the Dhamma
This compilation was begun with the Ven
Bhikkhu Nyanaponika and carried out largely according to his suggestions
To him and to the Ven
Bhikkhu Kheminda I am deeply thankful for the kindly help they gave me while I was engaged in this work
I also wish to record here my sincere thanks to the Ven
Bhikkhu Dhammapala for his valued assistance in reading over the proofs carefully and for the active interest he has taken in my work
The Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness and the excerpts from its commentary given here deal with the method of training for insight according to the Buddha's teaching
Insight is the understanding of the true nature of things by which a complete transfiguring of mental life takes place in the seer and by which he is lifted out of the groove of birth and death
The understanding of the nature of things is the sure knowledge of the transience and subjection to sorrow of all component things and of the emptiness of all things as regards ens self or essence
This last knowledge of the essential emptiness of all things is called the realization of the supreme void
By it the conception of a self and the craving and suffering which spring from that conception are abandoned
It marks the limit of the spiritually attainable in the Buddha's Dispensation
By it is accomplished emancipation from all bondage to ignorance and the attainment of the highest happiness
In the Way of Analytical Knowledge it is said What is the supreme void
The quieting of all kammical conformations the giving up of all clinging to rebirth detachment cessation Nibbana  this is the supreme void The Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness is for reaching that summum bonum of the Buddhas
Mindfulness is said to have nonsuperficiality as its salient characteristic the absence of confusion as its function and the state of being turned towards the object as its manifestation
It is also called the nonnegligence which indicates the state of unremitting alertness of the yogavacara the proficient in spiritual endeavor
Clear and strong mindfulness is conjoined with wisdom and is called the prudence of mindfulness
It is then pure cognition the cognition which is free from discrimination that proceeds from delusion
It is such cognition that is indicated in the teaching of the Buddha to Bahiya Daruciriya which says that to one there must be in what is seen just the seen in the heard just the heard in the contacted just the contacted in the apperceived just the apperceived so that one may be free from lust hatred and delusion and from bondage to this or any other world
This objective way of looking at a thing freed from considerations of the personal reactions to that thing is the pith of the method and constitutes what is called knowing as it is
Also by its quality of reckoning just what is present mindfulness cuts down discursive thought and prepares the mind to take in the actual characteristics of the cognized objects
In this sense mindfulness lets the objects speak for themselves and unfold their nature
Thus it predisposes and opens the mind to the impressions of truth induces mental pliancy and the mood of spiritual receptivity the basis of highest intuition
The Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness sets forth the whole duty of the meditator and provides for every phase of the process of training for insight
It is strenuous wholetime work and only resolute hearts in whom the consciousness of life's suffering runs deep could hope to pursue it to the end the attainment of arahantship
The Buddha's Goal of Emancipation is attained with the extirpation of all craving and spiritual ignorance
Who wins it gains lasting mental strength and contentment
It is the source of real peace and equanimity
Lack of freedom consists of subjection to hate lust and ignorance
Virtuous conduct wipes out hate the calm of skillful concentration casts out lust and wise understanding of the world within oneself dispels ignorance
The Way of Mindfulness does all this it is designed for the attainment of fullest inner freedom
This is the only satisfying way for the seeker of truth when the diffuseness of the external world with its thin layer of culture comfort and allurement ceases to be interesting and is found to lack true value
The seeker knows to a certainty that what he wants is to be found in the realm of the spirit
There alone he feels he would reach the vision of oneness of the enduring by transcending the diversity of change
And what he wants is inward integrity intactness inviolability based on the unshakable deliverance of the mind from the sway of all conditioned phenomena
To this the Way of Mindfulness leads by showing him how to penetrate into the singleness of nature of the Supreme Void Nibbana which is permeated with the one taste of liberation
The Way of Mindfulness reaches the first stage of supramundane fulfillment with what is technically known as entry into the stream or the arrival at the unswerving path to the Goal
Before that there could be serious deviations but not from that point where the First Direct Glimpse of the Goal is obtained
The Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness deals with the preparatory part the Mundane Way of Mindfulness which is of immediate practical value to worldlings still in the valleys of the spirit far from the supramundane peaks
Mindfulness is a process an event and an arising and a passing away momentarily like any other mental property
Although it is a basic power a shelter and a refuge of the mind the role it plays in the drama of transition from Ignorance to Knowledge differs considerably according to the other properties of mind with which it works
For instance in association with Right Understanding and its group which comprises wisdom intense knowledge discrimination research investigation of things consideration close examination pondering over learning skillfulness keenwittedness analysis reflection vision sagacity the discernment that leads aright penetrative insight and clear comprehension it is rational
And when it is combined with Right Concentration and its cognates such as mental steadfastness serenity immovability quietude nondistraction and pacification it is intuitive
But the intuitive or rational role does not preclude mindfulness from communicating its regulative impulse of moderation to the mind at all times
It is the property which makes for proper proportion in the response of the mind to mental objects
Mindfulness as memory is indicated by such terms as annussati  calling to mind patissati  remembrance dharanata  bearing in mind saranata  recollection
In this connection the process of mindfulness is compared to the Treasurer of a King who reminds the King of the royal possessions in detail daily at night and in the morning
The mindfulness of the aspirant to the Highest Goal of Liberation from Suffering reminds him of Virtue Concentration and Wisdom which constitute the possessions of the Good Life in the Dispensation of the Buddha
The value of the recollective activity of mindfulness is seen in the increasing awareness of the essentials of holy living in the aspirant's mind and the growing strength of purpose for realizing these within himself
Above that stands mindfulness as the activity that takes care of the mind and protects it
It is compared to a wagon driver who ties the oxen to the wagon's yoke greases the axle and drives the wagon making the oxen go gently
In this activity mindfulness looks to the smooth working and movement of the mind and takes notice of the processes both skillful and not taking place in the consciousness
In the more complex forms it is the selective and integrative action of the mind
The selective activity has been compared to the work of the Chief Adviser of a King
As the Adviser is instrumental in distinguishing the good from the bad and in getting the good and avoiding the bad so mindfulness distinguishes the worthy from unworthy things avoids the unworthy and obtains the worthy
The integrative character of mindfulness is like the Ministerofallwork of a King
He is wanted in putting through every project of the King
He is commissioned to organise and combine the workers and execute the tasks
Mindfulness is also like that Minister
It is the organizing activity of the mind necessary for the development of wholesome states of consciousness
It combines the various other qualities which compose those states puts them to their appropriate tasks and keeps them in proper working order
By the strength of integrating mindfulness a conscious state of skill functions harmoniously and becomes a wellknit unity
This activity of mindfulness makes the work of the aspirant complete at every stage of his progress
Integrating mindfulness sees all lacks and deficiencies brings in the needed qualities and suitably applies them
It is called the highest wisdom of mindfulness and constitutes the core of the Mindfulness that is included in the Real Way of the Way Factor of Mindfulness and of the Enlightenment Factor of Mindfulness
It is Right Mindfulness in the full sense of the term
From the foregoing it can be seen that it is mindfulness that holds things together in the mental flux brings them up and prevents them from floating away getting submerged forgotten and lost
Without mindfulness there will be no reconstitution of already acquired knowledge and consciousness itself would break in pieces become fragmentary and be unable to do properly the work of cognition
Further without mindfulness that has become wisdom the highest kind of mindfulness which includes clear comprehension cognition will be superficial there will not be the knowledge of things gained from different relations and different angles  the work of discernment and discrimination peculiar to selective activity  nor any really constructive understanding  the yield of integration  and so penetrative vision into the full significance of spiritual things will not be reached
When one is strongly mindful one plants one's consciousness deep in an object like a firm post well sunk in the ground and withstands the tempestuous clamour of the extraneous by a sublime ignoring of nonessentials But this does not mean that in such a one interest is narrow and his outlook wrongly restricted
Strong mindfulness ignores the unnecessary by adhering to the center of the business in hand and extends its view to important peripheral conditions with a widespreading watchfulness resembling that of the sentinel on a tower scanning the horizon for the glint of armour By such a balance between width and depth mindfulness steers clear of the extremes of lopsided vision and practice
In the sense of overcoming mental conflict and in the sense of getting rid of all unclarity all incapacity to judge aright and indefiniteness due to mental unquiet mindfulness is a controlling faculty
The controlling faculty of mindfulness makes for the absence of confusion and produces lucidity of thought sound judgment and definiteness of outlook
Mindfulness accompanied by keen understanding appears as the controlling faculty of mindfulness
Mindfulness accompanied by sustained energy is mindfulness considered as a spiritual power and is the quality of earnestness which destroys the wavering of negligence
Negligence is the wandering of the mind in objects of fivefold sensepleasure repeatedly it is the absence of thoroughness of perseverance and of steadfastness in doing good the behavior that is stuck in the mire of worldliness the casting aside of the desire to do what is right the casting aside of the duties which belong to one the absence of practice development and increase of wholesome qualities the lack of right resolve and the want of application
Earnestness is the opposite of all that negligence connotes
According to meaning earnestness is the nonneglect of mindfulness
Indeed earnestness is the name for mindfulness that is always active constantly at work
Earnestness may also be explained as it has been by some as the four mental aggregates of feeling perception consciousness and formations proceeding with application of mindfulness and clear comprehension
All that the Buddha taught from the time of his enlightenment to his passing away into the Element of Immortality has been summed up in the sentence strive with earnestness the last words of the Master
Earnestness runs through the whole of the Buddhaword and embraces everything there
It is like the elephant's footprint which is able to contain the footprint of any other animal
Therefore did the Blessed One say all wholesome things are founded on earnestness converge on earnestness and earnestness is to be considered as the most excellent of them
Mindfulness in this sense is found to be the chief characteristic of all skillful actions leading to bliss here and hereafter and tending to one's own and to other's profit
It is the force which pushes one to right practice after one has given careful thought to the Buddha's Teaching
Life as it is understood in the Dispensation of the Buddha is unsatisfactory until one can through moral joy meditative tranquillity and wise understanding reach mental invulnerability to suffering
The Way of Mindfulness is understanding and tranquillity illumined by a bright moral character
Without a blameless happy life of virtue it is not possible to tranquilize the heart or make the intellect keen and clear for spiritual perfection
The spiritual man is a person of so sensitive and heightened a consciousness that he finds even slight moral guilt burdensome and so he cannot help avoiding all traces of it by a strict adherence to virtue
Otherwise owing to remorse at his backslidings and preoccupation with them he will not find the right inner environment and climate for developing the placidity and insight which produce the power of perfect equanimity necessary for changing over from mental slavery to freedom
The cheerful joyous atmosphere which virtue gives is more necessary to the aspirant to Nibbana than anything else to keep him spiritually alive
Although the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness does not speak of virtue directly in detail and is principally concerned with the calming of the mind and wise understanding the presence of the virtuefoundation is implied since the instruction on mindfulness is intended for the purification of beings and there is no purification in the Dhamma which does not begin with purification of virtue and it is only after purification of virtue that the wise man develops concentration and wisdom and attains liberation
Further there is enough in the commentary and the explanation to it to prove the importance of virtue to the aspirant and to show how tranquillity and understanding help in protecting the preserving and the perfecting of virtue
The Way of Mindfulness moves towards the equanimity of the fully quieted mind along the firm and sure ground of active virtue
Because of this virtuous basis it is a reliable way to highest security free from the bogs swamps and sloughs of vice and the dangerous futility of inaction
Analysis is a salient feature of the method of arriving at knowledge in the Buddhadhamma
The Buddha is the Master of analytic knowledge and his doctrine is called the Teaching of Analysis
The Way of Mindfulness is therefore naturally replete with the application of the principles of analysis
The sentient being is radically searched through manifold analysis to see if anything in him is unanalysable
Only that which is relative is analysable only that which is conditioned and dependent on something else
The absolute the unconditioned and the independent are not analysable
Is there anything absolute in the sentient being or is everything in the sentient being relative
The answer has to be found out by the aspirant after being convinced by valid thought and experience in order to reach the first glimpse of the goal
By training to think along the lines indicated in the Way he will be able to conclude with certainty what the nature of sentient individuality really is
On the immovable basis of such correct knowledge rests the final realization of supra mundane perfection
The aim of analysis in the Way of the Buddha is to attain correct understanding of the component parts of sentient existence and their relations for rightly grasping the unique totality of the individual that emerges from the relations
Only a Buddha however has the ability to gauge the uniqueness of individual totality consummately
But the important thing to be noted here is that a just and generally accurate perception of the significance of the totality as a thing distinct from every other and possessing a character that clearly is not to be merely described or defined by the parts is the result of the teamwork of the forces of wisdom and concentrated vision
Analysis of the parts lays bare the constituent components
Analysis of the relations gives a sense of the totality
All the differences that make for uniqueness are seen as due to subtle distinctions of relations
And the uniqueness of the personality individuality and entirety of a living being depends on the countless number of ever changing relations their infinite variety subtle nuances and endless possibilities in each separate lifeflux
The analytic nature of the Way leads one finally to the vision of the sentient being as a uniquely related totality that transcends the parts and has a character all its own
The sense of totality to which the logic of analysis leads is realized as true in the intensity of the absorptive or unifying activity of concentrative thought
Here the development of penetrative insight combines with that of tranquilizing concentration and each functions in a way that does not outstrip the other
Both gain uniformity of force
Through the overdoing of analysis there could be agitation
And indolence creeps in through too much of tranquillity
Searching analysis is predominantly intellective and is the work of insight
Wholehearted acceptance is principally intuitive and springs from the placidity of concentration
In the sense of yoking and of not letting become overwhelming contemplative balance is reached
That balance is manifested as the sober serene steadfast acceptance of the truth which analysis reveals
This is a middle way
It does not overlook any valuable knowledge or experience of the spirit and does not edge sideways but goes straight forward intent on the Real free from all biases
Though it looks within it is aware of what is without
Along such a way one can transcend the narrow vision of a barricaded individuality and the indefinable looseness of view of a dissipated and disintegrated spirit
This Middle Way of Mindfulness is clearly not based on revelation dogmas nor vacuous beliefs like those in a Supreme Creator God and an Eternal Soul irrational in the extreme
What is irrational is not the Teaching of the Buddha though it be found in Buddhist Scriptures
On the contrary Whatever is well said is the Word of the Buddha even when it is not the Master's own utterance because the Blessed One acknowledges Truth wherever and by whomsoever spoken
To raise up the person to a keen sense of awareness in regard to an object and to bring into activity to call forth and stir up the controlling faculty the power the enlightenment factor and the way factor of mindfulness is the Arousing of Mindfulness designed
Every Arousing of Mindfulness in regard to body feeling consciousness or a mental object can be considered as a beginning of the road to insight
And so these arousings are in a sense startingpoints Further with the Arousing of Mindfulness one wakes up heedfulness intentness and carefulness and is in a state of mental preparedness in regard to any work in hand
These Arousings of Mindfulness are many as regards objects but are one in the sense of taking place in a single way of quietude charged with insight that leads to Nibbana
All the four different objects of mindfulness body feeling consciousness and mental objects have to be understood before one reaches sanctitude
According to character temperament and cognizing slant one can make however only one of these the preliminary object of contemplation
It is often the case that owing to a lack of proper understanding of oneself one has to try all objects before one gets to know what suits one best for the preliminary work
The choice is made more difficult by the fact that most of us have no clearcut natures and are a mixture of a little of every possible human characteristic
In these circumstances there is no alternative to the method of trial and error
But the earnest ones will find their way with persistence and sustained effort
By character there are two types determined by the excess of sensuous qualities of craving or of the asensuous qualities of abstract beliefs that make up their personality
The craving type is generally extrovert the other is generally introvert
According to temperament there are those whose mental functioning is slow those who are languid mentally and those who are mentally keen the nervous type
But here it must be understood that the terms languid and nervous have no necessary connection with calm and excitement
The nervous often keep cool when the languid fluster
The nervous type is sensitive but strong and vigorous and keen
The nervous think forcefully and clearly
The languid are sluggish inert and weak unclear discursive and often mixedup in thought
Cognizing slant is either intuitive or intellective
According to character and temperament the bodyobject is recommended for the languid extravert and the feelingobject for the nervous extrovert
For the languid introvert the consciousnessobject is recommended and for the nervous introvert mental objects
According to cognizing slant and temperament the bodyobject is pointed out for the mentally slow who belong to the intuitive kind which makes concentration its vehicle for progress and for the mentally keen of this kind the feelingobject
For the mentally slow who belong to the intellective kind which makes insight its vehicle the consciousnessobject is recommended and to the mentally keen of this kind the mental object
Further contemplation on the body destroys the delusion of beauty that on feeling destroys the delusion of pleasure contemplation on consciousness dispels the delusion of permanence and that on mental objects the delusion of the soul
The person who wishes to practice meditation according to the instruction of the Buddha on the Arousing of Mindfulness should first read the discourse with the commentary on the synopsis and get a fair idea of the trend of the teaching
Today there are still people as of old who learn the discourse by heart as a preparation to practice
Such memorizing is helpful to certain types
But it is not essential
What is essential is to think long and deep on the instruction until one gets the hang of its application to daily life
Only by repeated reflection on all the implications of it can the discourse be made an effective instrument of mental culture
The core of the instruction is in the sections dealing with the modes of deportment and clear comprehension
These are intended for all types of aspirants
The commentary on these sections is very important and should be carefully studied
The whole practice of mindfulness depends on the correct grasp of the exercises included in the two parts referred to here
One should then look through the rest of the exercises in the discourse with the help of the commentary to find a preliminary object of concentration or subject of meditation that accords with one's character temperament and cognizing slant mentioned earlier
If for instance one is an extrovert mentally languid or a person whose cognizing slant is intuitive and is temperamentally slow of mind the contemplation on breathing could well suit that one as a preliminary object
If one finds the explanation given in the commentary to the discourse on mindfulness on any preliminary object one chooses insufficient one should read the exposition of it in the Path of Purification of our commentator
One may if a teacher of Buddhist meditation can be found also consult him and ask for elucidation of any difficult points connected with meditative practice
Necessary too to be read by all are the portions of the commentary on the contemplation of feeling and consciousness and those on the hindrances the sensebases and the factors of Enlightenment which give information on the obstacles and aids to concentration on the preliminary object
In concentration of any preliminary object say the breath if any feeling or thought that interferes with concentration arises then one should contemplate on that interfering phenomenon in a manner that accords to the exposition on feeling consciousness the hindrances or the sensebases in the commentary until the interference disappears and then revert to the preliminary object
Similarly when attending to the preliminary object any overactiveness or slackness present should be overcome by the method taught in the exposition on the factors of Enlightenment in the commentary and then there will be steady work possible on the object of concentration
It is useful to bear in mind that either the favorable or the unfavorable qualities increase by pondering over them and decrease by the turning away of attention from them
In beginning to practice mindfulness one has to become aware of one's actions speech and thoughts and drive these towards good as a cowherd his charge to healthy pastures
It is helpful to get into the habit of preparing the mind before proceeding to act and to pause a while before initiating new activities
By such practice one learns to act deliberately consciously and with circumspection and not on the spur of the moment and so does everything prepared to face all consequences and with a proper sense of responsibility
Wholetime practice of mindfulness consists in the carrying out of each of the three following activities of contemplation at the proper time attention to the preliminary object of concentration reflection on the modes of deportment and clear comprehension
When one is not attending to the preliminary object for one good reason or another one should be reflecting on the modes of deportment or be doing clear comprehension
Wholetime practice of mindfulness can be carried out by all
There will however be differences to the degree of intensiveness of the practice according to the busyness of the individual
The more one is busy with external activities the less time will be at his disposal for attending to the preliminary object and also for steady reflection on deportment and for penetratively clear comprehension
One should therefore try to cut and also slow down as much as one can rightly and reasonably one's external activities
Who reflects on his movements and clearly comprehends states of activity and rest as taught in the commentary has his mind turned towards selfmastery
The preliminary object however is the basis of the practice and is the resort of the aspirant or the main object and ground of contemplation
The Way of Mindfulness is the objective way of viewing anything whatsoever
It reckons just what is present and stopping the garrulity of one's own mind lets the objects speak for themselves and unfold their character
Also by its patient pursuit of the meaning of things its readiness to see every side of any thought or experience and by its breath and tolerance it predisposes the mind to receive the impressions of truth induces inner pliancy and the mood of spiritual receptivity necessary for highest intuition
Since mindfulness is the only way for anyone who wishes inner happiness men of old irrespective of the school of thought to which they belonged underlined the importance of the Buddha's teaching on this point
In his Friendly Letter Nagarjuna says The Happy One said that the only way to be walked on is mindfulness directed bodywards therefore keep to it resolutely for if mindfulness is lacking all good Dhamma decays And San tideva in his Bodhicaryavatara says If the mind the tusker maddened with passion is bound completely with the rope of mindfulness then all perils disappear and all blessings come into being
In the Theravada countries of SouthEast Asia the Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness is wellknown and much appreciated
Especially so is it in Burma today where monk and layman go from time to time into solitude for training along this Way under the guidance of some meditationmaster In Burmese meditation monasteries each meditator is given a separate cell
He is not allowed to speak to any but the meditation master during the time of training
No books and no repetition of formulae are permitted
The business of the meditator is to keep mindfulness going during the whole of the waking state
Making his inhalations and exhalations the basic subject of meditation he has to be mindful of his postures completely aware of his behavior and to attend to his feelings thoughts and ideas as they arise according to the instructions of the meditation master
Seldom does a stretch of hard training extend over a month
The aim of the meditation master is to lessen the conceptualizing proclivities of the pupil and lead him towards appreciating the nature of the thing This he does by encouraging bare or pure mindfulness and letting transcience and the other characteristics of the mental and bodily objects become clear by dint of concentrated attention because true understanding of reality must in the last resort be based on profound personal experience
Otherwise it cannot change the character of the meditator in that final and irrevocable way of arahantship contemplated by this method
The meditation master does not load the pupil's mind with all the many particulars found in the commentary but selects what is just necessary for each pupil's progress and instructs accordingly
Continued practice of the arousings of mindfulness instills into the meditator the habit of systematic or proper attention regarding the details of a thing and accustoms him to test all phenomena for their inherent characteristics of transience and so forth
Thus he gradually learns to turn away from the worldling's view of things and look at them by way of condition cause dependent origination element etc and becomes in spirit one with the Dhamma
The Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness is one among the discourses often repeated by Buddhists and its traditional importance is seen further by its use as the viaticum to support one passing away from this life to another
The use of it as a deathbed discourse points out that mindfulness besides being one of the foremost qualities needed for holy living is also a quality that makes for holy dying
Truly a first and last thing
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kurus at Kammasadamma a markettown of the Kuru people
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus as follows This is the only way O bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of Mindfulness
What are the four
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating the feelings in the feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief
And how O bhikkhus does a bhikkhu live contemplating the body in the body
Here O bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits down bends in his legs crosswise on his lap keeps his body erect and arouses mindfulness in the object of meditation namely the breath which is in front of him
Mindful he breathes in and mindful he breathes out
He thinking 'I breathe in long' he understands when he is breathing in long or thinking 'I breathe out long' he understands when he is breathing out long or thinking 'I breathe in short' he understands when he is breathing in short or thinking 'I breathe out short' he understands when he is breathing out short
'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in' thinking thus he trains himself
'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out' thinking thus he trains himself
'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in' thinking thus he trains himself
'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe out' thinking thus he trains himself
Just as a clever turner or a turner's apprentice turning long understands 'I turn long' or turning short understands 'I turn short' just so indeed O bhikkhus a bhikkhu when he breathes in long understands 'I breathe in long' or when he breathes out long understands 'I breathe out long' or when he breathes in short he understands 'I breathe in short' or when he breathes out short he understands 'I breathe out short' He trains himself with the thought 'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in' He trains himself with the thought 'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out' He trains himself with the thought 'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in' He trains himself with the thought 'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe out'

Thus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body
And further O bhikkhus when he is going a bhikkhu understands 'I am going' when he is standing he understands 'I am standing' when he is sitting he understands 'I am sitting' when he is lying down he understands 'I am lying down' or just as his body is disposed so he understands it

Just as if O bhikkhus there were a bag having two openings full of grain differing in kind namely hillpaddy paddy greengram cowpea sesamum rice and a man with seeing eyes having loosened it should reflect thinking thus 'This is hill paddy this is paddy this is greengram this is cowpea this is sesamum this is rice' In the same way O bhikkhus a bhikkhu reflects on just this body hemmed in by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the hair down thinking thus 'There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh fibrous threads bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs contents of the stomach intestines mesentery feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat solid fat tears fat dissolved saliva mucus synovic fluid urine'

Thus spoke the Blessed One
Satisfied the bhikkhus approved of his words
Evam me sutam  Thus have I heard the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness
I refers to the Elder Ananda cousin of the Buddha
At the first Buddhist Council held in the Sattapanna Cave at Rajagaha under the presidentship of the Great Disciple of the Buddha the Elder Maha Kassapa the Collection of the Discourses was recited by the Elder Ananda
Ekam samayam bhagava Kurusu viharati  At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kurus Although the territory of the Kuru Princes their homeland was a single contiguous domain by taking into consideration its many villages and markettowns it was commonly referred to by the use of the plural form Kurus
In the time of the legendary king Mandhatu say the commentators inhabitants of the three continents Pubba Videha Apara Goyana and Uttara Kuru having heard that Jambudipa the birthplace of Sammasambuddhas Paccekabuddhas the Great Disciples of the Buddhas Universal Monarchs and other beings of mighty virtue was an exceedingly pleasant excellent continent came to Jambudipa with the Universal Monarch Mandhatu who was making a tour of all the continents in due order preceded by his Wheel Treasure
And at last when Mandhatu bodily translated himself by means of his psychic virtue to the Tavatimsa devaloka the heaven of the Thirtythree the people of the three continents who accompanied him to Jambudipa begged of his son for territory to live in as they said they had come carried by the great power of Mandhatu and were now unable by themselves to return to their own continents
Their prayer was heard and lands were granted to each of the groups of people of the three continents
The places in which these people settled got the names of the original continents from which they had emigrated
The settlement of people from Pubba Videha came to be known as Videha of those from Apara Goyana as Aparanta and of those from Uttara Kuru as Kururattha
Kammasadammam nama Kurunam nigamo  At Kammasadamma a markettown of the Kuru people Some explain the word Kammasadamma here spelling it with a dh instead of a d Since Kammasa was tamed here it was called Kammasadamma the place of the taming of Kammasa
Kammasa refers to the cannibal of Kammasapada the one with the speckled black and white or gray colored foot
It is said that a wound on his foot caused by a stake healed having become like a piece of wood with lines of fibre of a complex pattern
Therefore he became wellknown as Kammasapada Speckled Foot
By whom was Speckled Foot tamed
By the Great Being the Bodhisatta
In which Birthstory is it stated
Certain commentators say In the Sutasoma Birthstory But the elders of the Great Minister at Anuradhapura the Maha Vihara say that it is stated in the Jayaddisa Birthstory
Kammasapada was tamed weaned of his cannibalism by the Great Being in the circumstances mentioned in the Jayaddisa Birthstory
The following statement occurs in that story
Some however explain spelling the word thus Kammasadhamma
It is said that the traditional Kuru virtuous practice became stained in that place
Therefore it was called Kammasadhamma
The markettown established there too got the same name
Why was it not said Kammasadamme Kurunam nigame using the locative
Because it is said there was no monastery at which the Blessed One could stay in that markettown
Away from the markettown however there was a huge dense jungle in a delightful region watered well
In that jungle the Blessed One lived making the markettown his place for gathering alms
Ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggo  This is the only way O bhikkhus Why did the Blessed One teach this Discourse
Because of the ability of the people of the Kurus to take in deep doctrine
The inhabitants of the Kuru country  bhikkhus bhikkhunis upasakas upasikas  by reason of their country being blessed with a perfect climate and through their enjoyment of other comfortable conditions were always healthy in body and in mind
They happy with healthy minds and bodies and having the power of knowledge were capable of receiving deep teachings
Therefore the Blessed One perceiving their ability to appreciate this profound instruction proclaimed to them this Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness which is deep in meaning having set up the subject of meditation in arahantship in twentyone places
For even as a man having got a golden basket should fill it with divers flowers or indeed having got a golden casket should fill it with precious jewels of the seven kinds the Blessed One having got a following of the Kuruland people dispensed it is said deep doctrine
Likewise on that very account there in the Kurus the Blessed One taught other deep teachings the Mahanidana Sutta Mahasatipatthana Sutta Saropama Sutta Rukkhupama Sutta Ratthapala Sutta Magandiya Sutta and the Aneñjasappaya Sutta
Further in that territory of the Kuru people the four classes  bhikkhu bhikkhuni upasaka upasika  generally by nature were earnest in the application of the Arousing of Mindfulness to their daily life
At the very lowest even servants usually spoke with mindfulness
At wells or in spinning halls useless talk was not heard
If some woman asked of another woman Mother which Arousing of Mindfulness do you practice and got the reply None at all then that woman who replied so was reproached thus Your life is shameful though you live you are as if dead and was taught one of the kinds of Mindfulnessarousing
But on being questioned if she said that she was practicing such and such an Arousing of Mindfulness then she was praised thus Well done well done
Your life is blessed you are really one who has attained to the human state for you the Sammasambuddhas have come to be
With a perfect climate comfortable conditions
This includes such items as wholesome food and drink essential for maintaining mind and body unimpaired
The only way  The one way
There are many words for way The word used for way here is ayana
Therefore This is the only way O bhikkhus  means here A single way O bhikkhus is this way it is not of the nature of a double way
Or it is the only way because it has to be trodden by oneself only
That is without a companion
The state of being companionless is twofold without a comrade after abandoning contact with the crowd and in the sense of being withdrawn from craving through tranquillity of mind
Or it is called ekayana because it is the way of the one
Of the one  of the best of all beings the Blessed One is best
Therefore it is called the Blessed One's Way
Although others too go along that way it is the Buddha's because he creates it
Accordingly it is said He the Blessed One is the creator of the uncreated path O Brahman It proceeds only in this Doctrineanddiscipline and not in any other
Accordingly the Master declared Subhadda only in this Doctrineanddiscipline is the Eightfold Way to be found And further ekayana means It goes to the one  that is it goes solely to Nibbana
Although in the earlier stages this method of meditation proceeds on different lines in the latter it goes to just the one Nibbana
And that is why Brahma Sahampati said
As Nibbana is without a second that is without craving as accompanying quality it is called the one
Hence it is said Truth is one it is without a second
Why is the Arousing of Mindfulness intended by the word way
Are there not many other factors of the way namely understanding thinking speech action livelihood effort and concentration besides mindfulness
To be sure there are
But all these are implied when the Arousing of Mindfulness is mentioned because these factors exist in union with mindfulness
Knowledge energy and the like are mentioned in the analytically expository portion
In the synopsis however the consideration should be regarded as that of mindfulness alone by way of the mental disposition of those capable of being trained
Some however construing according to the stanza beginning with the words They do not go twice to the further shore  say One goes to Nibbana once therefore it is ekayana This explanation is not proper
Because in this instruction the earlier part of the Path is intended to be presented the preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulness proceeding in the four objects of contemplation is meant here and not the supramundane Way of Mindfulness
And that preliminary part of the Path proceeds many times or it may be said that there is many a going on it by way of repetition of practice
In what sense is it a way
In the sense of the path going towards Nibbana and in the sense of the path which is the one that should be traversed by those who wish to reach Nibbana
Regarding the only way there is the following account of a discussion that took place long ago
The Elder Tipitaka Culla Naga said The Way of Mindfulnessarousing is the preliminary part
His teacher the Elder Culla Summa said The Way is a mixed one
The pupil Reverend Sir it is the preliminary part
The teacher Friend it is the mixed Way
As the teacher was insistent the pupil became silent
They went away without coming to a decision
On the way to the bathing place the teacher considered the matter
He recited the Discourse
When he came to the part where it is said O bhikkhus should any person maintain the Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner for seven years he concluded that after producing the consciousness of the Supramundane Path there was no possibility of continuing in that state of mind for seven years and that his pupil Culla Naga was right
On that very day which happened to be the eighth of the lunar fortnight it was the elder Culla Naga's turn to expound the Dhamma
When the exposition was about to begin the Elder Culla Summa went to the Hall of Preaching and stood behind the pulpit
After the pupil had recited the preliminary stanzas the teacher spoke to the pupil in the hearing of others saying Friend Culla Naga The pupil heard the voice of his teacher and replied What is it Reverend Sir The teacher said this To say as I did that the Way is a mixed one is not right
You are right in calling it the preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulnessarousing Thus the Elders of old were not envious and did not go about holding up only what they liked as though it were a bundle of sugarcane
They took up what was rational they gave up what was not
Thereupon the pupil realising that on a point on which experts of the Dhamma like his learned teacher had floundered fellows of the holy life in the future were more likely to be unsure thought With the authority of a citation from the Discoursecollection I will settle this question Therefore he brought out and placed before his hearers the following statement from the Patisambhida Magga The preliminary part of the Way of Mindfulnessarousing is called the only way And in order to elaborate just that and to show of which path or way the instruction in our Discourse is the preliminary part he further quoted the following also from the Patisambhida Magga The Excellent Way is the Eightfold way four are truths dispassion is the best of things belonging to the wise besides that Way there is no other for the purifying of vision
Walk along that Way so that you may confound Death and put an end to suffering
Sattanam visuddhiya  For the purification of beings For the cleansing of beings soiled by the stains of lust hatred and delusion and by the defilements of covetise called lawless greed and so forth
All reach the highest purity after abandoning mental taints
By way of physical taints however there is no cleansing of impurities taught in the Dhamma
Accordingly it is said Mental taints soil beings mental cleansing sanctifies them
Sokaparidevanam samatikkamaya  For the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation If this Way is developed it will lead to the casting out of sorrow similar to that experienced by the Minister Santati and the casting out of lamentation similar to that of Patacara
With analytical knowledge did Santati reach arahantship after hearing this stanza
Patacara reached the fruition of the first stage of arahantship after hearing the following
Since there is nothing called spiritual development without laying hold on something whatsoever in material form feeling consciousness and mental objects they too overcame sorrow and lamentation just by this Way of Mindfulness
For the hearers namely the disciples of the Buddha there is no attainment of the Noble Path possible except by practicing the subject of meditation of the Four Truths
Spiritual development usually called meditation is the development of wisdom
Just the contemplation of material form of feeling consciousness or mental objects constitutes the cultivation of the Arousing of Mindfulness
Dukkha domanassanam atthangamaya  For the destruction of suffering and grief For the cessation of bodily suffering and mental grief
This way maintained by contemplation is conducive to the destruction of suffering similar to that of the Elder Tissa and of grief similar to that of Sakka
Tissa the head of a family at Savatthi renouncing forty crores of gold became a homeless one and dwelt in a forest far from other human beings
His sisterinlaw sent a robber band of five hundred to scour the forest in order to find him and ordered them to kill him when he was found
She sent him it is said in five batches of a hundred each in succession
After entering the forest and searching for the elder they in due course came to the place in which he lived and sat round him
When the robbers surrounded him the elder spoke thus Lay disciples why have you come They replied To kill you Then the elder said On a security give me my life for just this one night Said the robbers O recluse who will stand surety for you in a place like this The elder thereupon took a big stone broke the bones of his legs and said Lay disciples is the security of value They leaving the elder went to the end of the ambulatory and lighting a fire lay on the ground
The elder contemplating on the purity of his conduct after suppressing his pain attained arahantship at dawn having fulfilled the recluse's regimen in the three watches of the night
Giving expression to his feelings he said
There is another story
Thirty bhikkhus taking the subject of meditation from the Blessed One went into residence during the rains in a forestdwelling agreeing amongst themselves to practice the duty of the recluse during all the three watches of the night and to avoid one another's presence
One by one those monks who began to doze early in the morning after doing the recluse's duty during the three watches of the night were carried away by a tiger
Not one of those carried away did even utter the words I am taken by a tiger When thus fifteen bhikkhus had been devoured on uposatha day after it was asked Friends where are the others and it became known that they had been devoured by a tiger
It was agreed that anyone seized by the tiger thereafter should utter the words I am taken Then a certain young bhikkhu was seized by the tiger in the same circumstances in which the others were seized earlier
That young bhikkhu said Tiger Reverend Sir The other bhikkhus carrying sticks and torches went in pursuit of the tiger
The tiger having taken the young bhikkhu up to a rocky place a broken edge over a hollow spot inaccessible to the bhikkhus began to devour its prey from the feet upwards
The pursuing bhikkhus said Good man there is nothing that can be done by us
The extraordinary spiritual attainment of bhikkhus is to be seen in such a place
That bhikkhu even prostrate in the tiger's mouth suppressed his pain and developing the wisdom of insight attained the four paths and fruits of sanctitude together with analytical knowledge
Then he uttered this ecstatic utterance
And then there is the story of the elder Pitamalla who in the time he was a layman took the pennon for wrestling in three kingdoms
He came to Tambapanni Isle had audience of the king and received royal assistance
Once while going through the entrance to the Screened Sitting Hall he heard the following passage from the Notyours chapter of Scripture Material form o bhikkhus is not yours renounce it
That renunciation will for a long time be for your welfare and happiness And he thought Neither material form indeed nor feeling is one's own and making just that thought a goad he renounced the world
At the Great Minister the Maha Vihara at Anuradhapura he was in due course given the lower ordination and the higher
When he had mastered the two Codes of Discipline he went to the Gavaravaliya Shrine with thirty other bhikkhus and did the duty of the recluse
While meditating in the open at night there once he was moving on his knees on the ambulatory when his feet were unable to carry him and a hunter mistaking him for a deer struck him with a spear
The elder removed the spear which had gone deep into the body and stopping the wound with a wad of grass sat down on a flat stone
Making of his misfortune an opportunity for setting energy afoot he developed insight and attained arahantship with analytical knowledge
After he had reached the state of arahantship in order to apprise his fellowbhikkhus of his achievement he made a sign by clearing his throat and uttered this saying of joy at final liberation from suffering
Then those fellowmonks of the Elder Pitamalla who had come to see him said Reverend Sir if the Buddha were living he would have expressed his approval of your effort by stretching out his hand over the ocean and stroking your head
Three kingdoms  Pandu Cola Gola
Because he was in the habit of carrying a yellow pennon about his body and also because he adorned himself with that pennon when taking part in wrestling matches he was wellknown as Pitamalla the yellow wrestler
After his renunciation of the world too he was known as the Elder Yellow Wrestler
He came to Tambapanni Isle  Ceylon  having got the information that wrestlers were honored and hospitably received in the island
So in this manner this way is conducive to the destruction of suffering of those like the Elder Tissa
Sakka king of the gods after seeing the five portents afraid of death and griefstricken came to the Buddha and asked a question at the close of the answering of that question by the Buddha Sakka was established in the first stage of arahantship
Eighty thousand other gods were established together with Sakka in the same stage of sanctity
And the life of Sakka again was restored to just its original state through his rebirth once more as the king of the gods
Further it is said that Subrahma the god was partaking of the delights of paradise in the company of a thousand heavenly nymphs
There five hundred of the nymphs while picking flowers from a tree died and were reborn in a state of woe
He having seen their rebirth in a state of woe and having understood that the end of his own life was approaching and that he too would at death be reborn in that very state of woe was frightened
Then he went to the Buddha with his five hundred remaining nymphs and said this to the Lord
The Blessed One replied to him as follows
At the end of the instruction Subrahma and his five hundred nymphs were established in the first stage of awakening and he it is said returned to his paradise having made firm the heavenly fortunate state of life that was his before
It should be understood that this way developed in this manner is conducive to the destruction of grief of those like Sakka
ñayassa adhigamaya  For reaching the right path The Noble Eightfold Path is called the right path
This preliminary mundane Way of the Arousing of Mindfulness maintained is conducive to the realisation of the Supramundane Way
Nibbanassa sacchikiriyaya  For the attainment of Nibbana It is said as follows For the attainment the ocular experience by oneself of the deathless which has got the name Nibbana by reason of the absence in it of the lust called craving
Craving sews together or weaves aggregate with aggregate effect with cause and suffering with beings
In Nibbana there is no vana Or in the man who has attained to Nibbana there is no vana
Ocular experience by oneself Sensing without aid from the outside
This way maintained effects the attainment of Nibbana gradually
Although by the phrase For the purification of beings the things meant by the other phrases which follows it are attained the significance of those other phrases that follow the first is not obvious except to a person familiar with the usage of the Dispensation
Since the Blessed one does not at first make people conversant with the usage of the Dispensation and after that teach the Doctrine to them and as he by various discourses sets forth various meanings he explained the things which the only way effects with the words For the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation and so forth
Or it may be said that the Master explained the things accomplished by the only way in this manner in order to show that every thing which leads to the purification of beings by the only way is dependent on the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation that this overcoming is dependent on the destruction of suffering and grief and that the destruction of suffering and grief is dependent on the reaching of the right path which is in turn dependent on the attainment of Nibbana
It is a declaration of the method of deliverance by the only way
Further this is an expression of praise of the only way Just as the Blessed One by way of eight characteristics expressed praise in the Cha Chakka Sutta and by way of nine characteristics in the Ariyavamsa Sutta just in the same way he expressed praise of this only way through the seven characteristics contained in the words For the purification of beings and so forth
Why did he utter talk of praise of this kind
For the purpose of bringing out the interest of these bhikkhus
The Blessed One thought Having heard the utterance of praise these bhikkhus will believe that his way casts out the four onrushings namely sorrow produced by distress of heart lamentation characterised by confused talk suffering produced by disagreeable bodily feeling and grief produced by disagreeable thought and that it brings the three extraordinary spiritual attainments of purity knowledge and Nibbana and will be convinced that this instruction should be studied imam dhammadesanam uggahetabbam mastered borne in mind and memorized and that this way should be cultivated
Cattaro Satipatthana  The Four Arousings of Mindfulness Four in relation to classes of objects of mindfulness
Why did the Buddha teach just Four Arousings of Mindfulness and neither more nor less
By way of what was suitable for those capable of being trained
In regard to the pair of the dullwitted and the keenwitted minds among tamable persons of the craving type and the theorizing type pursuing the path of quietude or that of insight in the practice of meditation the following is stated For the dullwitted man of craving type the Arousing of Mindfulness through the contemplation of the gross physical body is the Path to Purity for the keenwitted of this type the subtle subject of meditation on the feeling
And for the dullwitted man of the theorizing type the Path to Purity is the Arousing of Mindfulness through a subject not too full of distinctions namely consciousness for the keenwitted of this type the subject which teems with distinctions namely the contemplation on things of the mind  mental objects
For the dullwitted man pursuing quietude the First Arousing of Mindfulness bodycontemplation is the Path to Purity by reason of the feasibility of getting at the mental reflex for the keenwitted of this type because he does not continue to stay in the coarse the second Arousing of Mindfulness the contemplation on feeling is the Path to Purity
And for the dullwitted man pursuing the path of insight the subject of meditation without many distinctions the contemplation on consciousness is the Path to Purity and for the keenwitted of this type the contemplation on mental objects which is full of distinctions
Or it may be said that these Four Arousings of Mindfulness are taught for casting out the illusions concerning beauty pleasure permanence and an ego
The body is ugly
There are people led astray by the illusion that it is a thing of beauty
In order to show such people the ugliness of the body and to make them give up their wrong idea the First Arousing of Mindfulness is taught
Feeling is suffering
There are people subject to the illusion that it gives pleasure
In order to show such people the painfulness of feeling and to make them give up their wrong idea the Second Arousing of Mindfulness is taught
Consciousness is impermanent
There are people who owing to an illusion believe that it is permanent
To show them the impermanence of consciousness and to wean them of their wrong belief the Third Arousing of Mindfulness is taught
Mental objects are insubstantial are soulless and possess no entity
There are people who believe by reason of an illusion that these mental things are substantial endowed with an abiding core or a soul or that they form part of a soul an ego or some substance that abides
To convince such errant folk of the fact of the soullessness or the insubstantiality of mental things and to destroy the illusion which clouds their minds the Fourth Arousing of Mindfulness is taught
Drawing distinctions it is said Body and feeling are the cause of zest
For the rejection of that zest of body by the dullwitted man of the craving type the seeing of the ugly in the body the coarse object which is the basis of craving is convenient
To that type of man the contemplation on corporeality the First Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity
For the abandoning of that zest by the keenwitted man of the craving type the seeing of suffering in feeling the subtle object which is the basis of craving is convenient and for him the contemplation on feeling the Second Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity
For the dullwitted man of the theorizing type it is convenient to see consciousness in the fairly simple way it is set forth in this discourse by way of impermanence and by way of such divisions as mindwithlust in order to reject the notion of permanence in regard to consciousness
Consciousness is a special condition for the wrong view due to a basic belief in permanence
The contemplation on consciousness the Third Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity of this type of man
For the keenwitted man of the theorizing type it is convenient to see mental objects or things according to the manifold way set forth in this discourse by way of perception senseimpression and so forth in order to reject the notion of a soul in regard to mental things
Mental things are special conditions for the wrong view due to a basic belief in a soul
For this type of man the contemplation on mental objects the Fourth Arousing of Mindfulness is the Path to Purity
Consciousness and mental objects constitute the outstanding conditions of theorizing
Consciousness is such a condition because it is a decisive factor in the belief in permanence
Mental objects are such conditions because these are decisive factors in the belief in a soul
Consciousness and mental objects are decisive factors of craving as well as of theorizing
And body and feeling are decisive factors of theorizing as well as of craving
Yet to point out that which is stronger in body and feeling namely craving and that which is stronger in consciousness and mental objects namely theorizing distinctions have been drawn
Because he does not continue to stay in the coarse The keenwitted man pursuing the path of quietude lays hold of the gross subject of meditation but he does not stay in that
He lays hold of feeling the subtle subject of meditation by way of the factors of absorption after attaining to and emerging from the absorption reached with the material body as subject
Since the heart of the man pursuing the path of insight takes to the contemplation of subtle consciousness and mental object these have been spoken of as the Path to Purity for the man dullwitted or keenwitted pursuing insight
Further these Four Arousings of Mindfulness were taught not only for the purpose of casting out the four illusions but for getting rid of the four floods bonds outflowings knots clingings wrong courses and the penetration of fourfold nutriment too
This is according to the method of exegesis in the Nettipakarana
In the commentary it is said that by way of remembering and of meeting in one thing the Arousing of Mindfulness is only one and that it is fourfold when regarded as a subject of meditation
By way of remembering by way of the reflection of actions of skill and so forth of body speech and thought
Meeting in one thing  union in the onenatured Nibbana
To a city with four gates men coming from the East with goods produced in the east enter by the east gate men coming from the South men coming from the West and men coming from the North with goods produced in the north enter by the north gate
Nibbana is like the city
The Real Supramundane Eightfold Path is like the citygate
Body mind feelings and mental objects are like the four chief directions in space
Like the people coming from the East with goods produced in the east are those who enter Nibbana by means of bodycontemplation through the Real Supramundane Path produced by the power of bodycontemplation practiced in the fourteen ways
Like the people coming from the South are those who enter by means of feelingcontemplation practiced in the nine ways
Like the people coming from the West are those who enter by means of consciousnesscontemplation practiced in the sixteen ways
Like the people coming from the North are those who enter by means of mentalobjectcontemplation practiced in the five ways
On account of the cause or on account of the sameness of entry into the one Nibbana the Arousing of Mindfulness is said to be just one thing
The meeting in the one Nibbana of the various Arousings of Mindfulness is called the meeting in the one thing on account of participation in that one Nibbana or on account of their becoming all of a kind
Katame cattaro  What are the four This is a question indicating the desire to expound the teaching
Idha  Here In this Dispensation
Bhikkhave  Bhikkhus This is a term for addressing persons who accept the teaching
Bhikkhu is a term to indicate a person who earnestly endeavors to accomplish the practice of the teaching
Others gods and men too certainly strive earnestly to accomplish the practice of the teaching but because of the excellence of the bhikkhustate by way of practice the Master said Bhikkhu For amongst those who accept the teaching of the Buddha the bhikkhu is the highest owing to fitness for receiving manifold instruction
Further when that highest kind of person the bhikkhu is reckoned the rest too are reckoned as in regard to a royal procession and the like when the king is reckoned by the reckoning of the king the retinue is reckoned
Also the word bhikkhu was used by the Buddha to point out the bhikkhustate through practice of the teaching in this way He who practices this practice of the Arousing of Mindfulness is called a bhikkhu He who follows the teaching be he a shining one or a human is indeed called a bhikkhu
Accordingly it is said
Kaye  In the body In the corporeal group
The group of big and small corporeal constituents namely things like hair of the head hair of the body nails and teeth in the sense of a collection similar to a herd of elephants a concourse of chariots according to grammatical method
From here the explanation is by way of wordanalysis
And as in the sense of a collection so also in the sense of the focus of what is filthy and therefore of what is disgusting is it kaya For the body is the birthplace of the disgusting the exceedingly repellent
The birthplace is the place of origin
Since these originate from that place it is the place of origin
What originates
The repulsive things like hair of the head
Therefore the body is the place of origin of disgusting or contemptible things
Kayanupassi  Contemplating the body Possessed of the character of bodycontemplation or of observing the body
Why is the word body used twice in the phrase Contemplating the body in the body For determining the object and isolating it and for the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact nature of things like continuity
Because there is no contemplating of feeling consciousness nor mental objects in the body but just the contemplating of the body only determination through isolation is set forth by the pointing out of the way of contemplating the body only in the property called the body
In the body there is no contemplation of a uniform thing apart from the big and small members of the body or of a man or of a woman apart from such things like the hair of the head and the hair of the body
There can be nothing apart from the qualities of primary and derived materiality in a body
Indeed the character of contemplating the collection of the major and the minor corporeal members is like the seeing of the constituents of a cart
The character of contemplating the collection of the hair of the head the hair of the body and the like is comparable to the seeing of the component parts of a city and the character of contemplating the collection of primary and derived materiality is comparable to the separation of the leaf covering of a plantaintrunk or is like the opening of an empty fist
Therefore by the pointing out of the basis called the body in the form of a collection in many ways the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact is shown
In this body apart from the above mentioned collection there is seen no body man woman or anything else
Beings engender wrong belief in many ways in the bare groups of things mentioned above
Therefore the men of old said
What he sees  What man or woman he sees
Why is there no seeing of man or a woman with the eye
There is
I see a woman I see a man  these statements refer to what he sees by way of ordinary perception
That perception owing to wrong comprehension does not get at the sensebasis in the highest sense philosophically through the falsely determined condition of material form
Or the meaning is the absence of perception which is called the seeing of primary and derived materiality beginning with things such as the hair of the head owing to noncognizability of the collective nature of an object like a man or woman by eyeconsciousness
What is seen that he does not properly see  He does not see according to reality by the eye of wisdom the sensebasis which exists the collection of primary and derived materiality beginning with hair of the head and the like
Not seeing properly he is shackled  Not seeing this body as it actually is with the eye of wisdom he thinks This is mine this am I this is my self and is bound with the fetter of defilement
And here by the passage For the determining of the object by isolating it and for the sifting out thoroughly of the apparently compact nature of things like continuity this too should be understood This person contemplates in this body only the body he does not contemplate anything else
What does this mean
In this definitely transient suffering soulless body that is unlovely he does not see permanence pleasure a soul nor beauty after the manner of those animals which see water in a mirage
Bodycontemplation is only the contemplation of the collection of qualities of transiency suffering soullessness and unloveliness
Because there is no contemplating of the body with reference to a self or to anything belonging to a self owing to the contemplating even of collections of things like the hair of the head there is the character of contemplating in the body the body which is a collection of things like the hair of the head
The meaning should be understood thus too contemplating the body in the body is the seeing of the body as a group of all qualities beginning with impermanence step by step as taught in the passage of the Patisambhida which begins with In this body he contemplates according to impermanence and not permanence
The bhikkhu sees the body in the body as something impermanent as something subject to suffering as something that is soulless by way of turning away from it and not by way of delighting in it by freeing himself of passion for it with thoughts making for cessation and not making for origination and not by way of laying hold of it but by way of giving it up
Viharati  Lives
Atapi  Ardent What burns the defilement of the three planes of becoming is ardour
Ardour is a name for energy
Although the term burning is applied to the abandoning of defilements here it is also applicable to right view thought speech action livelihood mindfulness and concentration
As ardour like glow is restricted by use to just energy generally it is said ardour is a name for energy Or because of the occurrence of energy by way of instigating the associated things in the abandoning of opposing qualities that itself is ardour atapa
In this place only energy is referred to by atapa By taking the word ardent the Master points out the one possessed of right energy or exertion
Sampajano  Clearly comprehending Endowed with knowledge called circumspection
Clearly comprehending  Discerning rightly entirely and equally
Rightly  Correctly
Entirely  By knowing in all ways
Equally  By reason of proceeding through the conveying of higher and higher spiritual attainments
Satima  Mindful Endowed with mindfulness that lays hold of the body as a subject of meditation because this yogavacara contemplates with wisdom after laying hold of the object with mindfulness
There is nothing called contemplation without mindfulness
Therefore the Master said Mindfulness is necessary in all circumstances O bhikkhus I declare
Necessary in all circumstances  Everywhere in the state of becoming in every sluggish and unbalanced state of mind it is desirable
Or that by the help of which the other proper Factors of Enlightenment are capable of being developed is necessary in all circumstances Here contemplation takes place by means of wisdom that is assisted by mindfulness
To point out the things by the influence of which the meditation of the yogi prospers is the purpose of the words Ardent clearly comprehending and mindful
To the nonardent state of mind there is the obstacle of mental lassitude
The state of mind that is not clearly comprehending commits blunders of judgment in the business of choosing the right means and in avoiding the wrong
The state of mind which is inattentive  the mental state of absence of mindfulness  is incapable of laying hold of the right means and of rejecting the wrong means
When the yogi is not ardent not clearly comprehending and not mindful he does not succeed in accomplishing his object
Mental lassitude  Inward stagnation
Indolence is the meaning
Right means  Things like the purification of virtue
After the pointing out of the things that make up the condition connected with the Arousing of Mindfulness through bodycontemplation there is the pointing out of the things that make up the condition which should be abandoned in this practice with the words having overcome in this world covetousness and grief  Vineyya loke abhijjhadomanassam
Arousing of Mindfulness
Here bare mindfulness is meant
Therefore the commentator speaks of the things that make up the condition connected with the Arousing of Mindfulness These things are energy and so forth associated necessarily with mindfulness
Condition  reason
Mindfulness denotes concentration too here on account of the inclusion of mindfulness in the aggregate of concentration
Or since the exposition is on mindfulness and as neither the abandoning of defilements nor the attainment of Nibbana is wrought by mindfulness alone and as mindfulness does not also occur separately the pointing out the things that make up the condition connected with the Arousing of Mindfulness is like the pointing out of the condition connected with absorption
Condition is a synonym for constituent
Initial application sustained application interest joy and onepointedness of mind are together with absorption as energy and the other qualities are with mindfulness
Having overcome refers to the discipline of knocking out an evil quality by its opposite good or through the overcoming of evil part by part and through the disciplining or the overcoming of the passions by suppression in absorption
Preliminary practice connected with the mundane path of mindfulness is pointed out by the commentator here
In this world In just this body
Here the body is the world in the sense of a thing crumbling
As covetousness and grief are abandoned in feeling consciousness and mental objects too the Vibhanga says Even the five aggregates of clinging are the world
Covetousness stands for sense desire and grief for anger
As sense desire and anger are the principal hindrances the abandoning of the hindrances is stated by the overcoming of covetousness and grief
With covetousness are abandoned the satisfaction rooted in bodily happiness delight in the body and the falling into erroneous opinion which takes as real the unreal beauty pleasure permanence and substantiality of the body
With the overcoming of grief are abandoned the discontent rooted in bodily misery the nondelight in the culture of bodycontemplation and the desire to turn away from facing the real ugliness suffering impermanence and insubstantiality of the body
By the instruction dealing with the overcoming of covetousness and grief yogic power and yogic skill are shown
Yogic power is the power of meditation
Yogic skill is dexterity in yoking oneself in meditation
Freedom from satisfaction and discontent in regard to bodily happiness and misery the forbearing from delighting in the body the bearingup of nondelight in the course of bodycontemplation the state of being not captivated by the unreal and the state of not running away from the real  these when practiced produce yogic power and the ability to practice these is yogic skill
There is another method of interpretation of the passage lives contemplating the body in the body ardent and so forth
Contemplating refers to the subject of meditation
Lives lives protecting the subject of meditation which here is the body
In the passage beginning with ardent Right Exertion is stated by energy the subject of meditation proper in all circumstances or the means of protecting the subject of meditation is stated by mindfulness and clear comprehension or the quietude that is obtained by way of the contemplation on the body is stated by mindfulness insight by clear comprehension and the fruit of inner culture through the overcoming of covetousness and grief
The subject of meditation useful in all circumstances is stated by referring to mindfulness and clear comprehension because through the force of these two qualities there is the protection of the subject of meditation and suitability of attention for its unbroken practice
Further of these two qualities mindfulness and clear comprehension the following is stated in the commentary to the Atthasalini Mula Tika To all who have yoked themselves to the practice of any subject of meditation to all yogis these two are things helpful at all times for the removal of obstruction and the increase of inner culture
Vedanasu Vedananupassi citte cittanupassi dhammesu dhammanupassi viharati  He lives contemplating feeling in the feelings the consciousness in consciousness mental object in mental objects Here the repetition of feelings consciousness and mental objects should be understood according to the reasons given for the repetition of the word body in bodycontemplation
Feeling  The three feelings pleasurable painful and the neither pleasurable nor painful
These are only mundane
The word feelings is repeated to limit the object by isolating it for the analysis of the apparently compact and for such other purposes in order to prevent any straying from the contemplation on feelings to some other object
Erratic contemplation takes place because of the connection of the other nonmaterial aggregates with feelings and because of the dependence of nonmaterial things like feelings on material form in the fiveconstituentexistence or the sensuous plane of becoming
By the repetition of the word the limiting of the object by isolating it is shown through the pointing out of only a doer of feelingcontemplation in the property called feeling as there is no contemplating of the body or consciousness or mental objects in feeling but only the contemplating of feeling
As in this matter of feeling when a pleasurable feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the other two and when a painful feeling or a neither pleasurable nor painful feeling occurs there is no occurrence of the remaining ones so is shown the analysis of the apparently compact the absence of permanence by the pointing out of different feelings after penetrating them severally and not having spoken of the state of feeling in a general way
Through the noticing of feelings as lasting just for the measure of a moment in time the seeing of impermanence is made clear
Through the same cognizance suffering and soullessness too are seen
For the analysis of the apparently compact and for such other purposes
By the words And for such other purposes the following should be understood This yogavacara contemplates just feelings and not any other thing because he is not one who contemplates by way of the lovely after the manner of a fool who sees a gem in a bubble of water which has not the quality of a gem
He does not see in this foolish way even in the stable instant when he experiences a pleasant feeling
Much more so does he not stray away into fanciful thinking in regard to the two remaining feelings of pain and indifference
On the other hand he contemplates along the real way of impermanence soullessness and the unlovely by way of momentary dissolution lack of power to control and the trickling of the dirt of defilement and distinctively contemplates suffering as the pain of vicissitude and of the formations or the constituents of life
Consciousness is only mundane and mundane too are mental objects
This statement will be made evident in the analytically expository portion
In the way mentioned above should the repetition of words in the contemplation of consciousness and mental objects be explained too
Only mundane as connected with the examining of mundane objects of thought in the light of impermanence suffering and soullessness
To be sure in whatever way feeling is to be exclusively contemplated here the contemplating in that very way is the meaning of the word Contemplating feelings in the feelings
In the contemplation of consciousness and mental objects too this is the method
How should feeling be contemplated upon it is asked further
Pleasurable feeling because it is the stuff of suffering as suffering
Painful feeling because it is the condition of bringing out trouble and so forth as a thorn
And the neither pleasurable nor painful feeling because of nonmastery or dependence and so forth as transiency
By the passage beginning with the words To be sure in whatsoever way the commentator points to the limit of the object
Accordingly the Master said
Who sees pleasure as suffering  Who sees feelings by way of the suffering natural to change with the eye of wisdom
Who sees pain as a thorn  Who sees painful feeling as damage causing piercing in and as a thing hard to drive out
The neutral peace  The feeling of indifference is peaceful owing to the absence of grossness as in states of pain and pleasure and by way of a restful nature
Who sees feelings with the thought that they are impermanent by reason of their becoming nonexistent after having come to be owing to their being characterised by the qualities of arising and passing away owing to their temporariness and owing to their being in a state of constant negation is he who sees the neutral peace of the neither pleasurable nor painful feelings as fleeting and is indeed the bhikkhu who will rightly know and live become still
Rightly  Correctly
Know  know feelings as they are
Further just all feelings should be contemplated with the thought These are suffering indeed
Suffering is what it is because of the ill natural to the constituents of life
For this has been said by the Blessed One All that is felt is in suffering I declare yam kiñci vedayitam tam sabbam dukkhasminti vadami
All that is in suffering  Everything experienced is plunged included in suffering because the ill natural to the formations the constituents in life cannot be conquered
And pleasure should also be contemplated upon as suffering
All should be explained according as the arahantnun Dhammadinna spoke Pleasant feeling friend Visakha is agreeable while it lasts and is disagreeable when it changes painful feeling is disagreeable while it lasts and agreeable when it changes the neither pleasant nor painful feeling is agreeable when there is a knowledge of its existence and disagreeable when that knowledge is wanting
The three feelings should be contemplated upon as pleasant and painful
When the first occurs the second changes and the third is known then feeling is pleasant
When the first changes the second occurs and the third is not known then feeling is painful
The feelings should also be seen according to the seven contemplations beginning with that of impermanence mentioned above
The remaining division beginning with the worldly and spiritual feelings in the classification of pleasurable feeling and so forth in feelingcontemplation will become clear in the analytical exposition
Consciousness and mental objects too should be contemplated upon by way of the diversity of the division of object arammana dominance conascence plane causal action result noncausative functional process and so forth beginning with impermanence and by way of the division of consciousness that is with passion and so forth come down in the portion of analytical exposition
Or the divisions of object noncausative functional process and so forth
Contemplation should be done by way of the division of the blue and so forth pertaining to the variety of objects visual and so forth by way of the division of the spontaneous and nonspontaneous consciousness absorption with initial application and so forth pertaining to the variety of conditions of conascence of knowledge absorption and so forth by way of the division of lofty middling and so forth pertaining to the diverse planes sensuous and so forth by way of the division of conduciveness to devaplanerebirth and so forth pertaining to the diverse kind of moral action of skill and so forth by way of the division of the state of requital which could be perceived in this very present condition of life and so forth pertaining to the variety of dark and bright resultants of evil and good deeds kanha sukka vipaka nanattassa dittha dhamma vedaniyatadi tabbhedassa by way of the division of the three good conditions of rebirth and so forth pertaining to noncausative functional diversity of the sensuous plane and so forth
Mental objects should be contemplated upon by way of own characteristic of impression and the like by way of general characteristic of impermanence and the like by way of phenomenonemptiness namely by way of the voidnature called soullessness to explain which clearly the instruction of the portion dealing with the void in the Abhidhamma proceeded by means of the statement beginning with At that time indeed there are phenomena there are aggregates without any mention of a soul by way of the seven contemplations of impermanence and so forth and by way of the divisions of what is present and what is absent and so forth in the analytical portion
If in the meditator's body called the world covetousness and grief are abandoned in the worlds of his feelings and so forth too these are abandoned owing to the earlier abandoning of these by the yogi
Still everywhere the abandoning of the defilements has been stated by way of the different types of persons and by way of the diversity of the thoughtunit in which the development of the different subjects of the Arousing of Mindfulness takes place
Or it should be understood thus It is stated in this manner in order to indicate that the abandoning of the defilements in one object implies the abandoning of the defilements in the remaining objects
Therefore it is not fit to speak again of the abandoning of these for while the defilements are abandoned they are not abandoned separately in one object after another  ie the defilements pertaining to the body for instance are not first abandoned and then those belonging to the feeling and so forth in succession but the defilements of all objects are abandoned when the defilements are abandoned in one object
That is due to the fact that only the defilements which can arise in the future are capable of being abandoned through the scorching out of the causes by the attainment of the Path or through measures that make the causes temporarily impotent because of the observance of virtue and the development of absorption
Past defilements and those arising in the present are beyond the scope of abandoning
The abandoning of the defilements of one object in the thoughtunit of the Path is indeed the abandoning of the defilements of all objects
It is right to say that by the Path are the defilements abandoned
The abandoning of the defilements of one person is not necessarily the abandonding of the defilements of another person
Reference to the different types of persons is made to point this fact of possible difference of method by way of object
The diversity of the thoughtunit
The mundane thoughtunit is meant as the preliminary path is dealt with here
What is abandoned temporarily by mundane meditation in the body is not suppressed in the feelings and the other objects
Even if covetousness and grief should not occur in the feelings and the other objects when it is suppressed in the body it should not be stated that owing to efficient rejection by meditation opposed to covetousness and grief there is no covetousness and grief in the other objects such as feelings and in the case of suppression by meditation therefore it is fit to speak of the rejection of covetousness and grief again in feelings and the other objects
The defilements abandoned in one object are abandoned in the remaining objects too
This statement refers to the supramundane meditation of Mindfulnessarousing
In the case of mundane meditation the rejection is stated everywhere with reference to bare nonoccurrence of the defilements
In regard to the four objects of contemplation through the Arousing of Mindfulness it is said in the Vibhanga thus Even the Five Aggregates are the world
Now the Blessed One desirous of bringing about diverse kinds of attainments of distinction in beings by the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness began to teach the analytically explanatory portion with the word And how o bhikkhus
He did that after dividing into four the one mindfulness that is right by way of the contemplation on the body on feelings on consciousness and on mental objects
The Blessed One's exposition of the Arousing of Mindfulness is similar to the action of a worker in mat and basket weaving who wishing to make coarse and fine mats boxes cases and the like should make those goods after getting a mammoth bamboo splitting it into four and reducing each of the parts to strips
Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu  Here o bhikkhus a bhikkhu
Here In this Dispensation of the Buddha which provides the basis for the person producing bodycontemplation in all modes
By the word here dispensations other than the Buddha's are excluded as they do not teach bodycontemplation in the complete way it is taught in the Buddhadhamma
For this is said Here is the recluse untenanted by recluses are the other opposing ways of thought
The person producing bodycontemplation in all modes
As sects outside the Buddha's Dispensation also produce a part of this contemplation by their words the Buddha's disciple's complete knowledge or allround grasp of this contemplation when it is practiced by him is told
Araññagato va suññagaragato va  Gone to the forest or to an empty place By this here is the making clear of the getting of an abode appropriate to the meditator for the culture of mindfulness
The mind of the meditator which for a long time had dwelt on visual and other objects does not like to enter the road of meditation and just like a wild young bull yoked to a cart runs off the road
A cowherd wishing to tame a wild calf nourished entirely on the milk of a wild cow ties that calf after leading it away from the cow to a stout post firmly sunk in the ground at a spot set apart for it
That calf having jumped hither and thither and finding it impossible to run away from here will crouch down or lie down at that very post
Even so must the bhikkhu who is desirous of taming the wild mind nourished long on the tasty drink of visible and other objects tie that mind to the post of the object of mindfulnessarousing with the rope of remembrance after leading the mind from visible and other objects and ushering it into a forest to the foot of a tree or into an empty place
The mind of the bhikkhu will also jump hither and thither
Not obtaining the objects it had long grown used to and finding it impossible to break the rope of remembrance and run away it will finally sit or lie down at that every object by way of partial and full absorption
Therefore the men of old said
In this way this abode becomes appropriate in the meditator
Therefore it is said This is the making clear of an abode appropriate to the meditator for the culture of mindfulness
Because the subject of meditation of mindfulness on inandoutbreathing is not easy to accomplish without leaving the neighbourhood of a village owing to sound which is a thorn to absorption and because in a place not become a township it is easy for the meditator to lay hold of this subject of meditation the Blessed One pointing out the abode suitable for that spoke the words Gone to the forest and so forth
The Buddha is like a master of the science of building sites because of the pointing out by him of the suitable abode for yogis
As a master in the science of selecting building sites after seeing a stretch of ground good for building a town and after considering it well from all sides advises Build the town here and when the building of the town is happily completed receives high honor from the royal family so the Buddha having well considered from all points the abode suitable for the meditator advises Here should the subject of meditation be yoked on to When arahantship is gradually reached by the yogi by the expression of the yogi's gratitude and admiration with the words Certainly the Blessed One is the Supremely Awakened One the Master receives great honor
The bhikkhu indeed is comparable to a leopard because like the leopard he lives alone in the forest and accomplishes his aim by overcoming those contrary to him namely the passions
Just as a great king of leopards concealed in the forest in grassbush junglebush or hillthicket seizes wild buffaloes elks pigs and other beasts this bhikkhu yoking himself to the subject of meditation gains the Four Real Paths and Fruits one after another in succession and therefore the men of old said
And so the Blessed One pointing out the forest abode the fit place for speedy exertion in the practice of meditation said Gone to the forest and so forth
Nisidati pallankam abhujitva ujum kayam panidhaya parimukham satim upatthapetva so satova assasati sato passasati  Sits down bends in his legs crosswise on his lap keeps is body erect and arouses mindfulness in the object of meditation namely the breath which is in front of him
Mindful he breathes in and mindful he breathes out
Bends in his legs crosswise on his lap Three things pertaining to the sitting posture of the yogi are pointed out by that firmness of the posture easefulness of breathing due to the posture and the expediency of the posture for laying hold of the subject of meditation
One sits in this posture having locked in the legs
It is the entirely thighbound sitting posture and is known as the lotus and the immovable posture too
Keeps his body erect Keeps the vertebrae in such a position that every segment of the backbone is said to be placed upright and end to end throughout
The body waist upwards is held straight
Arouses mindfulness in front Fixes the attention by directing it towards the breath which is in front
Mindful he breathes in and mindful he breathes out Breathes in and out without abandoning mindfulness
Digham va assasanto digham assasamiti pajanati digham va passasanto digham passasamiti pajanati  He thinking 'I breathe in long' understands when he is breathing in long or thinking 'I breathe out long' he understands when he is breathing out long
When breathing in long how does he understand 'I breathe in long'
When breathing out long how does he understand 'I breathe out long'
He breathes in a long breath during a long stretch of time he breathes out a long breath during a long stretch of time and he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths each during a long stretch of time
As he breathes in and breathes out long breaths each during a long stretch of time desire arises in him
With desire he breathes in a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time with desire he breathes out a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time and with desire he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of time
As with desire he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of time joy arises in him
With joy he breathes in a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time with joy he breathes out a long breath finer than the last during a long stretch of time and with joy he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of time
As with joy he breathes in and he breathes out long breaths finer than the last each during a long stretch of time the mind turns away from the long inandoutbreathings and equanimity stands firm
Sabbakayapatisamvedi Assasissami passasissamiti sikkhati  Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in breathe out thinking thus he trains himself He trains himself with the following idea I shall breathe in making known making clear to myself the beginning middle and end of the whole body of breathings in I shall breathe out making known making clear to myself the beginning middle and end of the whole body of breathings out
And he breathes in and breathes out with consciousness associated with knowledge making known making clear to himself the breaths
To one bhikkhu indeed in the tenuous diffused body of in breathing or body of outbreathing only the beginning becomes clear not the middle or the end
He is able to lay hold of only the beginning
In the middle and at the end he is troubled
To another the middle becomes clear and not the beginning or the end
To a third only the end becomes clear the beginning and the middle do not become clear and he is able only to lay hold of the breath at the end
He is troubled at the beginning and at the middle
To a fourth even all the three stages become clear and he is able to lay hold of all he is troubled nowhere
For pointing out that this subject of meditation should be developed after the manner of the fourth one the Master said Experiencing He trains himself
Since in the earlier way of the practice of this meditation there was nothing else to be done but just breathing in and breathing out it is said He thinking I breathe in understands and since thereafter there should be endeavor for bringing about knowledge and so forth it is said Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in
Passambhayam kayasamkharam assasissamiti passasissamiti sikkhati  Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in breathe out thinking thus he trains himself He thinks  I shall breathe in and I shall breathe out quieting making smooth making tranquil and peaceful the activity of the inandoutbreathing body
And in that way he trains himself
In this connection coarseness fineness and calm should be understood thus Without contemplative effort the body and the mind of this bhikkhu are distressed coarse
When the body and the mind are coarse the inandoutbreathings too are coarse and proceed uncalmly the nasal aperture becomes inadequate and he has to breathe through the mouth too
But when the body and the mind are under control then the body and the mind become placid restful
When these are restful the breathings proceed so fine that the bhikkhu doubts whether or not the breathings are going on
The breathing of a man who runs down from a hill puts down a heavy burden from his head and stands still is coarse his nasal aperture becomes inadequate and he breathes through the mouth too
But when he rids himself of his fatigue takes a bath and a drink of water and puts a wet cloth over his heart and is sitting in the shade his breathing becomes fine and he is at a loss to know whether it exists or not
Comparable to that man is the bhikkhu whose breaths become so fine after the taking up of the practice of contemplation that he finds it difficult to say whether he is breathing or not
What is the reason for this
Without taking up the practice of meditation he does not perceive concentrate on reflect on or think over the question of calming the gross activity of the breathing body the breaths but with the practice of meditation he does
Therefore the activity of the breathbody becomes finer in the time in which meditation is practiced than in the time in which there is no practice
So the men of old said
How does he train himself with the thought Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in breathe out
What are the activities of the body
Those things of the body of breaths those things bound up with that body are the activities of the body
Causing the bodyactivities to become composed to become smooth and calm he trains himself He trains himself thinking thus Calming the bodyactivity by way of the bodily activities of bending forwards sidewards all over and backwards and the moving quivering vibrating and quaking of the body I shall breathe in I shall breathe out
I shall breathe in and I shall breathe out calming the activity of the body by way of whatsoever peaceful and fine bodyactivities of nonbending of the body forwards sidewards all over and backwards of nonmoving nonquivering nonvibrating and nonquaking of the body
Indeed to that yogi training in respirationmindfulness according to the method taught thus He thinking 'I breathe in long' understands when he is breathing in long Calming the activity of the body I breathe out thinking thus he trains himself the four absorptions arise in the respiration sign
In the respiration sign  In the reflex image
Having emerged from the absorption he lays hold of either the respiration body or the factors of absorption
There the meditating worker in respiration examines the body thinking thus Supported by what is respiration
Supported by the basis
The basis is the coarse body
The coarse body is composed of the Four Great Primaries and the corporeality derived from these
The worker in respiration examines the respiration while devoting himself to the development of insight through the means of corporeality
The basis namely the coarse body is where the mind and mental characteristics occur
Thereupon he the worker in respiration cognizes the mind in the pentad of mental concomitants beginning with senseimpression
The first beginning with senseimpression are senseimpression feeling perception volition and consciousness
They are taken here as representative of mind
The worker in respiration examines the mind and the body sees the Dependent Origination of ignorance and so forth and concluding that this mind and this body are bare conditions and things produced from conditions and that besides these there is neither a living being nor a person becomes to that extent a person who transcends doubt
Besides these phenomena there is neither a living being nor a person refers to vision that is purified
Mindandbody is a bare impersonal process
It is not unrelated to a cause and also not related to a discordant cause like god but is connected with a cause like ignorance
A person who has transcended doubt regarding the past the future and the present
And the yogi who has transcended doubt while cultivating insight applies the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and soullessness to the mind and body together with the conditions and gradually reaches arahantship
Applies the three characteristics in order to grasp the qualities of the aggregates according to the method taught in the Anatta Lakkhana Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya beginning with the words Whatsoever form
The worker in absorption namely he who contemplates upon the factors of absorption also thinks thus Supported by what are these factors of absorption
By the basis
The basis is the coarse body
The factors of absorption are here representative of the mind
The coarse body is the body
Having determined thus he searching for the reason of the mind and the body seeks it in Conditions' Mode beginning with ignorance concludes that this mind and the body comprise just conditions and things produced by conditions and that besides these there is neither a living being nor a person and becomes to that extent a person who transcends doubt
And the yogi who transcends doubt thus while cultivating insight applies the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and soullessness to the mind and the body together with conditions and gradually reaches arahantship
Iti ajjhattam va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally This bhikkhu dwells in contemplation of the body in his own respiration body
By way of the practice of quietude however there is no arising of the sign of full absorption in another's respirationbody
Bahiddha va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally Or this bhikkhu dwells in contemplation of the body in another's respirationbody
Or in another's respirationbody
This portion deals with reflection for the growth of insight and has no reference to the growth of full absorption of quietude
Ajjhattabahiddha va kaye kayanupassi viharati  Or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally At one time in his own and at another in another's respirationbody he dwells in contemplation of the body
By this there is reference to the time when the yogi's mind moves repeatedly back and forth without laying aside the familiar subject of meditation
Without leaving aside at intervals nor from time to time nor occasionally
The time when the mind moves repeatedly back and forth
Or the time when the meditation proceeds incessantly in the internal and external phenomena
Both cannot occur at once
This pair of things stated in combination as internal and external cannot be found in the form of an object at one time simultaneously
It is not possible to objectify together is the meaning
Samudayadhammanupassi va kayasamim viharati  He lives contemplating originationthings in the body Just as the air moves back and forth depending on the smith's bellows' skin the bellows' spout and appropriate effort so depending on the coarse body nasal aperture and the mind of the bhikkhu the respirationbody moves back and forth
The things beginning with the body are origination kayadayo dhamma samudayo
The person who sees thus is he who lives contemplating originationthings in the body
Vayadhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati  Or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body In whatever way the air does not proceed when the bellows' skin is taken off the bellows' spout is broken and the appropriate exertion is absent even in that same way when the body breaks up the nasal aperture is destroyed and the mind has ceased to function the respirationbody does not go on
Thus through the ending of the coarse body the nasal aperture and the mind there comes to be the ending of the respirations
The person who sees in this way is he who lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body
Samudayavayadhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati  Or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in the body He lives contemplating origination at one time and dissolution at another
Origination is that from which suffering arises
Contemplating originationthings
Possessing the character of contemplation connected with the coarse body the nasal aperture and the mind the cause of the respirations
As the contemplation on originationanddissolutionthings too is split up as regards the scope of the object it is not possible to objectify both origination and dissolution at the same time
Atthi kayoti va panassa sati paccupatthita hoti  Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought 'The body exists' Mindfulness is established for the yogi through careful scrutiny
He thinks There is the body but there is no being no person no woman no man no soul nothing pertaining to a soul no I nothing that is mine no one and nothing belonging to anyone
Yavadeva  To the extent necessary It denotes purpose
This is said The mindfulness established is not for another purpose
What is the purpose for which it is established
Nanamattaya patissatimattaya  For just knowledge and remembrance That is just for the sake of a wider and wider or further and further measure of knowledge and of mindfulness
For the increase of mindfulness and clear comprehension is the meaning
For the purpose of reaching the knowledge of bodycontemplation to the highest extent is the meaning of To the extent necessary for just knowledge

Anissito ca viharati  And he lives independent He lives emancipated from dependence on craving and wrong views
With these words is stated the direct opposition of this meditation to the laying hold on craving and wrong views
Na ca kiñci loke upadiyati  And clings to naught in the world In regard to no visible shape or consciousness does he think this is my soul or this belongs to my soul
Evampi  Thus also
With this expression the Blessed One wound up the instruction on the section on breathing
In this section on breathing the mindfulness which examines the respirations is the Truth of Suffering
The precraving which brings about that mindfulness is the Truth of Origination
The nonoccurrence of both is the Truth of Cessation
The Real Path which understands suffering abandons origination and takes cessation as object is the Truth of the Way
Thus having endeavored by way of the Four Truths a person arrives at peace
This is the portal to emancipation of the bhikkhu devoted to meditation on breathing
The Buddha after dealing in the aforesaid manner with bodycontemplation in the form of respirationmeditation in detail said And further in order to deal exhaustively with bodycontemplation here according to the meditation on the modes of deportment
Gacchanto va gacchamiti pajanati  When he is going understands 'I am going' In this matter of going readily do dogs jackals and the like know when they move on that they are moving
But this instruction on the modes of deportment was not given concerning similar awareness because awareness of that sort belonging to animals does not shed the belief in a living being does not knock out the percept of a soul and neither becomes a subject of meditation nor the development of the Arousing of Mindfulness
Going
The term is applicable both to the awareness of the fact of moving on and to the knowledge of the characteristic qualities of moving on
The terms sitting standing and lying down too are applicable in the general sense of awareness and in the particular sense of knowledge of the characteristic qualities
Here the particular and not the general sense of awareness is to be taken
From the sort of mere awareness denoted by reference to canines and the like proceeds the idea of a soul the perverted perception with the belief that there is a doer and an experiencer
One who does not uproot or remove that wrong perception owing to nonopposition to that perception and to absence of contemplative practice cannot be called one who develops anything like a subject of meditation
But the knowledge of this meditator sheds the belief in a living being knocks out the idea of a soul and is both a subject of meditation and the development of the Arousing of Mindfulness
Indeed who goes whose going is it on what account is this going
These words refer to the knowledge of the going of the meditating bhikkhu
In the elucidation of these questions the following is said Who goes
No living being or person whatsoever
Whose going is it
Not the going of any living being or person
On account of what does the going take place
On account of the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity
Because of that this yogi knows thus If there arises the thought I shall go that thought produces the process of oscillation the process of oscillation produces expression
The moving on of the whole body through the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called going
The same is the method of exposition as regards the other postures standing and so forth
There too the yogi knows thus If there arises the thought I shall stand that thought produces the process of oscillation
The process of oscillation produces bodily expression
The raising upright of the whole body from below owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called standing
If there arises the thought I shall sit that thought produces the process of oscillation
The process of oscillation produces bodily expression
The bending of the lower part of the body and the raising upright of the upper part of the body owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called sitting
If there arises the thought I shall lie down that thought produces the process of oscillation
The process of oscillation produces bodily expression
The straightening or the spreading of the whole body horizontally or across owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation is called lying down
There who goes
is a doerquestion of the action of going without first separating efficient cause and action 
With the words whose going is it the commentator says the same thing in another way after separating efficient cause and action for making clear the absence of a doerconnection
On what account is it
This is a question for the real reason of the action of going from which the idea of a goer is rejected
Going is here shown to be one of the particular modes of bare phenomenal movement due to appropriate causeandcondition without attributing it to a fallacious reason such as the one formulated thus The soul comes into contact with the mind the mind with the senseorgans and the senseorgans with the object

No living being or person because of the proving of the going of only a bare phenomenon and because of the absence of anyone besides that phenomenon
Now to show proof of the going of a bare phenomenon the words beginning with on account of the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity were spoken by the commentator
There mental activity and the diffusion and agitation in the process of oscillation which is mental activity  diffusion of the process of mental activity
The commentator by mentioning mental activity eschews the diffusion of the process of oscillation connected with inanimate things and by the mention of the diffusion of the process of oscillation eschews the class of mental activity producing volitional verbalexpression
By the terms mental activity and the process of oscillation the commentator makes clear bodily expression
Produces the process of oscillation
Brings about the group of materiality with the quality of oscillation in excess
This group of materiality is that of the pure octad consisting of the Four Great Primaries symbolized by earth water fire and air and the four derived from these color smell taste and nutritive essence
Excess is to be taken here by way of capability and not by way of measure
The process of oscillation produces expression
This was said concerning the process of oscillation arisen from the thought of going
This process is a condition to the supporting with energy the bearing up and the movement of the conascent body of materiality
Expression is that change which takes place together with the intention
Oscillation is mentioned by way of a predominant condition and not by way of production through oscillation alone
Otherwise the state of derived materiality pertaining to expression would not be a fact
He who knows pursues the line of thinking in the following manner A living being goes A living being stands but there is no living being going or standing
This talk of a living being going or standing is similar to speech in the following way A cart goes A cart stands In fact there is no going cart and no standing cart
When with bulls a skilled driver is driving one conventionally speaking says A cart goes or A cart stands In the sense of a thing not able to go of itself the body is like the cart
Mindborn oscillation are like the bulls
Mind is like the driver
When the thought I go or the thought I stand arises the process of oscillation producing expression comes to existence
By the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity going and the other modes of deportment take place and then there are these forms of conventional speech A living being goes A living being stands I go I stand Therefore the commentator said
Accordingly this yogi who considers by way of causes and conditions the states of going standing and so forth knows well that he is going when he is in the state of going that he is standing when he stands that he is sitting when he sits and that he is lying down when he lies down as it is told in the passage in the discourse beginning with the words When he is going a bhikkhu understands 'I am going' Yatha yatha va panassa kayo panihito hoti tatha tatha nam pajanati  Or just as his body is disposed so he understands it
Iti ajjhattam va  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body examining his own four modes of deportment
Bahiddha va  Or externally Or examining the four modes of deportment of another
Ajjhattabahiddha va  Or internally and externally Or examining at one time his own four modes of deportment and at another time another's four modes of deportment he lives
Samudayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationthings Also dissolutionthings are included here
Origination and dissolution should be dwelt upon by way of the fivefold method beginning with the words He thinking 'the origination of materiality comes to be through the origination of ignorance' in the sense of the origin of conditions sees the arising of the aggregate of materiality
In the same way he sees the arising of the aggregate of materiality through the origination of craving karma and food in the sense of the origin of conditions and also while seeing the sign of birth
He sees the passing away of the aggregate while thinking that the dissolution of materiality comes to be through the dissolution of ignorance in the sense of the dissolution of conditions and through the dissolution of craving karma and food in the same way and while seeing the sign of vicissitude
For the arising of the materialityaggregate ignorance craving karma and food are the principal reasons
But these are not all
As it is said that one sees the arising of the materialityaggregate when beholding also the rebirthsign or the bare origination state called the integrationsuccession of the various material forms becoming manifest in the conscious flux owing to ignorance craving karma and nutriment and from consciousness and the process of caloricity the knowledge of arising is fivefold
Similarly the knowledge of passing away or ceasing is fivefold
The sign of vicissitude or change is the bare state of dissolution called impermanency
Atthi kayoti va panassa sati paccupatthita hoti  Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought 'The body exists' The exposition of this is to be done in the manner already stated in the preceding section
Here the mindfulness which examines the four modes of deportment is the Truth of Suffering
The precraving which brings about that mindfulness is the Truth of Origination
The nonoccurrence of either is the Truth of Cessation
The Real Path which understands suffering abandons origination and takes cessation as object is the Truth of the Way
The yogi having endeavored thus by way of the Four Truths arrives at peace
This is the portal to emancipation up to arahantship of the bhikkhu occupied with the four modes of deportment
After explaining bodycontemplation in the form of the meditation on the four modes of deportment the Master said And further to explain bodycontemplation by way of the four kinds of clear comprehension
On who is clearly comprehending is one who knows according to every way intensively or in a detailed way
Clear comprehension is the state of that one
It is likewise the knowledge of that one
Abhikkante patikkante  In going forwards in going backwards Here the meaning is as follows  Going forwards is called going
Going backwards is called turning back
Both these are to be found in all the four modes of deportment
Going here is going after turning back and going after not turning back
Turning back is the bare fact of turning back
This dyad is only mutually supported action
First in going carrying the body to a position in front  bringing the body along  is called going forwards
Turning back  returning thence  is called turning back
And in standing one just standing and bending the body to a position in front does what is called going forwards and one bending away behind  drawing back  does what is called going backwards
In sitting down one sitting and moving on  creeping on sliding on  to front portion comprising the frame and so forth of the seat ie chair stool or similar thing does going forwards and one moving away  sliding back  to the parts comprising the frame and so forth at the back of the chair or stool does what is called turning back
In lying down too the explanation is to be done according to the method stated above
Sampajanakari  Practicing clear comprehension Doing without fail all actions with clear comprehension
Or the doing of only clear comprehension
Clear comprehension  comprehending clearly
Both words mean the same thing their difference is only one of affix
Doing without fail all actions with clear comprehension is the character of doing what ought to be done by oneself with clear comprehension
The doing of only clear comprehension is the character of practicing clear comprehension
For the yogi practices only clear comprehension and is nowhere bereft of clear comprehension in going forwards and going backwards
There are these four kinds of comprehension clear comprehension of purpose of suitability of resort and of nondelusion
The discerning of things rightly entirely and equally is clear comprehension
Nothing else
This way of explanation is different from the commentary's
As it provides nondelusion in going forwards and backwards the action of clear comprehension is practice of clear comprehension
Who has that practice of clear comprehension is practicing clear comprehension
What takes place together with the aim called growth according to the Dhamma is purpose
The clear comprehension of purpose in going forwards and backwards is clear comprehension of purpose
The clear comprehension of what is suitable fit to oneself is clear comprehension of suitability
The clear comprehension of the resort which is called the subject of meditation that is unrelinquished in going backwards and forwards on the alms resort and elsewhere is the clear comprehension of resort
Clear comprehension of nondelusion is nondelusion that is clearly comprehending and is called nonstupefaction
Among these four kinds of clear comprehension the clear comprehension of purpose is the comprehension of purpose after considering what is worthy and not worthy with the thought Is there any use to one by this going or is there not One does this not having gone immediately just by the influence of the thought at the very moment the thought of going forwards is born
In this context purpose is growth according to the Dhamma by way of visiting a relic shrine Tree of Enlightenment the Sangha the elders and a place where the dead are cast for seeing the unlovely
By visiting a relic shrine a Bodhi Tree or the Sangha for producing spiritual interest and by meditating on the waning of that interest one could reach arahantship by visiting elders and by getting established in their instruction one could reach arahantship and by visiting a place where the dead are cast by seeing a corpse there and by producing the first absorption pathamajjhana in that unlovely object one could reach arahantship
So the visiting of these is purposeful
Arahantship
This is mentioned by way of the highest kind of exposition
Since the generating of quietude and insight too is growth according to the Dhamma for a bhikkhu
Some however say Increase by way of material gain too is purpose since material gain is helpful for the holy life
Some  Dwellers at the Abhayagiri Vihara at Anuradhapura
Material gain  Material requisites like robes
Clear comprehension of suitability is the comprehension of the suitable after considering what is suitable and not
For instance the visiting of a relic shrine could be quite purposeful
But when a great offering is made to a relic shrine a multitude of people in a ten or twelve yojana area gather and men and women according to their position go about adorned like painted figures
And if in that crowd greed could arise for the bhikkhu in an attractive object resentment in a nonattractive one and delusion through prejudice if he could commit the offence of sexual intercourse or if harm could come to the holy life of purity then a place like that relic shrine would not be suitable
When there could be no such harm it would be suitable
Prejudice is the name given to the grasping of an object without wise reflection by way of worldly ignorant complacency
Commit the offence of sexual intercourse by way of bodily contact with a woman
Harm come to the life through trampling down by an elephant and so forth
purity through seeing those of the opposite sex and so forth
The visiting of the Savgha is a purpose of worth
Still when there is allnight preaching in a big pandal in the inner village and there are crowds and one could possibly come to hurt and harm in the way mentioned earlier that place of preaching is not suitable to go to
When there is no hurt or harm possible one may go there as it would then be suitable
In visiting elders who are surrounded by a large following suitability and nonsuitability should also be determined in the way stated above
To visit a place where the dead are cast for beholding a corpse is fit and to explain the meaning of this the following story has been told
It is said that a young bhikkhu went with a novice to get wood for toothcleaners
The novice getting out of the road proceeded in front to a place in search of wood and saw a corpse
Meditating on it he produced the first absorption and making the factors of the absorption a basis for developing insight realized the first three fruitions of arahantship while examining the conformations and stood having laid hold of the subject of meditation for realizing the path of full arahantship
The young bhikkhu not seeing the novice called out to him
The novice thought thus From the day I took up the homeless life I have endeavored to let me never be called twice by a bhikkhu so I will produce the further distinction another day and replied to the bhikkhu with the words What's the matter reverend sir Come said the bhikkhu and the novice returned
The novice told the bhikkhu as follows Go first by this way then stand facing north at the place I stood for a while and look The young bhikkhu followed the novice's instruction and attained just the distinction reached by the novice
Thus the same corpse became profitable to two people
For the male the female corpse is not suitable and vice versa
Only a corpse of one's own sex is suitable
Comprehension of what is suitable in this way is called the clear comprehension of suitability
Further the going on the alms round of that one who has thus comprehended purpose and suitability after leaving and taking up just that resort  among the thirtyeight subjects of meditation  called the subject of meditation after his own heart is clear comprehension of resort
Subject of meditation refers to the object of concentration by way of locality of occurrence of the contemplative action that is being stated
Resort
Literally pasturing ground
This word is applied to the wandering for alms of a bhikkhu and to the subject of meditation in the sense of the locus sphere range or scope of contemplative action
For making manifest this clear comprehension of resort the following set of four should be understood In the Dispensation of the Buddha a certain bhikkhu on the journey out for alms takes along with him in the mind the subject of meditation but on the journey back from the work of almsgathering he does not bring it along with him having become unmindful of it
Another does not take it along with him on the outward journey but returns from the almstour with the subject of meditation in his mind
Still another neither takes it along with him on the outward journey nor returns with it on the journey home
And lastly there is the fourth kind of bhikkhu who both takes the subject of meditation along with him on the journey out for alms and brings it back with him on the journey home
Among these four kinds there is a certain bhikkhu who lives thus  By day he cleanses his mind of things that becloud  the hindrances  through meditation on the ambulatory and in the sitting posture
By night likewise on the ambulatory and in the sitting posture through meditation in the first watch and in the last watch he cleanses his mind of things that becloud after sleeping in the middle watch
Quite early in the day having done the duties connected with the terraces of the relicshrine and the Bhodhitree  sweeping and so forth  he sprinkles the Bodhitree with water places water for drinking and washing and attends to the Khandhaka duties beginning with the duties connected with the teacher and the preceptor
Thereafter having looked to the needs of his body  that is after bestowing that attention on the body which consists of washing the face and so forth  he enters his dwelling and practices the subject of meditation begun that day at several sittings
There two or three sittings  two or three sitting turns
Warming up is said concerning the matter of causing warmth to be taken up twice or thrice
The word sitting means sitting by way of the thighbound or locked posture
It is the posture called the lionpose and the firm pose
It is the sitting down of one with the left foot crossed on to the right thigh and the right foot on to the left thigh by way of interlocking through the bending of the thighs
When it is time to wander for alms he having got up from the sitting meditationpose and takes his bowl and robe with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind leaves his dwelling attending only to the thought of meditation
With just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind  Just with the subject of meditation in the forefront of the mind keeping to the thought of meditation
If when going to his alms collecting place the bhikkhu's thought of meditation is contemplation on the Buddha's qualities he on arriving at the relicshrine enters the shrine's precincts without having put aside his thought of meditation on the Buddha
But should his thought of meditation be something other than the Buddhasubject he having stood at the foot of the stairway leading to the shrineterrace put by his thought of meditation as if it were goods handcarried and acquired the joy begotten of the Buddhasubject of meditation goes up the stairway
If the relicshrine is a big one it should be worshipped at four places when the bhikkhu has gone round it three times to the right
If it is a small shrine it should be worshipped by the meditator in eight places when he has gone round it three times to the right just as in the case of the big shrine
By a bhikkhu who having worshipped a relicshrine has reached a Bodhitree shrine even the Bodhitree should be worshipped
And he should worship the Bodhitree showing meek demeanour as though he were in the very presence of the Buddha the Bhagava
In this way that monk having worshipped relicshrine and Boddhitree shrine goes to the place where he had put by his first subject of meditation namely to the bottom of the stairway
There having taken up the subject of meditation he had put by earlier and robed himself near the village with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind he enters the village for alms
There people after seeing the bhikkhu say Our venerable one has come and having gone forward to meet the bhikkhu taken his bowl conducted him to the sittinghall or to a house and made him take a seat offer gruel to him
Thereafter they wash and anoint his feet and till rice is ready sit in front of him and ask him questions or become desirous of listening to a talk on the Dhamma from him
Even if the people do not ask him to speak to them on the Dhamma the commentators say that a talk on the Dhamma should be given to the people in order to help them
The bhikkhus should expound the Dhamma for the purpose of assisting the folk with the grace of the Dhamma thinking If I do not expound the Dhamma to them who will
There is no Dhammatalk separate from the thought of meditation
This is said to strengthen the dictum of the commentators mentioned above
Therefore after expounding the Dhamma even with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind after partaking of the food with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind he leaves the village followed by the people who in spite of his requesting them to stop accompanying him
There after turning back those who followed him he takes the road to his dwellingplace
After expounding the Dhamma even with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind  After expounding the Dhamma just in accordance with the character of the thought of meditation that is being attended to by oneself by way of sticking to that thought
The method of exegesis is the same in regard to the next expression concerning food
After giving thanks
Here too the governing expression is Even with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind
There just at the place of departure from the village
The point at which the bhikkhu actually gets out of the village
Then novices and young bhikkhus who had taken their meal outside the village having left the village earlier than this bhikkhu see this bhikkhu coming
And they after going forward to meet him take his bowl and robe
It is said that bhikkhus of old did this duty without looking at the face of the returning bhikkhu and thinking our preceptor our teacher
In ancient times they did this duty according to the arrivinglimit
As the elder bhikkhu came the younger ones performed this duty not looking to see who the elder was
Those novices and young bhikkhus question the elder thus Reverend Sir who are these people to you
Are they relatives on the maternal side
Are they relatives on the paternal side  Having seen what do you query  Their affection and respect for you  Friends what even parents find it hard to do these people do for us
Our very robes and bowls are just due to them
Owing to these people we know no fear on occasions of fear and know no lack of food on occasions of famine
There are no people so helpful to us as these folk Speaking well of these people thus he goes
This bhikkhu is spoken of as a person who carries forth the subject of meditation when he leaves his dwelling but does not return with the thought of meditation
If to a bhikkhu who performs the duties detailed above betimes if his kammaproduced caloricity becomes very strong pajjalati lit flames up and lays hold of the derived assimilated material of the body owing to the absence of undigested food in the stomach if sweat exudes from his body and if he is unable to concentrate on his subject of meditation he takes his bowl and the robe quite early in the morning worships the relic shrine speedily and enters the village to get gruel just when the village herds go out of their pens for pasturing
After he gets the gruel he goes to sittinghall and drinks it
Then with the swallowing of just two or three mouthfuls the kammaproduced caloricity letting go the material of the body  ie the inner lining of the stomach lays hold of the property of the food taken in
And that bhikkhu having got to the assuagement of the distress of the caloric process like a man bathed with a hundred pots of cool water having partaken of the gruel with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind washed bowl and mouth attended to the subject of meditation till the later forenoon meal wandered for alms in the remaining places  in the places where he got no gruel and so where he could still go for alms  and taken the meal with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind returns having taken up just that subject of meditation which is thence forward present in his mind
This person is called the one who does not carry forth but returns with the thought of meditation
Kammaproduced caloricity is an expression referring to the function of that part of the alimentary tract where the bile helps digestion and from which vital heat spreads  the grahani according to Ayurveda
It is stated that the commentator said kammaproduced caloricity concerning the seizure the name of the alimentary function explained above
Becomes very strong means generates a condition of heat
Subject of meditation does not get on to the road of contemplative thought owing to the disappearance of concentration of the wearied body through hungerfatigue
When in the stomach indeed property like cooked rice is absent kammaproduced caloricity gets hold of the inner lining of the stomach
That causes the utterance of words like the following I am hungry give me food
When food is taken kammaproduced caloricity having let go the inner lining of the stomach gets hold of the foodproperty
Then the living being becomes calm
Therefore in the commentaries kammaproduced caloricity is spoken of as a shadowdemon
And bhikkhus like this one who after drinking gruel and exerting themselves in the development of insight reached the state of arahantship in the Buddha's Dispensation are past all numbering
In the Island of the Lion Race alone there is not a seat of sittinghall in the various villages which is not a place where a bhikkhu having sat and drunk gruel attained arahantship tesu tesu gamesu asanasalaya na tam asanam atthi yattha yagum pivitva arahattam patta bhikkhu natthi
And bhikkhus like this one and so forth
With these words the commentator points out the state of benefit of the bhikkhu attending to the thoughts of meditation even in the way aforesaid
But a bhikkhu who is a loose liver who is a slacker having broken all observances whilst living spiritually frozen through the fivefold bondage of mind having entered the village for alms without having even shown a sign of the fact that there is a thing called a subject of meditation and having walked about and eaten his meal in unbefitting company comes out of the village an empty fellow
This bhikkhu is called a person who neither carries forth nor returns with the thought of meditation
Who is spoken of with the words This one carries forth and carries back must be known just through the means of the observance of carrying forth and carrying back
Just through the means of the observance of carrying forth and carrying back means By way of whatsoever going for and returning from almsgathering only with the thought of meditation
Men of good family desirous of selfimprovement having become homeless ones in the Dispensation of the Buddha when living in a group of ten twenty fifty or a hundred make a covenant of observance with these words Friends you renounced not because you were troubled by creditors not because of fear of punishment from the king and not because of difficulties of subsistence produced by famine and the like but because you were desirous of release here
Therefore you should restrain the defilement that is born when going just in the process of going you should restrain the defilement that is born when standing just in the process of standing you should restrain the defilement that is born when sitting just in the process of sitting and you should restrain the defilement that is born when lying down just in the process of lying down
When after the making of such a covenant of observance they go on to a village for alms if there are stones by the road at distances of halfanusabha one usabha and one gavuta these bhikkhus proceed attending to the subject of meditation with awareness of those stones
If in the course of going a defilement of the mind arises in one just in the course of going one restrains or suppresses it
If one fails to do so one stops
Then he who comes behind one stops too
And one thinks This bhikkhu here knows the unclean thought that has arisen in you unbecoming is that to you Thus having reproved oneself and developed penetrative insight one steps into the Plane of the Noble Ones
If one is not able to do that one sits down and he who comes behind sits down too it is said that just is the method
Should one be not able to enter into the Plane of the Noble Ones then one having stopped the defilement goes attending to only the subject of meditation
One does not raise the foot with mind bereft of the subject of meditation but should one do so one having turned gets back again even to the earlier step
Desirous of selfimprovement  wishing for personal good and wellbeing  those wishing for the Dhamma is the true meaning  by reason of the fact that the Dhamma is truly good and wellbeing
Or to the wise the Dhamma is the self owing to the absence of difference from the self and owing to the state of being included in the living being
They desire wish for that tam kamenti icchanti
Newly  at the time this subcommentary was written  however the reading desirous of attainment by way of good is seen wishing for good that is connected with the Dhamma or wishing for the Dhamma that is good
Unbecoming is that means unbecoming is another's knowing of one's own defilement
This also should be understood as included even by another's knowing He makes systematic attention strong on account of the hungry condition of those coming behind pacchato agacchantanam chinna bhatta bhava bhayenapi yoniso manasikaram paribruhetiti idampi parassa jananeneva sangahitanti datthabbam
Even to the earlier step means just to the first footprint made with mind separate from the thought of meditation
Like the elder Maha Phussa the verandahdweller
With the stories beginning here the commentator lays low the misgiving about this observance for instance expressed thus Just impossible is that what is pointed out was indeed in this way practiced before
It is said that this elder dwelt for nineteen years fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and carrying back Plowmen sowers threshers of grain and other people having seen the elder go in this manner said This elder goes having halted again and again
Why does he do so
Has he got confused about the way or has he forgotten something
The elder by just doing the recluse's duty with mind yoked to the thought of meditation without giving heed to the talk of the people attained arahantship within twenty years
On the very day be became an arahant a deva who was living at the end of the elder's walking path stood emitting a radiance that came from the fingers of the deva
The Four Regents of the Earth Sakka the devaking and Brahma Sahampati came to serve the elder
Maha Tissa the forestdweller also an elder saw that radiance and inquired of the arahant the next day Last night there was a radiance about your reverence what was that
Diverting the talk the arahant said Radiance is that of light of gem and the like But on being pressed repeatedly with the words You are concealing he acknowledged saying Yes and informed Tissa of his attainment
Like the elder Maha Naga of the Black Creeper Pavilion
He it is said when fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and back the subject of meditation resolved upon keeping to only the postures of standing and of walking for seven years with the thought I will honor the Blessed One's great struggle And after fulfilling for sixteen years again the observance of carrying forth and carrying back the subject of meditation he attained arahantship
This is said of him He raises his foot only with mind yoked to the subject of meditation
If he raises with mind not yoked thus he turns back again
After standing at such a distance from the village as would raise the doubt Is it indeed a cow or a recluse and robing himself he fills his mouth with a draught of water from the watercarrier slung over the shoulder and hanging under the armpit having washed the bowl with water from the same source
For what reason does he fill his mouth so
He does it thinking Let there be no distraction of the mind even by the uttering of the words 'May you live long' to people coming to worship me or give me alms But when he is asked the question Reverend Sir which stage of the halfmonth is today concerning the date or when he is questioned about the number of monks he answers after swallowing the water
If there is no questioning about the day and so forth he having spat out the water at the village gate at the time of leaving goes
Like the fifty bhikkhus who entered upon the rainy season residence at the Monastery of the Galamba Landing Place
On the fullmoon day of July they made this covenant of observance  Without attaining arahantship we shall not converse with one another
These bhikkhus used to enter the village for alms filling the mouth with a draught of water and when questioned about the date and so forth they acted just according to the method mentioned above
In that village people having seen the spots on which mouthfuls of water had been spurted forth by the returning bhikkhus said Today one came today two And those people thought What indeed is the reason that these bhikkhus neither talk with us nor with each other
If they do not speak with each other surely they are persons who have had a dispute amongst themselves and saying Come we must make them forgive one another went  in a body  to the monastery
There they saw that no two bhikkhus were in the same place
Then a wise man in that crowd said Good people a place which quarrelsome folk occupy is not like this
The relicshrine and the Bodhishrine terraces are well swept
The brooms are well arranged
And water for drinking and water for washing are well set Then those people just turned back
And the bhikkhu of that monastery attained arahantship within three months and performed a Pure Pavarana ceremony
Diverting the talk  Turning away the talk because of unostentatiousness due to Realization
Keeping to only the postures of standing and walking This is said by way of the postures proper to be resolved upon for adherence
One restricts oneself to these postures not however by way of refusing to practice the propertobepracticed and necessary posture of sitting at mealtime and on such other occasions for by the word only it should be understood that one tops the remaining forms of sitting namely every sittingposture not absolutely necessary of practice and the posture of lying down
I will honor the Blessed One's great struggle
According to my strength I will do worship to the sixyear asceticism of extreme torture undertaken by the World's Redeemer for our sakes since even the honoring of the Master through conduct is the more praiseworthy kind of worship
Not so praiseworthy is the worship with material things
Pure pavarana
The Pavarana through the state of destruction of the outflowings  arahantship
Thus like the elder Maha Naga dweller in the Black Creeper Pavilion and like the bhikkhus who went into rainy season at the Galamba Ford Monastery the bhikkhu raises his foot only with mind yoked to the thought of meditation
Having reached the neighbourhood of the village filled the mouth with a draught of water and looked at the streets he enters the street where there are no quarrelsome drunkards gamesters and such folk or where there are no restive elephants horses and the like
There wandering for alms he does not go speedily like one in a great hurry since there is no ascetic practice of begging food speedily
He goes rather having become motionless like a water cart on uneven ground
Entering into each house in order spending such time as is suitable for concluding whether there is or not the tendency to offer alms he receives alms and comes to the inner village outer village or even to the monastery
There he seats himself in a place pleasant and good attends to the thought of meditation with the setting up of the perception of loathsomeness in food and reflects by way of the similes of axlegreasing applying ointment to ulcer and feeding on own child's flesh and eats the food fully followed with awareness of the eight attributes not for sport intoxication adornment or the filling up of those places of his body that have a deficiency of flesh
And he having eaten washes
Then he rests for a while the body that is tired with the business of eating
He attends to just the thought of meditation in the time after eating as in the time before eating and in the last watch of the night as in the first watch
This person is called one who carries forth and carries back the subject of meditation
The person who fulfills this observance of one who carries forth and carries back called the carrying forth when going out for alms and the bringing back when returning from the almsround reaches arahantship even in the period of youth if he is possessed of the sufficing condition the wherewithal to accomplish the destruction of ignorance and its defilements
If he fails to reach arahantship in early age then he reaches it in middle age if he fails in middle age then at the time of death if he fails at the time of death then after becoming a deva if he fails as a deva then at a time when no Buddha has appeared on earth he is born as a man and realizes the truth as a Buddha who is not able to communicate the truth to others and if he fails to realize the truth in that way then immediately on meeting a Fully Enlightened Buddha he becomes a person who intuits quickly like the elder Bahiya Daruciriya or a greatly wise one like the elder Sariputta or one of great psychic power like the elder Mogallana the Great or an exponent of ascetic practice like the elder Kassapa the Great or one endowed with clairvoyant power like the elder Anuruddha or an expert in discipline like the elder Upali or an expounder of the Dhamma like the elder Punna Mantaniputta or a forest dweller like the elder Revata or one of great learning like the elder Ananda or one desirous of training like the elder Rahula the Buddha's son
Amongst these four that form the set he who carries forth and carries back the subject of meditation reaches the crest of the clear comprehension of resort
Further nonconfusion in going forwards and so forth is the clear comprehension of nondelusion
That should be understood in the following way  In this Dispensation a monk without confusing himself like a blinded worldling who while going forwards or backwards becomes muddleheaded and believes thus The soul goes forward or The act of going forwards is produced by the soul or I go forwards or The act of going forwards is produced by me and the like thinks When there is the arising in one of the thought 'I am going forwards' just with that thought appears the process of oscillation originating from mind which brings to birth bodily expression
Thus by the way of the diffusion of the process of oscillation due to mental activity this skeleton called the body goes forward
In raising up the foot A two processes extension and cohesion are low weak and the other two processes caloricity and oscillation are high powerful so too in stretching out the foot B and in shifting away the foot C
But in dropping down the raised foot D and likewise in keeping the foot on the ground E and in pressing the foot against the ground F the first two processes are high and powerful and the second low and weak
There the material and mental phenomena in A do not occur in B those in B do not occur in C those in C do not occur in D those in D do not occur in E those in E do not occur in F
These phenomena after coming into existence in the form of several sections links and parts break quickly just in those places crackling like sesamum seeds thrown into a heated pan
In this matter who is the one that goes forward or whose going forward is there
In the highest sense what takes place is the going the standing the sitting down and the lying down of the processes
With material form in the several divisions
Low  Negligible poor in regard to standard
Since the process of caloricity with oscillation coming behind it is the condition for upraising caloricity and oscillation are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of upraising
Caloricity is specially conducive to the action of upraising and so in upraising oscillation is subordinate to caloricity
The processes of extension and cohesion are low in the action of upraising owing to their incapacity to raise up
Since the process of oscillation with caloricity coming behind it is the condition for stretching out and shifting away oscillation and caloricity are in preponderance by reason of capability in stretching out and shifting away
Oscillation is naturally active and because in the actions of stretching out and shifting away its movement is excessive caloricity is subordinate to oscillation in these actions
The other two processes are low in stretching out and shifting away because of the incapacity of these processes to stretch out and to shift away
Raising up is the lifting of a foot from a place already stepped on to
Stretching out is the carrying of a foot to the front from the place on which one is standing
Shifting away is the carrying of a foot sidewards for the purpose of avoiding stake and the like or for avoiding contact with the other foot already set on the ground
Or stretching out is the carrying of a foot to the place where the other foot is set and shifting away is the carrying of a foot further to a point beyond the place on which the other foot is
Since the process of cohesion with extension coming behind it is the condition for dropping down cohesion and extension are in preponderance by reason of capability in the action of dropping down
The nature of cohesion is most gravid and so in the laying down of an upraised foot extension is subordinate to cohesion
Because of their incapacity to drop down what is upraised the processes of caloricity and oscillation are called low in this connection
Since the process of extension with cohesion coming behind it is the condition for the keeping on the ground extension and cohesion are in preponderance by reason of capability in the keeping on the ground
In keeping the foot on the ground too as in the state of something fixed cohesion is subordinate to extension owing to the excessive functioning of the latter process
Cohesion is subordinate to extension also by way of the contactual action of the process of extension in pressing the foot against the ground
And here dropping down is lowering by way of relinguishment or laying down
The setting down thence of the foot on the ground and so forth is keeping the foot on the ground
After keeping the foot on the ground the coming to a complete standstill of the action of going by way of contacting is pressing the foot against the ground
There  In this going forward or among the six aforesaid divisions known as raising up stretching out shifting away dropping down keeping down and pressing against
In raising up  In the moment of upraising
Material and mental phenomena  The material phenomena proceeding in the form of upraising and the mental phenomena originating that materiality do not occur in stretching out by reason of their existing only for a moment
Throughout this is the method of exegesis in this passage
Just in these places  Wherever in the divisions beginning with upraising phenomena come to be just in those very places they perish
To be sure owing to swift change there is no going over of phenomena to another place
Sections  Division
Links  Joints
Parts  Portions
And all here is stated concerning the abovementioned divisions of the action of going which take place in the form of a differentiated serial process
More fleet than the group of devas running before the Sun's chariot  the group of devas in the shape of horses with keenedged razors attached to their heads and hoofs engaged in and taken to going plunging forwards some above and some below but never knocking against each other though moving close together  is the moment of existence of material phenomena
As the breakup of sesamum seeds that are roasted takes place almost at once with the sound of crackling the destruction of conditioned phenomena takes place almost at once with phenomena's arising
For similar to the crackling sound the sign of the breaking up of the sesamum seeds is arising the sign of the breaking up of conditioned phenomena owing to the destruction assuredly of phenomena that have arisen
Who is the one that goes forward
Just no one
Could it be said Whose going forward is there
No
Why
In the highest sense what takes place is the going the standing the sitting down and the lying down of the processes
The passage just mentioned is for dispelling the false idea of a self that goes forward which a confused blinded worldling is apt to possess or the passage is stated by way of objection and refutation
With material form in the several divisions means with material form in the aforesaid sixfold division
The conscious state of the thoughtunit that comes into existence when any material form comes into existence runs a course of its own and does not get into close contact with the material form in question nor does it get into repeated contact or relation with that material form
Therefore it is said one conscious state arises with material form and quite another ceases when that material form ceases
By reason of the absence of close or repeated contact of mind with matter this happens
Tension oscillation or vibration of mind is quicker than that of matter seventeen times
The words with material form in relation to the first sentence of the stanza mean with whatsoever material form arising simultaneously with a conscious state
And the same words in relation to the second sentence of the stanza refer to the material form already arisen and existing at the starting point of the seventeenth thoughtunit that occurs after the ceasingphase of the thoughtunit with which the aforesaid material form arose and which material form arisen already has a total duration from its arising to ceasing of seventeen consecutive thoughtunits and is possessed of the nature of ceasing together with the cessation of the seventeenth thoughtunit mentioned above namely of the seventeenth thoughtunit in its phase of dissolution or ceasing
Material and mental phenomena would perhaps be taken as things of equal duration if the matter were put in a different way to this
Should these two kinds of phenomena be wrongly considered as things of equal duration then there would be contradiction with such commentarial sayings as Material form is slowchanging is tardy as regards ceasing and with such textual sayings as I do not see a single thing so swiftly changing o bhikkhus as this mind
Since the nature of mind and mental characteristics is to cognize or to have objects mind and mental characteristics arise cognizing according to their strength the thing become a condition to mind and mental characteristics in the form of an object or the thing become an objectcondition to mind and mental characteristics
And immediately after the accomplishment or the effectuating of that which comprises the nature or quality of mind and mental characteristics and that quality is just the process of cognizing there occurs the ceasing of mind and mental characteristics
Material phenomena however do not take objects have no objects they do no cognizing
Material phenomena have to be cognized
Cognizibility's fulfillment occurs with sixteen thoughtunits
Hence the reduction of material phenomena to seventeen thoughtunits together with the one thoughtunit of the past is acknowledged by the commentator it is said
The swift changeability of mind or consciousness takes place through the mere combination of the other three mental aggregates with variform consciousness and through the mere combination of objects with the same consciousness that is replete with variegation
The state of slow change of material form occurs owing to the condition of sluggishness of the primaries namely of the processes of extension cohesion caloricity and oscillation symbolized by earth water fire and air respectively
Only the Tathagata he who has arrived at the Truth by traversing the Ancient Road of the Buddhas has knowledge of the different processes according to reality
And by means of that knowledge of the Tathagata the condition of prenascence as just a material phenomenon is stated
Likewise by that knowledge of the Tathagata the condition of postnascence too is stated
Because of the statement of the prenascent and postnascent conditions the identity of moment of occurrence of mental and material phenomena is just not fit
Therefore it was said by the commentator the elder Ananda thus Just according to the method stated should the meaning be understood here
This matter was stated in this way because it is easy to understand the simultaneity of cessation of mind and bodily or vocal expression
The meaning should be understood thus Quite another conscious state ceases with the ceasing of the material form arisen at the starting point of the seventeenth thoughtunit which is earlier to the material form together with expression that is physical in short seventeen thoughtunits arise and pass away during the lifetime of all material form except those connected with expression
The passage should be constructed thus One conscious state ceases and quite another arises  ie the conscious states at the arising and the ceasing of material phenomena are different
Indeed one is the word explanation another is the explanation of the sense
While the conscious state arisen earlier in ceasing it ceases in just the form of proximitycondition and so forth to another conscious state arising after it
Then another conscious state which has just obtained a condition arises
And here in a different state by reason of the difference of occasion
Alokite  In looking straight on Vilokite  In looking away from the front Here looking straight on  seeing in the direction in front of oneself
Looking away from the front  Looking out in all other directions
And other kinds of seeing by way of turning the eye in the direction above in the direction beneath and in the direction behind are called looking upwards looking downwards and looking backwards
Here those are not taken
But just these two  looking straight on and looking away from the front  are taken by way of what is befitting
Or by this method it is said all those are also taken
By way of what is fitting  In the form of that which is suitable to a recluse
Since looking downwards could happen in such actions as sweeping and plastering the floor with clay and cowdung looking upwards in removing cobwebs and other similar actions and looking backwards in such actions as the avoiding of danger coming from behind it is said that the commentator uttered the passage beginning with the words Or by this method
By that the commentator points out that the statement is also one of the kind that implies what is not expressed  an elliptical statement
Here the comprehending of purpose without having just looked by the force of the thought when the thought I shall look straight on arises is clear comprehension of purpose
That should be understood by making the venerable elder Nanda the example of a person who perceives through experience by the body
The following is stated in this connection Should looking straight on in the eastern direction become a thing that must be done by Nanda he looks straight on in the eastern direction having reflected with all his mind thus 'May no covetous griefproducing mean unskillful mental phenomena flow upon me while I am looking in the eastern direction' There he becomes mindful thus Further purposefulness and suitability here too should be understood just according to the manner in which they are explained in connection with the worshipping of a relic shrine and so forth
When the venerable elder Nanda was working for insight he slid into an unfavorable state of mind beginning with boredom in regard to the holy life and on becoming aware of that state of mind of his he stirred himself saying I shall restrain myself well Then having become energetic and very conscientious regarding guardedness at the doors of the controlling faculties of sense he reached the state of one of great perfection in selfrestraint through the fulfillment of all duties
By reason of that perfection the Master placed him in the position of preeminence in regard to the controlling faculty of restraint with the words This one namely Nanda O bhikkhus is the chief among my disciples endowed with the controlling faculty of restraint
Because clear comprehension of resort is just the keeping to the course of meditation looking straight on and looking away from the front should be done just according to each person's meditation with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind
Within it is said there certainly is no self or soul which looks straight on or looks away from the front
Still at the arising of the thought I shall look straight on and with that thought the process of oscillation originating from mind bringing into being bodily expression arises
Thus owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity the lower eyelid goes down and the upper eyelid goes up
Surely there is no one who opens with a contrivance
Thereupon eyeconsciousness arises fulfilling the function of sight it is said
Clear comprehension of this kind here is indeed called the clear comprehension of nondelusion
Further clear comprehension of nondelusion should be also understood here through accurate knowledge of the root through the casual state and through the temporary state
First by way of the accurate knowledge of the root 
There in the course of cognition the lifecontinum goes on fulfilling the function of a factor of the rebirthprocess after the turning round of the lifecontinum a barely active mind process fulfilling the function of adverting or attending to an object at the sensedoor of the eye goes on from the cessation of that fulfilling the function of seeing eyeconsciousness goes on from the cessation of that a resultant mind process fulfilling the function of receiving goes on from the cessation of that a resultant mind consciousness process fulfilling the function of considering goes on from the cessation of that a barely active mind consciousness process fulfilling the function of determining goes on from the cessation of that an impulsion impels seven times
Now among the mental states of the lifecontinum and so forth or even in the mental state of the first impulsion there is no looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hatred or ignorance by him who sees in any direction
Also there is no such stained vision by him in the mental state of the second impulsion the third the fourth the fifth sixth or even in the seventh impulsion
But when like soldiers in a battlefield the mental states after breakingup gradually are fallen one atop of another there takes place looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hate and ignorance accompanied by the discriminatory thought This is a woman or This is a man much in the same way as the fallen are distinguished after a battle for in the frenzy of fighting there is no room for recognition of the individuals engaged in the fray
Thus here in the first instance clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood by way of the accurate knowledge of the root
The passage beginning with the words Within it is said there certainly is no self or soul is stated to explain that looking straight on or looking away from the front is to be sure just a variety of occurrence of even bare phenomena and that therefore clear comprehension of nondelusion is the knowing of that fact as it really is
Accurate knowledge of the root  comprehension of the fundamental reason of impulsion at the minddoor
Through the casual state through the state of one coming as a stranger
Through the temporary state through the state of proceeding only at a certain moment tam khana matta pavattakassa bhava
Fulfilling the function of a factor of the rebirthprocess means accomplishing the principal work of a link what is stated by that is this having become substance
The lifecontinum is indeed the principal factor and the principal basis because of similarity to the relinking mind
Therefore it is called the principal factor and basis or it is called so owing to its fulfilling of the function of a ground or reason by way of the causal condition of unbroken procedure
The expression After the turning round of that has been stated by way of general reference to the lifecontinum threefold as regards procedure past thoughtunit of the lifecontinum movement of the lifecontinum and stoppage of the lifecontinum
At this place turning round refers just to the stoppage of the lifecontinum
From the cessation of that  Owing to the dissolution of that  expressions of reason by way of proximitycondition
Even in the first impulsion and so forth ending with the seventh impulsion
This passage has been stated concerning the absence of lust hate and ignorance with the thought This is a woman or This is a man in the course of cognition at the five doors of sense
In this matter indeed owing to the existence of mental states by way of adverting and the rest up to determining without radical reflection on account of reflecting unwisely prior to advertingdetermining impulsion that is with a bare semblance of greed arises in regard to a liked object such as a female form and impulsion that is with a bare semblance of hate arises in regard to an object not liked
There is however no occurrence of lust hate and ignorance in an extreme way with strong moral consequences in the course of sensedoor cognition
Only in the course of minddoor cognition lust hate and ignorance occur absolutely that is with strong moral consequences
But impulsion of the course of sensedoor cognition is the root of lust hate and ignorance of minddoor course of cognition
Or even all beginning with the mental state of the lifecontinum can be taken as the root of minddoor impulsion
Thus accurate knowledge of the root has been stated by way of the rootreason of minddoor impulsion
The casual state and the temporary state indeed on account of the newness of just impulsion of the course of cognition at the five doors of sense and on account of the brevity of the same impulsion
After breaking up gradually are fallen one atop of another on account of the turning round  changing moving  early and later or before and after or below and above in the form of the arising of the mental state of the lifecontinum
Likewise indeed the falling after breaking down of the mental states on account of the arising of the mental state of the lifecontinum tatha bhavanguppada vasena hi tesam bhijjitva patanam
By this indeed the commentator shows by way of the gradual arising of the earlier and the later mental state of the lifecontinum the arising of the impulsion of the minddoor course of cognition which is different to the impulsion of the course of cognition at the five doors of sense
Because of the proceeding of lust and the like by just the way of minddoor impulsion the commentator said even thus There takes place looking straight on or looking away from the front by way of lust hatred and ignorance
On an object falling within reach of consciousness at the eyedoor impulsion arises right at the very end when from the movement of the lifecontinum onwards the states of adverting seeing receiving considering and determining having arisen have ceased
That impulsion is like a visitor at the eyedoor which is comparable to a house belonging to the states of adverting and the rest mentioned above born there before the arising of impulsion
As it is not fit for a visitor who has arrived at a strange house for the purpose of getting some assistance from the owners of the house to do any kind of ordering when the owners themselves are silent so it is unfit for impulsion to be involved in lust hate and ignorance at the eyedoor house of adverting and the other states of mind when those states of mind are themselves not lusting hating or bound up with ignorance
Clear comprehension of nondelusion should thus be known by way of the casual state
At the eyedoor the mental states that close with the state of determining arise and break up together with associated phenomena at just those places on which they arise
They do not see each other
Therefore the mental states that close with determining are brief and temporary
There as in a house of the dead where here is one more to die just at that very instant it is not proper for that one who is to die to be given to delight in dancing and singing and the like even so at a sensedoor when the states of adverting and the rest with associated phenomena have died just where they arose it is not fit for the remaining impulsion that is to die shortly to take delight in anything by way of lust and the like
Clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood thus by way of the temporary state
Like a visitor  Like someone come specially a stranger
Visitors are of two kinds by way of a guest that is a person who comes and goes a person who does not stay permanently in a place and by way of someone who comes specially to a place a stranger
In this connection one who is an acquaintance or one who is known is a guest
One who is not an acquaintance and is unknown is a stranger
According to the context here a stranger is meant
Since to these mental states there is just that duration limited to the process of riseandfall of mental phenomena these states of mind are called temporary
And further this clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood by way of the reflection on the aggregates bases processes and conditions
To be sure here eye and visible object are materialityaggregate seeing is consciousnessaggregate feeling that is associated with seeing is feelingaggregate perceiving is perceptionaggregate and those beginning with senseimpression are formationaggregate
Thus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these five aggregates
There who singly looks straight on
Who looks away from the front
Seeing  Eyeconsciousness
By reason of knowing the acts of looking straight on and of looking away from the front in that way only as eyeconsciousness adverting and the rest are left out as bare seeing only is in eyeconsciousness
Separate from that fivefold aggregate who singly looks straight on
Who singly looks away from the front
None singly only by oneself indeed looks straight on and none singly only by oneself looks away from the front  this reply is intended to be given to the questions
In the same way eye is eyebase visible object is materialitybase seeing is mindbase feeling and so forth the associated things are thingbase
Thus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these four bases
There who singly looks straight on
Who looks away from the front
Likewise eye is eyeprocess visible object is materialityprocess seeing is eyeconsciousnessprocess and the things beginning with feeling associated with eyeconsciousness are mindprocess
Thus lookingstraightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these four processes
There who singly looks straight on
Who looks away from the front
Exactly in the manner already stated eye is supportcondition visible object is objectcondition adverting is condition of proximity contiguity decisivesupport absence and disappearance light is condition of decisivesupport and those beginning with feeling are conascencecondition
Thus looking straightonandlookingawayfromthefront is seen in the combination of these conditions
There who singly looks straight on
Who looks away from the front
With the words light is the condition of decisivesupport the conditionality of seeing is stated through the Suttanta method through the way of illustrated discourse discursively indirectly
Conascencecondition too belongs to just seeing
This is only an example owing to the obtaining also of conditions of mutuality association presence nondisappearance and so forth
Here in this way by reflection on the aggregates bases processes and conditions too clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood
Sammiñjite pasarite  in bending and in stretching In the bending and the stretching of the joints
The consideration of purpose and lack of purpose in regard to any contemplated act of bending or stretching and the taking up of that which is purposeful after not bending and stretching according to merely the mind's inclination is clear comprehension of purpose
In this matter a person who experiences pain every moment due to standing long with bent or stretched hands or feet does not get concentration of mind his subject of meditation entirely falls away and he does not obtain distinction
But he who bends or stretches his hands and feet for the proper length of time does not experience pain gets concentration of mind develops his subject of meditation and attains distinction
Thus the comprehension of purpose and nonpurpose should be known
Clear comprehension of suitability is the comprehension of the suitable after considering the suitable and the nonsuitable even in a matter that is purposeful
In this connection the following is the method of explanation It is said that on the terrace of the Great Relic Shrine while young bhikkhus were rehearsing the doctrine young bhikkhunis standing at the back of the bhikkhus were listening to the rehearsal
Then a young bhikkhu came into bodily contact with a bhikkhuni while stretching out his hand and by just that fact became a layman
Another bhikkhu in stretching his foot stretched it into fire and his foot got burnt to the bone
Another stretched his foot on an anthill and was bitten in the foot by a poisonous snake
Another bhikkhu stretched out his hand till it rested on the pole of a robetent a ribbonsnake on the pole bit the hand of that bhikkhu
Therefore the stretching of one's limbs should be done in a suitable and not an unsuitable place
This should be understood here as clear comprehension of suitability
Just by the showing of the tribulation of noncomprehension of that the felicity of comprehension is made clear thus here the illustration of these should be understood
In the terrace of the Great Relic Shrine  In the terrace of the great relic shrine known by the name of Hemamali at Anuradhapura in Lanka built by the king Dutthagamini
By just that fact became a layman  By reason of coming into bodily contact with a female that bhikkhu having become filled with longing for sensedelights turned to the lower life of the world
On the pole of a robetent  On a pole fixed to the roof of a tent covered with robes
It is said by the commentator that bhikkhus having made a robetent were in that tent rehearsing the doctrine even on the terrace of the Great Relic Shrine
It is said by the commentators the elders Ananda and Dhammapala that the ribbonsnake is a snakespecies found in Lion Island
Clear comprehension of resort should indeed be illustrated by the story of the senior bhikkhu called Great Elder
It is said that Great Elder seated in his dayquarters bent his arm quickly whilst talking to his resident pupils and then after putting back his arm to the position in which it first was bent it again slowly
The resident pupils questioned him thus Reverend Sir why after bending the arm quickly did you having placed it in the position in which it first was bend it slowly Friends until now I did not bend this arm with a mind separate from the subject of meditation ever since I began to attend to the subject of meditation
Therefore having put back the arm in the place it was first in I bent Good
Reverend Sir
A bhikkhu should be one who acts thus Here too it should be understood that the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation is clear comprehension of resort
Subject of meditation  The subject of meditation of the elements that is according to the method about to be stated with the words Within there is no soul and so forth
Within there is no soul that bends or stretches
By the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity bending and stretching occur
Indeed here it should be understood that the knowing in this way is clear comprehension of nondelusion
Sanghati patta civara dharane  In wearing the shouldercloak the other robes and the bowl
In this connection purpose is what accrues materially to one on the almsround and what is stated by the Blessed One according to the method beginning with the words for keeping out cold for keeping out heat
Suitable to one who is naturally warmbodied is fine clothing and that is suitable to one who is weak too
To the susceptible to cold is suitable thick clothing made of two pieces of cloth laid one over the other and stitched together Nonsuitable to these is clothing contrary to the kind mentioned above
A wornout robe is indeed not suitable as that robe will even be hindrancecausing when one patches and sews or darns it
Likewise hindrancecausing are robes of silk fine hemp and similar material that stimulate cupidity
For to the lonedweller in the forest such robes are productive of loss of clothing and of life
With the words to the lonedweller in the forest such robes are productive of loss of clothing the commentator mentioned in part what constitutes the loss of the life of purity and it is stated so because clothing is properly free to be taken or used by or accessible to thieves and the like
The robe acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the robe which decreases the good and increases the bad in the one who wears it are irreversibly not suitable
Just by that statement the commentator shows that the nonsuitable mentioned earlier is not nonsuitable absolutely because of the possibility of the nonsuitable mentioned earlier becoming suitable to someone at some time owing to this or that reason
This pair here is however absolutely nonsuitable on account of the absence of suitability to anyone at any time
Here from the foregoing clear comprehension of the suitable and the nonsuitable should be understood as the holding fast to the line of meditative thought by way of the nonabandoning of the line of contemplation which the commentator is going to state clear comprehension of resort should be understood
Within there is nothing called a soul that robes itself
According to the method of exposition adopted already only by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity does the act of robing take place
The robe has no power to think and the body too has not that power
The robe is not aware of the fact that it is draping the body and the body too of itself does not think I am being draped round with the robe Mere processes clothe a processheap in the same way that a modelled figure is covered with a piece of cloth
Therefore there is neither room for elation on getting a fine robe nor for depression on getting one that is not fine
Within
In one's own mental flux
Body too
Body too is only an egoconcept
I  Karma produced body
Processes  External processes called robes
Processheap  The internal processcollection called the body
Some honor an anthill where a cobra de capello lives a treeshrine and so forth with garlands perfumes incense cloth and similar things
Others maltreat these objects
Anthill treeshrine and the like are however neither elated by the good nor depressed by the bad treatment
Just in the same way there should be no elation on receiving a good robe or depression on getting a bad one
Clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood in this connection as the proceeding of reflective thought in this way
And in using the bowl clear comprehension of purpose should be understood by way of the benefit obtainable through the action of one who takes the bowl unhurriedly and thinks Going out to beg with this I shall get alms
With the seeing of the purpose the obtaining of food should the bowl be taken by one
In this way indeed does clear comprehension of purpose arise
To one with a lean body which is weak a heavy bowl is not suitable
And not suitable is a damaged bowl that is tied with thread and stopped in four or five places and hard to wash properly
A bowl that is hard to wash well certainly is not fit
There will be inconvenience caused to him who washes that kind of bowl
A bowl that is hard to wash well This was said concerning a bowl difficult to wash properly naturally though it may be without mends
A bright bowl which shines like a gem and therefore is capable of stimulating the cupidity of others is not suitable for the same reasons given in regard to robes of silk fine hemp and so forth
Just irreversibly unsuitable are the bowl acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the bowl by which good decreases and evils increase
Through this explanation clear comprehension of suitability in this connection should be understood
And by the fact even of the holding fast to the subject of meditation should clear comprehension of resort be understood
Within there is nothing called a self that is taking the bowl
As stated already by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity there is the taking of the bowl
In this matter of taking the bowl the bowl cannot think
Hands too cannot think
The bowl does not cognize that it is taken by the hands
Hands do not cognize that the bowl is taken by them
Just processes take a processheap
It is comparable to the taking of a redhot vessel with a pair of tongs
By way of the proceeding of reflective thought in this way clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood in bowltaking
And further it is like this When kindly people see in a refuge for the helpless unfortunate persons with hands and feet cut off and with blood pus and many maggots in the open wounds and give to the unfortunate persons bandages and medicine in containers some of the miserable sufferers in the refuge may get thick bandages and containers not shapely others may get thin bandages and shapely containers
None of the sufferers will feel elated or depressed about the kind of bandages and containers they receive
That is because they merely want cloth to cover their wounds and containers for keeping medicine
Now the bhikkhu who regards the robe as a bandage the bowl as a medicinecontainer and almsfood as medicine in the bowl through clear comprehension of nondelusion should be taken as a person endowed with the highest clear comprehension
A person endowed with the highest clear comprehension should be known by way of the discernment of fineness of the characteristic activity of one possessed of the highest clear comprehension and by way of the highest state of the previous practicers of clear comprehension
As to purpose there is the eightfold purpose referred to with the words Not for sport and so forth in the formula of reflection on the four requisites of a bhikkhu
As such should clear comprehension of purpose be known
Nonsuitable to one is the food by which to that one there is discomfort whatever the food may be in quality or taste coarse or fine or bitter or sweet or anything else
Suitable is food that does not cause discomfort
Just irreversibly nonsuitable are these the food acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the food by which good decreases and evils increase in one who partakes of it
Food which is got by right means and food which does not cause decrease of good and increase of evil in the one taking it are suitable
In this matter of the partaking of food clear comprehension of suitability should be understood according to the explanation given above and the clear comprehension of resort should be understood by way of the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation
Within there is no eater called a self
As stated already by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only there is the receiving of food in the bowl by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only there is the descent of the hand into the bowl and by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity only the making of the food into suitable lumps the raising of the lumps from the bowl and the opening of the mouth take place
No one opens the jaws with a key
No one opens the jaws with a contrivance
Just by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity take place the putting of a lump of food in the mouth the pestleaction of the upper row of teeth the mortarwork of the lower row of teeth and the tongue's activity comparable to that of the hand collecting together material that is being crushed
Thus that lump of food in the mouth is mixed together with the thin saliva at the end of the tongue and the thick saliva at the root of the tongue
That food in the mortar of the lower teeth turned by the tongue moistened by the saliva and ground fine by the pestle of the upper teeth is not put into the stomach by anyone with a ladle or a spoon
Just by the process of oscillation it goes on
There is no one within who having made a straw mat is bearing each lump that goes in
Each lump stands by reason of the process of oscillation
There is no one who having put up an oven and lit a fire is cooking each lump standing there
By only the process of caloricity the lump of food matures
There is no one who expels each digested lump with a stick or pole
Just the process of oscillation expels the digested food
It is oscillation that does the taking onward the moving away from side to side and it is oscillation that bears turns round pulverizes causes the removal of liquidity and expels
Extension also does bearing up turning round pulverizing and the removal of liquidity
Cohesion apodhatu moistens and preserves wetness
Caloricity ripens or digests the food that goes in
Space becomes the way for the entering of the food
Consciousness as a consequence of right kind of action knows in any particular situation
According to reflection of this sort should the clear comprehension of nondelusion be understood here
Taking onward moving on up to the mouth
Moving away from side to side taking forwards from there to the belly
Again taking onward  carrying beyond the mouthaperture
Moving away from side to side  taking what is going bellywards sidewise
Bears  causes to stand in the stomach
Turns round  causes to turn back and forth
Pulverizes  causes the complete powdering as if by a pestle
Expels  causes the depositing outside the belly
In regard to the functions of the process of extension too the explanation is similar to that which has been already stated
Indeed these  bearing turning pulverizing drying  the process of oscillation is able to do only together with the process of extension
Not singly by itself
Therefore these  bearing turning pulverizing the removal of liquidity or drying  too are stated by way of the function of the process of extension
Moistens  makes humid
Preserves wetness Just as there is no very great drying by the process of oscillation and so forth so the process of cohesion preserves wetness by not wetting quite
The way  the way for entering turning round expelling
Process of consciousness  mindconsciousness process the knowledge in regard to seeking food swallowing and the like
In any particular situation  in any function of seeking swallowing or other similar act
Right kind of action
The act which even completes a function and becomes a condition for any particular kind of knowledge
That act causes fulfillment of even the knowledge of the scope of that function by reason of that knowledge not arising without the act
Knows
Perceives understands by way of seeking by way of full experience of swallowing by way of the digested the undigested and so forth
It should be understood that as knowledge is always preceded by the adverting or the turning of the mind to a thing knowledge too is included here
Further the clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood through reflection on the unpleasantness connected with food in the following ten ways By way of the need to go to get it to seek it the process of eating it by way of the receptacle by way of the belly by way of food that is undigested by way of food that is digested by way of the consequences of eating by way of the trickling or oozing of food from the body's openings in the form of excretions and by way of the pollution due to food
The detailed exposition of the contemplation on the unpleasantness connected with food is given in the Path of Purity
By way of the need to go for it By way of going towards the almsvillage in the sense of wandering for alms
The return journey is also included
By way of the need to seek it By way of wandering for alms in the almsvillage
Entry into a retiring hall and the like become included in this naturally
By way of the process of eating it By way of taking in the contemptible food comparable to dog's vomit in a dog's food trough rid of color and odor just when the tongue turns the food which has been reduced to pulp by the pestles of the teeth
By way of the receptacle Through the food thus taken in becoming the condition for prime contemptibility by way of the fourfold receptacle placed on the top of the stomach
What stands exists there in the upper part of the stomach is the staying place the receptacle
By way of the food that is undigested By way of nonpreparation of the food in the stomach and the intestines for absorption by the body through the process of karmaproduced caloricity called the seizer a supposed organ of the body which functions in digestion according to Ayurvedic teaching of ancient India
By way of the food that is digested Digested through just the karmaproduced process of caloricity abovementioned
By way of the consequences of eating By way of effect
By way of the business called the bringing about of carcassproducts like hair and diseases like skin eruptions through the digested and undigested food
This is stated by the commentator as the fruit of food
By way of the trickling or oozing of food from the body's openings in the form of excretions By way of the flowing out from eye ear and several other openings here and there
For it is said by the Ancients
By way of the pollution due to food By way of the smearing throughout when eating of the hands lips and other members of that kind and after eating of the nine openings or doors of the body
Uccara passavakamme  In defecating and in urinating means When the time is come when the time is proper if one does not defecate or urinate then one's body perspires one's eyes reel one's mind is not collected and illness in the form of sharp pain fistula and so forth arise for one
But to one who defecates and urinates at the proper time none of these discomforts disadvantages troubles and illnesses arise
This is the sense in which this matter should be understood and in this sense should clear comprehension of purpose in defecation and urination be taken
By defecating or urinating in an improper place one commits disciplinary offences one goes on getting a bad name and one endangers one's life
Fields occupied or frequented by humans and places occupied or frequented by devas and devasanctuaries are improper
Angry men and spirits cause even death to those who defecate or urinate in such places
By using such places for cleansing the waste of the body bhikkhus and bhikkunis become guilty of the disciplinary offences of minor wrongdoing or of acts expiable by confession according to the circumstances
But to one evacuating the bowels or the bladder in a place suitable for such evacuation those offences or troubles just mentioned above have no reference
And by way of that fitness of place clear comprehension of suitability should be understood
By the nonabandoning of the subject of meditation clear comprehension of resort should be understood
Within there is no doer of the act of defecation or urination
Only by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity defecation and urination occur just as in a matured boil by the bursting of the boil pus and blood come out without any kind of wishing to come out and just as from an overfull waterpot water comes out without any desire for coming out so too the feces and urine accumulated in the abdomen and the bladder are pressed out by the force of the process of oscillation
Certainly this fecesandurine coming out thus is neither that bhikkhu's own nor another's
It is just bodily excretion
When from a watervessel or calabash a person throws out the old water the water thrown out is neither his nor other's
It simply forms parts of a process of cleansing
In the form of reflection proceeding in this way clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood
Now we come to the explanation of the instruction dealing with clear comprehension in walking in standing in a place in sitting in some position in sleeping in walking in speaking and in keeping silence  Gate thite nisinne sutte jagarite bhasite tunhibhave
By the words When he is going a bhikkhu understands 'I am going' and so froth postures of long duration are indicated
And by the words in going forwards and backwards in bending and in stretching postures of middling duration and by the words in walking in standing In sleeping postures of short brief duration
Therefore in these three parts of the instruction the practicing of clear comprehension should be known even by the triple method stated here
Postures of long duration postures kept up long or postures existing in a process of going for or of one wayfaring long
Postures of middling duration postures proceeding neither too long in time nor involving too long wayfaring namely those connected with wandering for alms and so forth
Postures of short duration postures become diminutive by reason of brief duration and proceeding by way of going about and so forth in the monastery or elsewhere
The Elder Tipitaka Maha Siva indeed said Who after walking or exercising long in the ambulatory stands and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of exercises on the ambulatory ended just there on the ambulatory is called a doer of clear comprehension in walking
When after standing for a long time in study or answering a question or minding a subject of meditation sits and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of standing ended just at the time of standing is called a doer of clear comprehension in standing
Who after sitting for a long time in study or other similar work lies down and reflects The bodily and mental things which existed when sitting ended just at the time of sitting is called a doer of clear comprehension in sitting
Who after lying down falls asleep and then after getting up from his sleep reflects The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of sleep ended just during sleep is called a doer of clear comprehension in sleeping and waking
By reason of proximity of the word waking here the action of lying down is only sleep in the sense of the descent of the mind into the state of the lifecontinum
It is not merely the stretching out of the back
The nonoccurrence of processes which make action or are made of action is sleep the occurrence waking
Action is doing function of body and so forth
The processes which make action produce the function of bodily expression or the function of verbal expression
Or action is the double function of adverting
The things made of or produced from that action or double function are processes made of action
For by way of adverting when there is the stoppage of the lifecontinum courses of cognition arise
Processes are things which go on move changing by arising gradually in different ways
Somewhere there is the reading of mental states of actionmaking mental states kriyamaya cittanam It should be understood that this is not a reading of the Ancients as it is against the commentary and explanation to the Abhidhamma and other books
Impulsion of either course of cognition is a process made of action
Therefore it is said in the explanation to the Abhiddhamma On account of the condition of processes making action of body and so forth and by reason of the condition of originating action of adverting impulsion of either course of cognition or lust of every process of the six doors gets known as a process which makes or is made of action
Nonoccurrence Nonarising at the time of falling asleep is called sleep
Thus the thing should be understood
Otherwise sleep could be called the proceeding of even all states of doorfree consciousness before and after the sixdoor states of consciousness so it should be understood that the supervention of the lifecontinum at a time other than that of falling asleep is included in waking
He who whilst speaking thinks This sound arises dependent on the lips teeth tongue palate and the act of the mind that accords to that sound speaks mindful and clearly comprehending
He who for a long time has studied or expounded the Teaching or recited the words of the subject of meditation or cleared a question and later on becoming silent thinks The bodily and mental things which arose during the time of speaking ended just then is called a doer of clear comprehension in speaking
He who after remaining silent long considering the Teaching or his subject of meditation thinks that the bodily and mental things that existed in the time of silence ended just then that the occurrence of derived material qualities is speech and that the nonoccurrence of these is silence is called a doer of clear comprehension in keeping silence
This dominance of nondelusion stated by the Elder Maha Siva is intended here in this Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness
But in the Discourse on the Fruit of the Homeless Life even the entire fourfold clear comprehension is found
Therefore in a special way here only by way of clear comprehension of nondelusion should be understood the state of doing clear comprehension
The occurrence of the soundbase is speech its nonoccurrence is silence
Since indeed in the exposition of the Elder Maha Siva the state of clear comprehension is considered by way of the vision of the ending then and there of material and mental qualities occurring in posture after posture without a break the state of clear comprehension should be known by way of the insight portion of the clear comprehension of nondelusion come down in the Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness not by way of the detailing of the fourfold clear comprehension
Therefore only in the Discourse on the Fruit of the Homeless Life is that fourfold clear comprehension intended
The dominance of nondelusion refers to the statement to which nondelusion is the dominant or principal thing
This statement of the Elder Maha Siva contains the reason that is found only in the Satipatthana Sutta in this connection namely clear comprehension of nondelusion by way of the insight portion or turn and not the detailing of fourfold clear comprehension as given in the Samaññaphala Sutta
In all statements the meaning of the term clear comprehension should be understood by way of only clear comprehension that is endowed with mindfulness
Indeed in the Book of Classifications these are put just in this way One goes forward mindful and clearly comprehending one goes backwards mindful and clearly comprehending
By the words only clear comprehension that is endowed with mindfulness both the importance of clear comprehension by way of function and that of mindfulness are taken
Indeed it is not the pointing out of merely the condition of mindfulness with clear comprehension for it is said nowhere does knowledge exist without mindfulness
Now in order to reinforce that thing by the Classificatory Method too the words Indeed in the Book of Classifications and so forth were spoken by the commentator
By this indeed one makes clear the importance even of mindfulness here as of clear comprehension
There these refers to the synoptical statement beginning with In going forwards and in going backwards he is a doer of clear comprehension
The reciters of the Middle Collection however and the scholars of the Abhidhamma say thus A certain bhikkhu goes thinking the while of something else considering something else 
Another goes without causing the abandoning of the subject of meditation
In the same manner a certain bhikkhu thinking the while of something else considering something else is standing sitting or sleeping another sleeps without causing the abandoning of the subject of meditation
Indeed the earnest bhikkhu comprehends thus The material and mental qualities which existed at the east end of the ambulatory passed away just there without reaching the west end of the ambulatory
The material and mental qualities which existed at the west end of the ambulatory too passed away just there without reaching the east end of the ambulatory
The material and mental qualities which existed at the very center of the ambulatory passed away just there without reaching either end of the ambulatory
The material and mental qualities which existed in walking passed away without reaching the position of standing
The material and mental qualities which existed in the position of standing passed away just there without reaching the position of sitting of sitting without reaching the position of sleeping
Comprehending in this way again and again the mind enters the lifecontinum the unconscious
When arising he at once takes up the subject of meditation
This bhikkhu is a doer of clear comprehension in walking and so forth
In this way however the subject becomes unclear in sleep the subject of meditation should not be made unclear
Therefore the bhikkhu having exercised to the full extent of his ability on the ambulatory stood and sat lies down comprehending thus The body is unconscious the bed is unconscious
The body does not know 'I am lying down on the bed' The bed also does not know 'On me the body is lying down' He whilst just comprehending again and again thus The unconscious body is lying down on the unconscious bed the mind enters the lifecontinum the unconscious
On awakening he at once takes up the subject of meditation
This bhikkhu is called a doer of clear comprehension in sleeping
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus the bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body by way of the laying hold of the fourfold comprehension either in his own body or in another's body or at one time in his own body and in another's at another time
And here too in contemplating origination and so forth the origin and the dissolution of only the materiality aggregate should in the exposition be taken out
The remainder is to be understood just by the method already stated by the commentator
Here the Truth of Suffering is the mindfulness which lays hold of the fourfold clear comprehension the Truth of Origination is the precraving which originates that mindfulness the nonoccurrence of either is the Truth of Cessation the Real Path already stated is the Waytruth
Thus the bhikkhu having striven by way of the Four Noble Truths reaches peace
This is indeed the means of deliverance up to arahantship of one who lays hold of the fourfold clear comprehension
After explaining bodycontemplation by way of the fourfold clear comprehension to explain it by way of the reflection of repulsiveness the Master said And further and so forth
Everything that should be said in connection with the passage beginning with On just this body and so forth is stated in detail taking into consideration all aspects of the matter in the Path of Purity the Visuddhi Magga and its commentary The Casket of the Highest Thing Paramattha Mañjusa a summary of that account is given here
This reflection by way of mindfulness directed bodywards called the reflection of repulsiveness is unknown to nonBuddhists in the form of subject of meditation development
Hence it is a thing which comes into being when a Buddha arises not at other times
This mindfulness directed bodywards leads to the following
The great tranquillity or security based on effort 
Great mindfulness and clear comprehension 
Attainment of insightknowledge 
Happy living here and now 
Realization of the fruition of wisdom and freedom
This mindfulness has been explained in the following sections Breathinginandout four kinds of deportment the fourfold clear comprehension the reflection on repulsiveness the reflection on the elements or modes of existence and the nine cemetery contemplation
There are these seven kinds of skill in study to be acquired in regard to this subject of meditation by
Repetition of the parts only mentally
Determining of the hair of the head and so forth according to color
Determining of the parts according to shape
Determination of situation of the parts as above or below the navel on the upper or lower side of the body directionally
Determination of the place in the body acquired by a part that is determination spatially
Determination of one part by the position of another to it and by way of dissimilarity of one part to another
There are these ten kinds of skill in reflecting on this subject of meditation
Doing it not too quickly
Doing it not too slowly
Doing it by warding off mental rambling
Practice by way of going beyond the concept of hair and so forth to the idea of repulsiveness
Practice by gradual elimination of the less clear parts
Practice by way of the part which is the source of ecstasy
Practice by way of the Three Discourses Adhicitta Sitibhava and Bojjhangakosalla
The following is the application of the simile Like the bag with the two openings is the body made up of the four great primaries earth water fire and air
The thirtytwo parts beginning with hairofthehead are like the various grains thrown into that bag after mixing them
Like a man with seeing eyes is the yogi
Comparable to the time when after loosening the bag the various grains become clear to one reflecting is the time when the thirtytwo parts become clear to the yogi
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in his body or in another's
Sometimes he contemplates the body in his own body at other times in another's by way of laying hold on things beginning with the hair of the head
From here the meaning should be known just in the way already stated by the commentator
Here the mindfulness which lays hold of the thirtytwo parts is the Truth of Suffering
Having interpreted thus the portal to emancipation should be understood
The Master having explained bodycontemplation in the form of reflection on the repulsiveness of the thirtytwo parts of the body said And further now to set forth bodycontemplation by way of reflection on the modes of materiality
The elaboration of the meaning together with the application of the simile in this connection is as follows
Just as if some cowbutcher or a cowbutcher's apprentice a man who works for his keep having killed a cow and made it into parts were sitting at a fourcrossroad just so a bhikkhu reflects by way of the modes on the body in any one of the four postures thus There are in this body the modes of extension cohesion caloricity and oscillation
The cowbutcher does not get rid of the cowpercept while feeding the cow driving it to the place of slaughter tying it and putting it up there killing it and even when seeing the dead carcass of the cow not until he cuts it up and divides it into parts does the perception of a cow disappear
To that butcher sitting after cutting up the cow however the perception of a cow disappears and the perception of flesh comes into being
To him there is not this thought I am selling the cow these people are taking away the cow But to him indeed there occurs this thought I am selling flesh these people indeed are taking away flesh
To the bhikkhu similarly the perception of a being or the perception of a person does not disappear as long as he does not reflect by way of the modes of materiality in this body as it is placed or disposed in whatsoever position after sifting thoroughly the apparently compact aggregation
To him who reflects by way of the modes of materiality however the perception of a being disappears the mind gets established by way of the modes of materiality
Therefore the Blessed One declared A bhikkhu reflects on just this body according as it is placed or disposed by way of the mode of materiality thinking thus 'There are in this body the mode of solidity the mode of cohesion the mode of caloricity and the mode of oscillation' O bhikkhus in whatever manner a clever cowbutcher or a cowbutcher's apprentice having slaughtered a cow and divided it by way of portions should be sitting at the junction of a crossroad in the same manner a bhikkhu reflects thinking thus 'There are in this body the mode of solidity And the mode of oscillation'  Imameva kayam yatha thitam yatha panihitam dhatuso paccavekkhati atthi imasmim kaye pathavidhatu apodhatu tejodhatu vayodhatuti
Seyyathapi bhikkhave dakkho goghatako va goghatakantevasi va gavim vadhitva catummahapathe bilaso pativibhajitva nissinno assa evameva kho bhikkhave bhikkhu imameva kayam paccavekkhati atthi imasmim kaye pathavidhatu vayodhatuti
The yogi is comparable to the cowbutcher the perception of a being is comparable to the perception of a cow the fourfold posture is comparable to the crossroad and the reflection by way of the modes of materiality is comparable to the state of sitting with the cow's flesh in front after dividing the cow into parts
Here this is the textual explanation
Details of the reflection on the modes of materiality as a subject of meditation however are given in the Path of Purity
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally One dwells contemplating the body in the body thus by way of the laying hold of the four modes of materiality in one's own or in another's body or at one time in one's own body and at another time in another's body
From here on the exposition should be known just by the method already mentioned
The mindfulness which lays hold of the four modes of materiality is the Truth of Suffering
Thus the portal to deliverance should be known
By the word placed there is the elucidation of occasion by way of own function of material things known as the body in various moments
By the word disposed here the following meaning should be known By way of condition the putting down or settling owing to the arrangement of several conditions
Reflects  Considers again and again sees analytically part by part separately after sifting thoroughly with the eye of wisdom
After explaining bodycontemplation in the form of the modes of materiality the Master said And further in order to explain bodycontemplation through the nine cemetery contemplations
Uddhumatam  Swollen By reason of the swelled state of the corpse comparable to a pair of windfilled bellows owing to the gradually uprising bloattedness after death
Vinilakam  Blue is stated to be the color of fully differing shades
Blue is that corpse which is reddish in the protuberantly fleshy parts and whitish in the purulent parts while in those parts which are predominantly blue it seems to be as though covered with a blue mantle
This is the descriptive statement of the blue corpse
Vipubbakajatam  Festering is the corpse that is full of pus flowing from the broken parts or from the nine openings of the body
So imameva kayam upasamharati ayampi kho kayo evam dhammo evam bhavi evam anatitoti  He thinks of his own body thus 'This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that body' This has been stated By the existence of these three life warmth consciousness this body can endure to stand to walk and do other things by the separation of these three however this body is indeed a thing like that corpse is possessed of the nature of corruption is going to become like that will become swollen blue and festering and cannot escape the state of being like that cannot transcend the condition of swelling up become blue and festering
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus by laying hold of the state of swelling and so forth in regard to one's own body or another's or at one time in regard to one's own and at another in regard to another's one dwells contemplating the body in the body
Khajjamanam  Whilst it is being eaten When crows and other creatures after sitting on the belly or another part of the corpse are eating the carcass by picking the flesh of the belly of the lips the corners of the eye and so forth
Samamsalohitam  Together with flesh and blood With the flesh and blood still remaining
Nimmamsalohitam  Bloodbesmeared without flesh When though rid of flesh the blood is still not dry
Aññena  In a different place In a different direction
Hatthatthikam  Bone of the hand the sixtyfour kinds of bones of the hand when these are lying in different places separate from one another
In the explanation of the bone of the foot and so forth the method is the same as this
Terovassikani  More than a year old beyond a year in a state of exposure
Putini  Rotten just those in the open become rotten by being exposed to wind sun and rain for over a year
Bones buried in the earth last longer
Cunnakajatani  Become dust scattered in the form of powder
Everywhere according to the method already stated beginning He thinks of his own body thus 'This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that body
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally Thus through the laying hold of the corpse from the state in which it is being eaten by crows and other creatures to the state when it is dust one dwells contemplating the body in one's own body or in another's or at one time in one's own body and at another time in another's body
Further having stopped here one should put together the nine cemetery contemplations thus
Ekahamatam va dvihamatam va tihamatam va  A body dead one two or three day This is the first contemplation
Kakehi va khajjamanam  Whilst it is being eaten by crows This portion of the Discourse where the devouring of the body of various kinds of animals is stated refers to the second contemplation
Atthikasamkhalikam samamsalohitam naharusambandham  A skeleton together with flesh and blood held in by the tendons This is the third contemplation
Nimmamsalohitamakkhitam naharusambandham  A bloodsmeared skeleton without flesh but held in by the tendons This is the fourth
Apagatamamsalohitam naharusambandham  A skeleton held in by the tendons but without flesh and not besmeared with blood This is the fifth
Atthikani apagatasambandhani  Bones gone loose scattered in all directions This is the sixth
Atthikani setani sankhavannupanibhani  Bones white in color like a conch This is the seventh
Atthikani puñjakitani terovassikani  Bones more than a year old heaped together This is the eighth
Atthikani putini cunnakajatani  Bones gone rotten and become dust This is the ninth
Evam kho bhikkhave  Thus indeed o bhikkhus He said this bringing to an end bodycontemplation after pointing out the nine cemetery contemplations
The mindfulness which lays hold of the nine cemetery contemplations is the Truth of Suffering the previous craving which originates that mindfulness is the Truth of Origin the nonoccurrence of both that mindfulness and the craving is the Truth of Cessation
The Real Path that understands suffering casts out the origin and has cessation for its object is the Truth of the Way
Endeavoring in this way by means of the Four Truths one arrives at peace
This is for the bhikkhu who lays hold of the nine cemetery contemplations the portal of deliverance up to arahantship
Now these are the fourteen portions which comprise bodycontemplation The section on breathing in and breathing out on the postures on the four kinds of clear comprehension of reflection on repulsiveness on the modes of materiality and on the nine cemetery contemplations
There only the sections on breathing in and breathing out and of the reflection on repulsiveness can become meditationsubjects of full absorption
As the cemetery contemplations are stated by way of consideration of disadvantages dangers or evils all the remaining twelve are only meditationsubjects of partial absorption
The Blessed One having in this way set forth the Arousing of Mindfulness through the fourteenfold method of bodycontemplation now said And now o bhikkhus in order to expound the ninefold method of contemplation of feeling
There the meaning of pleasant feeling  sukham vedanam is as follows The bhikkhu when experiencing a bodily or mental pleasant feeling knows I experience a pleasant feeling
Certainly while they experience a pleasant feeling in sucking the breast and on similar occasions even infants lying on their backs know that they experience pleasure
But this meditator's knowledge is different
Knowledge of pleasure possessed by infants lying on their backs and other similar kinds of knowledge of pleasure do not cast out the belief in a being do not root out the perception of a being do not become a subject of meditation and do not become the cultivation of the Arousing of Mindfulness
But the knowledge of this bhikkhu casts out the belief in a being uproots the perception of a being is a subject of meditation and is the cultivation of the Arousing of Mindfulness
Indeed the knowledge meant here is concerned with experience that is wisely understood through inquiry
Who feels
No being or person
Whose is the feeling
Not of a being or person
Owing to what is there the feeling
Feeling can arise with things  forms sounds smells and so forth  as objects
That bhikkhu knows therefore that there is a mere experiencing of feeling after the objectifying of a particular pleasurable or painful physical basis or of one of indifference
because there is no doer or agent besides a bare process
The word bare indicates that the process is impersonal
The words of the Discourse I experience form a conventional expression indeed for that process of impersonal feeling
It should be understood that the bhikkhu knows that with the objectification of a property or basis he experiences a feeling
It is said that an Elder of Cittala Hill was sick turning over from side to side again and again and groaning with great pain
To him a young bhikkhu said Venerable Sir which part of your body is painful  A specially painful place indeed there is not as a result of taking certain things for object there is the experiencing of painful feeling replied the Elder
Venerable Sir from the time one knows that is not bearing up befitting said the young bhikkhu
I am bearing up friend said the Elder
Bearing up is excellent Venerable Sir said the young bhikkhu
The Elder bore up
Thereafter the aerial humor caused injury right up to the heart
His intestines protruded out and lay in a heap on the bed
The Elder pointed that out to the young bhikkhu and said Friend is bearing up so far befitting The young bhikkhu remained silent
The Elder having applied concentration with energy attained arahantship with Analytical Knowledge and passed away into the final peace of Nibbana in the state of consciousness immediately after the course of reflection on the fruit of arahantship thus realizing the highest and passing away nearly at the same time
Just as when experiencing a pleasant feeling so too when experiencing a painful feeling a neitherpleasantnorpainful spiritual feeling he understands I experience a neitherpleasantnorpainful spiritual feeling
Thus the Blessed One when expounding the noncorporeal subject of meditation after the corporeal subject of meditation expounds it by way of feeling
For twofold is the subject of meditation the subject of meditation of corporeality or materiality and the subject of meditation which is noncorporeal or nonmaterial
This twofold subject of meditation is also spoken of as the laying hold of the mental and the laying hold of the material
While the Blessed One is expounding the material subject of meditation by way of brief or lengthy reflection he expounds the discernment of the four modes of materiality
Both those ways of reflection are pointed out fully in the Path of Purity
While expounding however the mental subject of meditation generally the Master expounds it by way of the contemplation on feeling
Threefold indeed is the establishing in the mental subject of meditation by way of senseimpression feeling and mind
How
To some meditator indeed when the material subject of meditation is laid hold of when there is the first impact of mindwithmentalcharacteristics on the object the senseimpression that arises with the contacting of that object becomes clear
To another the feeling that arises with the experiencing of that object becomes clear
To yet another the consciousness that arises with the knowing of that object becomes clear
When senseimpression becomes clear not only does senseimpression arise together with that senseimpression arise feeling perception volition and consciousness
When feeling becomes clear the other four too arise
Also when consciousness becomes clear the other four arise
The bhikkhu on reflecting thus Dependent on what is this group of five things knows as follows Dependent on the corporeal base
That coarse body about which it is said And indeed this consciousness of mine is depending on is bound up with this body that in its actual nature consists of the four great physical things the four great primaries and the physical qualities sourcing from the four great primaries
These physical qualities are called derived materiality
Here the bhikkhu sees mind and body thinking The corporeal base aforesaid is body the five beginning with senseimpression are mind
In this connection there are the five aggregates because the body is the aggregate of materiality and the mind the four aggregates of nonmaterial things
There is neither a fivefold aggregation separate from the mind and body nor a mind and body separate from the fivefold aggregation
The bhikkhu who tries to find out what the cause of these five aggregates is sees that these are due to ignorance etc
Henceforth the bhikkhu lives with thorough knowledge thinking that this thing the fivefold aggregation is only something conditioned and includes what is produced from conditioning
It is a congeries of bare formations indeed of bare processes
He applies to it by way of the mind and body that exist together with conditions according to the gradual succession of insightproducing knowledge the words impermanent subjecttosuffering and soulless
After getting suitable weather conditions a person of advantage to him spiritually food that agrees with him or fitting doctrinal instructions the bhikkhu desirous of realization says Today today fixed in one posture reaches the acme of insight and stands fast in the fruit of arahantship
For the three kinds of persons aforesaid the subject of meditation up to arahantship is expounded in this way
Here however the Blessed One speaking of the nonmaterial or mental subject of meditation speaks by way of feeling
While expounding by way of senseimpression or consciousness the subject of meditation does not become clear
It seems dark
But by way of feeling it becomes clear
Why
Because of the clearness of the arising of feeling
Indeed the arising of pleasant or painful feeling is clear
When pleasant feeling arises spreading through and flowing over the whole body making one to utter the words Ah 'tis joy it is like causing one to eat fresh clarified butter cooled in very cold water a hundred times after being melted again and again also a hundred times it is like causing one to be massaged with an emollient oil worth a hundred pieces and it is like causing one to be cooled of a burning fever with a thousand pots of cold water
When painful feeling arises spreading through and flowing over the whole body making one to bewail with the words Alas what woe it is like the applying on one of a heated plowshare it is like the sprinkling upon one of molten copper and it is comparable to the hurling into dried grass and trees in the forest of bundles of wood firebrands
Thus the arising of pleasant or painful feeling becomes clear but the arising of the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is dark and unclear
The neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling becomes clear to one who grasps it methodically thinking At the disappearance of pleasure and pain the neutral neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling occurs which is contrary to the pleasant and the unpleasant To what is it comparable
To a deer hunter following the hoof marks of a deer which midway having gone up a flat rock is fleeing
The hunter after seeing the hoof marks on the hither and thither side of the rock without seeing any trace in the middle knows by inference Here the animal went up and here it went down in the middle on the flat rock possibly it went through this part
Like the hoofmark at the place of going up the arising of pleasurable feeling becomes clear
Like the hoofmark at the place of descent the arising of painful feeling becomes clear
Like the grasping through inference of the part traversed over the rock by the deer is the laying hold of the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling methodically with the thought At the disappearance of pleasure and pain the neutral neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling occurs which is contrary to the pleasant and the unpleasant
In this manner the Blessed One having expounded at first the form subject of meditation later pointed out the formless subject of meditation by way of feeling having taken it out from the fivefold aggregation distinguishingly
Not only here did he point it out thus
In the Cula Tanhasankkhaya the Cula Vedalla the Maha Vedalla the Ratthapala Magandiya Dhatuvibhanga and Aneñjasappaya of the Majjhima Nikaya in the Maha Nidana Sakkapañha and Maha Satipatthana of the Digha Nikaya in the Cula Nidana Rukkhupama and Parivimamsana Suttas of the Samyutta Nikaya in the whole of the Vedana Samyutta of the same Nikaya and in many other discourses did the Master point out the formless subject of meditation by way of feeling having taken out feeling from the fivefold aggregation after first expounding the form subject of meditation
This is another method of understanding understands I experience a pleasant feeling  Sukham vedanam vediyamiti pajanati
By the absence of painful feeling at the moment of pleasant feeling he knows while experiencing a pleasant feeling I am experiencing a pleasant feeling By reason of that knowledge of the experiencing of pleasant feeling owing to the absence now of whatsoever painful feeling that existed before and owing to the absence of this pleasant feeling before the present time feeling is called an impermanent a not lasting and a changeful thing
When he knows the pleasant feeling in the pleasant feeling thus there is clear comprehension
For it is said in the th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya by the Blessed One When one experiences a pleasant feeling Aggivessana then one does not experience a painful feeling or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Only the pleasant feeling does one then experience
When one experiences a painful feeling Aggivessana then one does not experience a pleasant or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Only a painful feeling does one then experience
When one experiences a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling then one does not experience a pleasant or a painful feeling
Only a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling does one then experience
Pleasant feeling indeed Aggivessana is a thing that is impermanent puttogether dependently originating decaying passing away fading and ceasing
So is painful feeling and the neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
The learned real disciple Aggivessana seeing thus turns away from the pleasant feeling even as he does from the painful and the neitherpleasantnorpainful feelings
Turning away he detaches himself by absence of attachment he frees himself freed he knows thus I am freed of craving
Destroyed by me is rebirth lived by me is the Highest Life of the Real Way done by me is the work of developing the Real Way that must be developed and there is no more work to be done by me
Pleasant worldly feeling refers to the six joyful feelings connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilements
Pleasant spiritual feeling refers to the six joyful feelings connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesire
Painful worldly feeling refers to the six feelings of grief connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilements
Painful spiritual feeling refers to the six feelings of grief connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesire
Worldly neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling refers to the six feelings of indifference connected with the six sensedoors and dependent on that which is tainted by defilements
Spiritual neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling refers to the six feelings of indifference connected with the six sensedoors and not dependent on sensedesire
The division into pleasant worldly feeling and so forth is in the th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya
Ajjhattam  Internally The bhikkhu dwells contemplating feelings in the feelings that are his own by laying hold of the pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Or he dwells contemplating feelings in the feelings of others by laying hold of the pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful feelings in the way told above
Or at one time he contemplates his own feelings and at another time another's
Samudayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationthings In this contemplation of feeling the bhikkhu dwells seeing the origination and the dissolution of the aggregate of feeling or seeing the origination of feeling at one time and the dissolution of feeling at another time by way of ignorance craving and so forth in the five ways mentioned in the Section on the Modes of Deportment
From here on it should be understood that the exposition is just according to the method followed in the explanation of bodycontemplation
Indeed the mindfulness that lays hold of feeling is the Truth of Suffering
Thus the portal of deliverance for the bhikkhu who lays hold of feeling should be understood
After explaining the ninefold Arousing of Mindfulness in regard to feeling the Master began the explanation of the contemplation of consciousness in the sixteenfold way with the words And how o bhikkhus
In this section there is no reference to supramundane truth because in the sifting of things thoroughly to see their transient painladen and soulless nature only the mundane things are handled and so there is in this matter of penetrative knowledge of things no bringing together of mundane and supramundane things
Here follows the elucidation of terms mentioned in this section
Saragam cittam  The consciousness with lust Karmically unwholesome eight conscious states of the plane of existence of senseexperience
These are together with greed in the sense of springing from it
Vitaragam cittam  The consciousness without lust Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousness
The two spontaneous and nonspontaneous conscious states karmically unwholesome accompanied by grief linked to resentment and springing from hate the conscious state karmically unwholesome accompanied by neither pain nor pleasure linked to doubt and springing from ignorance and the conscious state karmically unwholesome accompanied by neither pain nor pleasure linked to agitation springing from ignorance  these four do not associate with the consciousnesswithlustdivision or the consciousnesswithoutlust division
Sodosam cittam  The consciousness with hate The two conscious states karmically unwholesome accompanied by grief
Vitadosam cittam  The consciousness without hate Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousness
The other ten karmically unwholesome conscious states of the plane of existence of senseexperience do not associate with either the consciousnesswithhate division or the consciousnesswithouthate division
Samoham cittam  The consciousness with ignorance The conscious state karmically unwholesome linked to doubt and the conscious state karmically unwholesome linked to agitation
Because indeed ignorance arises in all karmically bad states the other karmically bad states too should be mentioned here
In just this division all the twelve karmically bad unwholesome or unskillful conscious states are included
Vitamoham cittam  The consciousness without ignorance Karmically wholesome and karmically neutral mundane states of consciousness
Sankhittam cittam  The shrunken state of consciousness The conscious state fallen into sloth and torpor
That is called the shrivelled or contracted state of mind
Vikkhittam cittam  The distracted state of consciousness The conscious state accompanied by agitation
That is called the dissipated mind
Mahaggatam cittam  The state of consciousness become great The conscious state of the sensuousethereal plane of existence and of the purely ethereal plane of existence
Amahaggatam cittam  The state of consciousness not become great The conscious state of the plane of existence of senseexperience
Sauttaram cittam  The state of consciousness with some other mental state superior to it That refers to any conscious state belonging to the plane of senseexperience
Anuttaram cittam  The state of consciousness with no other mental state superior to it That refers to any conscious state belonging to the sensuousethereal or the purely ethereal plane
Samahitam cittam  The quieted state of consciousness It refers to the conscious state of him who has full or partial absorption
Asamahitam cittam  The state of consciousness not quieted It refers to the conscious state without either absorption
Vimuttam cittam  the freed state of consciousness That refers to the conscious state emancipated partially from defilements through systematic or radical reflection or to the conscious state emancipated through the suppression of the defilements in absorption
Both these kinds of emancipation are temporary
Avimuttam cittam  The unfreed state of consciousness That refers to any conscious state without either kind of temporary emancipation
In the mundane path of the beginner there is no place for the supramundane kinds of emancipation through extirpation stilling and final release
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness by laying hold on the consciousness with lust and so forth when these states of consciousness proceed in his own flux or in another's flux or by laying hold of these conscious states at one time as they proceed in his own flux and at another time as they proceed in another's flux
Samudayavayadhammanupassi  Contemplating originationanddissolutionthings Here the arising of the aggregate of consciousness should be explained with the pointing out of the origination of consciousness from the origination of ignorance and so forth in the five ways according to the method shown in the Section on the Modes of Deportment
And the passing away of consciousness should also be explained in the same way as it is shown in the Section on the Modes of Deportment
From here on there is nothing new in the method of explanation
The mindfulness which lays hold of consciousness is the Truth of Suffering
Thus the portal of deliverance up to arahantship of the bhikkhu who lays hold of consciousness as a subject of meditation ought to be understood
In the consciousness with lust lust occurs as a mental concomitant arising and passing away along with a conscious state and sharing with that conscious state the object and basis of consciousness
In this sense of a conscious state wellknit with lust one speaks of the consciousness with lust
The term consciousness without lust is used as a contrary of the term consciousness with lust not as a contradictory
That becomes clear when we know that the work to be done in this contemplation of the mind consists of the laying hold of the things of the three planes of cosmic existence for the purpose of developing the conviction based on insight in regard to cosmic impermanence cosmic suffering and cosmic insubstantiality
In no stage of mundane thought can it be said that latency of lust is destroyed and so the term consciousness without lust indicates only a relatively lustfree conscious state
The grouping of conscious states here it is said may be questioned
For instance in the two states of consciousness with hate is there just absence of lust because these two states are not wellknit together with lust
Could there not be in them a trace of lust functioning as a distant condition as when a man's lust for a woman produces hate towards another who stands between him and the possession or enjoyment of his object of lust
If there indeed could not be such a trace of lust in these two conscious states of hate are these seven states of consciousness without lust
When the commentator said that the four remaining karmically bad states do not associate with either the consciousness with lust or without lust he only wanted to show them just separate from the pair known by the phrases with lust and without lust
If so then would not one fall into partial knowledge
No
Because of their being included in the pairs 
Consciousness with ignorance is twofold
It is either accompanied by doubt or by agitation
As this consciousness in either of its forms is fit to be called a delusion by way of particularity owing to excessive observation and special endowment with ignorance these two forms namely the one linked to doubt and the one linked to agitation are in an outstanding manner with ignorance
By reason of the mind proceeding slackly in a shrivelled state owing to want of interest in the object and more or less with displeasure there is the shrunken state of consciousness
This is a name applicable to the five karmically unwholesome sensuous conscious states not marked by spontaneity
There is the conscious state associated with agitation in the sense of agitation having become powerful in the consciousness
All karmically bad conscious states are indeed accompanied by agitation
The mental state accompanied by agitation is called the distracted mind because it spreads outside its object by way of diffused thinking
By the ability to suppress the defilements and by the abundance of fruition and by the great length or extent of the series of its particular courses of cognition there is a state of consciousness become great
Or there is a state of consciousness become great by reason of lofty regenerative wish and so forth
The state of consciousness become great is the mind that has reached the ground of the sensuousethereal and the purely ethereal planes of existence
As there is nothing in the cosmos greater than the sensuousethereal and the purely ethereal the commentator explained the consciousness become great by reference to these two highest planes of existence
The state of consciousness with some other mental state superior to it refers to the consciousness that has not reached the highest possible planes of attainment in cosmic existence or the consciousness that can become more fine and the state of consciousness with no other mental state superior to it is that which has got to the highest planes of cosmic existence or that which has reached the acme of fineness of mundane states of mind
After explaining the Arousing of Mindfulness of the sixteenfold contemplation of consciousness the Master said And how o bhikkhus in order to expound the fivefold contemplation of mental objects  things spiritual and material
Further the laying hold of pure corporeality or materiality was taught by the Blessed One in the instruction on bodycontemplation and in the instruction on the contemplation of feeling and consciousness the laying hold of the purely spiritual
Now in order to teach the laying hold of a mixture of the material and the spiritual he said And how o bhikkhus and so forth
Or in the contemplation on the body the laying hold of the aggregate of corporeality or materiality was spoken of by the Master in the contemplation on feeling the laying hold of the aggregate of feeling in the contemplation on mind the laying hold of the aggregate of consciousness and now in order to speak of even the laying hold of the aggregates of perception and formations he said And how o bhikkhus and so forth
There in the Discourse the word santam  present It means existing by way of occurrence practice or repeated happening
Asantam  not present Not existing by way of nonoccurrence or because of rejection from the mind by way of reflection or concentration
In connection with the hindrances it must be known that the hindrance of sensuality arises because of wrong reflection on an object that is sensuously agreeable pleasant favorable
Such an object is either sensuality itself or that which produces sensuality  the sensualityobject
Wrong reflection is inexpedient reflection reflection on the wrong track
Or it is reflection which considers the impermanent as permanent pain as pleasure nonsoul as soul the bad as good
Sensedesire arises when wrong reflection occurs plentifully in a sensuously good object
Therefore the Blessed One said that the condition for the arising of fresh sensedesire and for the increase and expansion of existing sensedesire is plentiful wrong reflection on a sensuously auspicious or promising object
Sensedesire is cast out indeed with right reflection on a sensuously inauspicious or unpromising object
Such an object itself or the jhana developed through such an object is meant by the term sensuously inauspicious object
Right reflection is expedient reflection reflection going on the right track
It is reflection that considers the facts of impermanence suffering soullessness and of impurity according to reality
When there is much right reflection on the sensuously inauspicious or unpromising object sensedesire is knocked out
Therefore the Blessed One said that the condition for keeping out new sensedesire and for casting out old sensedesire is abundant right reflection on the sensuously inauspicious or unpromising object
Further there are six things which lead to the casting out of sensedesire Taking up the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation application for the development of the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation the guarded state of the controlling faculties of sense moderation in food the sympathy and support of good men in the endeavor stimulating talk that helps the accomplishment of the object in view
Explaining these six it is said Taking up refers to the taking up of the tenfold object sensuously inauspicious impure or bad the man who takes it up will cast out sensedesire
Sensedesire will also be cast out by him who develops the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious object of meditation by him who guards the controlling faculties of sense by closing the six sense doors and by him who knows the measure of food for sustenance and of whom it is said
It will also be cast out by him who keeps the company of men like the Elder Tissa the worker in the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation sympathetic towards those who endeavor in accomplishing the casting out of sensedesire and by talk connected with the tenfold sensuously inauspicious object
Therefore it is said by the commentator that six things are conducive to the casting out of sensedesire
Sensedesire cast out by these six things becomes incapable of arising in the future through the attainment of the path of arahantship
Hindrances have to be cast out first in the course of proper training
With the casting out of the hindrances there is induced jhana the means of attaining quietude
Thus indeed is bodycontemplation surely taught with quietude preceding
Afterwards is given the higher instruction in regard to all divisions beginning with what should be understood  the aggregations and the sensebase which ought to be understood and the factors of enlightenment which should be developed
Therefore here too the development of quietude is desired so far as it is for the sake of insight
It is said The instruction on the Arousing of Mindfulness has insight as the chief thing abounds in insight
Since there is no state of yoking together of the good and the bad moral qualities similar to the yoking of two bulls to a cart  since the good and the bad do not exist together  from the absence of sensuality at the time of seeing one's mind through knowledge it is said by way of occurrence
At the moment of seeing wisely the occurrence of sensedesire there is no sensedesire as good and bad states of mind cannot exist together
Existing means When it is found in one's own mental flux
Sensuously inauspicious or unpromising objects are the ten inanimate things The corpse that is swollen Blue Festering Fissured Mangled Dismembered Cut and dismembered With blood Wormy Become a skeleton
Details of these may be found in The Path of Purity in the exposition of the subject of meditation on the foul
And the perception of hair of the head and so forth because it is called in the Girimananda Sutta the perception of the sensuously inauspicious or impure is taken as the sensuously inauspicious animate thing
The jhana on the sensuously inauspicious object occurs in an inanimate or animate sensuously inauspicious thing
And the indication of the four kinds of wrong reflection and the four kinds of right reflection in regard to the sensuously inauspicious object is for the purpose of pointing out fully the subject
The four kinds of consideration of the impure as pure the impermanent as permanent suffering as pleasure and nonsoul as soul are the four kinds of wrong reflection and the four kinds of consideration of the impure as impure and so forth are the four kinds of right reflection
The taking up of the practice of considering the repulsiveness of any of the eleven kinds of the sensuously inauspicious or the practice of contemplation on the sensuously inauspicious object is taking up or upholding
The application to the development of the thought bent on the sensuously inauspicious object which brings partial and full concentration is application for the development of the jhana on the sensuously inauspicious subject of meditation
Certain teachers say that as there is no opportunity for sensedesire in him who knows the proper measure of food to be taken through absence of trouble owing to that knowledge from sloth and torpor sensedesire is cast out in such a person
Just this reason is given in even the expository portion The person who practices moderation in food brings about the perception of impurity bound up with that food for instance through the alteration of food by way of bodily excretions and dwells on other similar thoughts as well as on the idea of corporeal subjection to food
Such a person casts out sensedesire
The Elder Tissa referred to in the commentary above is the Elder Maha Tissa who saw the teeth of a woman and who by doing right reflection on their bony nature cast out sensedesire through jhana
According to the Abhidhamma method of instruction even the whole world is the hindrance of sensedesire
Therefore the commentator said through the attainment of the path of arahantship
Indeed wrong reflection on an object of resentment produces anger
In this connection anger itself as well as the object which causes anger is called the resentmentobject or the sign of resentment
Wrong reflection has just the same character everywhere and when it occurs much in the resentmentobject or the resentmentsign anger arises
Therefore the Blessed One said that intense wrong reflection on an object of resentment is the cause of fresh anger and of the increase and expansion of anger already existing
By right reflection of the liberating thought of love the thought of love that frees the heart indeed anger gets cast out
The term love here is applicable both to partial concentration and full concentration
Heartliberating love is only full concentration
Right reflection has the same character throughout
When it occurs strong in the thought of love anger is removed from the heart
Therefore the Master said There is o bhikkhus the liberation of the mind through love
Intense right reflection on love is the condition for keeping out new anger and for throwing out anger that is already in the heart
And it is said that these six things help to cast anger out Taking up the practice of the love subject of meditation applying oneself to the development of jhana on the thought of love reflection on one's action as one's own property abundance of wise consideration sympathetic and helpful companionship of the good and stimulating talk that assists the development of the thought of love and the overthrow of anger
In explanation the commentator said Anger will be put down in one who takes up the love subject of meditation by way of spreading it particularly or separately
Or if one takes up the love subject of meditation by way of spreading it generally without particularization or directional restriction in space then too anger will be put down in one
Anger vanishes also through the development of jhana by spreading love restrictedly with differentiation on seven or twentyeight ways or by spreading it unrestrictedly without differentiation in five or twenty ways or by spreading it directionally towards the ten points in space
Anger vanishes in one who reflects thus too What will you do to him by becoming angry Will you be able to destroy things like his virtue Have you not been born here just by your own actions and will you not also by your own actions get reborn hereafter Getting angry with another is comparable to the state of him who wishes to strike another with glowing coals redhot crowbar excreta and such other damaging things after taking them up in his bare hands And what can another who is angry with you do to you Can he destroy your virtue or any other similar thing of yours He too has been born here as a result of his actions and will be reborn hereafter just according to his actions Like a present not accepted is that anger of his and like a handful of dust thrown against the wind that anger of his alights on his own head In this way one reflects on one's own action as one's own property and also another person's action as that person's own and puts out anger
To one remaining in an abundance of wise consideration after reflecting on action as one's or another's own property anger vanishes
And it vanishes in him who is in the company of a sympathetic friend who delights in developing the jhana of the thought of love like the Elder Assagutta and through stimulating talk on the thought of love when in any one of the four postures
Therefore it is said Six things are conducive to the casting out of anger
The anger cast out by these six things however is finally destroyed by the attainment of the state of the Anagami the neverreturner
The thought of love is a sublime state of mind it is one's own state of freedom from hatred
A detailed description of the way of developing love as a subject of meditation is given in the Path of Purity
The following summary of hints gathered from different comments and the Path of Purity will be helpful to a beginner
The lovethought of meditation is different from worldly attachment
It is based on wishing well to all beings
The idea of possession of the loved object is foreign to it
It is not a state of mind that encourages exclusiveness
The aim of the meditation is finally to include in the ambit of one's goodwill all beings equally without distinction
The liberation of the mind through love refers only to full concentration
Without reaching full concentration there is no effective freedom from anger
The beginner who works at this subject of meditation is not to practice the thought of love at first
On a dead person as the practice would be futile
On an enemy as anger might arise
On an indifferent person as the practice might prove wearisome
On one who is very dear as the arousing of friendly thoughts without attachment towards such a one would be tiring and as mental agitation might occur should even some slight trouble overtake that one
Taking up the practice of the love subject of meditation is the generating the bringing about of the characteristic sign or mark of the love thought of meditation of him who through lovingkindness gathers together all beings with goodwill
The reflection on the thought of love itself is the sign of the love thought of meditation because the reflection arisen first is the reason of the later reflection
Spreading it particularly Consecutively in the following order to oneself to a friend an indifferent person and an enemy
Spreading it generally By breaking down all barriers limits and reservations which separate oneself from all others and extending the same kind of friendly thought to all
Directionally Extending the thought of love towards one point of the compass for instance the east
These three kinds of spreading of the thought of love refer to the stage of meditation of taking up the practice of the thought of love which covers the training from the beginning to the attainment of partial concentration
In regard to this state of meditation the following is stated Spreading the thought of love after particularizing the direction by way of a monastery a street village and so forth is one way and spreading the thought of love towards a direction in space generally by way of the eastern direction and so forth without specifying a monastery and so forth is another way of practice
The development of the jhana on the thought of love is the practice again and again of the thought of love that has got partial concentration
The development is done in three ways The spreading of the love thought universally
This is done by wishing that all living beings all breathing things all beings born all persons all who have reached a state of individuality be without hatred disease and grief and be happy taking care of themselves
Spreading the thought of love by way of a restricted group of beings
This is done by wishing that all females all males all purified ones all nonpurified ones all divine beings all humans all beings fallen to states of woe be without hatred disease and grief and happy taking care of themselves
Spreading the thought of love directionally in space
This is done by restricting the thought of love towards each of the ten directions in space the cardinal points the intermediate points and the zenith and nadir
And it is also done by wishing that the beings in each of the directions taken up according to the divisions and groups given above be without hatred and so forth according to the formula already mentioned
Through wrong reflection on a state of boredom and the like sloth and torpor come to be
Boredom is just dissatisfaction
Lassitude is bodily laziness
Languidity of body is the bending of the body torpidly in getting up and in similar actions
Lethargy after a meal is a dizziness or slight faint which is due to eating a principal meal
It is also called the discomfort which follows such a meal
The mind's sluggishness is the dullness of the mind
An abundance of wrong reflection on boredom and similar states of mind produces sloth and torpor
Therefore the Blessed One said that much wrong reflection on boredom lassitude languidity of body lethargy after a meal and the mind's sluggishness is a condition for the production of fresh sloth and torpor and the increase and expansion of sloth and torpor already come into being
Through right reflection in inceptive energy and similar states of mind is brought about the overthrow of sloth and torpor
Inceptive energy is the effort first set afoot
Exertion is more powerful than the inceptive energy because it leaves indolence behind
And because of its assailing further and further of the destructive condition progressive endeavor is more powerful than exertion
By the exercise of right reflection intensely on this threefold strenuousness sloth and torpor are cast out
Therefore the Blessed One said that the condition for keeping out new sloth and torpor and for casting out sloth and torpor that is old is abundant right reflection on the element of inceptive energy of exertion and of progressive endeavor
There are six things which lead to the casting out of sloth and torpor The seeing of the reason of sloth and torpor in the fact of eating too much or gluttony the changing of the postures completely reflection on the perception of light staying in the open sympathetic and helpful companionship of the good and stimulating talk that assists in dispelling sloth an torpor
There is the following explanation of these six things The bhikkhu who has eaten gluttonously is assailed by sloth and torpor while doing his recluse duty of meditation in his day or night quarters as by a mighty elephant pressing down on him but that one who practices moderation in food is not troubled thus with these hindrances
In one who thus sees the characteristic of sloth and torpor in gluttony there is the casting out of sloth and torpor
Sloth and torpor disappear in him who changes over from the posture which induces sloth and torpor to another in him who reflects on the brightness or the light of the moon a lamp or a torch by night and on the light or brightness of the sun by day in him who lives in the open in him who associates with sympathetic and helpful companions like the Elder Maha Kassapa who have dispelled sloth and torpor and by stimulating talk connected with a strict recluseregimen
Therefore it is said Six things lead to the casting out of sloth and torpor
The yogi understands thus sloth and torpor cast out by these six things are stopped from arising forever in the future by the attainment of the path of arahantship
The bhikkhu who has eaten gluttonously after the manner of the wellknown types of Brahmanical gormandizers mentioned in ancient Indian books
There are five kinds of these greedy eaters He who eats until he has to be raised up by the hand from his seat
He who lies rolling just where he has eaten and eats as long as he likes
He who eats until he slips off his waist cloth
He who fills himself with food in such a way that it seems as if a crow could peck at the food in him
He who having filled his belly full and vomitted eats more food again or he who eats until he vomits
On the light or brightness of the sun by day The meaning should be understood thus Sloth and torpor vanish in him too who at night is reflecting on the image of the perception of the brightness of the sun he got by day
Here it may be helpful to state the eight ways of dealing with torpor taught by the Master to the Elder Maha Moggallana One should neglect to mind the thought which says that drowsiness is descending on one or one should reflect on the Dhamma or repeat or recite the Dhamma or pull both earlobes and rub or massage the limbs with the hands or getting up from the sitting position apply water on and rub the eyes and look into the distance at the constellations in the starry sky or reflect on the thought of light or fix the thought on the ambulatory aware of the ends of it with the controlling faculties of sense turned inwards and the mind kept in or sleep conscious of the time of waking and on awaking get up quickly thinking that one will not give oneself to the comforts of lying down reclining and languor when all other seven ways fail
Wrong reflection on mental agitation brings about flurry and worry
Mental agitation is inner turbulence
Actually it is flurry and worry only
Intense wrong reflection on that mental agitation produces flurry and worry
Therefore the Blessed One said that wrong reflection on mental agitation when plentifully done produces fresh flurry and worry and increases and expands flurry and worry already in existence
The casting out of agitation and worry occurs through right reflection on mental tranquillity called concentration and an abundance of right reflection on mental tranquillity says the Blessed One is a condition for the keeping out of fresh mental agitation and worry and the dispelling of agitation and worry already in the mind
Six things are conducive to the casting out of agitation and worry Knowledge questioning understanding of disciplinary rules association with those more experienced and older than oneself in the practice of things like virtue sympathetic and helpful companionship and stimulating talk that helps the rejection of mental agitation and worry
In explanation it is said as follows Agitation and worry disappear in him who learns in the spirit and in the letter one two three four or five collections of Scripture
This is how one gets over agitation and worry by knowledge
Questioning means inquiring much about what is befitting and not according to the practice of the Sangha
In him who does this too agitation and worry disappear
Then these twin evils disappear in him who has got the mastery of the Discipline due to practical application of and conversance with the nature of the Rule of the Sangha
This is the understanding of the disciplinary rules
Association with those more experienced and so forth the going to the presence of and the conversing with virtuous elders in the Sangha
By such visits mental agitation and worry disappear in one
Sympathetic and helpful companionship association with experts of the Disciplinary Rules like the Elder Upali the first of the great masters of the Discipline in the Sangha
In such company mental agitation and worry disappear
Stimulating talk in this connection refers particularly to matters of disciplinary practice by which one comes to know what is befitting and what is not
By this agitation and worry vanish in one
Therefore is it said that six things lead to the rejection of agitation and worry but the agitation cast out by these things finally ceases to arise in the future through the attainment of the path of arahantship and the worry cast out by these things finally ceases to arise in the future through the attainment of the path of the nonreturner
In their own state or actually as they are individually mental agitation and worry are two different things
Still as worry in the form of repentance or remorse for ill done and good undone is similar to agitation which is characterized by distraction and disquiet of mind mental agitation is called flurry and worry
Mental agitation does not overtake the intelligent wellread man who probes into things by way of what is written in books and by way of the significance and import of the things themselves
Therefore it is said that by way of knowledge not merely of the Disciplinary Rules but by way of knowledge of the ninefold Buddhaword beginning with the Discourses according to the principles of the method already stated and by the application of the proper remedies mentioned by way of questioning and so forth remorse and regret for ill done and good undone do not take place
By associating with elders who are older than oneself in the practice of the precepts of virtue and similar good things who are restrained aged matured seniors there is brought to one a measure of restraint matured bearing dignity and calm and mental agitation and worry are cast out
Good companionship refers to association with those versed in the Discipline who are able to dispel worry as regards any doubt concerning what is proper and improper practice
Wrong reflection on things which are founded on doubt brings about the arising of doubt
Things which are founded on doubt are known as just doubt owing to the state of being the reason of doubt again and again
Therefore the Blessed One said that wrong reflection on things founded on doubt is the condition for fresh doubt and for the increase and expansion of doubt already arisen
By right reflection on wholesome things karmically and the like there is the casting out of doubt
Therefore the Blessed One said that right reflection on things which are karmically wholesome and not things blameful and blameless things to be practiced and not to be practiced things of low and high value things dark and fair the counterparts of bad and good done intensely keeps out fresh doubt and casts out doubt that has already come into existence
There are these six things which help to throw out doubt The state of being learned in the Buddha's teaching of inquiring about the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha of understanding thoroughly the nature of the Discipline of being decided about the truth of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha sympathetic and helpful companionship and stimulating talk that helps to dispel doubt
The first has been explained earlier
It is the knowledge of the Suttas generally both in the letter and the spirit
The second is obvious
The third indicates a state of mastery of the Discipline through practical application and great conversance with it at first hand
The fourth is the strong inclination towards or reliance on the Triple Gem called the faith that is capable of settling in the object of the virtues of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
The fifth is association with good companions like the Elder Vakkali bent inclined sliding towards faith mentally
The sixth is stimulating talk on the Triple Gem at all times possible in every state of behavior
One can cast away doubt by means of these six things but the doubt cast out by these six things does not ever arise in the future only when it is destroyed by the attainment of the first stage of the arahant
Things which are founded on doubt are things which stand or proceed on doubt
Taking doubt itself one sees that the doubt arisen first is the particular reason by way of a common cause of the doubt arisen afterwards
Surely by the knowledge of the Dhamma and by inquiry all doubts are cast out
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating the mental objects by laying hold of the five hindrances amongst the mental objects of his own mind or amongst the mental objects in another's mind or at one time amongst the mental objects of his own mind and at another time amongst the mental objects of another's mind
Here origination and dissolution only refer to the origination of the five hindrances by way of wrong reflection on sensuously attractive or beautiful objects etc and the dissolution of the five hindrances by wise reflection on the impurity of the sensuous objects etc
Here the mindfulness which lays hold of the hindrances is the Truth of Suffering
Thus the portal of deliverance of the bhikkhu who lays hold of the hindrances should be understood
Having expounded the contemplation of mental objects by way of the five hindrances the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to explain the contemplation of mental objects by way of the fivefold aggregation
Pañcasu upadanakkhandhesu  In the five aggregates of clinging The five aggregates of clinging are the groups that grasp life
The congeries of mental objects become the condition of clinging is the meaning
This is a brief indication of these aggregates
For the statement about the aggregates at length the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity should be read
Iti rupam  Thus is material form So far is there material form and no further
In this way the bhikkhu perceives material form according to nature
In regard to feeling and the things that come afterwards the same is the method of exegesis
This is the brief indication of meaning of the matters referred to here
For the lengthy explanation on these things one should read the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity
Iti rupassa samudayo  Thus is the arising of material form The arising of material form and the other aggregates should be known according to the fivefold way through the arising of ignorance and so forth
Iti rupassa atthangamo  Thus is the disappearance of material form The disappearance of material form and the other aggregates should be known according to the fivefold way through the passing away of ignorance and so forth
One should read the talk on the aggregates in the Path of Purity for further explanation
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally In this way the bhikkhu lives contemplating mental objects by laying hold of the fivefold aggregation of clinging amongst his own mental objects or amongst the mental objects of another or at one time in his own and at another time in another's mental objects
The origination and dissolution of the fivefold aggregate should be brought forward and connected by way of the fifty characteristics of the five groups with the extended application of the words From the arising of ignorance the arising of material form comes to be
From here on according to the method already stated by the commentator should the exposition be
According to nature means according to the nature of breakingup according to the nature of the eye color and the like in regard to material form and according to the nature of experiencing the nature of pleasure and the like in regard to feeling
In this way all other connected things should be interpreted
After explaining the contemplation of mental objects by way of the aggregates the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to explain the contemplation of mental objects by way of the sensebases
Chasu ajjhattika bahiresu ayatanesu  In the six internal and the six external sensebases The eye the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mind are the six internal sensebases and material form mind smell tastes tactual object and mental object are the six external sensebases
Cakkhum pajanati   understands the eye He understands the sensory apparatus of the eye by way of its own distinct function and salient characteristic
Rupe pajanati   understands material form that are visible He understands material form arising from the four producers of corporeality namely karma consciousness climate and nutriment by way of their own distinctive function and salient characteristic
Yam tadubhayam paticcca uppajjati samyojanam  The fetter that arises dependent on both He understands according to distinct function and characteristic the tenfold fetter that arises dependent on both eye and forms  the tenfold fetter of sensedesire resentment pride speculative theory doubt belief in rites and ceremonies the desire to go on existing envy avarice and ignorance
How does this tenfold fettering arise asks one
The fetter of sensuality arises for him who by way of sensuous enjoyment takes delight in a pleasant senseobject become visible at the eyedoor
For him who is annoyed or angry at the sight of an unpleasant object the fetter of resentment arises and the fetter of pride arises in him who thinks No one but me is able to consider the object wisely
The fetter of speculative theory comes to be in him who takes material form to be permanent and everlasting
The fetter of doubt arises in him who thinks in this way Is the material form a being or a being's
The fetter of the desire to go on existing arises in him who wishes thus To be sure in a favorable state of existence this material form will become easy of access
The fetter of rites and ceremonies arises in him who undertakes to perform rites and ceremonies thinking In the future it will be possible to obtain such an object as this by taking up the observance of rites and ceremonies
The fetter of envy arises in him who contemplates grudgingly Should no others get this material form it would be good indeed
The fetter of avarice arises in one who stints for another the material form belonging to one
The fetter of ignorance arises with all sensuous passion and the like by way of the relation of conascent nescience
Yathaca anupannassa samyojanassa uppado hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the arising of the nonarisen fetter comes to be He understands that the fetter had not arisen earlier owing to some cause of nonoccurrence
Yatha ca uppannassa samyojanassa pahanam hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be He understands the reason for the abandoning of just the fetter arisen through previous nonabandoning or through occurrence
Yatha ca pahinassa samojanassa ayatim anuppado hoti tañca pajanati  He understands how the nonarising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be He understands the reason for the nonarising in the future of even the fetter abandoned by way of rejection of separate factors through right reflection and through absorption
Owing to what reason does the tenfold fettering cease to arise in the future finally
The path of streamwinning or the first stage of awakening is the reason for final cessation of the five fetters of speculative theory doubt rites and ceremonies envy and avarice
The path of oncereturning or the second stage of awakening is the reason for the final cessation of sensuality and resentment of a gross kind and the residum of these two fetters finally ceases by reason of the statement of the path of neverreturning the third stage of awakening
The fact which makes the fetter of pride of the desire to go on existing and of ignorance to cease finally in the future is the path of final purification arahantship the fourth state of awakening
The same is the method of exegesis in sotañca pajanati sadde ca pajanati  He understands the ear and sounds Further in this connection the talk on the sensebases in full should be understood as stated by the commentator in the Path of Purity
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The bhikkhu lives contemplating the mental objects by laying hold of the internal sensebases in his own mental objects or in another's or laying hold of the external sensebases in another's mental objects or in his own or at one time in his own and at another time in another's mental objects
Origination and dissolution should be brought forward and connected here by the extended application of the method indicated by the words From the origin of ignorance the origin of the eye to the sensebases of material form in the aggregate of materiality to the mental sensebase in the aggregate of consciousness and to the sensebase of the mental object in the other nonmaterial aggregates according to the method of exegesis already stated by the commentator
The supramundane states should not be taken
From here onward the exposition is according to the method already shown by the commentator
The two groups of six sensebases are stated by way of determining the sensedoors and the senseobjects of arising of sixfold consciousness
Of the consciousness or mind aggregate included in a course of cognition of eyeconsciousness just the eyebase is the door of origin and the base of the material form is the object
So it is in the case of the others
But of the sixth sensebase the part of the mindbase called the lifecontinum the unconscious mind is the door of origin
And in a particular or special way the mindobject base is the object
Dependent on both The eye becomes a condition by way of decisive support and the material forms the objects become a condition by way of objective predominance and objective decisive support
After explaining the contemplation of mental objects by way of the internal and the external sensebases the Master said And further o bhikkhus in order to talk on the contemplation of mental objects by way of the Factors of Enlightenment the mental limbs of a being who is awaking from the stupor of the passions that soil or who is penetrating the Real Truths of Suffering its Cause its Cessation and the Way Leading to the Cessation of Suffering
Limbs are members or constituent parts of the awaking mind
Santam  Is present Existing by way of attainment
The enlightenment factor called mindfulness is the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
Because in these enlightenment factors the meditator effectively gets enlightened the meditator is called Complete Enlightenment from the time he begins strenuous contemplation on insight
It is a name for him who stands in the practice starting from the arising of the knowledge of the rise and fall of phenomena
The sevenfold completeness or harmony beginning with mindfulness by which he awakes effectively rises from the sleep of the defilements or penetrates the Truths is Complete Enlightenment The components of that Complete Enlightenment or of the harmony called Complete Enlightenment are the factors of enlightenment
The instruction of the Discourses is figurative and as this instruction on the Arousing of Mindfulness is set going by way of the mundane eightfold path it is said by the commentator that the meditator is Complete Enlightenment Otherwise he should be a Pure Disciple
The meditator is considered the personification of the factors of complete enlightenment by which he can reach Nibbana
In the other factors of enlightenment the wordmeaning should be understood in the same way
Assantam  Is absent Not existing through lack of attainment
Yatha anuppannassa  How of the nonarisen First is the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness and an abundance of right reflection on them is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness and for the increase the expansion and completion by culture of the arisen enlightenment factor
Thus it comes into being just mindfulness comprises the things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
Right reflection has just the characteristic already mentioned and when right reflection occurs plentifully in the things which condition the enlightenment factor of mindfulness the enlightenment factor of mindfulness arises
Further four things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness Mindfulness with clear comprehension the avoiding of person with confused minds association with persons who keep mindfulness ready for application inclination towards mindfulness
In explanation it is said Mindfulness arises through mindfulness with clear comprehension in the seven positions beginning with that of going forwards or the mindfulness arousing the knowledge which grasps the purpose of these actions is mindfulness with clear comprehension and as mindfulness with clear comprehension everywhere is a state which brings about the cultivation of mindfulness mindfulness with clear comprehension is necessary for the arising of mindfulness
As the abandoning or rejection of contrary things and the practice of suitable things are necessary for the arising of fresh karmically wholesome things so the eschewing of persons bereft of mindfulness association with persons who cultivate mindfulness the state of being not engaged with the first kind and the state of being engaged with the second are necessary for the arising of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
Mindfulness arises through the avoiding of persons who are confused in mind like crows that come cawing to food thrown through association with persons who keep mindfulness ready for application like the Elder Tissadatta who in the Terrace of the Wisdom Tree having got a golden ticket authorizing him to expound the Dhamma entered the assembly saying In which one of the eighteen languages shall I expound the Dhamma and the Elder Abhaya who is mentioned as the Elder Dattabhaya by the commentator and through the state of mind tending for originating mindfulness in all postures in all kinds of behavior or disposition of the body
And the bhikkhu knows that the completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of mindfulness brought into being by these four ways takes place by means of the attainment of the path of arahantship
There are karmically good and karmically bad things right and wrong counterparts of bright and dark things and an abundance of right reflection on them is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects and for the increase expansion and the completion of culture of that enlightenment factor when it has arisen
Here right reflection is the conscious state that is associated with knowledge and which arises by way of perceiving according to actuality the nature function characteristic and so forth of the several skillful states of mind and the like
Because it is correct reflection it is called right reflection
Six things lead to the arising of this enlightenment factor Inquiring about the aggregates and so forth the purification of the basis imparting evenness to the controlling faculties avoiding the ignorant associating with the wise reflecting on the profound difference of the hardtoperceive processes of the aggregates modes sensebases and so forth and the inclining towards the development of the enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects
Inquiring about the aggregates and so forth means seeking the meaning of the aggregates the modes sensebases controlling faculties powers enlightenment factors way factors absorption factors the meditation for quietude and the meditation for insight by asking for explanation of knotty points regarding these things in the Five Nikayas with the commentaries from teachers of the Dhamma
Purification of the basis is the cleaning of the personal basis the body and of the impersonal basis clothes and dwelling place
The flame of a lamp is unclear when its wick oil and container are dirty the wick splutters flickers but the flame of a lamp that has a clean wick oil and container is clear and the wick does not spit it burns smoothly
So it is with knowledge
Knowing that arises out of the mind and mental qualities which are in dirty external and internal surroundings is apt to be impure too but the knowledge that arises under clean conditions is apt to be pure
In this way cleanliness leads to the growth of this enlightenment factor which comprises knowledge
Personal cleanliness is impaired by the excessive length of hair of the head nails hair of the body by the excess of humors and by the dirt of perspiration cleanliness of impersonal or external things is impaired when robes are worn out dirty and smelly and when the house where one lives is dirty soiled and untidy
So personal cleanliness should be secured by shaving haircutting nailparing the use of pectoral emetics and of purgatives which make the body light and by shampooing bathing and doing other necessary things at the proper time
In similar way external cleanliness should be brought about by darning washing and dyeing one's robes and by smearing the floor of one's house with clay and the like to smoothen and clean it and by doing other necessary things to keep the house clean and tidy
Imparting evenness to the controlling faculties is the equalizing of the controlling faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom
Equalizing is making neither more nor less effective functionally
When faith outstrips the others through overactivity the others are thrown out of gear
Then energy finds it impossible to exert mindfulness to attend to the object concentration to be nondistracted and wisdom to see
Therefore that overactivity of faith should be made to wane either by reflection on the phenomenal nature of the things or by not attending to that thing when thinking of which faith becomes excessive
The story of the Thera Vakkali is the illustration of overactive faith
Faith outstrips the others because of unclearness of wisdom and the laxity and so forth of energy and the others through the excessive zeal of the function of faith in regard to a believable object an object that generates trust
Energy is unable to do the work of exerting and of supporting the associated mental characteristics and to avoid indolence
Mindfulness is not able to do the work of attending to the object of continuing to be at the object after coming to it
Concentration is not able to do the work of nondistraction of rejecting distraction
To see the object according to actuality as if one were seeing a physical thing with the eye wisdom is not able
These four faculties are unable to do their work because of their being overwhelmed by the faculty of faith acting very strong
Only by the evenness of function can the mental things which exist together with consciousness and are the principal things amongst conascent mental things namely the five spiritual controlling faculties accomplish their work
Not otherwise
Reflection on the phenomenal nature of the thing
By examining the objet of faith by way of the conditioned and the produced from the conditioned and the like by scrutiny according to actuality
The story of the Thera Vakkali
This venerable person who fulfilled his duties through keen faith liked to behold the Master always
The Master admonished him saying What shall it profit you to see this impure body
Who sees the Dhamma sees me and urged him to practice a subject of meditation
He was unable to apply himself to the practice of the subject of meditation and as he was inclined to destroy himself he went up to a place that was a steep declivity
Then the Master showed himself by his psychic power as if he were seated before the thera and spoke these words
Gladdened by the words of the Master he set up the development of insight but as his faith was very strong he was not able to enter into the joy of the insight
The Master knowing this gave him the subject of meditation after correcting it with the imparting of evenness of the controlling faculties
The thera after putting himself in the path of practice taught by the Master and after doing hard work in regular order reached arahantship
If however the controlling faculty of energy becomes too powerful then neither will the faculty of faith be able to do its work of arousing faith in a settled way in its object nor will the remaining controlling faculties be able to perform their functions
Therefore in such a case energy should be made to lessen its activity by the development of the enlightenment factors of calm concentration and equanimity
The story of the Thera Sona is given as an illustration of overdone energy
The story of the Thera Sona
This refers to Sona Thera who was of delicate constitution
After getting a subject of meditation from the Master he was living in Cool Wood and he thought thus My body is delicate and it is not possible to reach happiness with comfort only
Even after being exhausted the duty of the recluse should be done Thereupon he decided while giving himself up to exertion to keep to only the two postures of standing and walking
Owing to excessive walking blisters appeared on the soles of his feet and caused him great pain
He continued to make strong effort in spite of the pain but could not produce a state of distinction in meditation with his excessive energy
The Master visited Sona instructed him with the simile of the lute corrected the Thera's subject of meditation showing him the method of applying energy evenly and went to Vulture Peak
Having applied energy evenly according to the method given by the Master and after working hard for insight the Thera developing the practice established himself in arahantship
Even thus should the incapacity of the rest of the spiritual faculties to function effectively when one of them has become overactive and powerful be understood
Here the wise specially praise the equalizing of faith and wisdom and of concentration and energy
He who is very strong in faith and feeble in wisdom becomes a person who believes in foolish people who have no virtue persons who are not trustworthy
He who has very strong wisdom and feeble faith gets craftyminded and is like a drugproduced disease that cannot be cured
Such a person thinks that wholesome karma arises with just the intention to do good
Going along the wrong way by a species of thought beyond the limits of reason and doing neither almsgiving nor other similar good deeds he is born in a state of woe
By the equalizing of faith and wisdom one believes only in those like the Buddha who are worthy of trust because there is a reason for trusting them
As concentration naturally inclines towards indolence when there is too much of concentration and too little of energy indolence overwhelms the mind
As energy inclines naturally towards restlessness or agitation when there is much energy and little concentration restlessness overwhelms the mind
When concentration is combined well with energy there will be no falling of the mind into indolence
When energy is combined well with concentration there will be no falling of the mind into restlessness
Discord of faith and wisdom and discord of concentration and energy through functional unevenness are not conducive to success in meditation
Faith and wisdom should be made functionally even and harmonious
So too concentration and energy
With the making even functionally of these pairs full absorption occurs
Further to a worker in concentration  a man pursuing the path of quietude  faith that is somewhat strong is met
With faith that is strong the yogi will by believing in and fixing the mind on the object reach full absorption
If for instance the yogi is meditating on the element of earth he will not think thus How can absorption arise by the repetition of the word earth He will think that the method of meditation taught by the Supreme Buddha will surely succeed and he will settle in and leap on to the object by way of firm belief having as it were forced his way into it
Concerning concentration and wisdom it is said as follows For the worker in concentration  the man pursuing quietude  strong onepointedness is met by reason of the fact that concentration is the principal thing in absorption
With strong onepointedness he reaches full absorption
For the man pursuing the path of insight strong wisdom is met if strong wisdom exists he arrives at the penetration of the characteristics
By the equalizing of the concentration and wisdom of the worker in concentration the man pursuing quietude there is just full absorption
Owing to the very great strength of the concentration of the man pursuing quietude very great strength of wisdom too should be desired
Full absorption is mundane full absorption
Supramundane full absorption also is expected through the equalizing of these
Accordingly the Master said He develops quietude and insight yoked together
Strong mindfulness is met everywhere since it protects the mind from falling into restlessness belonging to faith energy and wisdom and from falling into indolence belonging to concentration
Faith energy and wisdom have a tendency towards excitement and concentration has a tendency towards sloth
Therefore mindfulness is to be desired by the yogi always
It is likened to the saltflavoring which is in all curries and the ministerofallwork wanted in every business of the king
And because of this the commentator made the following statement And indeed it was said by the Blessed One thus 'Mindfulness is to be desired everywhere' Why
Because mindfulness is the mind's help because mindfulness has just protection as its manifestation and because without mindfulness there is no exerting or restraining of the mind
Because it is applied always mindfulness is always useful or desirable and because in all states of elation and depression it should be developed by the man longing for the factors of enlightenment it is necessary
Mind's help the help of a wholesome or skillful state of consciousness
It is the support of such a state of mind for attaining the yet unattained
Avoiding the ignorant is keeping away from foolish folk not grounded in the knowledge of the divisions of the aggregates and so forth
Association with wise folk is fellowship with persons possessed of the knowledge of rise and fall through the laying hold of all the fifty characteristics
Reflecting on the profound differences of the profound process of the aggregates and so forth is the analytic reflection according to wisdom of the movement of the hardtoperceive aggregates and so forth
Inclining towards the enlightenment factor of the investigation of mental objects is the mental state inclining tending and sloping towards the purpose of originating this enlightenment factor in every posture of standing sitting walking and lying down
The yogi understands that the culture of this enlightenment factor arisen thus comes to completion through the path of arahantship
There is the mode of energy that is inceptive the mode of energy that is enduring and the mode of energy that is strong powerful courageous and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of energy and for the increase expansion and the completion by culture of that enlightenment factor when it has arisen
Eleven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of energy Reflection on the fearfulness of statesofwoe the seeing of the benefits of energy reflection on the path to be trodden the honoring of alms reflection on the greatness of the heritage the reflection on the greatness of the Master reflection on the greatness of race reflection on the greatness of fellows in the holy life the avoiding of lazy folk the associating with folk who have begun to exert and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of energy
Reflection on the fearfulness of the statesofwoe as stated in the Devaduta and other Suttas produces in the yogi the thought Now is the time to rouse energy it is not possible to be energetic when subject to great suffering
The seeing of the benefits of energy is the appreciation of the fact that only by one who has begun to exert himself could the Supramundane Truth be obtained and not by a lazy person
The path trodden by all the Supreme Buddhas the Paccekabuddhas and the Great Disciples has to be trodden by you says the yogi to himself and that path is impossible for an indolent person That is the reflection on the path to be trodden
The yogi thinks thus Those who support you with almsfood and so forth are not relatives of yours are not your servants they do not give you excellent alms thinking 'We shall live depending on you' But they give expecting from their offerings great fruit
Also the requisites were not allowed to you by the Master so that you may make use of the requisites and live strongbodied in comfort but they were allowed to you so that you may do the duty of the recluse and escape the round of suffering whilst using the requisites
The indolent one does not honor the alms only he who has begun to be energetic honors it Reflection in this way about honoring the alms permitted by the Buddha produces energy as in the case of the Thera Maha Mitta
The Thera lived in Kassaka Lena
In the village to which he resorted for alms there was a certain Maha Upasika who taking him as a child of hers looked after him
One day she was preparing to go to the forest and spoke to her daughter thus Here is old rice here milk here ghee and here treacle
When your brother the venerable Mitta comes cook the rice and give it to him with milk ghee and treacle
You too eat of it
I have eaten the cold rice cooked yesterday with gruel Mother what will you take at noon Cook a sour gruel with herbs and broken rice and put it by
Just as the Thera was taking out the bowl after he had robed himself to go out for alms he heard that talk of the mother and daughter through his clairaudient power at the door of his cave and thought as follows The great lay devotee has eaten stale rice with gruel and will take sour gruel at noon
For you she has given old rice milk ghee and treacle
She does not expect field or food or cloth from you
Only expecting the three good attainments of the human divine and supramundane planes does she give
Will you be able to bestow on her those attainments
Indeed her alms is not fit to be taken by you with lust hatred and ignorance Then he put back the bowl into the bowlbag loosened the robeknot refrained from going for alms and returning to the Cultivator's Cave put the bowl under his bed the robe on the robe pole and sat down resolved on endeavor thinking I will not go from here without attaining arahantship
This recluse who had been earnest for a long time after developing insight reached the fruit of arahantship even before mealtime and the great destroyer of the corruptions smiling like an opening lotus went out of the cave
To him the guardian deity of the tree near the cave said this
Having uttered this appreciation the tree deity said Venerable Sir after giving alms to an arahant like you wandering for alms the elderly woman will escape suffering
When the Thera got up and opened the door to observe what the time was he found that it was still quite early
So he took his bowl and robe and entered the village
The young girl having prepared the rice sat looking towards the door of her house thinking Now my brother will come
And when the Thera arrived she took the bowl filled it with milkrice alms mixed with ghee and treacle and placed it in his hands and he departed after giving thanks with the words May there be happiness and the girl stood there looking at the departing one
The color of the Elder at that time was exceedingly clear and his controlling faculties especially pure and his face was shining like a ripe palmfruit freed from the footstalk
The mother of the girl on returning from the forest inquired Dear did your brother come The daughter told her everything
The Maha Upasika knowing that her son's renunciation work had that day reached its acme said Dear your brother delights in the Dispensation of the Buddha
He is not dissatisfied
There is reflection on the greatness of the heritage when one thinks thus Great indeed is the heritage of the Teacher namely the Seven Real Treasures
These are not to be got by the slothful
The indolent man is like a son disowned by his parents
He does not get this parents' wealth when they pass away
So too it is with the Seven Real Treasures
Only the man of energy gets these
Reflection on the greatness of the Master consists in recalling the great events in the teacher's life and admonishing oneself thus Does it befit you to be slack after entering the Dispensation of such a Teacher
Reflection on the greatness of race is carried out by way of the fact that in entering the Buddha's Dispensation one has become the Conqueror's son and that for such a one slacking is not fit
Reflection on the greatness of fellows in the holy life consists of admonishing oneself thus Sariputta Maha Moggallana and the great disciples penetrated the supramundane after much endeavor
Are you following their way of life
The avoiding of lazy folk is the avoiding of people without physical and mental energy who are like a rocksnake lying inert after a full feed
And the association with folk who have begun to exert themselves is mixing with those whose minds are turned towards and who are endeavoring for the attainment of Nibbana
Inclination towards the development of this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards right exertion in all postures of sitting standing and so forth
The enlightenment factor that arises in this way comes to completion by culture through the path of arahantship
There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of joy and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of joy and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of the enlightenment factor when it has arisen
Eleven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of joy recollection of the Buddha recollection of the Dhamma recollection of the Sangha recollection of virtue of liberality of the shining ones and the recollection of peace the avoiding of bad people association with good people reflection on the discourses inspiring confidence and the inclination towards joy
By recollection of the Buddha's qualities of the qualities of the Dhamma and of the Sangha joy arises
Joy arises also for one who having kept the precepts of fourfold purity unbroken for a long time reflects on one's virtue to laymen who reflect on their virtue through observing the ten and the five precepts to one reflecting on liberality and recollecting one's gift of excellent food to one's fellows in the holy life during a time of scarcity and the like to laymen recollecting their liberality in giving alms to virtuous folk to one reflecting on one's possession of qualities by which beings have reached the state of shining ones to one reflecting thus by way of peace The passions suppressed by the higher attainments do not occur for sixty or seventy years
The avoiding of bad people is the keeping away from rough people who are like dirt on a mule's back who show a callous nature through irreverence owing to lack of faithinspired affection for the Buddha and the like in worshipping shrines or elders
Good people are those who have much faith in the Buddha and the like and are gentle of mind
Discourses which illumine the qualities of and inspire confidence in the Triple Gem are discourses inspiring confidence
The inclination towards joy refers to the mind sloping towards this enlightenment factor in all postures of sitting and the like
The completion by culture of this enlightenment factor is through the path of awakening
There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of calm of the body and of the mind and an abundance of right reflection on these things is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of calm and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of this enlightenment factor when it has arisen
Seven things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of calm The resorting to fine food comfortable weather and comfortable postures judgment according to the middle way the avoiding of people who are physically restless the association with people who are physically calm and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of calm
The resorting to fine food is the resorting to excellent beneficial food that is suitable to one
The resorting to comfortable weather and postures means the resorting to weather and postures suitable to one
By resorting to this threefold suitability wellbeing of mind comes into existence by way of the basis of bodily wellbeing and there proceeds then the reason for twofold calm
Judgment according to the middle way is reflection on one's own deed as one's own property and another's deed as that of other's property
This is the judgment of things based on the acknowledgment of the law of moral causation avoiding first the extreme view that the suffering and happiness experienced by living beings are causeless and then the other extreme view of ascribing these to a fictive cause like that of a Creator God and the knowing of all suffering and happiness as one's own action
But he who has the nature of a great man is patient of all kinds of weather and postures
Not concerning such a person has the above been said
The avoiding of people who are physically restless is the keeping away from restless people who go about harassing others with clod and stick
People who are physically calm are those who are quiet because they are restrained on hand and foot
The inclination towards the development of this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards calm in all postures
By the arahant's path the completion by culture of this enlightenment factor takes place
There is the sign of quietude and the sign of nonconfusion and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of concentration and for the increase expansion and completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of concentration when it has arisen
The first stage of tranquillity which arises when an object is being grasped by way of bearing it in mind the composed manner is the characteristic sign of quietude
There the sign of quietude is just the quietude by way of the composed manner
And in the sense of nondistraction is the sign of nonconfusion to be taken
Confusion is the state of mind which because of the whirling in a multiplicity of objects is jumping from thing to thing diverse of aim and not onepointed
Distraction is the same in character
Unsteadiness is its salient feature and deviation is its manifestation
By onepointedness of mind confusion is thrown out
Eleven things lead to the arising of concentration
Purification of the basis the imparting of evenness to the spiritual controlling faculties skill in taking up the sign of the object of meditation the inciting of the mind on occasion the restraining of the mind on occasion the gladdening of the mind on occasion and the regarding of the mind without interfering on occasion the avoiding of people who are not collected in mind association with people who are collected in mind reflection on the absorptions and the emancipations and the inclination towards the development of the enlightenment factor of concentration
Skill in the taking up of the sign which is the cause for the arising of absorption is skill in taking up the sign
The inciting of the mind on occasion is the applying of the mind vigorously by bringing into being the enlightenment factors of the investigation of mental objects energy and joy when there is excessive laxity of energy and of the application of wisdom and a deficiency of delight in the meditation
The restraining of the mind refers to the checking of the mind that is becoming excessively energetic too strong in the application of wisdom and elated with delight by bringing into being the enlightenment factors of calm concentration and equanimity
The gladdening of the mind means The enlivening with confidence of the mind becomes dissatisfied either through weak application of wisdom or the nonattainment of the bliss of restfulness
This enlivening is done through reflection on the eight reasons for the upsurge of spiritual feeling namely birth decay disease death the suffering of the four states of woe the samsaric round of suffering in the past and the suffering rooted in the search for nutriment in the present life and through contemplation on the qualities of the Triple Gem
The regarding of the mind without interfering is the absence of the work of inciting retraining and gladdening the mind which has got to right practice and which proceeds well in the object free from sloth free from restlessness and free from dissatisfaction
It is comparable to the state of a charioteer who looks on uninterfering when the horses are going well
The keeping away from persons who have not reached partial or full absorption and are distracted of mind is the avoiding of people who are not collected in mind
Association with persons who have reached those states of absorption is association with people who are collected in mind
The mind inclining sloping and bending towards concentrationproduction in all postures of standing sitting and the like constitutes the inclination for this factor
The completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of concentration is through the path of arahantship
Excessive laxity Of application of wisdom means feeble working of wisdom
As the principal thing in liberality is nongreed and in virtue nonhate so in meditation it is wisdom that is the principal thing
Therefore if wisdom is not very strong in the development of concentration there will be no causing of contemplative attainment
As unprepared food gives no pleasure to a man so without the application of wisdom the object of meditation does not give satisfaction to the yogi's mind
To the yogi then there is the pointing out of the remedy for that lack of satisfaction in the stirring up of spiritual feeling and confidence
There are things which condition the enlightenment factor of equanimity and an abundance of right reflection on these is the reason that is conducive to the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of equanimity and for the increase expansion and the completion by culture of the enlightenment factor when it has risen
Five things lead to the arising of the enlightenment factor of equanimity The detached attitude towards beings the detached attitude towards things the avoiding of persons who are egotistical in regard to living beings and things association with people who are neutral in regard to living beings and things and the inclination for developing the enlightenment factor of equanimity
The detached attitude towards beings is brought about by reflection on beings as possessors of their own deeds and by reflection in the highest sense
Reflection on beings as possessors of their own deeds is there when a person thinks thus You have been born here by your own deeds in the past and will depart from here and fare according to your own deeds
Who then is the being you are attached to
Reflection in the highest sense is thinking in the following way Really no living being exists
To whom then can you be attached
The detached attitude towards things is brought about by reflection on ownerlessness and temporariness
A person thinks thus This robe will fade get old become a footcleaning rag and be after that fit only to be taken up at the end of a stick and flung away
Surely should there be an owner of this he would not let it come to ruin in this way This is the reflection on ownerlessness
To think that this robe cannot last long and that its duration is short is to reflect on the temporariness of it
These two reflections are applicable in a similar way to the bowl and other things
Persons who are egotistical in regard to living beings are laymen who cherish their own sons and daughters and the like and recluses who cherish their resident pupils mates preceptors and the like
And these persons if for instance they are recluses do with their own hands for them whom they cherish haircutting sewing robewashing robedyeing bowllacquering and so forth
If even for a short time they do not see their cherished ones they look here and there like bewildered deer and ask Where is such and such novice or Where is such and such a young bhikkhu And if these recluses are requested by others to send a novice or a young bhikkhu to do some work for them such as haircutting they don't send the novice or young bhikkhu on the pretense that he is not made to do even his own work and that if he is made to do the work of others he would get tired
Persons egotistical in this way should be avoided
A person who is egotistical in regard to things is he who cherishes robes bowls beakers walking sticks staffs and so forth and does not let another even touch these
When asked for a loan of some article he would say Even I do not use it how can I give it Persons egotistical in that way too should be avoided
A person who is neutral indifferent as regards both living beings and things is a person who is detached as regards both living beings and things
The company of such a person should be sought
Inclination for developing this enlightenment factor is the inclining sloping and bending of the mind towards equanimity in all postures of standing and so forth
The completion by culture of the enlightenment factor of equanimity is wrought by the path of awakening
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally The yogi lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects by laying hold of his own enlightenment factors or another's enlightenment factors or at one time his own enlightenment factors and at another time another's enlightenment factors
Here origination and dissolution should be known by way of the origination and dissolution of the enlightenment factors
From here on the exposition is just according to the manner already stated
The cause of the enlightenment factor of equanimity is the impartial state the middle state free from attraction and repulsion
If that freedom from attraction and repulsion exists then there is equanimity when it does not exist there is no equanimity
This state of freedom from attraction and repulsion is twofold by way of scope detachment in regard to beings and detachment in regard to things
Repulsion is thrown away even by the development of the enlightenment factor of calm and in order to show just the way of casting out attraction is the instruction beginning with detachment in regard to beings taught
Specially equanimity is an enemy of lust and so the commentator said Equanimity is the path of purity of one who is full of lust
The detached attitude towards beings is developed by reflection on the individual nature of moral causation and by reflection on soullessness
By reflection on ownerlessness the state of not belonging to a soul is brought out and by reflection on temporariness the impermanence of things is brought out to produce the detached attitude towards inanimate things
Having explained thus the contemplation of mental objects by way of the seven factors of enlightenment the Master said And further and so forth in order to explain the meditation by way of the Four Truths
Idam dukkhanti yathabhutam Pajanati  A bhikkhu understands 'this is suffering' according to reality He puts aside craving and understands all things of the three planes of becoming as suffering according to nature
He understands according to nature the previous craving that produces and makes to arise that very suffering
He understands the nonoccurrence of both suffering and its origin according to nature as Nibbana
He understands according to nature the Noble Path which penetrates suffering abandons origination and realizes cessation
The rest of the explanation of the Noble Truths is in the Path of Purity
Iti ajjhattam  Thus internally He lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects having laid hold of his own four truths or the four truths of another or at one time his own four truths and at another time another's four truths
In this explanation of the truths the origination and dissolution of the four truths should be understood according to nature by way of arising and stopping
From here on the explanation is according to the manner already stated
With this have been stated the following twentyone subjects of meditation Breathing Modes of Deportments the Method of the Thirtytwo Parts of the Body the Determination of the Four Modes of Materiality the Nine Cemetery Contemplations Contemplation of Feeling Contemplation of Consciousness the Laying Hold on the Hindrances the Laying Hold on the Aggregates the Laying Hold on the Sensebases the Laying Hold on the Enlightenment Factors and the Laying Hold on the Truths
The Cemetery Contemplations are counted separately
The Contemplation on Breathing the Thirtytwo Parts and the Nine Cemetery Contemplations these eleven are subjects of meditation which produce full absorption
The Dighabhanaka Maha Siva however says that the Nine Cemetery Contemplations are here stated by way of the contemplation of Misery
Therefore according to his view only two subjects Breathing and the Thirtytwo Parts produce full absorption the rest produce only partial absorption
Yo hi koci bhikkhave ime cattaro satipatthane evam bhaveyya  O bhikkhus if anyone develops the Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner If any bhikkhu or bhikkhuni or upasaka or upasika cultivates mindfulness from the beginning according to the method taught here
Titthantu bhikkhave  O bhikkhus let alone This together with what follows was said by way of the average person capable of being trained
But concerning the person of keen intelligence it was stated as follows Instructed in the morning he will attain in the evening instructed in the evening he will attain in the morning
The Blessed One pointed out the teaching thus Bhikkhus my Dispensation leads to Deliverance in this way closed the instruction that is crowned with arahantship in twentyone places and uttered the following words This is the only way o bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of Mindfulness
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Somdet Toh  his formal title was Somdet Budhacariya  was probably the most famous and widely loved monk in nineteenth century Thailand
A skilled meditator closely associated with the royal family he was famous for many reasons but his wide popularity rests on two things Despite his rank he was easily approachable to people on all levels of society and he made amulets that  because of his meditative prowess  were reputed to be very powerful
He was also famous for his wisdom and wit
Since his death in a cult has grown up around his memory with many mediums throughout Thailand claiming to channel his spirit
At the same time many legends have grown up around his name
Here are a few of my favorites
I can't vouch for their accuracy but they all carry a good lesson which is why they merit passing on
Somdet Toh was an illegitimate son of a nobleman who eventually became King Rama The story goes that one day in or when the nobleman was in northern Thailand cleaning up after the Burmese invasion he happened to get separated from his troops
As he rode along on his horse he came across a house with a young woman about sixteen years old standing in front
Thirsty he asked her for some water
She went to the well got a bowl of water  in Thailand in the old days they would drink water out of a bowl rather than out of a glass  and crushed a lotus flower over the bowl sprinkling the stamens all over the surface of the water
Then she handed the bowl to him as he was sitting on his horse
He took one long look at the stamens on top of the water and then had to drink the water very carefully so as not to swallow them
As he handed the bowl back to her he asked her Was that a trick
No she said
I saw that you were so thirsty that you might gulp the water down and end up choking on it
So I figured this would be a good way to make sure that you drank slowly
Well
He asked her Are your parents around So she fetched her parents
They didn't know who he was but he was obviously a nobleman so when he told them I'd like to have your daughter they gave their consent
So she joined the king in the army camp but as the campaign was ending he said to her I'm afraid I can't take you down to the palace with me but in case you do have a child by me here's my belt
Give the child my belt and I'll know that it's my child
I'll take care of him or her in the future So he left her and went down to Bangkok
Her whole family soon followed down to Bangkok when they discovered that she actually was pregnant
They moved onto a floating house moored on the bank of the Chao Phraya River in front of a monastery Wat In
She gave birth to a son and named him Toh which means large When he was old enough he was ordained as a novice
A few years later when the nobleman had become King Rama II the family took Novice Toh to Wat Nibbanaram  currently Wat Mahathaad a temple right across the road from the Grand Palace  and showed the belt to the abbot
The abbot took the belt to the king and the king said Yes that's my son So he later sponsored Novice Toh's ordination as a monk
When Prince Mongkut  later Rama IV  was ordained as a monk Phra Toh was his older brother monk the one who gave him his initial training in Dhamma and Vinaya
Soon after Prince Mongkut's ordination his father died and although by birth Prince Mongkut was next in line for the throne the Privy Council chose one of his halfbrothers to reign as Rama III instead
When this happened Phra Toh decided it would be wise to leave Bangkok so he went into the forest
Prince Mongkut stayed on as a monk for years until Rama III passed away
He was then offered the throne so he disrobed and was crowned King Rama IV
Soon after his coronation he sent out word to fetch Phra Toh back to Bangkok
Officials went into the forest dragging back any monk they could find and asking Is this the monk No Is this the monk No Finally word got to Phra Toh and he came out voluntarily
The king gave him the title of Somdet  which next to the Supreme Patriarch is the highest title a monk can hold  and put him in charge of Wat Rakhang the monastery across the river from the palace
Rama IV is remembered as a wise and humane king
Somdet Toh's own epithet for him  in a brief poem he wrote summarizing the history and prophesizing the future of the Chakri dynasty  was that he maintained or embodied the Dhamma
And Rama IV's desire to have Somdet Toh near the palace is an indication of his wisdom
He knew that as king he would have trouble finding people fearless and selfless enough to tell him frankly when he was wrong and so he wanted his former teacher nearby to perform this function
But even as the king's former teacher Somdet Toh had to exercise tact and skill in criticizing the king
One story tells that one day early in his reign the king  and remember he had been a monk for twentyeight years  was sitting out on the boat landing in front of the palace drinking with his courtiers
So Somdet Toh came paddling across the river in a small boat
The king displeased said to him Here I've made you a Somdet
Don't you have any respect for your title
How can you paddle your own boat The Somdet replied When the king of the country is drinking in public Somdets can paddle their own boats Turning around he paddled back to Wat Rakhang
That was the last time the king drank in public
Another time Rama IV felt that since Thailand had been laid waste by the Burmese many ancient Thai customs had disappeared so new customs should be developed to replace them
So he decided Wouldn't it be nice if we had a boat parade at the end of the rains retreat
Every monastery in Bangkok will be responsible for decorating a boat and we'll have a contest to reward the bestlooking boat So the royal decree went out that every monastery in Bangkok had to decorate a boat for the parade
When the day for the parade came a long line of beautifully decorated boats floated past the royal reviewing stand  except for one a little canoe carrying a monkey tied to a leash with a sign on its back
The king's immediate reaction was anger Somebody's making fun of me He had his officials check the roster to see which monastery was responsible for the boat and it was Wat Rakhang Somdet Toh's monastery
So they took the sign off the monkey to see what it said
It said Willing to lose face in order to save cloth which rhymed in Thai but didn't make any more sense in Thai than it does in English
A few days later the king invited Somdet Toh into the palace for a meal and a Dhamma talk after which he asked him Suppose someone sponsored a boat with a sign like this on the back of a monkey
What do you think it might mean And the Somdet said Well it might mean that monks don't have any resources of their own to decorate boats and it's certainly not appropriate for them to ask for donations from laypeople to decorate boats so the only course left open to them would to have been to put their robes in the pawn shop
So they were willing to lose face in order to save their robes That was the last time the parade was ever held
Another story concerns a funeral in the royal palace
Funerals in the palace could go on for a hundred days before the cremation
Every night they'd invite four monks to chant
The famous highranking monks would chant toward the beginning of the hundred days and by the end of the period they were getting down into the ranks of the junior monks
One night toward the end of this particular funeral they invited four young monks who had never seen the king before in their lives
And this was back in the days when if the king said Off with your head it was off with your head
So they were nervous about their performance
After all the king had been a monk for years
He would know if they made any mistakes in their chanting
Finally the king entered the room followed by his entourage
Now Rama IV had a rather stern and fearsome appearance and as soon as the monks took one look at him they went running behind a curtain
This infuriated the king
What is this
Am I a monster
An ogre
What is this
Disrobe them immediately So a royal decree was written up and sent over the river for Somdet Toh to disrobe the monks
He happened to be sitting at a writing table next to a small altar where incense was burning
Taking one look at the royal decree he placed it over a stick of incense burned three holes in it and sent it back across the river to the palace
The king of course had studied Buddhist doctrine he knew what the three fires were the fire of passion the fire of anger and the fire of delusion
The Somdet's message was Put them out So the monks didn't have to disrobe
That's how you criticize a king
Once however Somdet Toh didn't get away with criticizing the king
There is a tradition recorded in the Apadanas that the Buddha's clan the Sakyan clan started from a time when the sons and daughters of a particular king had to leave their country
They took up residence in Kapilavastu the area that eventually became the Buddha's home
After building their city and settling in they looked around the area for spouses but couldn't find anyone who was highborn enough for them to marry
So the brothers ended up marrying their own sisters
That's the tradition recorded in the Apadanas to explain the name of the Sakyan  One's Own  clan
One day Somdet Toh was giving a talk on this topic in the royal palace and after discussing this point he continued Ever since then it's become a custom among royal families
Uncles go running after their nieces cousins go running after their cousins Now Rama IV's major queen was his niece so again he was furious
You cannot stay in this country he said
So Somdet Toh was banished from Thailand
Now in Thailand the civil law does not extend into the sima the territory immediately around ordination halls
For instance if a thief goes running into a sima the police have to get the abbot's permission before they can go into the sima after him
So the Somdet returned to Wat Rakhang and moved into the ordination hall
For about three months he didn't set foot outside the sima
Meanwhile the king had forgotten all about the banishment order and one day he said We haven't had Somdet Toh over for a talk in a long time
Let's invite him over So the invitation went across the river to the monastery but word came back saying I cannot set foot in this country remember Oh the king said I forgot And he lifted the banishment order
So it wasn't an easy thing to criticize kings in those days
Even if you were his personal teacher you had to be careful
Of course not all of Somdet Toh's comments about the king were critical
After all the respect he felt for the king was what had inspired him to leave the forest to be of help in the first place
One of the most famous stories about their relationship concerns a Dhamma talk Somdet Toh gave in the palace
Palace Dhamma talks were highly ritualized affairs
The talk was expected to be long and literary preceded with and followed by many elaborate chants and other formalities
Once Rama IV invited Somdet to present such a talk and had prepared an especially large pile of offerings to be presented to the Somdet after the talk  a sign that he was looking forward to an especially long and learned disquisition to test the Somdet's knowledge of the Dhamma
After the beginning formalities however Somdet Toh said only one sentence The king already knows everything there is to know Then he chanted the ritual passages to conclude the talk and returned to his seat on the dais quiet and composed
Immensely pleased the king presented him with the offerings commenting that that was the best Dhamma talk he had ever heard

At another similar event at the palace Somdet Toh began the closing blessing with the standard chant
As he reached this point in the chant the king in a very unusual breach of Buddhist etiquette called out Why are you giving all the merit to the hungry ghosts
What did they do to deserve it
Somdet Toh without missing a beat backed up to change the last line
Even so does everything given here benefit the king
The king who was fluent in Pali himself was delighted with the Somdet's ability to think on his feet
There are many other legends concerning Somdet Toh that don't deal with the king
Ajaan Fuang my teacher especially liked to tell a story of how Somdet Toh dealt with highranking lay people who would visit monasteries and waste the monks' time in idle conversation
Somdet Toh ate his meals in a small open pavilion in front of his dwelling
If a stray dog wandered past he would toss a little food to the dog  which meant that over time a whole pack of dogs would regularly come to sit around him at his meal time waiting for food
This meant that if any highranking lay people wanted to come pay their respects and chat with him while he was eating they'd have to bow down to the dogs as well
As a result only the people who weren't too proud to bow down to the dogs got to talk to him during his mealtime
Another story concerns a wealthy layman who wanted to invite Somdet Toh to his house for a meal and a Dhamma talk
Events like this would often be fairly public with the donor inviting many friends and relatives to participate in the meal offering and to hear the talk
So the layman sent his servant to convey the invitation to Somdet Toh saying that he wanted Somdet Toh to give a talk on a lofty topic the four noble truths
Now it so happened that the servant wasn't familiar with the term four noble truths  which in Thai is ariyasat
To him it sounded like naksat or zodiac
So he told Somdet Toh that his master wanted to hear a Dhamma talk on the zodiac
The Somdet knew that this couldn't possibly be right but the servant's mistake amused him and he decided to use it as an opportunity to make a Dhamma point  and have a little fun at the same time
When the day for the talk arrived he went to the layman's house and after the meal got up on the sermon seat and began the talk by saying Today our esteemed host has invited me to deliver a Dhamma talk on the zodiac He then proceeded to describe the twelve houses of the zodiac in a fair amount of detail
Meanwhile the master was staring daggers at the servant
After finishing his description of the zodiac the Somdet then added But regardless of what house of the zodiac people are born into they are all subject to suffering With that he switched to the four noble truths  and probably saved the servant's job
Another time some Christian missionaries came to visit the Somdet
One of the missionary strategies in those days was to show off their knowledge of science so as to dazzle the heathens win their respect and possibly win converts
With Somdet Toh so closely associated with the king perhaps they thought that if they could convert him the king might be converted as well
So they discussed various scientific topics with him and finally touched on the fact that they had proof that the world was round
The Somdet instead of being surprised said I know
In fact I can show you where the center of the world is This surprised the missionaries so they asked him to show them
He got up took his staff went out in front of his hut and planted the staff firmly on the ground saying Right here
But how could that be they asked him
He answered If the world is round it's a sphere right
And any point on the surface of the sphere is as central as any other point on the surface
After that the missionaries left him alone
On the final day of the Rains retreat in Rama IV passed away
His eldest son Prince Chulalongkorn who was now Rama V was only fifteen years old
As a result the running of the government was placed in the hands of a Regent  Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawong  who was to hold this office until Rama V reached maturity
Shortly after the Regency was instituted Somdet Toh  who was now  appeared at the Regent's palace in the middle of a sunny day carrying a lit torch that he held aloft with one hand and a long narrow palmleaf Dhamma text that he carried at a backwardsloping angle under his other arm
After he had walked through the palace halls in this way word reached the Regent
The Regent respectfully approached Somdet Toh and asked him to take a seat after which he assured him that he understood the Somdet's message He would not allow his deliberations to be overcome with the darkness of defilement and he would hold to the Dhamma as a rudder while steering the ship of state
Four years later Somdet Toh passed away
Buddhism in a Nutshell first appeared in
Since then several editions were published by various philanthropic gentlemen for free distribution
For a fuller exposition of the subjects dealt with here readers are kindly requested to read the revised and enlarged edition of The Buddha and His Teachings published in

Namo Tassa Bhagavato ArahatoSammaSambuddhassa
On the fullmoon day of May in the year BC there was born in the district of Nepal an Indian Sakya Prince named Siddhattha Gotama who was destined to be the greatest religious teacher in the world
Brought up in the lap of luxury receiving an education befitting a prince he married and had a son
His contemplative nature and boundless compassion did not permit him to enjoy the fleeting material pleasures of a Royal household
He knew no woe but he felt a deep pity for sorrowing humanity
Amidst comfort and prosperity he realized the universality of sorrow
The palace with all its worldly amusements was no longer a congenial place for the compassionate prince
The time was ripe for him to depart
Realizing the vanity of sensual enjoyments in his twentyninth year he renounced all worldly pleasures and donning the simple yellow garb of an ascetic alone penniless wandered forth in search of Truth and Peace
It was an unprecedented historic renunciation for he renounced not in his old age but in the prime of manhood not in poverty but in plenty
As it was the belief in the ancient days that no deliverance could be gained unless one leads a life of strict asceticism he strenuously practiced all forms of severe austerities
Adding vigil after vigil and penance after penance he made a superhuman effort for six long years
His body was reduced to almost a skeleton
The more he tormented his body the farther his goal receded from him
The painful unsuccessful austerities which he strenuously practiced proved absolutely futile
He was now fully convinced through personal experience of the utter futility of selfmortification which weakened his body and resulted in lassitude of spirit
Benefiting by this invaluable experience of his he finally decided to follow an independent course avoiding the two extremes of selfindulgence and selfmortification
The former retards one's spiritual progress and the latter weakens one's intellect
The new way which he himself discovered was the Middle Path Majjhima Patipada which subsequently became one of the salient characteristics of his teaching
One happy morning while He was deeply absorbed in meditation unaided and unguided by any supernatural power and solely relying on His efforts and wisdom He eradicated all defilements purified Himself and realizing things as they truly are attained Enlightenment at the age of
He was not born a Buddha but He became a Buddha by His own striving
As the perfect embodiment of all the virtues He preached endowed with deep wisdom commensurate with His boundless compassion
He devoted the remainder of His precious life to serve humanity both by example and precept dominated by no personal motive whatever
After a very successful ministry of long years the Buddha as every other human being succumbed to the inexorable law of change and finally passed away in His th year exhorting His disciples to regard His doctrine as their teacher
The Buddha was a human being
As a man He was born as a man He lived and as a man His life came to an end
Though a human being He became an extraordinary man but He never arrogated to Himself divinity
The Buddha laid stress on this important point and left no room whatever for anyone to fall into the error of thinking that He was an immortal divine being
Fortunately there is no deification in the case of the Buddha
It should however be remarked that there was no Teacher ever so godless as the Buddha yet none so godlike
The Buddha is neither an incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu as is believed by some nor is He a savior who freely saves others by His personal salvation
The Buddha exhorts His disciples to depend on themselves for their deliverance for both purity and defilement depend on oneself
Clarifying His relationship with His followers and emphasizing the importance of selfreliance and individual striving the Buddha plainly states You should exert yourselves the Tathagatas are only teachers
The Buddhas point out the path and it is left for us to follow that path to obtain our purification
To depend on others for salvation is negative but to depend on oneself is positive Dependence on others means a surrender of one's effort
In exhorting His disciples to be selfdependent the Buddha says in the Parinibbana Sutta Be ye islands unto yourselves be ye a refuge unto yourselves seek not for refuge in others These significant words are selfelevating
They reveal how vital is selfexertion to accomplish one's object and how superficial and futile it is to seek redemption through benignant saviors and to crave for illusory happiness in an after life through the propitiation of imaginary Gods or by irresponsive prayers and meaningless sacrifices
Furthermore the Buddha does not claim the monopoly of Buddhahood which as a matter of fact is not the prerogative of any specially graced person
He reached the highest possible state of perfection any person could aspire to and without the closefist of a teacher he revealed the only straight path that leads thereto
According to the Teaching of the Buddha anybody may aspire to that supreme state of perfection if he makes the necessary exertion
The Buddha does not condemn men by calling them wretched sinners but on the contrary He gladdens them by saying that they are pure in heart at conception
In His opinion the world is not wicked but is deluded by ignorance
Instead of disheartening His followers and reserving that exalted state only to Himself He encourages and induces them to emulate Him for Buddhahood is latent in all
In one sense all are potential Buddhas
One who aspires to become a Buddha is called a Bodhisatta which literally means a wisdombeing
This Bodhisatta ideal is the most beautiful and the most refined course of life that has ever been presented to this egocentric world for what is nobler than a life of service and purity
As a Man He attained Buddhahood and proclaimed to the world the latent inconceivable possibilities and the creative power of man
Instead of placing an unseen Almighty God over man who arbitrarily controls the destinies of mankind and making him subservient to a supreme power He raised the worth of mankind
It was He who taught that man can gain his deliverance and purification by his own exertion without depending on an external God or mediating priests
It was he who taught the egocentric world the noble ideal of selfless service
It was He who revolted against the degrading caste system and taught equality of mankind and gave equal opportunities for all to distinguish themselves in every walk of life
He declared that the gates of success and prosperity were open to all in every condition of life high or low saint or criminal who would care to turn a new leaf and aspire to perfection
Irrespective of caste color or rank He established for both deserving men and women a democratically constituted celibate Order
He did not force His followers to be slaves either to His Teachings or to Himself but granted complete freedom of thought
He comforted the bereaved by His consoling words
He ministered to the sick that were deserted
He helped the poor that were neglected
He ennobled the lives of the deluded purified the corrupted lives of criminals
He encouraged the feeble united the divided enlightened the ignorant clarified the mystic guided the benighted elevated the base dignified the noble
Both rich and poor saints and criminals loved Him alike
Despotic and righteous kings famous and obscure princes and nobles generous and stingy millionaires haughty and humble scholars destitute paupers downtrodden scavengers wicked murderers despised courtesans  all benefited by His words of wisdom and compassion
His noble example was a source of inspiration to all
His serene and peaceful countenance was a soothing sight to the pious eyes
His message of Peace and Tolerance was welcomed by all with indescribable joy and was of eternal benefit to every one who had the fortune to hear and practice it
Wherever His teachings penetrated it left an indelible impression upon the character of the respective peoples
The cultural advancement of all the Buddhist nations was mainly due to His sublime Teachings
In fact all Buddhist countries like Ceylon Burma Thailand Cambodia Vietnam Laos Nepal Tibet China Mongolia Korea Japan etc grew up in the cradle of Buddhism
Though more than years have elapsed since the passing away of this greatest Teacher yet his unique personality exerts a great influence on all who come to know Him
His iron will profound wisdom universal love boundless compassion selfless service historic renunciation perfect purity magnetic personality exemplary methods employed to propagate the Teachings and his final success  all these factors have compelled about onefifth of the population of the world today to hail the Buddha as their supreme Teacher
Paying a glowing tribute to the Buddha Sri Radhakrishnan states In Gautama the Buddha we have a mastermind from the East second to none so far as the influence on the thought and life of the human race is concerned and sacred to all as the founder of a religious tradition whose hold is hardly less wide and deep than any other
He belongs to the history of the world's thought to the general inheritance of all cultivated men for judged by intellectual integrity moral earnestness and spiritual insight He is undoubtedly one of the greatest figures in history
In The Three Greatest Men in History HG
Wells writes In the Buddha you see clearly a man simple devout lonely battling for light  a vivid human personality not a myth
He too gave a message to mankind universal in character
Many of our best modern ideas are in closest harmony with it
All the miseries and discontents are due he taught to selfishness
Before a man can become serene he must cease to live for his senses or himself
Then he merges into a great being
Buddha in different language called men to selfforgetfulness years before Christ
In some ways he is nearer to us and our needs
He was more lucid upon our individual importance and service than Christ and less ambiguous upon the question of personal immortality
St
Hilaire remarks The perfect model of all the virtues He preaches
His life has not a stain upon it
Fausboll says  The more I know of Him the more I love Him
A humble follower of his would say  The more I know Him the more I love Him the more I love Him the more I know Him
The nonaggressive moral and philosophical system expounded by the Buddha which demands no blind faith from its adherents expounds no dogmatic creeds encourages no superstitious rites and ceremonies but advocates a golden mean that guides a disciple through pure living and pure thinking to the gain of supreme wisdom and deliverance from all evil is called the Dhamma and is popularly known as Buddhism
The allmerciful Buddha has passed away but the sublime Dhamma which He unreservedly bequeathed to humanity still exists in its pristine purity
Although the Master has left no written records of His Teachings His distinguished disciples preserved them by committing to memory and transmitting them orally from generation to generation
Immediately after His demise chief Arahats versed in the Dhamma and Vinaya held a convocation to rehearse the Doctrine as was originally taught by the Buddha
Venerable Ananda Thera who enjoyed the special privilege of hearing all the discourses recited the Dhamma while the Venerable Upali recited the Vinaya
The Tipitaka was compiled and arranged in its present form by those Arahats of old
During the reign of the pious Sinhala King Vattagamani Abhaya about BC the Tipitaka was for the first time in the history of Buddhism committed to writing on palm leaves in Ceylon
This voluminous Tipitaka which contains the essence of the Buddha's Teaching is estimated to be about eleven times the size of the Bible
A striking contrast between the Tipitaka and the Bible is that the former is not a gradual development like the latter
As the word itself implies the Tipitaka consists of three baskets
They are the Basket of Discipline the Basket of Discourses and the Basket of Ultimate Doctrine
The Vinaya Pitaka which is regarded as the sheet anchor to the oldest historic celibate order  the Sangha  mainly deals with rules and regulations which the Buddha promulgated as occasion arose for the future discipline of the Order of monks and nuns
It described in detail the gradual development of the Sasana
An account of the life and ministry of the Buddha is also given
Indirectly it reveals some important and interesting information about ancient history Indian customs arts science etc
The Vinaya Pitaka consists of the five following books
The Sutta Pitaka consists chiefly of discourses delivered by the Buddha himself on various occasions
There are also a few discourses delivered by some of His distinguished disciples such as the Venerable Sariputta Ananda Moggallana etc included in it
It is like a book of prescriptions as the sermons embodied therein were expounded to suit the different occasions and the temperaments of various persons
There may be seemingly contradictory statements but they should not be misconstrued as they were opportunely uttered by the Buddha to suit a particular purpose for instance to the selfsame question He would maintain silence or give a detailed reply when He knew the inquirer to be an earnest seeker
Most of the sermons were intended mainly for the benefit of Bhikkhus and they deal with the Holy life and with the expositions of the doctrine
There are also several other discourses which deal with both the material and moral progress of His lay followers
This Pitaka is divided into five Nikayas or collections viz
The fifth is subdivided into fifteen books
The Abhidhamma Pitaka is the most important and the most interesting of the three containing as it does the profound philosophy of the Buddha's Teaching in contrast to the illuminating and simpler discourses in the Sutta Pitaka
In the Sutta Pitaka is found the conventional teaching while in the Abhidhamma Pitaka is found the ultimate teaching
To the wise Abhidhamma is an indispensable guide to the spiritually evolved an intellectual treat and to research scholars food for thought
Consciousness is defined
Thoughts are analyzed and classified chiefly from an ethical standpoint
Mental states are enumerated
The composition of each type of consciousness is set forth in detail
How thoughts arise is minutely described
Irrelevant problems that interest mankind but having no relation to one's purification are deliberately set aside
Matter is summarily discussed fundamental units of matter properties of matter sources of matter relationship between mind and matter are explained
The Abhidhamma investigates mind and matter the two composite factors of the socalled being to help the understanding of things as they truly are and a philosophy has been developed on those lines
Based on that philosophy an ethical system has been evolved to realize the ultimate goal Nibbana
The Abhidhamma Pitaka consists of seven books
In the Tipitaka one finds milk for the babe and meat for the strong for the Buddha taught His doctrine both to the masses and to the intelligentsia
The sublime Dhamma enshrined in these sacred texts deals with truths and facts and is not concerned with theories and philosophies which may be accepted as profound truths today only to be thrown overboard tomorrow
The Buddha has presented us with no new astounding philosophical theories nor did He venture to create any new material science
He explained to us what is within and without so far as it concerns our emancipation as ultimately expounded a path of deliverance which is unique
Incidentally He has however forestalled many a modern scientist and philosopher
Schopenhauer in his World as Will and Idea has presented the truth of suffering and its cause in a Western garb
Spinoza though he denies not the existence of a permanent reality asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory
In his opinion sorrow is conquered by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient not ephemeral but is immutable permanent everlasting Berkeley proved that the socalled indivisible atom is a metaphysical fiction
Hume after a relentless analysis of the mind concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states
Bergson advocates the doctrine of change
Prof
James refers to a stream of consciousness
The Buddha expounded these doctrines of Transiency Sorrow and NoSoul some years ago while He was sojourning in the valley of the Ganges
It should be understood that the Buddha did not preach all that He knew
On one occasion while the Buddha was passing through a forest He took a handful of leaves and said O Bhikkhus what I have taught is comparable to the leaves in my hand
What I have not taught is comparable to the amount of leaves in the forest
He taught what He deemed was absolutely essential for one's purification making no distinction between an esoteric and exoteric doctrine
He was characteristically silent on questions irrelevant to His noble mission
Buddhism no doubt accords with science but both should be treated as parallel teachings since one deals mainly with material truths while the other confines itself to moral and spiritual truths
The subject matter of each is different
The Dhamma He taught is not merely to be preserved in books nor is it a subject to be studied from a historical or literary standpoint
On the contrary it is to be learned and put into practice in the course of one's daily life for without practice one cannot appreciate the truth
The Dhamma is to be studied and more to be practiced and above all to be realized immediate realization is its ultimate goal
As such the Dhamma is compared to a raft which is meant for the sole purpose of escaping from the ocean of birth and death
Buddhism therefore cannot strictly be called a mere philosophy because it is not merely the love of inducing the search after wisdom Buddhism may approximate a philosophy but it is very much more comprehensive
Philosophy deals mainly with knowledge and is not concerned with practice whereas Buddhism lays special emphasis on practice and realization
It is neither a religion in the sense in which that word is commonly understood for it is not a system of faith and worship owing any allegiance to a supernatural being
Buddhism does not demand blind faith from its adherents
Here mere belief is dethroned and is substituted by confidence based on knowledge which in Pali is known as Saddha
The confidence placed by a follower on the Buddha is like that of a sick person in a noted physician or a student in his teacher
A Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha because it was He who discovered the Path of Deliverance
A Buddhist does not seek refuge in the Buddha with the hope that he will be saved by His personal purification
The Buddha gives no such guarantee
It is not within the power of a Buddha to wash away the impurities of others
One could neither purify nor defile another
The Buddha as Teacher instructs us but we ourselves are directly responsible for our purification
Although a Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha he does not make any selfsurrender
Nor does a Buddhist sacrifice his freedom of thought by becoming a follower of the Buddha
He can exercise his own free will and develop his knowledge even to the extent of becoming a Buddha himself
The starting point of Buddhism is reasoning or understanding or in other words Sammaditthi
To the seekers of truth the Buddha says
Do not accept anything on hearsay 
Do not accept anything by mere tradition 
Do not accept anything on account of mere rumors 
Do not accept anything just because it accords with your scriptures
Do not accept anything by mere suppositions
Do not accept anything by mere inference
Do not accept anything by merely considering the reasons
Do not accept anything merely because it agrees with your preconceived notions
Do not accept anything merely because it seems acceptable 
Do not accept anything thinking that the ascetic is respected by us
But when you know for yourselves  these things are immoral these things are blameworthy these things are censured by the wise these things when performed and undertaken conduce to ruin and sorrow  then indeed do you reject them
When you know for yourselves  these things are moral these things are blameless these things are praised by the wise these things when performed and undertaken conduce to wellbeing and happiness  then do you live acting accordingly
These inspiring words of the Buddha still retain their original force and freshness
Though there is no blind faith one might argue whether there is no worshiping of images etc in Buddhism
Buddhists do not worship an image expecting worldly or spiritual favors but pay their reverence to what it represents
An understanding Buddhist in offering flowers and incense to an image designedly makes himself feel that he is in the presence of the living Buddha and thereby gains inspiration from His noble personality and breathes deep His boundless compassion
He tries to follow His noble example
The Botree is also a symbol of Enlightenment
These external objects of reverence are not absolutely necessary but they are useful as they tend to concentrate one's attention
An intellectual person could dispense with them as he could easily focus his attention and visualize the Buddha
For our own good and out of gratitude we pay such external respect but what the Buddha expects from His disciple is not so much obeisance as the actual observance of His Teachings
The Buddha says  He honors me best who practices my teaching best He who sees the Dhamma sees me
With regard to images however Count Kevserling remarks  I see nothing more grand in this world than the image of the Buddha
It is an absolutely perfect embodiment of spirituality in the visible domain
Furthermore it must be mentioned that there are not petitional or intercessory prayers in Buddhism
However much we may pray to the Buddha we cannot be saved
The Buddha does not grant favors to those who pray to Him
Instead of petitional prayers there is meditation that leads to selfcontrol purification and enlightenment
Meditation is neither a silent reverie nor keeping the mind blank
It is an active striving
It serves as a tonic both to the heart and the mind
The Buddha not only speaks of the futility of offering prayers but also disparages a slave mentality
A Buddhist should not pray to be saved but should rely on himself and win his freedom
Prayers take the character of private communications selfish bargaining with God
It seeks for objects of earthly ambitions and inflames the sense of self
Meditation on the other hand is selfchange
 Sri Radhakrishnan
In Buddhism there is not as in most other religions an Almighty God to be obeyed and feared
The Buddha does not believe in a cosmic potentate omniscient and omnipresent
In Buddhism there are no divine revelations or divine messengers
A Buddhist is therefore not subservient to any higher supernatural power which controls his destinies and which arbitrarily rewards and punishes
Since Buddhists do not believe in revelations of a divine being Buddhism does not claim the monopoly of truth and does not condemn any other religion
But Buddhism recognizes the infinite latent possibilities of man and teaches that man can gain deliverance from suffering by his own efforts independent of divine help or mediating priests
Buddhism cannot therefore strictly be called a religion because it is neither a system of faith and worship nor the outward act or form by which men indicate their recognition of the existence of a God or gods having power over their own destiny to whom obedience service and honor are due
If by religion is meant a teaching which takes a view of life that is more than superficial a teaching which looks into life and not merely at it a teaching which furnishes men with a guide to conduct that is in accord with this its inlook a teaching which enables those who give it heed to face life with fortitude and death with serenity or a system to get rid of the ills of life then it is certainly a religion of religions
It no doubt contains an excellent ethical code which is unparalleled in its perfection and altruistic attitude
It deals with one way of life for the monks and another for the laity
But Buddhism is much more than an ordinary moral teaching
Morality is only the preliminary stage on the Path of Purity and is a means to an end but not an end in itself
Conduct though essential is itself insufficient to gain one's emancipation
It should be coupled with wisdom or knowledge
The base of Buddhism is morality and wisdom is its apex
In observing the principles of morality a Buddhist should not only regard his own self but also should have a consideration for others we well  animals not excluded
Morality in Buddhism is not founded on any doubtful revelation nor is it the ingenious invention of an exceptional mind but it is a rational and practical code based on verifiable facts and individual experience
It should be mentioned that any external supernatural agency plays no part whatever in the moulding of the character of a Buddhist
In Buddhism there is no one to reward or punish
Pain or happiness are the inevitable results of one's actions
The question of incurring the pleasure or displeasure of a God does not enter the mind of a Buddhist
Neither hope of reward nor fear of punishment acts as an incentive to him to do good or to refrain from evil
A Buddhist is aware of future consequences but he refrains from evil because it retards does good because it aids progress to Enlightenment
There are also some who do good because it is good refrain from evil because it is bad
To understand the exceptionally high standard of morality the Buddha expects from His ideal followers one must carefully read the Dhammapada Sigalovada Sutta Vyaggapajja Sutta Mangala Sutta Karaniya Sutta Parabhava Sutta Vasala Sutta Dhammika Sutta etc
As a moral teaching it excels all other ethical systems but morality is only the beginning and not the end of Buddhism
In one sense Buddhism is not a philosophy in another sense it is the philosophy of philosophies
In one sense Buddhism is not a religion in another sense it is the religion of religions
Buddhism is neither a metaphysical path nor a ritualistic path
It is neither sceptical nor dogmatic
It is neither selfmortification nor selfindulgence
It is neither pessimism nor optimism
It is neither eternalism nor nihilism
It is neither absolutely thisworldly nor otherworldly
It is a unique Path of Enlightenment
The original Pali term for Buddhism is Dhamma which literally means that which upholds
There is no English equivalent that exactly conveys the meaning of the Pali term
The Dhamma is that which really is
It is the Doctrine of Reality
It is a means of Deliverance from suffering and Deliverance itself
Whether the Buddhas arise or not the Dhamma exists
It lies hidden from the ignorant eyes of men till a Buddha an Enlightened One realizes and compassionately reveals it to the world
This Dhamma is not something apart from oneself but is closely associated with oneself
As such the Buddha exhorts
Abide with oneself as an island with oneself as a Refuge
Abide with the Dhamma as an island with the Dhamma as a Refuge
Seek no external refuge
 Parinibbana Sutta
The foundations of Buddhism are the four Noble Truths  namely Suffering its cause its end and the Middle Way
What is the Noble Truth of Suffering
Birth is suffering old age is suffering disease is suffering death is suffering to be united with the unpleasant is suffering to be separated from the pleasant is suffering not to receive what one craves for is suffering in brief the five Aggregates of Attachment are suffering
What is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering
What is the Noble Truth of the Annihilation of Suffering
What is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Annihilation of Suffering
Whether the Buddhas arise or not these four Truths exist in the universe
The Buddhas only reveal these Truths which lay hidden in the dark abyss of time
Scientifically interpreted the Dhamma may be called the law of cause and effect
These two embrace the entire body of the Buddha's Teachings
The first three represent the philosophy of Buddhism the fourth represents the ethics of Buddhism based on that philosophy
All these four truths are dependent on this body itself
The Buddha states In this very onefathom long body along with perceptions and thoughts do I proclaim the world the origin of the world the end of the world and the path leading to the end of the world Here the term world is applied to suffering
Buddhism rests on the pivot of sorrow
But it does not thereby follow that Buddhism is pessimistic
It is neither totally pessimistic nor totally optimistic but on the contrary it teaches a truth that lies midway between them
One would be justified in calling the Buddha a pessimist if He had only enunciated the Truth of suffering without suggesting a means to put an end to it
The Buddha perceived the universality of sorrow and did prescribe a panacea for this universal sickness of humanity
The highest conceivable happiness according to the Buddha is Nibbana which is the total extinction of suffering
The author of the article on Pessimism in the Encyclopedia Britannica writes Pessimism denotes an attitude of hopelessness towards life a vague general opinion that pain and evil predominate in human affairs
The original doctrine of the Buddha is in fact as optimistic as any optimism of the West
To call it pessimism is merely to apply to it a characteristically Western principle to which happiness is impossible without personality
The true Buddhist looks forward with enthusiasm to absorption into eternal bliss
Ordinarily the enjoyment of sensual pleasures is the highest and only happiness of the average man
There is no doubt a kind of momentary happiness in the anticipation gratification and retrospection of such fleeting material pleasures but they are illusive and temporary
According to the Buddha nonattachment is a greater bliss
The Buddha does not expect His followers to be constantly pondering on suffering and lead a miserable unhappy life
He exhorts them to be always happy and cheerful for zest is one of the factors of Enlightenment
Real happiness is found within and is not to be defined in terms of wealth children honors or fame
If such possessions are misdirected forcibly or unjustly obtained misappropriated or even viewed with attachment they will be a source of pain and sorrow to the possessors
Instead of trying to rationalize suffering Buddhism takes suffering for granted and seeks the cause to eradicate it
Suffering exists as long as there is craving
It can only be annihilated by treading the Noble Eightfold Path and attaining the supreme bliss of Nibbana
These four Truths can be verified by experience
Hence the Buddha Dhamma is not based on the fear of the unknown but is founded on the bedrock of facts which can be tested by ourselves and verified by experience
Buddhism is therefore rational and intensely practical
Such a rational and practical system cannot contain mysteries or esoteric doctrines
Blind faith therefore is foreign to Buddhism
Where there is no blind faith there cannot be any coercion or persecution or fanaticism
To the unique credit of Buddhism it must be said that throughout its peaceful march of years no drop of blood was shed in the name of the Buddha no mighty monarch wielded his powerful sword to propagate the Dhamma and no conversion was made either by force or by repulsive methods
Yet the Buddha was the first and the greatest missionary that lived on earth
Aldous Huxley writes Alone of all the great world religions Buddhism made its way without persecution censorship or inquisition
Lord Russell remarks Of the great religions of history I prefer Buddhism especially in its earliest forms because it has had the smallest element of persecution
In the name of Buddhism no altar was reddened with the blood of a Hypatia no Bruno was burnt alive
Buddhism appeals more to the intellect than to the emotion
It is concerned more with the character of the devotees than with their numerical strength
On one occasion Upali a follower of Nigantha Nataputta approached the Buddha and was so pleased with the Buddha's exposition of the Dhamma that he instantly expressed his desire to become a follower of the Buddha
But the Buddha cautioned him saying
Upali who was overjoyed at this unexpected remark of the Buddha said
Buddhism is saturated with this spirit of free enquiry and complete tolerance
It is the teaching of the open mind and the sympathetic heart which lighting and warming the whole universe with its twin rays of wisdom and compassion sheds its genial glow on every being struggling in the ocean of birth and death
The Buddha was so tolerant that He did not even exercise His power to give commandments to His lay followers
Instead of using the imperative He said It behooves you to do this  It behooves you not to do this He commands not but does exhort
This tolerance the Buddha extended to men women and all living beings
It was the Buddha who first attempted to abolish slavery and vehemently protested against the degrading caste system which was firmly rooted in the soil of India
In the Word of the Buddha it is not by mere birth one becomes an outcast or a noble but by one's actions
Caste or color does not preclude one from becoming a Buddhist or from entering the Order
Fishermen scavengers courtesans together with warriors and Brahmans were freely admitted to the Order and enjoyed equal privileges and were also given positions of rank
Upali the barber for instance was made in preference to all other the chief in matters pertaining to Vinaya discipline
The timid Sunita the scavenger who attained Arhatship was admitted by the Buddha Himself into the Order
Angulimala the robber and criminal was converted to a compassionate saint
The fierce Alavaka sought refuge in the Buddha and became a saint
The courtesan Ambapali entered the Order and attained Arhatship
Such instances could easily be multiplied from the Tipitaka to show that the portals of Buddhism were wide open to all irrespective of caste color or rank
It was also the Buddha who raised the status of downtrodden women and not only brought them to a realization of their importance to society but also founded the first celibate religious order for women with rules and regulations
The Buddha did not humiliate women but only regarded them as feeble by nature
He saw the innate good of both men and women and assigned to them their due places in His teaching
Sex is no barrier to attaining Sainthood
Sometimes the Pali term used to denote women is Matugama which means motherfolk or society of mothers As a mother woman holds an honorable place in Buddhism
Even the wife is regarded as best friend of the husband
Hasty critics are only making ex parte statements when they reproach Buddhism with being inimical to women
Although at first the Buddha refused to admit women into the Order on reasonable grounds yet later He yielded to the entreaties of His fostermother Pajapati Gotami and founded the Bhikkhuni Order
Just as the Arahats Sariputta and Moggallana were made the two chief disciples in the Order of monks even so he appointed Arahats Khema and Uppalavanna as the two chief female disciples
Many other female disciples too were named by the Buddha Himself as His distinguished and pious followers
On one occasion the Buddha said to King Kosala who was displeased on hearing that a daughter was born to him
Many women who otherwise would have fallen into oblivion distinguished themselves in various ways and gained their emancipation by following the Dhamma and entering the Order
In this new Order which later proved to be a great blessing to many women queens princesses daughters of noble families widows bereaved mothers destitute women pitiable courtesans  all despite their caste or rank met on a common platform enjoyed perfect consolation and peace and breathed that free atmosphere which is denied to those cloistered in cottages and palatial mansions
It was also the Buddha who banned the sacrifice of poor beasts and admonished His followers to extend their loving kindness to all living beings  even to the tiniest creature that crawls at one's feet
No man has the power or the right to destroy the life of another as life is precious to all
A genuine Buddhist would exercise this lovingkindness towards every living being and identify himself with all making no distinction whatsoever with regard to caste color or sex
It is this Buddhist Metta that attempts to break all the barriers which separate one from another
There is no reason to keep aloof from others merely because they belong to another persuasion or another nationality
In that noble Toleration Edict which is based on CullaVyuha and MahaVyuha Suttas Asoka says Concourse alone is best that is all should harken willingly to the doctrine professed by others
Buddhism is not confined to any country or any particular nation
It is universal
It is not nationalism which in other words is another form of caste system founded on a wider basis
Buddhism if it be permitted to say so is supernationalism
To a Buddhist there is no far or near no enemy or foreigner no renegade or untouchable since universal love realized through understanding has established the brotherhood of all living beings
A real Buddhist is a citizen of the world
He regards the whole world as his motherland and all as his brothers and sisters
Buddhism is therefore unique mainly owing to its tolerance nonaggressiveness rationality practicability efficacy and universality
It is the noblest of all unifying influences and the only lever that can uplift the world
These are some of the salient features of Buddhism and amongst some of the fundamental doctrines may be said  Kamma or the Law of Moral Causation the Doctrine of Rebirth Anatta and Nibbana
We are faced with a totally illbalanced world
We perceive the inequalities and manifold destinies of men and the numerous grades of beings that exist in the universe
We see one born into a condition of affluence endowed with fine mental moral and physical qualities and another into a condition of abject poverty and wretchedness
Here is a man virtuous and holy but contrary to his expectation illluck is ever ready to greet him
The wicked world runs counter to his ambitions and desires
He is poor and miserable in spite of his honest dealings and piety
There is another vicious and foolish but accounted to be fortune's darling
He is rewarded with all forms of favors despite his shortcomings and evil modes of life
Why it may be questioned should one be an inferior and another a superior
Why should one be wrested from the hands of a fond mother when he has scarcely seen a few summers and another should perish in the flower or manhood or at the ripe age of eighty or hundred
Why should one be sick and infirm and another strong and healthy
Why should one be handsome and another ugly and hideous repulsive to all
Why should one be brought up in the lap of luxury and another in absolute poverty steeped in misery
Why should one be born a millionaire and another a pauper
Why should one be born with saintly characteristics and another with criminal tendencies
Why should some be linguists artists mathematicians or musicians from the very cradle
Why should some be congenitally blind deaf and deformed
Why should some be blessed and others cursed from their birth
These are some problems that perplex the minds of all thinking men
How are we to account for all this unevenness of the world this inequality of mankind
Is it due to the work of blind chance or accident
There is nothing in this world that happens by blind chance or accident
To say that anything happens by chance is no more true than that this book has come here of itself
Strictly speaking nothing happens to man that he does not deserve for some reason or another
Could this be the fiat of an irresponsible Creator
Huxley writes
If we are to assume that anybody has designedly set this wonderful universe going it is perfectly clear to me that he is no more entirely benevolent and just in any intelligible sense of the words than that he is malevolent and unjust
According to Einstein
If this being is omnipotent then every occurrence including every human action every human thought and every human feeling and aspiration is also his work how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an Almighty Being
In giving out punishments and rewards he would to a certain extent be passing judgment on himself
How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to him
According to the theological principles man is created arbitrarily and without his desire and at the moment of his creation is either blessed or damned eternally
Hence man is either good or evil fortunate or unfortunate noble or depraved from the first step in the process of his physical creation to the moment of his last breath regardless of his individual desires hopes ambitions struggles or devoted prayers
Such is theological fatalism
 Spencer Lewis
As Charles Bradlaugh says
The existence of evil is a terrible stumbling block to the Theist
Pain misery crime poverty confront the advocate of eternal goodness and challenge with unanswerable potency his declaration of Deity as allgood allwise and allpowerful
In the words of Schopenhauer
Whoever regards himself as having become out of nothing must also think that he will again become nothing for an eternity has passed before he was and then a second eternity had begun through which he will never cease to be is a monstrous thought
If birth is the absolute beginning then death must be his absolute end and the assumption that man is made out of nothing leads necessarily to the assumption that death is his absolute end
Commenting on human sufferings and God Prof
JBS
Haldane writes
Either suffering is needed to perfect human character or God is not Almighty
The former theory is disproved by the fact that some people who have suffered very little but have been fortunate in their ancestry and education have very fine characters
The objection to the second is that it is only in connection with the universe as a whole that there is any intellectual gap to be filled by the postulation of a deity
And a creator could presumably create whatever he or it wanted
Lord Russell states
The world we are told was created by a God who is both good and omnipotent
Before He created the world he foresaw all the pain and misery that it would contain
He is therefore responsible for all of it
it is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sin
If God knew in advance the sins of which man would be guilty He was clearly responsible for all the consequences of those sins when He decided to create man
In Despair a poem of his old age Lord Tennyson thus boldly attacks God who as recorded in Isaiah says I make peace and create evil 
What
I should call on that infinite love that has served us so well
Infinite cruelty rather that made everlasting hell Made us foreknew us foredoomed us and does what he will with his own
Better our dead brute mother who never has heard us groan
Surely the doctrine that all men are sinners and have the essential sin of Adam is a challenge to justice mercy love and omnipotent fairness
Some writers of old authoritatively declared that God created man in his own image
Some modern thinkers state on the contrary that man created God in his own image
With the growth of civilization man's concept of God also became more and more refined
It is however impossible to conceive of such a being either in or outside the universe
Could this variation be due to heredity and environment
One must admit that all such chemicophysical phenomena revealed by scientists are partly instrumental but they cannot be solely responsible for the subtle distinctions and vast differences that exist amongst individuals
Yet why should identical twins who are physically alike inheriting like genes enjoying the same privilege of upbringing be very often temperamentally morally and intellectually totally different
Heredity alone cannot account for these vast differences
Strictly speaking it accounts more plausibly for their similarities than for most of the differences
The infinitesimally minute chemicophysical germ which is about millionth part of an inch across inherited from parents explains only a portion of man his physical foundation
With regard to the more complex and subtle mental intellectual and moral differences we need more enlightenment
The theory of heredity cannot give a satisfactory explanation for the birth of a criminal in a long line of honorable ancestors the birth of a saint or a noble man in a family of evil repute for the arising of infant prodigies men of genius and great religious teachers
According to Buddhism this variation is due not only to heredity environment nature and nurture but also to our own kamma or in other words to the result of our own inherited past actions and our present deeds
We ourselves are responsible for our own deeds happiness and misery
We build our own hells
We create our own heavens
We are the architects of our own fate
In short we ourselves are our own kamma
On one occasion a certain young man named Subha approached the Buddha and questioned why and wherefore it was that among human beings there are the low and high states
For said he we find amongst mankind those of brief life and those of long life the hale and the ailing the good looking and the illlooking the powerful and the powerless the poor and the rich the lowborn and the highborn the ignorant and the intelligent
The Buddha briefly replied Every living being has kamma as its own its inheritance its cause its kinsman its refuge
Kamma is that which differentiates all living beings into low and high states
He then explained the cause of such differences in accordance with the law of moral causation
Thus from a Buddhist standpoint our present mental intellectual moral and temperamental differences are mainly due to our own actions and tendencies both past the present
Kamma literally means action but in its ultimate sense it means the meritorious and demeritorious volition
Kamma constitutes both good and evil
Good gets good
Evil gets evil
Like attracts like
This is the law of Kamma
As some Westerners prefer to say Kamma is actioninfluence
We reap what we have sown
What we sow we reap somewhere or some when
In one sense we are the result of what we were we will be the result of what we are
In another sense we are not totally the result of what we were and we will not absolutely be the result of what we are
For instance a criminal today may be a saint tomorrow
Buddhism attributes this variation to Kamma but it does not assert that everything is due to Kamma
If everything were due to Kamma a man must ever be bad for it is his Kamma to be bad
One need not consult a physician to be cured of a disease for if one's Kamma is such one will be cured
According to Buddhism there are five orders or processes which operate in the physical and mental realms
Every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by these allembracing five orders or processes which are laws in themselves
Kamma is therefore only one of the five orders that prevail in the universe
It is a law in itself but it does not thereby follow that there should be a lawgiver
Ordinary laws of nature like gravitation need no lawgiver
It operates in its own field without the intervention of an external independent ruling agency
Nobody for instance has decreed that fire should burn
Nobody has commanded that water should seek its own level
No scientist has ordered that water should consist of HO and that coldness should be one of its properties
These are their intrinsic characteristics
Kamma is neither fate nor predestination imposed upon us by some mysterious unknown power to which we must helplessly submit ourselves
It is one's own doing reacting on oneself and so one has the possibility to divert the course of Kamma to some extent
How far one diverts it depends on oneself
It must also be said that such phraseology as rewards and punishments should not be allowed to enter into discussions concerning the problem of Kamma
For Buddhism does not recognize an Almighty Being who rules His subjects and rewards and punishes them accordingly
Buddhists on the contrary believe that sorrow and happiness one experiences are the natural outcome of one's own good and bad actions
It should be stated that Kamma has both the continuative and the retributive principle
Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing its due effect
The cause produces the effect the effect explains the cause
Seed produces the fruit the fruit explains the seed as both are interrelated
Even so Kamma and its effect are interrelated the effect already blooms in the cause
A Buddhist who is fully convinced of the doctrine of Kamma does not pray to another to be saved but confidently relies on himself for his purification because it teaches individual responsibility
It is this doctrine of Kamma that gives him consolation hope self reliance and moral courage
It is this belief in Kamma that validates his effort kindles his enthusiasm makes him ever kind tolerant and considerate
It is also this firm belief in Kamma that prompts him to refrain from evil do good and be good without being frightened of any punishment or tempted by any reward
It is this doctrine of Kamma that can explain the problem of suffering the mystery of socalled fate or predestination of other religions and above all the inequality of mankind
Kamma and rebirth are accepted as axiomatic
As long as this Kammic force exists there is rebirth for beings are merely the visible manifestation of this invisible Kammic force
Death is nothing but the temporary end of this temporary phenomenon
It is not the complete annihilation of this socalled being
The organic life has ceased but the Kammic force which hitherto actuated it has not been destroyed
As the Kammic force remains entirely undisturbed by the disintegration of the fleeting body the passing away of the present dying thoughtmoment only conditions a fresh consciousness in another birth
It is Kamma rooted in ignorance and craving that conditions rebirth
Past Kamma conditions the present birth and present Kamma in combination with past Kamma conditions the future
The present is the offspring of the past and becomes in turn the parent of the future
If we postulate a past present and a future life then we are at once faced with the alleged mysterious problem  What is the ultimate origin of life
Either there must be a beginning or there cannot be a beginning for life
One school in attempting to solve the problem postulates a first cause God viewed as a force or as an Almighty Being
Another school denies a first cause for in common experience the cause ever becomes the effect and the effect becomes the cause
In a circle of cause and effect a first cause is inconceivable
According to the former life has had a beginning according to the latter it is beginningless
From the scientific standpoint we are the direct products of the sperm and ovum cells provided by our parents
As such life precedes life
With regard to the origin of the first protoplasm of life or colloid scientists plead ignorance
According to Buddhism we are born from the matrix of action
Parents merely provide an infinitesimally small cell
As such being precedes being
At the moment of conception it is past Kamma that conditions the initial consciousness that vitalizes the fetus
It is this invisible Kammic energy generated from the past birth that produces mental phenomena and the phenomenon of life in an already extent physical phenomenon to complete the trio that constitutes man
For a being to be born here a being must die somewhere
The birth of a being which strictly means the arising of the five aggregates or psychophysical phenomena in this present life corresponds to the death of a being in a past life just as in conventional terms the rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in another place
This enigmatic statement may be better understood by imagining life as a wave and not as a straight line
Birth and death are only two phases of the same process
Birth precedes death and death on the other hand precedes birth
The constant succession of birth and death in connection with each individual life flux constitutes what is technically known as Samsara  recurrent wandering
What is the ultimate origin of life
The Buddha declares
Without cognizable end is this Samsara
A first beginning of beings who obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving wander and fare on is not to be perceived
This lifestream flows ad infinitum as long as it is fed by the muddy waters of ignorance and craving
When these two are completely cut off then only if one so wishes does the stream cease to flow rebirth ends as in the case of the Buddhas and Arahats
An ultimate beginning of this lifestream cannot be determined as a stage cannot be perceived when this lifeforce was not fraught with ignorance and craving
The Buddha has here referred merely to the beginning of the lifestream of living beings
It is left to scientists to speculate on the origin and the evolution of the universe
The Buddha does not attempt to solve all the ethical and philosophical problems that perplex mankind
Nor does He deal with theories and speculations that tend neither to edification nor to enlightenment
Nor does He demand blind faith from His adherents
He is chiefly concerned with the problem of suffering and its destruction
With but this one practical and specific purpose in view all irrelevant side issues are completely ignored
But how are we to believe that there is a past existence
The most valuable evidence Buddhists cite in favor of rebirth is the Buddha for He developed a knowledge which enabled Him to read past and future lives
Following His instructions His disciples also developed this knowledge and were able to read their past lives to a great extent
Even some Indian Rishis before the advent of the Buddha were distinguished for such psychic powers as clairaudience clairvoyance thoughtreading remembering past births etc
There are also some persons who probably in accordance with the laws of association spontaneously develop the memory of their past birth and remember fragments of their previous lives
Such cases are very rare but those few wellattested respectable cases tend to throw some light on the idea of a past birth
So are the experiences of some modern dependable psychics and strange cases of alternating and multiple personalities
In hypnotic states some relate experiences of their past lives while a few others read the past lives of others and even heal diseases
Sometimes we get strange experiences which cannot be explained but by rebirth
How often do we meet persons whom we have never met and yet instinctively feel that they are quite familiar to us
How often do we visit places and yet feel impressed that we are perfectly acquainted with those surroundings
The Buddha tells us
Through previous associations or present advantage that old love springs up again like the lotus in the water
Experiences of some reliable modern psychics ghostly phenomena spirit communications strange alternating and multiple personalities and so on shed some light upon this problem of rebirth
Into this world come Perfect Ones like the Buddhas and highly developed personalities
Do they evolve suddenly
Can they be the products of a single existence
How are we to account for great characters like Buddhaghosa Panini Kalidasa Homer and Plato men of genius like Shakespeare infant prodigies like Pascal Mozart Beethoven Raphael Ramanujan etc
Heredity alone cannot account for them
Else their ancestry would disclose it their posterity even greater than themselves demonstrate it
Could they rise to such lofty heights if they had not lived noble lives and gained similar experiences in the past
Is it by mere chance that they are been born or those particular parents and placed under those favorable circumstances
The few years that we are privileged to spend here or for the most five score years must certainly be an inadequate preparation for eternity
If one believes in the present and in the future it is quite logical to believe in the past
The present is the offspring of the past and acts in turn as the parent of the future
If there are reasons to believe that we have existed in the past then surely there are no reasons to disbelieve that we shall continue to exist after our present life has apparently ceased
It is indeed a strong argument in favor of past and future lives that in this world virtuous persons are very often unfortunate and vicious persons prosperous
A Western writer says
Whether we believe in a past existence or not it forms the only reasonable hypothesis which bridges certain gaps in human knowledge concerning certain facts of every day life
Our reason tells us that this idea of past birth and Kamma alone can explain the degrees of difference that exist between twins how men like Shakespeare with a very limited experience are able to portray with marvelous exactitude the most diverse types of human character scenes and so forth of which they could have no actual knowledge why the work of the genius invariably transcends his experience the existence of infant precocity the vast diversity in mind and morals in brain and physique in conditions circumstances and environment observable throughout the world and so forth
It should be stated that this doctrine of rebirth can neither be proved nor disproved experimentally but it is accepted as an evidentially verifiable fact
The cause of this Kamma continues the Buddha is avijja or ignorance of the Four Noble Truths
Ignorance is therefore the cause of birth and death and its transmutation into knowingness or vijja is consequently their cessation
The result of this analytical method is summed up in the Paticca Samuppada
Paticca means because of or dependent upon Samuppada arising or origination Paticca Samuppada therefore literally means  Dependent Arising or Dependent Origination
It must be borne in mind that Paticca Samuppada is only a discourse on the process of birth and death and not a theory of the ultimate origin of life
It deals with the cause of rebirth and suffering but it does not in the least attempt to show the evolution of the world from primordial matter
Ignorance is the first link or cause of the wheel of life
It clouds all right understanding
Dependent on ignorance of the Four Noble Truths arise activities  both moral and immoral
The activities whether good or bad rooted in ignorance which must necessarily have their due effects only tend to prolong life's wandering
Nevertheless good actions are essential to get rid of the ills of life
Dependent on activities arise rebirthconsciousness
This links the past with the present
Simultaneous with the arising of rebirthconsciousness there come into being mind and body
The six senses are the inevitable consequences of mind and body
Because of the six senses contact sets in
Contact leads to feeling
These five  viz consciousness mind and matter six senses contact and feeling  are the effects of past actions and are called the passive side of life
Dependent on feeling arises craving
Craving results in grasping
Grasping is the cause of Kamma which in its turn conditions future birth
Birth is the inevitable cause of old age and death
If on account of cause effect comes to be then if the cause ceases the effect also must cease
The reverse order of the Paticca Samuppada will make the matter clear
Old age and death are possible in and with a psychophysical organism
Such an organism must be born therefore it presupposes birth
But birth is the inevitable result of past deeds or Kamma
Kamma is conditioned by grasping which is due to craving
Such craving can appear only where feeling exists
Feeling is the outcome of contact between the senses and objects
Therefore it presupposes organs of senses which cannot exist without mind and body
Where there is a mind there is consciousness
It is the result of past good and evil
The acquisition of good and evil is due to ignorance of things as they truly are
The whole formula may be summed up thus
Thus does the entire aggregate of suffering arise
The first two of these twelve pertain to the past the middle eight to the present and the last two to the future
The complete cessation of Ignorance leads to the cessation of Activities
Thus does the cessation of this entire aggregate of suffering result
This process of cause and effect continues ad infinitum
The beginning of this process cannot be determined as it is impossible to say whence this lifeflux was encompassed by nescience
But when this nescience is turned into knowledge and the lifeflux is diverted into Nibbanadhatu then the end of the life process of Samsara comes about
This Buddhist doctrine of rebirth should be distinguished from the theory of reincarnation which implies the transmigration of a soul and its invariable material rebirth
Buddhism denies the existence of an unchanging or eternal soul created by a God or emanating from a Divine Essence
If the immortal soul which is supposed to be the essence of man is eternal there cannot be either a rise or a fall
Besides one cannot understand why different souls are so variously constituted at the outset
To prove the existence of endless felicity in an eternal heaven and unending torments in an eternal hell an immortal soul is absolutely necessary
Otherwise what is it that is punished in hell or rewarded in heaven
It should be said writes Bertrand Russell that the old distinction between soul and body has evaporated quite as much because 'matter' has lost its solidity as mind has lost its spirituality
Psychology is just beginning to be scientific
In the present state of psychology belief in immortality can at any rate claim no support from science
Buddhists do agree with Russell when he says there is obviously some reason in which I am the same person as I was yesterday and to take an even more obvious example if I simultaneously see a man and hear him speaking there is some sense in which the 'I' that sees is the same as the 'I' that hears
Till recently scientists believed in an indivisible and indestructible atom
For sufficient reasons physicists have reduced this atom to a series of events
For equally good reasons psychologists find that mind has not the identity of a single continuing thing but is a series of occurrences bound together by certain intimate relations
The question of immortality therefore has become the question whether these intimate relations exist between occurrences connected with a living body and other occurrence which take place after that body is dead
As CEM
Joad says in The Meaning of Life matter has since disintegrated under our very eyes
It is no longer solid it is no longer enduring it is no longer determined by compulsive causal laws and more important than all it is no longer known
The socalled atoms it seems are both divisible and destructible The electrons and protons that compose atoms can meet and annihilate one another while their persistence such as it is is rather that of a wave lacking fixed boundaries and in process of continual change both as regards shape and position than that of a thing
Bishop Berkeley who showed that this socalled atom is a metaphysical fiction held that there exists a spiritual substance called the soul
Hume for instance looked into consciousness and perceived hat there was nothing except fleeting mental states and concluded that the supposed permanent ego is nonexistent
There are some philosophers he says who imagine we are every moment conscious of what we call 'ourself' that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence and so we are certain both of its perfect identity and simplicity
For my part when I enter most intimately into what I call 'myself' I always stumble on some particular perception or other  of heat or cold light or shade love or hatred pain or pleasure
I never catch myself and never can observe anything but the perception nor do I conceive what is further requisite to make me a perfect nonentity
Bergson says All consciousness is time existence and a conscious state is not a state that endures without changing
It is a change without ceasing when change ceases it ceases it is itself nothing but change
Dealing with this question of soul Prof
James says  The soultheory is a complete superfluity so far as accounting for the actually verified facts of conscious experience goes
So far no one can be compelled to subscribe to it for definite scientific reasons In concluding his interesting chapter on the soul he says And in this book the provisional solution which we have reached must be the final word the thoughts themselves are the thinkers
Watson a distinguished psychologist states No one has ever touched a soul or has seen one in a test tube or has in any way come into relationship with it as he has with the other objects of his daily experience
Nevertheless to doubt its existence is to become a heretic and once might possibly even had led to the loss of one's head
Even today a man holding a public position dare not question it
The Buddha anticipated these facts some years ago
According to Buddhism mind is nothing but a complex compound of fleeting mental states
One unit of consciousness consists of three phases  arising or genesis static or development and cessation or dissolution
Immediately after the cessation stage of a thought moment there occurs the genesis stage of the subsequent thoughtmoment
Each momentary consciousness of this everchanging lifeprocess on passing away transmits its whole energy all the indelibly recorded impressions to its successor
Every fresh consciousness consists of the potentialities of its predecessors together with something more
There is therefore a continuous flow of consciousness like a stream without any interruption
The subsequent thought moment is neither absolutely the same as its predecessor  since that which goes to make it up is not identical  nor entirely another  being the same continuity of Kamma energy
Here there is no identical being but there is an identity in process
Every moment there is birth every moment there is death
The arising of one thoughtmoment means the passing away of another thoughtmoment and vice versa
In the course of one lifetime there is momentary rebirth without a soul
It must not be understood that a consciousness is chopped up in bits and joined together like a train or a chain
But on the contrary it persistently flows on like a river receiving from the tributary streams of sense constant accretions to its flood and ever dispensing to the world without the thoughtstuff it has gathered by the way It has birth for its source and death for its mouth
The rapidity of the flow is such that hardly is there any standard whereby it can be measured even approximately
However it pleases the commentators to say that the time duration of one thoughtmoment is even less than onebillionth part of the time occupied by a flash of lightning
Here we find a juxtaposition of such fleeting mental states of consciousness opposed to a superposition of such states as some appear to believe
No state once gone ever recurs nor is identical with what goes before
But we worldlings veiled by the web of illusion mistake this apparent continuity to be something eternal and go to the extent of introducing an unchanging soul an Atta the supposed doer and receptacle of all actions to this everchanging consciousness
The socalled being is like a flash of lightning that is resolved into a succession of sparks that follow upon one another with such rapidity that the human retina cannot perceive them separately nor can the uninstructed conceive of such succession of separate sparks As the wheel of a cart rests on the ground at one point so does the being live only for one thoughtmoment
It is always in the present and is ever slipping into the irrevocable past
What we shall become is determined by this present thoughtmoment
If there is no soul what is it that is reborn one might ask
Well there is nothing to be reborn
When life ceases the Kammic energy rematerializes itself in another form
As Bhikkhu Silacara says Unseen it passes whithersoever the conditions appropriate to its visible manifestation are present
Here showing itself as a tiny gnat or worm there making its presence known in the dazzling magnificence of a Deva or an Archangel's existence
When one mode of its manifestation ceases it merely passes on and where suitable circumstances offer reveals itself afresh in another name or form
Birth is the arising of the psychophysical phenomena
Death is merely the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon
Just as the arising of a physical state is conditioned by a preceding state as its cause so the appearance of psychophysical phenomena is conditioned by cause anterior to its birth
As the process of one lifespan is possible without a permanent entity passing from one thoughtmoment to another so a series of lifeprocesses is possible without an immortal soul to transmigrate from one existence to another
Buddhism does not totally deny the existence of a personality in an empirical sense
It only attempts to show that it does not exist in an ultimate sense
The Buddhist philosophical term for an individual is Santana ie a flux or a continuity
It includes the mental and physical elements as well
The Kammic force of each individual binds the elements together
This uninterrupted flux or continuity of psychophysical phenomenon which is conditioned by Kamma and not limited only to the present life but having its source in the beginningless past and its continuation in the future  is the Buddhist substitute for the permanent ego or the immortal soul of other religions
This process of birth and death continues ad infinitum until this flux is transmuted so to say to Nibbanadhatu the ultimate goal of Buddhists
The Pali word Nibbana is formed of Ni and Vana
Ni is a negative particle and Vana means lusting or craving
It is called Nibbana in that it is a departure from the craving which is called Vana lusting Literally Nibbana means nonattachment
It may also be defined as the extinction of lust hatred and ignorance The whole world is in flames says the Buddha
By what fire is it kindled
By the fire of lust hatred and ignorance by the fire of birth old age death pain lamentation sorrow grief and despair it is kindled
It should not be understood that Nibbana is a state of nothingness or annihilation owing to the fact that we cannot perceive it with our worldly knowledge
One cannot say that there exists no light just because the blind man does not see it
In that well known story too the fish arguing with his friend the turtle triumphantly concluded that there exists no land
Nibbana of the Buddhists is neither a mere nothingness nor a state of annihilation but what it is no words can adequately express
Nibbana is a Dhamma which is unborn unoriginated uncreated and unformed Hence it is eternal desirable and happy
In Nibbana nothing is eternalized nor is anything annihilated besides suffering
According to the Books references are made to Nibbana as Sopadisesa and Anupadisesa
These in fact are not two kinds of Nibbana but the one single Nibbana receiving its name according to the way it is experienced before and after death
Nibbana is not situated in any place nor is it a sort of heaven where a transcendental ego resides
It is a state which is dependent upon this body itself
It is an attainment which is within the reach of all
Nibbana is a supramundane state attainable even in this present life
Buddhism does not state that this ultimate goal could be reached only in a life beyond
Here lies the chief difference between the Buddhist conception of Nibbana and the nonBuddhist conception of an eternal heaven attainable only after death or a union with a God or Divine Essence in an afterlife
When Nibbana is realized in this life with the body remaining it is called Sopadisesa Nibbanadhatu
When an arahant attains Parinibbana after the dissolution of his body without any remainder of physical existence it is called Anupadisesa Nibbanadhatu
In the words of Sir Edwin Arnold
From a metaphysical standpoint Nibbana is deliverance from suffering
From a psychological standpoint Nibbana is the eradication of egoism
From an ethical standpoint Nibbana is the destruction of lust hatred and ignorance
Does the arahant exist or not after death
The Buddha replies
The arahant who has been released from the five aggregates is deep immeasurable like the mighty ocean
To say that he is reborn would not fit the case
To say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case
One cannot say that an arahant is reborn as all passions that condition rebirth are eradicated nor can one say that the arahant is annihilated for there is nothing to annihilate
Robert Oppenheimer a scientist writes
If we ask for instance whether the position of the electron remains the same we must say 'no' if we ask whether the electron's position changes with time we must say 'no' if we ask whether the electron is at rest we must say 'no' if we ask whether it is in motion we must say 'no'
The Buddha has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of man's self after death but they are not familiar answers from the tradition of the th and th century science
How is Nibbana to be attained
It is by following the Noble Eightfold Path which consists of Right Understanding Right Thoughts Right Speech Right Actions Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration
Right Understanding which is the keynote of Buddhism is explained as the knowledge of the four Noble Truths
To understand rightly means to understand things as they really are and not as they appear to be
This refers primarily to a correct understanding of oneself because as the Rohitassa Sutta states Dependent on this onefathom long body with its consciousness are all the four Truths
In the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path Right Understanding stands at the beginning as well as at its end
A minimum degree of Right Understanding is necessary at the very beginning because it gives the right motivations to the other seven factors of the Path and gives to them correct direction
At the culmination of the practice Right Understanding has matured into perfect Insight Wisdom leading directly to the Stages of Sainthood
Clear vision of right understanding leads to clear thinking
The second factor of the Noble Eightfold Path is therefore Right Thoughts which serves the double purpose of eliminating evil thoughts and developing pure thoughts
Right Thoughts in this particular connection are three fold
They consist of
Right Thoughts lead to Right Speech the third factor
This includes abstinence from falsehood slandering harsh words and frivolous talk
Right Speech must be followed by Right Action which comprises abstinence from killing stealing and sexual misconduct
Purifying his thoughts words and deeds at the outset the spiritual pilgrim tries to purify his livelihood by refraining from the five kinds of trade which are forbidden to a laydisciple
They are trading in arms human beings animals for slaughter intoxicating drinks and drugs and poisons
For monks wrong livelihood consists of hypocritical conduct and wrong means of obtaining the requisites of monklife
Right Effort is fourfold namely
Right Mindfulness is constant mindfulness with regard to body feelings thoughts and mindobjects
Right Effort and Right Mindfulness lead to Right Concentration
It is the onepointedness of mind culminating in the Jhanas or meditative absorptions
Of these eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path the first two are grouped under the heading of Wisdom the following three under Morality and the last three under Concentration
But according to the order of development the sequence is as follows
Morality is the first stage on this path to Nibbana
Without killing or causing injury to any living creature man should be kind and compassionate towards all even to the tiniest creature that crawls at his feet
Refraining from stealing he should be upright and honest in all his dealings
Abstaining from sexual misconduct which debases the exalted nature of man he should be pure
Shunning false speech he should be truthful
Avoiding pernicious drinks that promote heedlessness he should be sober and diligent
These elementary principles of regulated behavior are essential to one who treads the path to Nibbana
Violation of them means the introduction of obstacles on the path which will obstruct his moral progress
Observance of them means steady and smooth progress along the path
The spiritual pilgrim disciplining thus his words and deeds may advance a step further and try to control his senses
While he progresses slowly and steadily with regulated word and deed and restrained senses the Kammic force of this striving aspirant may compel him to renounce worldly pleasures and adopt the ascetic life
To him then comes the idea that
It should not be understood that everyone is expected to lead the life of a Bhikkhu or a celibate life to achieve one's goal
One's spiritual progress is expedited by being a Bhikkhu although as a lay follower one can become an arahant
After attaining the third state of Sainthood one leads a life of celibacy
Securing a firm footing on the ground of morality the progressing pilgrim then embarks upon the higher practice of Samadhi the control and culture of the mind  the second stage on this Path
Samadhi  is the onepointedness of the mind It is the concentration of the mind on one object to the entire exclusion of all irrelevant matter
There are different subjects for meditation according to the temperaments of the individuals
Concentration on respiration is the easiest to gain the onepointedness of the mind
Meditation on lovingkindness is very beneficial as it is conducive to mental peace and happiness
Cultivation of the four sublime states  lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity  is highly commendable
After giving careful consideration to the subject for contemplation he should choose the one most suited to his temperament
This being satisfactorily settled he makes a persistent effort to focus his mind until he becomes so wholly absorbed and interested in it that all other thoughts get ipso facto excluded from the mind
The five hindrances to progress  namely sensedesire hatred sloth and torpor restlessness and brooding and doubts are then temporarily inhibited
Eventually he gains ecstatic concentration and to his indescribable joy becomes enwrapt in Jhana enjoying the calmness and serenity of a onepointed mind
When one gains this perfect onepointedness of the mind it is possible for one to develop the five Supernormal Powers Divine Eye Divine Ear Reminiscence of past births
Thought Reading and different Psychic Powers
It must not be understood that those supernormal powers are essential for Sainthood
Though the mind is now purified there still lies dormant in him the tendency to give vent to his passions for by concentration passions are lulled to sleep temporarily
They may rise to the surface at unexpected moments
Both Discipline and Concentration are helpful to clear the Path of its obstacles but it is Insight alone which enables one to see things as they truly are and consequently reach the ultimate goal by completely annihilating the passions inhibited by Samadhi
This is the third and the final stage on the Path of Nibbana
With his onepointed mind which now resembles a polished mirror he looks at the world to get a correct view of life
Wherever he turns his eyes he sees nought but the Three Characteristics  Anicca Dukkha and anatta standing out in bold relief
He comprehends that life is constantly changing and all conditioned things are transient
Neither in heaven nor on earth does he find any genuine happiness for every form of pleasure is a prelude to pain
What is transient is therefore painful and where change and sorrow prevail there cannot be a permanent immortal soul
Whereupon of these three characteristics he chooses one that appeals to him most and intently keeps on developing Insight in that particular direction until that glorious day comes to him when he would realize Nibbana for the first time in his life having destroyed the three Fetters  selfillusion doubts indulgence in rites and ceremonies
At this stage he is called a Sotapanna  one who has entered the stream that leads to Nibbana
As he has not eradicated all Fetters he is reborn seven times at the most
Summoning up fresh courage as a result of this glimpse of Nibbana the Pilgrim makes rapid progress and cultivating deeper Insight becomes a Sakadagami by weakening two more Fetters  namely Sensedesire and illwill
He is called a Sakadagami because he is reborn on earth only once in case he does not attain Arhatship
It is in the third state of Sainthood  Anagama that he completely discards the aforesaid two Fetters
Thereafter he neither returns to this world nor does he seek birth in the celestial realms since he has no more desire for sensual pleasures
After death he is reborn in the Pure Abodes a congenial Brahma plane till he attains Arhatship
Now the saintly pilgrim encouraged by the unprecedented success of his endeavors makes his final advance and destroying the remaining Fetters  namely lust after life in Realms of Forms and Formless Realms conceit restlessness and ignorance  becomes a perfect Saint an arahant a Worthy One
Instantly he realizes that what was to be accomplished has been done that a heavy burden of sorrow has been relinquished that all forms of attachment have been totally annihilated and that the Path to Nibbana has been trodden
The Worthy One now stands on heights more than celestial far removed from the rebellious passions and defilements of the world realizing the unutterable bliss of Nibbana and like many an arahant of old uttering that paean of joy
As TH
Huxley states  Buddhism is a system which knows no God in the Western sense which denies a soul to man which counts the belief in immortality a blunder which refuses any efficacy to prayer and sacrifice which bids men to look to nothing but their own efforts for salvation which in its original purity knew nothing of vows of obedience and never sought the aid of the secular arm yet spread over a considerable moiety of the world with marvelous rapidity  and is still the dominant creed of a large fraction of mankind
Anapana Sati is mindfulness on respiration
Ana means inhalation and Apana exhalation
Concentration on the breathing process leads to onepointedness of the mind and ultimately to Insight which enables one to attain Sainthood or Arhatship
The Buddha also practiced concentration on respiration before He attained Enlightenment
This harmless concentration may be practiced by any person irrespective of religious beliefs
Adopting a convenient posture keep the body erect
Place the right hand over the left hand
Eyes may be closed or halfclosed
Easterners generally sit crosslegged with the body erect
They sit placing the right foot on the left thigh and the left foot on the right thigh
This is the full position
Sometimes they adopt the half position that is by simply placing the right foot on the left thigh or the left foot on the right thigh
When the triangular position is assumed the whole body is wellbalanced
Those who find the crosslegged posture too difficult may sit comfortably in a chair or any other support sufficiently high to rest the legs on the ground
It is of no importance which posture one may adopt provided the position is easy and relaxed
Head should not be drooping
Neck should be straightened so that the nose may be in a perpendicular line with the navel
Buddhas usually adopt the full lotus position
They sit with half closed eyes looking not more than a distance of three and half feet
Before the practice bad air from the lungs should be breathed out slowly through the mouth and then the mouth should be closed
Now inhale through the nostrils normally without strain without force
Mentally count one
Exhale and count two
Inhale and count three
Count up to ten constantly concentrating on the breathing process without thinking of anything else
While doing so one's mind may wander
But one need not be discouraged
Gradually one may increase the number of series  say five series of ten
Later one may inhale and pause for a moment concentrating merely on inhalation without counting
Exhale and pause for a moment
Thus inhale and exhale concentrating on respiration
Some prefer counting as it aide concentration while others prefer not to count
What is essential is concentration and not counting which is secondary
When one practices this concentration one feels very peaceful light in mind and body
After practicing for a certain period a day might come when one may realize that this socalled body is supported by mere breath and that body perishes when breathing ceases
One fully realizes impermanence
Where there is change there cannot be a permanent entity or an immortal soul
Insight can then be developed to attain Arhatship
It is clear that the object of this concentration on respiration is not merely to gain onepointedness but also to cultivate Insight to obtain deliverance from suffering
In some discourses this simple and harmless method of respiration is described as follows
Mindfully he inhales mindfully he exhales
When making a long inhalation he knows 'I make a long inhalation' when making a long exhalation he knows 'I make a long exhalation'
When making a short inhalation he knows ' I make a short inhalation' when making a short exhalation he knows 'I make a short exhalation'
Clearly perceiving the entire breathing process 'I will inhale thus he trains himself clearly perceiving the entire breathing process 'I will exhale' thus he trains himself
Calming the respiration 'I will inhale' thus he trains himself calming the respirations 'I will exhale' thus he trains himself

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The essence of the Buddha's teaching can be summed up in two principles the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path
The first covers the side of doctrine and the primary response it elicits is understanding the second covers the side of discipline in the broadest sense of that word and the primary response it calls for is practice
In the structure of the teaching these two principles lock together into an indivisible unity called the dhammavinaya the doctrineanddiscipline or in brief the Dhamma
The internal unity of the Dhamma is guaranteed by the fact that the last of the Four Noble Truths the truth of the way is the Noble Eightfold Path while the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path right view is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths
Thus the two principles penetrate and include one another the formula of the Four Noble Truths containing the Eightfold Path and the Noble Eightfold Path containing the Four Truths
Given this integral unity it would be pointless to pose the question which of the two aspects of the Dhamma has greater value the doctrine or the path
But if we did risk the pointless by asking that question the answer would have to be the path
The path claims primacy because it is precisely this that brings the teaching to life
The path translates the Dhamma from a collection of abstract formulas into a continually unfolding disclosure of truth
It gives an outlet from the problem of suffering with which the teaching starts
And it makes the teaching's goal liberation from suffering accessible to us in our own experience where alone it takes on authentic meaning
To follow the Noble Eightfold Path is a matter of practice rather than intellectual knowledge but to apply the path correctly it has to be properly understood
In fact right understanding of the path is itself a part of the practice
It is a facet of right view the first path factor the forerunner and guide for the rest of the path
Thus though initial enthusiasm might suggest that the task of intellectual comprehension may be shelved as a bothersome distraction mature consideration reveals it to be quite essential to ultimate success in the practice
The present book aims at contributing towards a proper understanding of the Noble Eightfold Path by investigating its eight factors and their components to determine exactly what they involve
I have attempted to be concise using as the framework for exposition the Buddha's own words in explanation of the path factors as found in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali canon
To assist the reader with limited access to primary sources even in translation I have tried to confine my selection of quotations as much as possible to those found in Venerable Nyanatiloka's classic anthology The Word of the Buddha
In some cases passages taken from that work have been slightly modified to accord with my own preferred renderings
For further amplification of meaning I have sometimes drawn upon the commentaries especially in my accounts of concentration and wisdom I have relied heavily on the Visuddhimagga a vast encyclopedic work which systematizes the practice of the path in a detailed and comprehensive manner
Limitations of space prevent an exhaustive treatment of each factor
To compensate for this deficiency I have included a list of recommended readings at the end which the reader may consult for more detailed explanations of individual path factors
For full commitment to the practice of the path however especially in its advanced stages of concentration and insight it will be extremely helpful to have contact with a properly qualified teacher
Textual references have been abbreviated as follows

are to the chapter and section number of the translation by Bhikkhu anamoli The Path of Purification 
The search for a spiritual path is born out of suffering
It does not start with lights and ecstasy but with the hard tacks of pain disappointment and confusion
However for suffering to give birth to a genuine spiritual search it must amount to more than something passively received from without
It has to trigger an inner realization a perception which pierces through the facile complacency of our usual encounter with the world to glimpse the insecurity perpetually gaping underfoot
When this insight dawns even if only momentarily it can precipitate a profound personal crisis
It overturns accustomed goals and values mocks our routine preoccupations leaves old enjoyments stubbornly unsatisfying
At first such changes generally are not welcome
We try to deny our vision and to smother our doubts we struggle to drive away the discontent with new pursuits
But the flame of inquiry once lit continues to burn and if we do not let ourselves be swept away by superficial readjustments or slouch back into a patched up version of our natural optimism eventually the original glimmering of insight will again flare up again confront us with our essential plight
It is precisely at that point with all escape routes blocked that we are ready to seek a way to bring our disquietude to an end
No longer can we continue to drift complacently through life driven blindly by our hunger for sense pleasures and by the pressure of prevailing social norms
A deeper reality beckons us we have heard the call of a more stable more authentic happiness and until we arrive at our destination we cannot rest content
But it is just then that we find ourselves facing a new difficulty
Once we come to recognize the need for a spiritual path we discover that spiritual teachings are by no means homogeneous and mutually compatible
When we browse through the shelves of humanity's spiritual heritage both ancient and contemporary we do not find a single tidy volume but a veritable bazaar of spiritual systems and disciplines each offering themselves to us as the highest the fastest the most powerful or the most profound solution to our quest for the Ultimate
Confronted with this melange we fall into confusion trying to size them up  to decide which is truly liberative a real solution to our needs and which is a sidetrack beset with hidden flaws
One approach to resolving this problem that is popular today is the eclectic one to pick and choose from the various traditions whatever seems amenable to our needs welding together different practices and techniques into a synthetic whole that is personally satisfying
Thus one may combine Buddhist mindfulness meditation with sessions of Hindu mantra recitation Christian prayer with Sufi dancing Jewish Kabbala with Tibetan visualization exercises
Eclecticism however though sometimes helpful in making a transition from a predominantly worldly and materialistic way of life to one that takes on a spiritual hue eventually wears thin
While it makes a comfortable halfway house it is not comfortable as a final vehicle
There are two interrelated flaws in eclecticism that account for its ultimate inadequacy
One is that eclecticism compromises the very traditions it draws upon
The great spiritual traditions themselves do not propose their disciplines as independent techniques that may be excised from their setting and freely recombined to enhance the felt quality of our lives
They present them rather as parts of an integral whole of a coherent vision regarding the fundamental nature of reality and the final goal of the spiritual quest
A spiritual tradition is not a shallow stream in which one can wet one's feet and then beat a quick retreat to the shore
It is a mighty tumultuous river which would rush through the entire landscape of one's life and if one truly wishes to travel on it one must be courageous enough to launch one's boat and head out for the depths
The second defect in eclecticism follows from the first
As spiritual practices are built upon visions regarding the nature of reality and the final good these visions are not mutually compatible
When we honestly examine the teachings of these traditions we will find that major differences in perspective reveal themselves to our sight differences which cannot be easily dismissed as alternative ways of saying the same thing
Rather they point to very different experiences constituting the supreme goal and the path that must be trodden to reach that goal
Hence because of the differences in perspectives and practices that the different spiritual traditions propose once we decide that we have outgrown eclecticism and feel that we are ready to make a serious commitment to one particular path we find ourselves confronted with the challenge of choosing a path that will lead us to true enlightenment and liberation
One cue to resolving this dilemma is to clarify to ourselves our fundamental aim to determine what we seek in a genuinely liberative path
If we reflect carefully it will become clear that the prime requirement is a way to the end of suffering
All problems ultimately can be reduced to the problem of suffering thus what we need is a way that will end this problem finally and completely
Both these qualifying words are important
The path has to lead to a complete end of suffering to an end of suffering in all its forms and to a final end of suffering to bring suffering to an irreversible stop
But here we run up against another question
How are we to find such a path  a path which has the capacity to lead us to the full and final end of suffering
Until we actually follow a path to its goal we cannot know with certainty where it leads and in order to follow a path to its goal we must place complete trust in the efficacy of the path
The pursuit of a spiritual path is not like selecting a new suit of clothes
To select a new suit one need only try on a number of suits inspect oneself in the mirror and select the suit in which one appears most attractive
The choice of a spiritual path is closer to marriage one wants a partner for life one whose companionship will prove as trustworthy and durable as the pole star in the night sky
Faced with this new dilemma we may think that we have reached a dead end and conclude that we have nothing to guide us but personal inclination if not a flip of the coin
However our selection need not be as blind and uninformed as we imagine for we do have a guideline to help us
Since spiritual paths are generally presented in the framework of a total teaching we can evaluate the effectiveness of any particular path by investigating the teaching which expounds it
In making this investigation we can look to three criteria as standards for evaluation
First the teaching has to give a full and accurate picture of the range of suffering
If the picture of suffering it gives is incomplete or defective then the path it sets forth will most likely be flawed unable to yield a satisfactory solution
Just as an ailing patient needs a doctor who can make a full and correct diagnosis of his illness so in seeking release from suffering we need a teaching that presents a reliable account of our condition
The second criterion calls for a correct analysis of the causes giving rise to suffering
The teaching cannot stop with a survey of the outward symptoms
It has to penetrate beneath the symptoms to the level of causes and to describe those causes accurately
If a teaching makes a faulty causal analysis there is little likelihood that its treatment will succeed
The third criterion pertains directly to the path itself
It stipulates that the path which the teaching offers has to remove suffering at its source
This means it must provide a method to cut off suffering by eradicating its causes
If it fails to bring about this rootlevel solution its value is ultimately nil
The path it prescribes might help to remove symptoms and make us feel that all is well but one afflicted with a fatal disease cannot afford to settle for cosmetic surgery when below the surface the cause of his malady continues to thrive
To sum up we find three requirements for a teaching proposing to offer a true path to the end of suffering first it has to set forth a full and accurate picture of the range of suffering second it must present a correct analysis of the causes of suffering and third it must give us the means to eradicate the causes of suffering
This is not the place to evaluate the various spiritual disciplines in terms of these criteria
Our concern is only with the Dhamma the teaching of the Buddha and with the solution this teaching offers to the problem of suffering
That the teaching should be relevant to this problem is evident from its very nature for it is formulated not as a set of doctrines about the origin and end of things commanding belief but as a message of deliverance from suffering claiming to be verifiable in our own experience
Along with that message there comes a method of practice a way leading to the end of suffering
This way is the Noble Eightfold Path
The Eightfold Path stands at the very heart of the Buddha's teaching
It was the discovery of the path that gave the Buddha's own enlightenment a universal significance and elevated him from the status of a wise and benevolent sage to that of a world teacher
To his own disciples he was preeminently the arouser of the path unarisen before the producer of the path not produced before the declarer of the path not declared before the knower of the path the seer of the path the guide along the path
And he himself invites the seeker with the promise and challenge You yourselves must strive
The Buddhas are only teachers
The meditative ones who practice the path are released from the bonds of evil
To see the Noble Eightfold Path as a viable vehicle to liberation we have to check it out against our three criteria to look at the Buddha's account of the range of suffering his analysis of its causes and the programme he offers as a remedy
The Buddha does not merely touch the problem of suffering tangentially he makes it rather the very cornerstone of his teaching
He starts the Four Noble Truths that sum up his message with the announcement that life is inseparably tied to something he calls dukkha
The Pali word is often translated as suffering but it means something deeper than pain and misery
It refers to a basic unsatisfactoriness running through our lives the lives of all but the enlightened
Sometimes this unsatisfactoriness erupts into the open as sorrow grief disappointment or despair but usually it hovers at the edge of our awareness as a vague unlocalized sense that things are never quite perfect never fully adequate to our expectations of what they should be
This fact of dukkha the Buddha says is the only real spiritual problem
The other problems  the theological and metaphysical questions that have taunted religious thinkers through the centuries  he gently waves aside as matters not tending to liberation What he teaches he says is just suffering and the ending of suffering dukkha and its cessation
The Buddha does not stop with generalities
He goes on to expose the different forms that dukkha takes both the evident and the subtle
He starts with what is close at hand with the suffering inherent in the physical process of life itself
Here dukkha shows up in the events of birth aging and death in our susceptibility to sickness accidents and injuries even in hunger and thirst
It appears again in our inner reactions to disagreeable situations and events in the sorrow anger frustration and fear aroused by painful separations by unpleasant encounters by the failure to get what we want
Even our pleasures the Buddha says are not immune from dukkha
They give us happiness while they last but they do not last forever eventually they must pass away and when they go the loss leaves us feeling deprived
Our lives for the most part are strung out between the thirst for pleasure and the fear of pain
We pass our days running after the one and running away from the other seldom enjoying the peace of contentment real satisfaction seems somehow always out of reach just beyond the next horizon
Then in the end we have to die to give up the identity we spent our whole life building to leave behind everything and everyone we love
But even death the Buddha teaches does not bring us to the end of dukkha for the life process does not stop with death
When life ends in one place with one body the mental continuum the individual stream of consciousness springs up again elsewhere with a new body as its physical support
Thus the cycle goes on over and over  birth aging and death  driven by the thirst for more existence
The Buddha declares that this round of rebirths  called samsara the wandering  has been turning through beginningless time
It is without a first point without temporal origin
No matter how far back in time we go we always find living beings  ourselves in previous lives  wandering from one state of existence to another
The Buddha describes various realms where rebirth can take place realms of torment the animal realm the human realm realms of celestial bliss
But none of these realms can offer a final refuge
Life in any plane must come to an end
It is impermanent and thus marked with that insecurity which is the deepest meaning of dukkha
For this reason one aspiring to the complete end of dukkha cannot rest content with any mundane achievement with any status but must win emancipation from the entire unstable whirl
A teaching proposing to lead to the end of suffering must as we said give a reliable account of its causal origination
For if we want to put a stop to suffering we have to stop it where it begins with its causes
To stop the causes requires a thorough knowledge of what they are and how they work thus the Buddha devotes a sizeable section of his teaching to laying bare the truth of the origin of dukkha The origin he locates within ourselves in a fundamental malady that permeates our being causing disorder in our own minds and vitiating our relationships with others and with the world
The sign of this malady can be seen in our proclivity to certain unwholesome mental states called in Pali kilesas usually translated defilements The most basic defilements are the triad of greed aversion and delusion
Greed is selfcentered desire the desire for pleasure and possessions the drive for survival the urge to bolster the sense of ego with power status and prestige
Aversion signifies the response of negation expressed as rejection irritation condemnation hatred enmity anger and violence
Delusion means mental darkness the thick coat of insensitivity which blocks out clear understanding
From these three roots emerge the various other defilements  conceit jealousy ambition lethargy arrogance and the rest  and from all these defilements together the roots and the branches comes dukkha in its diverse forms as pain and sorrow as fear and discontent as the aimless drifting through the round of birth and death
To gain freedom from suffering therefore we have to eliminate the defilements
But the work of removing the defilements has to proceed in a methodical way
It cannot be accomplished simply by an act of will by wanting them to go away
The work must be guided by investigation
We have to find out what the defilements depend upon and then see how it lies within our power to remove their support
The Buddha teaches that there is one defilement which gives rise to all the others one root which holds them all in place
This root is ignorance
Ignorance is not mere absence of knowledge a lack of knowing particular pieces of information
Ignorance can coexist with a vast accumulation of itemized knowledge and in its own way it can be tremendously shrewd and resourceful
As the basic root of dukkha ignorance is a fundamental darkness shrouding the mind
Sometimes this ignorance operates in a passive manner merely obscuring correct understanding
At other times it takes on an active role it becomes the great deceiver conjuring up a mass of distorted perceptions and conceptions which the mind grasps as attributes of the world unaware that they are its own deluded constructs
In these erroneous perceptions and ideas we find the soil that nurtures the defilements
The mind catches sight of some possibility of pleasure accepts it at face value and the result is greed
Our hunger for gratification is thwarted obstacles appear and up spring anger and aversion
Or we struggle over ambiguities our sight clouds and we become lost in delusion
With this we discover the breeding ground of dukkha ignorance issuing in the defilements the defilements issuing in suffering
As long as this causal matrix stands we are not yet beyond danger
We might still find pleasure and enjoyment  sense pleasures social pleasures pleasures of the mind and heart
But no matter how much pleasure we might experience no matter how successful we might be at dodging pain the basic problem remains at the core of our being and we continue to move within the bounds of dukkha
To free ourselves from suffering fully and finally we have to eliminate it by the root and that means to eliminate ignorance
But how does one go about eliminating ignorance
The answer follows clearly from the nature of the adversary
Since ignorance is a state of not knowing things as they really are what is needed is knowledge of things as they really are
Not merely conceptual knowledge knowledge as idea but perceptual knowledge a knowing which is also a seeing
This kind of knowing is called wisdom
Wisdom helps to correct the distorting work of ignorance
It enables us to grasp things as they are in actuality directly and immediately free from the screen of ideas views and assumptions our minds ordinarily set up between themselves and the real
To eliminate ignorance we need wisdom but how is wisdom to be acquired
As indubitable knowledge of the ultimate nature of things wisdom cannot be gained by mere learning by gathering and accumulating a battery of facts
However the Buddha says wisdom can be cultivated
It comes into being through a set of conditions conditions which we have the power to develop
These conditions are actually mental factors components of consciousness which fit together into a systematic structure that can be called a path in the word's essential meaning a courseway for movement leading to a goal
The goal here is the end of suffering and the path leading to it is the Noble Eightfold Path with its eight factors right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
The Buddha calls this path the middle way
It is the middle way because it steers clear of two extremes two misguided attempts to gain release from suffering
One is the extreme of indulgence in sense pleasures the attempt to extinguish dissatisfaction by gratifying desire
This approach gives pleasure but the enjoyment won is gross transitory and devoid of deep contentment
The Buddha recognized that sensual desire can exercise a tight grip over the minds of human beings and he was keenly aware of how ardently attached people become to the pleasures of the senses
But he also knew that this pleasure is far inferior to the happiness that arises from renunciation and therefore he repeatedly taught that the way to the Ultimate eventually requires the relinquishment of sensual desire
Thus the Buddha describes the indulgence in sense pleasures as low common worldly ignoble not leading to the goal
The other extreme is the practice of selfmortification the attempt to gain liberation by afflicting the body
This approach may stem from a genuine aspiration for deliverance but it works within the compass of a wrong assumption that renders the energy expended barren of results
The error is taking the body to be the cause of bondage when the real source of trouble lies in the mind  the mind obsessed by greed aversion and delusion
To rid the mind of these defilements the affliction of the body is not only useless but selfdefeating for it is the impairment of a necessary instrument
Thus the Buddha describes this second extreme as painful ignoble not leading to the goal
Aloof from these two extreme approaches is the Noble Eightfold Path called the middle way not in the sense that it effects a compromise between the extremes but in the sense that it transcends them both by avoiding the errors that each involves
The path avoids the extreme of sense indulgence by its recognition of the futility of desire and its stress on renunciation
Desire and sensuality far from being means to happiness are springs of suffering to be abandoned as the requisite of deliverance
But the practice of renunciation does not entail the tormenting of the body
It consists in mental training and for this the body must be fit a sturdy support for the inward work
Thus the body is to be looked after well kept in good health while the mental faculties are trained to generate the liberating wisdom
That is the middle way the Noble Eightfold Path which gives rise to vision gives rise to knowledge and leads to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
The eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path are not steps to be followed in sequence one after another
They can be more aptly described as components rather than as steps comparable to the intertwining strands of a single cable that requires the contributions of all the strands for maximum strength
With a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously each supporting the others
However until that point is reached some sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitable
Considered from the standpoint of practical training the eight path factors divide into three groups the moral discipline group made up of right speech right action and right livelihood the concentration group made up of right effort right mindfulness and right concentration and the wisdom group made up of right view and right intention
These three groups represent three stages of training the training in the higher moral discipline the training in the higher consciousness and the training in the higher wisdom
The order of the three trainings is determined by the overall aim and direction of the path
Since the final goal to which the path leads liberation from suffering depends ultimately on uprooting ignorance the climax of the path must be the training directly opposed to ignorance
This is the training in wisdom designed to awaken the faculty of penetrative understanding which sees things as they really are Wisdom unfolds by degrees but even the faintest flashes of insight presuppose as their basis a mind that has been concentrated cleared of disturbance and distraction
Concentration is achieved through the training in the higher consciousness the second division of the path which brings the calm and collectedness needed to develop wisdom
But in order for the mind to be unified in concentration a check must be placed on the unwholesome dispositions which ordinarily dominate its workings since these dispositions disperse the beam of attention and scatter it among a multitude of concerns
The unwholesome dispositions continue to rule as long as they are permitted to gain expression through the channels of body and speech as bodily and verbal deeds
Therefore at the very outset of training it is necessary to restrain the faculties of action to prevent them from becoming tools of the defilements
This task is accomplished by the first division of the path the training in moral discipline
Thus the path evolves through its three stages with moral discipline as the foundation for concentration concentration the foundation for wisdom and wisdom the direct instrument for reaching liberation
Perplexity sometimes arises over an apparent inconsistency in the arrangement of the path factors and the threefold training
Wisdom  which includes right view and right intention  is the last stage in the threefold training yet its factors are placed at the beginning of the path rather than at its end as might be expected according to the canon of strict consistency
The sequence of the path factors however is not the result of a careless slip but is determined by an important logistical consideration namely that right view and right intention of a preliminary type are called for at the outset as the spur for entering the threefold training
Right view provides the perspective for practice right intention the sense of direction
But the two do not expire in this preparatory role
For when the mind has been refined by the training in moral discipline and concentration it arrives at a superior right view and right intention which now form the proper training in the higher wisdom
Right view is the forerunner of the entire path the guide for all the other factors
It enables us to understand our starting point our destination and the successive landmarks to pass as practice advances
To attempt to engage in the practice without a foundation of right view is to risk getting lost in the futility of undirected movement
Doing so might be compared to wanting to drive someplace without consulting a roadmap or listening to the suggestions of an experienced driver
One might get into the car and start to drive but rather than approaching closer to one's destination one is more likely to move farther away from it
To arrive at the desired place one has to have some idea of its general direction and of the roads leading to it
Analogous considerations apply to the practice of the path which takes place in a framework of understanding established by right view
The importance of right view can be gauged from the fact that our perspectives on the crucial issues of reality and value have a bearing that goes beyond mere theoretical convictions
They govern our attitudes our actions our whole orientation to existence
Our views might not be clearly formulated in our mind we might have only a hazy conceptual grasp of our beliefs
But whether formulated or not expressed or maintained in silence these views have a farreaching influence
They structure our perceptions order our values crystallize into the ideational framework through which we interpret to ourselves the meaning of our being in the world
These views then condition action
They lie behind our choices and goals and our efforts to turn these goals from ideals into actuality
The actions themselves might determine consequences but the actions along with their consequences hinge on the views from which they spring
Since views imply an ontological commitment a decision on the question of what is real and true it follows that views divide into two classes right views and wrong views
The former correspond to what is real the latter deviate from the real and confirm the false in its place
These two different kinds of views the Buddha teaches lead to radically disparate lines of action and thence to opposite results
If we hold a wrong view even if that view is vague it will lead us towards courses of action that eventuate in suffering
On the other hand if we adopt a right view that view will steer us towards right action and thereby towards freedom from suffering
Though our conceptual orientation towards the world might seem innocuous and inconsequential when looked at closely it reveals itself to be the decisive determinant of our whole course of future development
The Buddha himself says that he sees no single factor so responsible for the arising of unwholesome states of mind as wrong view and no factor so helpful for the arising of wholesome states of mind as right view
Again he says that there is no single factor so responsible for the suffering of living beings as wrong view and no factor so potent in promoting the good of living beings as right view
In its fullest measure right view involves a correct understanding of the entire Dhamma or teaching of the Buddha and thus its scope is equal to the range of the Dhamma itself
But for practical purposes two kinds of right view stand out as primary
One is mundane right view right view which operates within the confines of the world
The other is supramundane right view the superior right view which leads to liberation from the world
The first is concerned with the laws governing material and spiritual progress within the round of becoming with the principles that lead to higher and lower states of existence to mundane happiness and suffering
The second is concerned with the principles essential to liberation
It does not aim merely at spiritual progress from life to life but at emancipation from the cycle of recurring lives and deaths
Mundane right view involves a correct grasp of the law of kamma the moral efficacy of action
Its literal name is right view of the ownership of action and it finds its standard formulation in the statement Beings are the owners of their actions the heirs of their actions they spring from their actions are bound to their actions and are supported by their actions
Whatever deeds they do good or bad of those they shall be heirs More specific formulations have also come down in the texts
One stock passage for example affirms that virtuous actions such as giving and offering alms have moral significance that good and bad deeds produce corresponding fruits that one has a duty to serve mother and father that there is rebirth and a world beyond the visible one and that religious teachers of high attainment can be found who expound the truth about the world on the basis of their own superior realization
To understand the implications of this form of right view we first have to examine the meaning of its key term kamma
The word kamma means action
For Buddhism the relevant kind of action is volitional action deeds expressive of morally determinate volition since it is volition that gives the action ethical significance
Thus the Buddha expressly identifies action with volition
In a discourse on the analysis of kamma he says Monks it is volition that I call action
Having willed one performs an action through body speech or mind The identification of kamma with volition makes kamma essentially a mental event a factor originating in the mind which seeks to actualize the mind's drives dispositions and purposes
Volition comes into being through any of three channels  body speech or mind  called the three doors of action
A volition expressed through the body is a bodily action a volition expressed through speech is a verbal action and a volition that issues in thoughts plans ideas and other mental states without gaining outer expression is a mental action
Thus the one factor of volition differentiates into three types of kamma according to the channel through which it becomes manifest
Right view requires more than a simple knowledge of the general meaning of kamma
It is also necessary to understand the ethical distinction of kamma into the unwholesome and the wholesome the principal cases of each type and the roots from which these actions spring
As expressed in a sutta When a noble disciple understands what is kammically unwholesome and the root of unwholesome kamma what is kammically wholesome and the root of wholesome kamma then he has right view
Taking these points in order we find that kamma is first distinguished as unwholesome and wholesome
Unwholesome kamma is action that is morally blameworthy detrimental to spiritual development and conducive to suffering for oneself and others
Wholesome kamma on the other hand is action that is morally commendable helpful to spiritual growth and productive of benefits for oneself and others
Innumerable instances of unwholesome and wholesome kamma can be cited but the Buddha selects ten of each as primary
These he calls the ten courses of unwholesome and wholesome action
Among the ten in the two sets three are bodily four are verbal and three are mental
The ten courses of unwholesome kamma may be listed as follows divided by way of their doors of expression
The ten courses of wholesome kamma are the opposites of these abstaining from the first seven courses of unwholesome kamma being free from covetousness and ill will and holding right view
Though the seven cases of abstinence are exercised entirely by the mind and do not necessarily entail overt action they are still designated wholesome bodily and verbal action because they center on the control of the faculties of body and speech
Actions are distinguished as wholesome and unwholesome on the basis of their underlying motives called roots which impart their moral quality to the volitions concomitant with themselves
Thus kamma is wholesome or unwholesome according to whether its roots are wholesome or unwholesome
The roots are threefold for each set
The unwholesome roots are the three defilements we already mentioned  greed aversion and delusion
Any action originating from these is an unwholesome kamma
The three wholesome roots are their opposites expressed negatively in the old Indian fashion as nongreed nonaversion and nondelusion
Though these are negatively designated they signify not merely the absence of defilements but the corresponding virtues
Nongreed implies renunciation detachment and generosity nonaversion implies lovingkindness sympathy and gentleness and nondelusion implies wisdom
Any action originating from these roots is a wholesome kamma
The most important feature of kamma is its capacity to produce results corresponding to the ethical quality of the action
An immanent universal law holds sway over volitional actions bringing it about that these actions issue in retributive consequences called vipaka ripenings or phala fruits The law connecting actions with their fruits works on the simple principle that unwholesome actions ripen in suffering wholesome actions in happiness
The ripening need not come right away it need not come in the present life at all
Kamma can operate across the succession of lifetimes it can even remain dormant for aeons into the future
But whenever we perform a volitional action the volition leaves its imprint on the mental continuum where it remains as a stored up potency
When the stored up kamma meets with conditions favorable to its maturation it awakens from its dormant state and triggers off some effect that brings due compensation for the original action
The ripening may take place in the present life in the next life or in some life subsequent to the next
A kamma may ripen by producing rebirth into the next existence thus determining the basic form of life or it may ripen in the course of a lifetime issuing in our varied experiences of happiness and pain success and failure progress and decline
But whenever it ripens and in whatever way the same principle invariably holds wholesome actions yield favorable results unwholesome actions yield unfavorable results
To recognize this principle is to hold right view of the mundane kind
This view at once excludes the multiple forms of wrong view with which it is incompatible
As it affirms that our actions have an influence on our destiny continuing into future lives it opposes the nihilistic view which regards this life as our only existence and holds that consciousness terminates with death
As it grounds the distinction between good and evil right and wrong in an objective universal principle it opposes the ethical subjectivism which asserts that good and evil are only postulations of personal opinion or means to social control
As it affirms that people can choose their actions freely within limits set by their conditions it opposes the hard deterministic line that our choices are always made subject to necessitation and hence that free volition is unreal and moral responsibility untenable
Some of the implications of the Buddha's teaching on the right view of kamma and its fruits run counter to popular trends in presentday thought and it is helpful to make these differences explicit
The teaching on right view makes it known that good and bad right and wrong transcend conventional opinions about what is good and bad what is right and wrong
An entire society may be predicated upon a confusion of correct moral values and even though everyone within that society may applaud one particular kind of action as right and condemn another kind as wrong this does not make them validly right and wrong
For the Buddha moral standards are objective and invariable
While the moral character of deeds is doubtlessly conditioned by the circumstances under which they are performed there are objective criteria of morality against which any action or any comprehensive moral code can be evaluated
This objective standard of morality is integral to the Dhamma the cosmic law of truth and righteousness
Its transpersonal ground of validation is the fact that deeds as expressions of the volitions that engender them produce consequences for the agent and that the correlations between deeds and their consequences are intrinsic to the volitions themselves
There is no divine judge standing above the cosmic process who assigns rewards and punishments
Nevertheless the deeds themselves through their inherent moral or immoral nature generate the appropriate results
For most people the vast majority the right view of kamma and its results is held out of confidence accepted on faith from an eminent spiritual teacher who proclaims the moral efficacy of action
But even when the principle of kamma is not personally seen it still remains a facet of right view
It is part and parcel of right view because right view is concerned with understanding  with understanding our place in the total scheme of things  and one who accepts the principle that our volitional actions possess a moral potency has to that extent grasped an important fact pertaining to the nature of our existence
However the right view of the kammic efficacy of action need not remain exclusively an article of belief screened behind an impenetrable barrier
It can become a matter of direct seeing
Through the attainment of certain states of deep concentration it is possible to develop a special faculty called the divine eye a supersensory power of vision that reveals things hidden from the eyes of flesh
When this faculty is developed it can be directed out upon the world of living beings to investigate the workings of the kammic law
With the special vision it confers one can then see for oneself with immediate perception how beings pass away and rearise according to their kamma how they meet happiness and suffering through the maturation of their good and evil deeds
The right view of kamma and its fruits provides a rationale for engaging in wholesome actions and attaining high status within the round of rebirths but by itself it does not lead to liberation
It is possible for someone to accept the law of kamma yet still limit his aims to mundane achievements
One's motive for performing noble deeds might be the accumulation of meritorious kamma leading to prosperity and success here and now a fortunate rebirth as a human being or the enjoyment of celestial bliss in the heavenly worlds
There is nothing within the logic of kammic causality to impel the urge to transcend the cycle of kamma and its fruit
The impulse to deliverance from the entire round of becoming depends upon the acquisition of a different and deeper perspective one which yields insight into the inherent defectiveness of all forms of samsaric existence even the most exalted
This superior right view leading to liberation is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths
It is this right view that figures as the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path in the proper sense as the noble right view
Thus the Buddha defines the path factor of right view expressly in terms of the four truths What now is right view
It is understanding of suffering understanding of the origin of suffering understanding of the cessation of suffering understanding of the way leading to the cessation to suffering The Eightfold Path starts with a conceptual understanding of the Four Noble Truths apprehended only obscurely through the media of thought and reflection
It reaches its climax in a direct intuition of those same truths penetrated with a clarity tantamount to enlightenment
Thus it can be said that the right view of the Four Noble Truths forms both the beginning and the culmination of the way to the end of suffering
The first noble truth is the truth of suffering the inherent unsatisfactoriness of existence revealed in the impermanence pain and perpetual incompleteness intrinsic to all forms of life
This is the noble truth of suffering
Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering association with the unpleasant is suffering separation from the pleasant is suffering not to get what one wants is suffering in brief the five aggregates of clinging are suffering
The last statement makes a comprehensive claim that calls for some attention
The five aggregates of clinging are a classificatory scheme for understanding the nature of our being
What we are the Buddha teaches is a set of five aggregates  material form feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness  all connected with clinging
We are the five and the five are us
Whatever we identify with whatever we hold to as our self falls within the set of five aggregates
Together these five aggregates generate the whole array of thoughts emotions ideas and dispositions in which we dwell our world Thus the Buddha's declaration that the five aggregates are dukkha in effect brings all experience our entire existence into the range of dukkha
But here the question arises Why should the Buddha say that the five aggregates are dukkha
The reason he says that the five aggregates are dukkha is that they are impermanent
They change from moment to moment arise and fall away without anything substantial behind them persisting through the change
Since the constituent factors of our being are always changing utterly devoid of a permanent core there is nothing we can cling to in them as a basis for security
There is only a constantly disintegrating flux which when clung to in the desire for permanence brings a plunge into suffering
The second noble truth points out the cause of dukkha
From the set of defilements which eventuate in suffering the Buddha singles out craving as the dominant and most pervasive cause the origin of suffering
This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering
It is this craving which produces repeated existence is bound up with delight and lust and seeks pleasure here and there namely craving for sense pleasures craving for existence and craving for nonexistence
The third noble truth simply reverses this relationship of origination
If craving is the cause of dukkha then to be free from dukkha we have to eliminate craving
Thus the Buddha says
This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering
It is the complete fading away and cessation of this craving its forsaking and abandonment liberation and detachment from it
The state of perfect peace that comes when craving is eliminated is Nibbana the unconditioned state experienced while alive with the extinguishing of the flames of greed aversion and delusion
The fourth noble truth shows the way to reach the end of dukkha the way to the realization of Nibbana
That way is the Noble Eightfold Path itself
The right view of the Four Noble Truths develops in two stages
The first is called the right view that accords with the truths the second the right view that penetrates the truths
To acquire the right view that accords with the truths requires a clear understanding of their meaning and significance in our lives
Such an understanding arises first by learning the truths and studying them
Subsequently it is deepened by reflecting upon them in the light of experience until one gains a strong conviction as to their veracity
But even at this point the truths have not been penetrated and thus the understanding achieved is still defective a matter of concept rather than perception
To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation  first to strengthen the capacity for sustained concentration then to develop insight
Insight arises by contemplating the five aggregates the factors of existence in order to discern their real characteristics
At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye turns away from the conditioned phenomena comprised in the aggregates and shifts its focus to the unconditioned state Nibbana which becomes accessible through the deepened faculty of insight
With this shift when the mind's eye sees Nibbana there takes place a simultaneous penetration of all Four Noble Truths
By seeing Nibbana the state beyond dukkha one gains a perspective from which to view the five aggregates and see that they are dukkha simply because they are conditioned subject to ceaseless change
At the same moment Nibbana is realized craving stops the understanding then dawns that craving is the true origin of dukkha
When Nibbana is seen it is realized to be the state of peace free from the turmoil of becoming
And because this experience has been reached by practicing the Noble Eightfold Path one knows for oneself that the Noble Eightfold Path is truly the way to the end of dukkha
This right view that penetrates the Four Noble Truths comes at the end of the path not at the beginning
We have to start with the right view conforming to the truths acquired through learning and fortified through reflection
This view inspires us to take up the practice to embark on the threefold training in moral discipline concentration and wisdom
When the training matures the eye of wisdom opens by itself penetrating the truths and freeing the mind from bondage
The second factor of the path is called in Pali samma sankappa which we will translate as right intention The term is sometimes translated as right thought a rendering that can be accepted if we add the proviso that in the present context the word thought refers specifically to the purposive or conative aspect of mental activity the cognitive aspect being covered by the first factor right view
It would be artificial however to insist too strongly on the division between these two functions
From the Buddhist perspective the cognitive and purposive sides of the mind do not remain isolated in separate compartments but intertwine and interact in close correlation
Emotional predilections influence views and views determine predilections
Thus a penetrating view of the nature of existence gained through deep reflection and validated through investigation brings with it a restructuring of values which sets the mind moving towards goals commensurate with the new vision
The application of mind needed to achieve those goals is what is meant by right intention
The Buddha explains right intention as threefold the intention of renunciation the intention of good will and the intention of harmlessness
The three are opposed to three parallel kinds of wrong intention intention governed by desire intention governed by ill will and intention governed by harmfulness
Each kind of right intention counters the corresponding kind of wrong intention
The intention of renunciation counters the intention of desire the intention of good will counters the intention of ill will and the intention of harmlessness counters the intention of harmfulness
The Buddha discovered this twofold division of thought in the period prior to his Enlightenment
While he was striving for deliverance meditating in the forest he found that his thoughts could be distributed into two different classes
In one he put thoughts of desire ill will and harmfulness in the other thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness
Whenever he noticed thoughts of the first kind arise in him he understood that those thoughts lead to harm for oneself and others obstruct wisdom and lead away from Nibbana
Reflecting in this way he expelled such thoughts from his mind and brought them to an end
But whenever thoughts of the second kind arose he understood those thoughts to be beneficial conducive to the growth of wisdom aids to the attainment of Nibbana
Thus he strengthened those thoughts and brought them to completion
Right intention claims the second place in the path between right view and the triad of moral factors that begins with right speech because the mind's intentional function forms the crucial link connecting our cognitive perspective with our modes of active engagement in the world
On the one side actions always point back to the thoughts from which they spring
Thought is the forerunner of action directing body and speech stirring them into activity using them as its instruments for expressing its aims and ideals
These aims and ideals our intentions in turn point back a further step to the prevailing views
When wrong views prevail the outcome is wrong intention giving rise to unwholesome actions
Thus one who denies the moral efficacy of action and measures achievement in terms of gain and status will aspire to nothing but gain and status using whatever means he can to acquire them
When such pursuits become widespread the result is suffering the tremendous suffering of individuals social groups and nations out to gain wealth position and power without regard for consequences
The cause for the endless competition conflict injustice and oppression does not lie outside the mind
These are all just manifestations of intentions outcroppings of thoughts driven by greed by hatred by delusion
But when the intentions are right the actions will be right and for the intentions to be right the surest guarantee is right views
One who recognizes the law of kamma that actions bring retributive consequences will frame his pursuits to accord with this law thus his actions expressive of his intentions will conform to the canons of right conduct
The Buddha succinctly sums up the matter when he says that for a person who holds a wrong view his deeds words plans and purposes grounded in that view will lead to suffering while for a person who holds right view his deeds words plans and purposes grounded in that view will lead to happiness
Since the most important formulation of right view is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths it follows that this view should be in some way determinative of the content of right intention
This we find to be in fact the case
Understanding the four truths in relation to one's own life gives rise to the intention of renunciation understanding them in relation to other beings gives rise to the other two right intentions
When we see how our own lives are pervaded by dukkha and how this dukkha derives from craving the mind inclines to renunciation  to abandoning craving and the objects to which it binds us
Then when we apply the truths in an analogous way to other living beings the contemplation nurtures the growth of good will and harmlessness
We see that like ourselves all other living beings want to be happy and again that like ourselves they are subject to suffering
The consideration that all beings seek happiness causes thoughts of good will to arise  the loving wish that they be well happy and peaceful
The consideration that beings are exposed to suffering causes thoughts of harmlessness to arise  the compassionate wish that they be free from suffering
The moment the cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path begins the factors of right view and right intention together start to counteract the three unwholesome roots
Delusion the primary cognitive defilement is opposed by right view the nascent seed of wisdom
The complete eradication of delusion will only take place when right view is developed to the stage of full realization but every flickering of correct understanding contributes to its eventual destruction
The other two roots being emotive defilements require opposition through the redirecting of intention and thus meet their antidotes in thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness
Since greed and aversion are deeply grounded they do not yield easily however the work of overcoming them is not impossible if an effective strategy is employed
The path devised by the Buddha makes use of an indirect approach it proceeds by tackling the thoughts to which these defilements give rise
Greed and aversion surface in the form of thoughts and thus can be eroded by a process of thought substitution by replacing them with the thoughts opposed to them
The intention of renunciation provides the remedy to greed
Greed comes to manifestation in thoughts of desire  as sensual acquisitive and possessive thoughts
Thoughts of renunciation spring from the wholesome root of nongreed which they activate whenever they are cultivated
Since contrary thoughts cannot coexist when thoughts of renunciation are roused they dislodge thoughts of desire thus causing nongreed to replace greed
Similarly the intentions of good will and harmlessness offer the antidote to aversion
Aversion comes to manifestation either in thoughts of ill will  as angry hostile or resentful thoughts or in thoughts of harming  as the impulses to cruelty aggression and destruction
Thoughts of good will counter the former outflow of aversion thoughts of harmlessness the latter outflow in this way excising the unwholesome root of aversion itself
The Buddha describes his teaching as running contrary to the way of the world
The way of the world is the way of desire and the unenlightened who follow this way flow with the current of desire seeking happiness by pursuing the objects in which they imagine they will find fulfillment
The Buddha's message of renunciation states exactly the opposite the pull of desire is to be resisted and eventually abandoned
Desire is to be abandoned not because it is morally evil but because it is a root of suffering
Thus renunciation turning away from craving and its drive for gratification becomes the key to happiness to freedom from the hold of attachment
The Buddha does not demand that everyone leave the household life for the monastery or ask his followers to discard all sense enjoyments on the spot
The degree to which a person renounces depends on his or her disposition and situation
But what remains as a guiding principle is this that the attainment of deliverance requires the complete eradication of craving and progress along the path is accelerated to the extent that one overcomes craving
Breaking free from domination by desire may not be easy but the difficulty does not abrogate the necessity
Since craving is the origin of dukkha putting an end to dukkha depends on eliminating craving and that involves directing the mind to renunciation
But it is just at this point when one tries to let go of attachment that one encounters a powerful inner resistance
The mind does not want to relinquish its hold on the objects to which it has become attached
For such a long time it has been accustomed to gaining grasping and holding that it seems impossible to break these habits by an act of will
One might agree to the need for renunciation might want to leave attachment behind but when the call is actually sounded the mind recoils and continues to move in the grip of its desires
So the problem arises of how to break the shackles of desire
The Buddha does not offer as a solution the method of repression  the attempt to drive desire away with a mind full of fear and loathing
This approach does not resolve the problem but only pushes it below the surface where it continues to thrive
The tool the Buddha holds out to free the mind from desire is understanding
Real renunciation is not a matter of compelling ourselves to give up things still inwardly cherished but of changing our perspective on them so that they no longer bind us
When we understand the nature of desire when we investigate it closely with keen attention desire falls away by itself without need for struggle
To understand desire in such a way that we can loosen its hold we need to see that desire is invariably bound up with dukkha
The whole phenomenon of desire with its cycle of wanting and gratification hangs on our way of seeing things
We remain in bondage to desire because we see it as our means to happiness
If we can look at desire from a different angle its force will be abated resulting in the move towards renunciation
What is needed to alter perception is something called wise consideration
Just as perception influences thought so thought can influence perception
Our usual perceptions are tinged with unwise consideration
We ordinarily look only at the surfaces of things scan them in terms of our immediate interests and wants only rarely do we dig into the roots of our involvements or explore their longrange consequences
To set this straight calls for wise consideration looking into the hidden undertones to our actions exploring their results evaluating the worthiness of our goals
In this investigation our concern must not be with what is pleasant but with what is true
We have to be prepared and willing to discover what is true even at the cost of our comfort
For real security always lies on the side of truth not on the side of comfort
When desire is scrutinized closely we find that it is constantly shadowed by dukkha
Sometimes dukkha appears as pain or irritation often it lies low as a constant strain of discontent
But the two  desire and dukkha  are inseparable concomitants
We can confirm this for ourselves by considering the whole cycle of desire
At the moment desire springs up it creates in us a sense of lack the pain of want
To end this pain we struggle to fulfill the desire
If our effort fails we experience frustration disappointment sometimes despair
But even the pleasure of success is not unqualified
We worry that we might lose the ground we have gained
We feel driven to secure our position to safeguard our territory to gain more to rise higher to establish tighter controls
The demands of desire seem endless and each desire demands the eternal it wants the things we get to last forever
But all the objects of desire are impermanent
Whether it be wealth power position or other persons separation is inevitable and the pain that accompanies separation is proportional to the force of attachment strong attachment brings much suffering little attachment brings little suffering no attachment brings no suffering
Contemplating the dukkha inherent in desire is one way to incline the mind to renunciation
Another way is to contemplate directly the benefits flowing from renunciation
To move from desire to renunciation is not as might be imagined to move from happiness to grief from abundance to destitution
It is to pass from gross entangling pleasures to an exalted happiness and peace from a condition of servitude to one of selfmastery
Desire ultimately breeds fear and sorrow but renunciation gives fearlessness and joy
It promotes the accomplishment of all three stages of the threefold training it purifies conduct aids concentration and nourishes the seed of wisdom
The entire course of practice from start to finish can in fact be seen as an evolving process of renunciation culminating in Nibbana as the ultimate stage of relinquishment the relinquishing of all foundations of existence
When we methodically contemplate the dangers of desire and the benefits of renunciation gradually we steer our mind away from the domination of desire
Attachments are shed like the leaves of a tree naturally and spontaneously
The changes do not come suddenly but when there is persistent practice there is no doubt that they will come
Through repeated contemplation one thought knocks away another the intention of renunciation dislodges the intention of desire
The intention of good will opposes the intention of ill will thoughts governed by anger and aversion
As in the case of desire there are two ineffective ways of handling ill will
One is to yield to it to express the aversion by bodily or verbal action
This approach releases the tension helps drive the anger out of one's system but it also poses certain dangers
It breeds resentment provokes retaliation creates enemies poisons relationships and generates unwholesome kamma in the end the ill will does not leave the system after all but instead is driven down to a deeper level where it continues to vitiate one's thoughts and conduct
The other approach repression also fails to dispel the destructive force of ill will
It merely turns that force around and pushes it inward where it becomes transmogrified into selfcontempt chronic depression or a tendency to irrational outbursts of violence
The remedy the Buddha recommends to counteract ill will especially when the object is another person is a quality called in Pali metta
This word derives from another word meaning friend but metta signifies much more than ordinary friendliness
I prefer to translate it by the compound lovingkindness which best captures the intended sense an intense feeling of selfless love for other beings radiating outwards as a heartfelt concern for their wellbeing and happiness
Metta is not just sentimental good will nor is it a conscientious response to a moral imperative or divine command
It must become a deep inner feeling characterized by spontaneous warmth rather than by a sense of obligation
At its peak metta rises to the heights of a brahmavihara a divine dwelling a total way of being centered on the radiant wish for the welfare of all living beings
The kind of love implied by metta should be distinguished from sensual love as well as from the love involved in personal affection
The first is a form of craving necessarily selfdirected while the second still includes a degree of attachment we love a person because that person gives us pleasure belongs to our family or group or reinforces our own selfimage
Only rarely does the feeling of affection transcend all traces of egoreference and even then its scope is limited
It applies only to a certain person or group of people while excluding others
The love involved in metta in contrast does not hinge on particular relations to particular persons
Here the reference point of self is utterly omitted
We are concerned only with suffusing others with a mind of lovingkindness which ideally is to be developed into a universal state extended to all living beings without discriminations or reservations
The way to impart to metta this universal scope is to cultivate it as an exercise in meditation
Spontaneous feelings of good will occur too sporadically and are too limited in range to be relied on as the remedy for aversion
The idea of deliberately developing love has been criticized as contrived mechanical and calculated
Love it is said can only be genuine when it is spontaneous arisen without inner prompting or effort
But it is a Buddhist thesis that the mind cannot be commanded to love spontaneously it can only be shown the means to develop love and enjoined to practice accordingly
At first the means has to be employed with some deliberation but through practice the feeling of love becomes ingrained grafted onto the mind as a natural and spontaneous tendency
The method of development is mettabhavana the meditation on lovingkindness one of the most important kinds of Buddhist meditation
The meditation begins with the development of lovingkindness towards oneself
It is suggested that one take oneself as the first object of metta because true lovingkindness for others only becomes possible when one is able to feel genuine lovingkindness for oneself
Probably most of the anger and hostility we direct to others springs from negative attitudes we hold towards ourselves
When metta is directed inwards towards oneself it helps to melt down the hardened crust created by these negative attitudes permitting a fluid diffusion of kindness and sympathy outwards
Once one has learned to kindle the feeling of metta towards oneself the next step is to extend it to others
The extension of metta hinges on a shift in the sense of identity on expanding the sense of identity beyond its ordinary confines and learning to identify with others
The shift is purely psychological in method entirely free from theological and metaphysical postulates such as that of a universal self immanent in all beings
Instead it proceeds from a simple straightforward course of reflection which enables us to share the subjectivity of others and experience the world from the standpoint of their own inwardness
The procedure starts with oneself
If we look into our own mind we find that the basic urge of our being is the wish to be happy and free from suffering
Now as soon as we see this in ourselves we can immediately understand that all living beings share the same basic wish
All want to be well happy and secure
To develop metta towards others what is to be done is to imaginatively share their own innate wish for happiness
We use our own desire for happiness as the key experience this desire as the basic urge of others then come back to our own position and extend to them the wish that they may achieve their ultimate objective that they may be well and happy
The methodical radiation of metta is practiced first by directing metta to individuals representing certain groups
These groups are set in an order of progressive remoteness from oneself
The radiation begins with a dear person such as a parent or teacher then moves on to a friend then to a neutral person then finally to a hostile person
Though the types are defined by their relation to oneself the love to be developed is not based on that relation but on each person's common aspiration for happiness
With each individual one has to bring his image into focus and radiate the thought May he be well
May he be happy
May he be peaceful Only when one succeeds in generating a warm feeling of good will and kindness towards that person should one turn to the next
Once one gains some success with individuals one can then work with larger units
One can try developing metta towards all friends all neutral persons all hostile persons
Then metta can be widened by directional suffusion proceeding in the various directions  east south west north above below  then it can be extended to all beings without distinction
In the end one suffuses the entire world with a mind of lovingkindness vast sublime and immeasurable without enmity without aversion
The intention of harmlessness is thought guided by compassion aroused in opposition to cruel aggressive and violent thoughts
Compassion supplies the complement to lovingkindness
Whereas lovingkindness has the characteristic of wishing for the happiness and welfare of others compassion has the characteristic of wishing that others be free from suffering a wish to be extended without limits to all living beings
Like metta compassion arises by entering into the subjectivity of others by sharing their interiority in a deep and total way
It springs up by considering that all beings like ourselves wish to be free from suffering yet despite their wishes continue to be harassed by pain fear sorrow and other forms of dukkha
To develop compassion as a meditative exercise it is most effective to start with somebody who is actually undergoing suffering since this provides the natural object for compassion
One contemplates this person's suffering either directly or imaginatively then reflects that like oneself he also wants to be free from suffering
The thought should be repeated and contemplation continually exercised until a strong feeling of compassion swells up in the heart
Then using that feeling as a standard one turns to different individuals considers how they are each exposed to suffering and radiates the gentle feeling of compassion out to them
To increase the breadth and intensity of compassion it is helpful to contemplate the various sufferings to which living beings are susceptible
A useful guideline to this extension is provided by the first noble truth with its enumeration of the different aspects of dukkha
One contemplates beings as subject to old age then as subject to sickness then to death then to sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair and so forth
When a high level of success has been achieved in generating compassion by the contemplation of beings who are directly afflicted by suffering one can then move on to consider people who are presently enjoying happiness which they have acquired by immoral means
One might reflect that such people despite their superficial fortune are doubtlessly troubled deep within by the pangs of conscience
Even if they display no outward signs of inner distress one knows that they will eventually reap the bitter fruits of their evil deeds which will bring them intense suffering
Finally one can widen the scope of one's contemplation to include all living beings
One should contemplate all beings as subject to the universal suffering of samsara driven by their greed aversion and delusion through the round of repeated birth and death
If compassion is initially difficult to arouse towards beings who are total strangers one can strengthen it by reflecting on the Buddha's dictum that in this beginningless cycle of rebirths it is hard to find even a single being who has not at some time been one's own mother or father sister or brother son or daughter
To sum up we see that the three kinds of right intention  of renunciation good will and harmlessness  counteract the three wrong intentions of desire ill will and harmfulness
The importance of putting into practice the contemplations leading to the arising of these thoughts cannot be overemphasized
The contemplations have been taught as methods for cultivation not mere theoretical excursions
To develop the intention of renunciation we have to contemplate the suffering tied up with the quest for worldly enjoyment to develop the intention of good will we have to consider how all beings desire happiness to develop the intention of harmlessness we have to consider how all beings wish to be free from suffering
The unwholesome thought is like a rotten peg lodged in the mind the wholesome thought is like a new peg suitable to replace it
The actual contemplation functions as the hammer used to drive out the old peg with the new one
The work of driving in the new peg is practice  practicing again and again as often as is necessary to reach success
The Buddha gives us his assurance that the victory can be achieved
He says that whatever one reflects upon frequently becomes the inclination of the mind
If one frequently thinks sensual hostile or harmful thoughts desire ill will and harmfulness become the inclination of the mind
If one frequently thinks in the opposite way renunciation good will and harmlessness become the inclination of the mind
The direction we take always comes back to ourselves to the intentions we generate moment by moment in the course of our lives
The next three path factors  right speech right action and right livelihood  may be treated together as collectively they make up the first of the three divisions of the path the division of moral discipline
Though the principles laid down in this section restrain immoral actions and promote good conduct their ultimate purpose is not so much ethical as spiritual
They are not prescribed merely as guides to action but primarily as aids to mental purification
As a necessary measure for human wellbeing ethics has its own justification in the Buddha's teaching and its importance cannot be underrated
But in the special context of the Noble Eightfold Path ethical principles are subordinate to the path's governing goal final deliverance from suffering
Thus for the moral training to become a proper part of the path it has to be taken up under the tutelage of the first two factors right view and right intention and to lead beyond to the trainings in concentration and wisdom
Though the training in moral discipline is listed first among the three groups of practices it should not be regarded lightly
It is the foundation for the entire path essential for the success of the other trainings
The Buddha himself frequently urged his disciples to adhere to the rules of discipline seeing danger in the slightest fault One time when a monk approached the Buddha and asked for the training in brief the Buddha told him First establish yourself in the starting point of wholesome states that is in purified moral discipline and in right view
Then when your moral discipline is purified and your view straight you should practice the four foundations of mindfulness
The Pali word we have been translating as moral discipline sila appears in the texts with several overlapping meanings all connected with right conduct
In some contexts it means action conforming to moral principles in others the principles themselves in still others the virtuous qualities of character that result from the observance of moral principles
Sila in the sense of precepts or principles represents the formalistic side of the ethical training sila as virtue the animating spirit and sila as right conduct the expression of virtue in reallife situations
Often sila is formally defined as abstinence from unwholesome bodily and verbal action
This definition with its stress on outer action appears superficial
Other explanations however make up for the deficiency and reveal that there is more to sila than is evident at first glance
The Abhidhamma for example equates sila with the mental factors of abstinence  right speech right action and right livelihood  an equation which makes it clear that what is really being cultivated through the observance of moral precepts is the mind
Thus while the training in sila brings the public benefit of inhibiting socially detrimental actions it entails the personal benefit of mental purification preventing the defilements from dictating to us what lines of conduct we should follow
The English word morality and its derivatives suggest a sense of obligation and constraint quite foreign to the Buddhist conception of sila this connotation probably enters from the theistic background to Western ethics
Buddhism with its nontheistic framework grounds its ethics not on the notion of obedience but on that of harmony
In fact the commentaries explain the word sila by another word samadhana meaning harmony or coordination
The observance of sila leads to harmony at several levels  social psychological kammic and contemplative
At the social level the principles of sila help to establish harmonious interpersonal relations welding the mass of differently constituted members of society with their own private interests and goals into a cohesive social order in which conflict if not utterly eliminated is at least reduced
At the psychological level sila brings harmony to the mind protection from the inner split caused by guilt and remorse over moral transgressions
At the kammic level the observance of sila ensures harmony with the cosmic law of kamma hence favorable results in the course of future movement through the round of repeated birth and death
And at the fourth level the contemplative sila helps establish the preliminary purification of mind to be completed in a deeper and more thorough way by the methodical development of serenity and insight
When briefly defined the factors of moral training are usually worded negatively in terms of abstinence
But there is more to sila than refraining from what is wrong
Each principle embedded in the precepts as we will see actually has two aspects both essential to the training as a whole
One is abstinence from the unwholesome the other commitment to the wholesome the former is called avoidance and the latter performance
At the outset of training the Buddha stresses the aspect of avoidance
He does so not because abstinence from the unwholesome is sufficient in itself but to establish the steps of practice in proper sequence
The steps are set out in their natural order in the famous dictum of the Dhammapada To abstain from all evil to cultivate the good and to purify one's mind  this is the teaching of the Buddhas
The other two steps  cultivating the good and purifying the mind  also receive their due but to ensure their success a resolve to avoid the unwholesome is a necessity
Without such a resolve the attempt to develop wholesome qualities is bound to issue in a warped and stunted pattern of growth
The training in moral discipline governs the two principal channels of outer action speech and body as well as another area of vital concern  one's way of earning a living
Thus the training contains three factors right speech right action and right livelihood
These we will now examine individually following the order in which they are set forth in the usual exposition of the path
The Buddha divides right speech into four components abstaining from false speech abstaining from slanderous speech abstaining from harsh speech and abstaining from idle chatter
Because the effects of speech are not as immediately evident as those of bodily action its importance and potential is easily overlooked
But a little reflection will show that speech and its offshoot the written word can have enormous consequences for good or for harm
In fact whereas for beings such as animals who live at the preverbal level physical action is of dominant concern for humans immersed in verbal communication speech gains the ascendency
Speech can break lives create enemies and start wars or it can give wisdom heal divisions and create peace
This has always been so yet in the modern age the positive and negative potentials of speech have been vastly multiplied by the tremendous increase in the means speed and range of communications
The capacity for verbal expression oral and written has often been regarded as the distinguishing mark of the human species
From this we can appreciate the need to make this capacity the means to human excellence rather than as too often has been the case the sign of human degradation
Abstaining from false speech 
Herein someone avoids false speech and abstains from it
He speaks the truth is devoted to truth reliable worthy of confidence not a deceiver of people
Being at a meeting or amongst people or in the midst of his relatives or in a society or in the king's court and called upon and asked as witness to tell what he knows he answers if he knows nothing I know nothing and if he knows he answers I know if he has seen nothing he answers I have seen nothing and if he has seen he answers I have seen Thus he never knowingly speaks a lie either for the sake of his own advantage or for the sake of another person's advantage or for the sake of any advantage whatsoever
This statement of the Buddha discloses both the negative and the positive sides to the precept
The negative side is abstaining from lying the positive side speaking the truth
The determinative factor behind the transgression is the intention to deceive
If one speaks something false believing it to be true there is no breach of the precept as the intention to deceive is absent
Though the deceptive intention is common to all cases of false speech lies can appear in different guises depending on the motivating root whether greed hatred or delusion
Greed as the chief motive results in the lie aimed at gaining some personal advantage for oneself or for those close to oneself  material wealth position respect or admiration
With hatred as the motive false speech takes the form of the malicious lie the lie intended to hurt and damage others
When delusion is the principal motive the result is a less pernicious type of falsehood the irrational lie the compulsive lie the interesting exaggeration lying for the sake of a joke
The Buddha's stricture against lying rests upon several reasons
For one thing lying is disruptive to social cohesion
People can live together in society only in an atmosphere of mutual trust where they have reason to believe that others will speak the truth by destroying the grounds for trust and inducing mass suspicion widespread lying becomes the harbinger signalling the fall from social solidarity to chaos
But lying has other consequences of a deeply personal nature at least equally disastrous
By their very nature lies tend to proliferate
Lying once and finding our word suspect we feel compelled to lie again to defend our credibility to paint a consistent picture of events
So the process repeats itself the lies stretch multiply and connect until they lock us into a cage of falsehoods from which it is difficult to escape
The lie is thus a miniature paradigm for the whole process of subjective illusion
In each case the selfassured creator sucked in by his own deceptions eventually winds up their victim
Such considerations probably lie behind the words of counsel the Buddha spoke to his son the young novice Rahula soon after the boy was ordained
One day the Buddha came to Rahula pointed to a bowl with a little bit of water in it and asked Rahula do you see this bit of water left in the bowl Rahula answered Yes sir So little Rahula is the spiritual achievement of one who is not afraid to speak a deliberate lie Then the Buddha threw the water away put the bowl down and said Do you see Rahula how that water has been discarded
In the same way one who tells a deliberate lie discards whatever spiritual achievement he has made Again he asked Do you see how this bowl is now empty
In the same way one who has no shame in speaking lies is empty of spiritual achievement Then the Buddha turned the bowl upside down and said Do you see Rahula how this bowl has been turned upside down
In the same way one who tells a deliberate lie turns his spiritual achievements upside down and becomes incapable of progress Therefore the Buddha concluded one should not speak a deliberate lie even in jest
It is said that in the course of his long training for enlightenment over many lives a bodhisatta can break all the moral precepts except the pledge to speak the truth
The reason for this is very profound and reveals that the commitment to truth has a significance transcending the domain of ethics and even mental purification taking us to the domains of knowledge and being
Truthful speech provides in the sphere of interpersonal communication a parallel to wisdom in the sphere of private understanding
The two are respectively the outward and inward modalities of the same commitment to what is real
Wisdom consists in the realization of truth and truth is not just a verbal proposition but the nature of things as they are
To realize truth our whole being has to be brought into accord with actuality with things as they are which requires that in communications with others we respect things as they are by speaking the truth
Truthful speech establishes a correspondence between our own inner being and the real nature of phenomena allowing wisdom to rise up and fathom their real nature
Thus much more than an ethical principle devotion to truthful speech is a matter of taking our stand on reality rather than illusion on the truth grasped by wisdom rather than the fantasies woven by desire
Abstaining from slanderous speech 
He avoids slanderous speech and abstains from it
What he has heard here he does not repeat there so as to cause dissension there and what he has heard there he does not repeat here so as to cause dissension here
Thus he unites those that are divided and those that are united he encourages
Concord gladdens him he delights and rejoices in concord and it is concord that he spreads by his words
Slanderous speech is speech intended to create enmity and division to alienate one person or group from another
The motive behind such speech is generally aversion resentment of a rival's success or virtues the intention to tear down others by verbal denigrations
Other motives may enter the picture as well the cruel intention of causing hurt to others the evil desire to win affection for oneself the perverse delight in seeing friends divided
Slanderous speech is one of the most serious moral transgressions
The root of hate makes the unwholesome kamma already heavy enough but since the action usually occurs after deliberation the negative force becomes even stronger because premeditation adds to its gravity
When the slanderous statement is false the two wrongs of falsehood and slander combine to produce an extremely powerful unwholesome kamma
The canonical texts record several cases in which the calumny of an innocent party led to an immediate rebirth in the plane of misery
The opposite of slander as the Buddha indicates is speech that promotes friendship and harmony
Such speech originates from a mind of lovingkindness and sympathy
It wins the trust and affection of others who feel they can confide in one without fear that their disclosures will be used against them
Beyond the obvious benefits that such speech brings in this present life it is said that abstaining from slander has as its kammic result the gain of a retinue of friends who can never be turned against one by the slanderous words of others
Abstaining from harsh speech
He avoids harsh language and abstains from it
He speaks such words as are gentle soothing to the ear loving such words as go to the heart and are courteous friendly and agreeable to many
Harsh speech is speech uttered in anger intended to cause the hearer pain
Such speech can assume different forms of which we might mention three
One is abusive speech scolding reviling or reproving another angrily with bitter words
A second is insult hurting another by ascribing to him some offensive quality which detracts from his dignity
A third is sarcasm speaking to someone in a way which ostensibly lauds him but with such a tone or twist of phrasing that the ironic intent becomes clear and causes pain
The main root of harsh speech is aversion assuming the form of anger
Since the defilement in this case tends to work impulsively without deliberation the transgression is less serious than slander and the kammic consequence generally less severe
Still harsh speech is an unwholesome action with disagreeable results for oneself and others both now and in the future so it has to be restrained
The ideal antidote is patience  learning to tolerate blame and criticism from others to sympathize with their shortcomings to respect differences in viewpoint to endure abuse without feeling compelled to retaliate
The Buddha calls for patience even under the most trying conditions
Even if monks robbers and murderers saw through your limbs and joints whosoever should give way to anger thereat would not be following my advice
For thus ought you to train yourselves Undisturbed shall our mind remain with heart full of love and free from any hidden malice and that person shall we penetrate with loving thoughts wide deep boundless freed from anger and hatred
Abstaining from idle chatter
He avoids idle chatter and abstains from it
He speaks at the right time in accordance with facts speaks what is useful speaks of the Dhamma and the discipline his speech is like a treasure uttered at the right moment accompanied by reason moderate and full of sense
Idle chatter is pointless talk speech that lacks purpose or depth
Such speech communicates nothing of value but only stirs up the defilements in one's own mind and in others
The Buddha advises that idle talk should be curbed and speech restricted as much as possible to matters of genuine importance
In the case of a monk the typical subject of the passage just quoted his words should be selective and concerned primarily with the Dhamma
Lay persons will have more need for affectionate small talk with friends and family polite conversation with acquaintances and talk in connection with their line of work
But even then they should be mindful not to let the conversation stray into pastures where the restless mind always eager for something sweet or spicy to feed on might find the chance to indulge its defiling propensities
The traditional exegesis of abstaining from idle chatter refers only to avoiding engagement in such talk oneself
But today it might be of value to give this factor a different slant made imperative by certain developments peculiar to our own time unknown in the days of the Buddha and the ancient commentators
This is avoiding exposure to the idle chatter constantly bombarding us through the new media of communication created by modern technology
An incredible array of devices  television radio newspapers pulp journals the cinema  turns out a continuous stream of needless information and distracting entertainment the net effect of which is to leave the mind passive vacant and sterile
All these developments naively accepted as progress threaten to blunt our aesthetic and spiritual sensitivities and deafen us to the higher call of the contemplative life
Serious aspirants on the path to liberation have to be extremely discerning in what they allow themselves to be exposed to
They would greatly serve their aspirations by including these sources of amusement and needless information in the category of idle chatter and making an effort to avoid them
Right action means refraining from unwholesome deeds that occur with the body as their natural means of expression
The pivotal element in this path factor is the mental factor of abstinence but because this abstinence applies to actions performed through the body it is called right action The Buddha mentions three components of right action abstaining from taking life abstaining from taking what is not given and abstaining from sexual misconduct
These we will briefly discuss in order
Abstaining from the taking of life 
Herein someone avoids the taking of life and abstains from it
Without stick or sword conscientious full of sympathy he is desirous of the welfare of all sentient beings
Abstaining from taking life has a wider application than simply refraining from killing other human beings
The precept enjoins abstaining from killing any sentient being
A sentient being is a living being endowed with mind or consciousness for practical purposes this means human beings animals and insects
Plants are not considered to be sentient beings though they exhibit some degree of sensitivity they lack fullfledged consciousness the defining attribute of a sentient being
The taking of life that is to be avoided is intentional killing the deliberate destruction of life of a being endowed with consciousness
The principle is grounded in the consideration that all beings love life and fear death that all seek happiness and are averse to pain
The essential determinant of transgression is the volition to kill issuing in an action that deprives a being of life
Suicide is also generally regarded as a violation but not accidental killing as the intention to destroy life is absent
The abstinence may be taken to apply to two kinds of action the primary and the secondary
The primary is the actual destruction of life the secondary is deliberately harming or torturing another being without killing it
While the Buddha's statement on noninjury is quite simple and straightforward later commentaries give a detailed analysis of the principle
A treatise from Thailand written by an erudite Thai patriarch collates a mass of earlier material into an especially thorough treatment which we shall briefly summarize here
The treatise points out that the taking of life may have varying degrees of moral weight entailing different consequences
The three primary variables governing moral weight are the object the motive and the effort
With regard to the object there is a difference in seriousness between killing a human being and killing an animal the former being kammically heavier since man has a more highly developed moral sense and greater spiritual potential than animals
Among human beings the degree of kammic weight depends on the qualities of the person killed and his relation to the killer thus killing a person of superior spiritual qualities or a personal benefactor such as a parent or a teacher is an especially grave act
The motive for killing also influences moral weight
Acts of killing can be driven by greed hatred or delusion
Of the three killing motivated by hatred is the most serious and the weight increases to the degree that the killing is premeditated
The force of effort involved also contributes the unwholesome kamma being proportional to the force and the strength of the defilements
The positive counterpart to abstaining from taking life as the Buddha indicates is the development of kindness and compassion for other beings
The disciple not only avoids destroying life he dwells with a heart full of sympathy desiring the welfare of all beings
The commitment to noninjury and concern for the welfare of others represent the practical application of the second path factor right intention in the form of good will and harmlessness
Abstaining from taking what is not given 
He avoids taking what is not given and abstains from it what another person possesses of goods and chattel in the village or in the wood that he does not take away with thievish intent
Taking what is not given means appropriating the rightful belongings of others with thievish intent
If one takes something that has no owner such as unclaimed stones wood or even gems extracted from the earth the act does not count as a violation even though these objects have not been given
But also implied as a transgression though not expressly stated is withholding from others what should rightfully be given to them
Commentaries mention a number of ways in which taking what is not given can be committed
Some of the most common may be enumerated
stealing taking the belongings of others secretly as in housebreaking pickpocketing etc
robbery taking what belongs to others openly by force or threats
snatching suddenly pulling away another's possession before he has time to resist
fraudulence gaining possession of another's belongings by falsely claiming them as one's own
deceitfulness using false weights and measures to cheat customers
The degree of moral weight that attaches to the action is determined by three factors the value of the object taken the qualities of the victim of the theft and the subjective state of the thief
Regarding the first moral weight is directly proportional to the value of the object
Regarding the second the weight varies according to the moral qualities of the deprived individual
Regarding the third acts of theft may be motivated either by greed or hatred
While greed is the most common cause hatred may also be responsible as when one person deprives another of his belongings not so much because he wants them for himself as because he wants to harm the latter
Between the two acts motivated by hatred are kammically heavier than acts motivated by sheer greed
The positive counterpart to abstaining from stealing is honesty which implies respect for the belongings of others and for their right to use their belongings as they wish
Another related virtue is contentment being satisfied with what one has without being inclined to increase one's wealth by unscrupulous means
The most eminent opposite virtue is generosity giving away one's own wealth and possessions in order to benefit others
Abstaining from sexual misconduct 
He avoids sexual misconduct and abstains from it
He has no intercourse with such persons as are still under the protection of father mother brother sister or relatives nor with married women nor with female convicts nor lastly with betrothed girls
The guiding purposes of this precept from the ethical standpoint are to protect marital relations from outside disruption and to promote trust and fidelity within the marital union
From the spiritual standpoint it helps curb the expansive tendency of sexual desire and thus is a step in the direction of renunciation which reaches its consummation in the observance of celibacy binding on monks and nuns
But for laypeople the precept enjoins abstaining from sexual relations with an illicit partner
The primary transgression is entering into full sexual union but all other sexual involvements of a less complete kind may be considered secondary infringements
The main question raised by the precept concerns who is to count as an illicit partner
The Buddha's statement defines the illicit partner from the perspective of the man but later treatises elaborate the matter for both sexes
For a man three kinds of women are considered illicit partners
A woman who is married to another man
This includes besides a woman already married to a man a woman who is not his legal wife but is generally recognized as his consort who lives with him or is kept by him or is in some way acknowledged as his partner
All these women are illicit partners for men other than their own husbands
This class would also include a woman engaged to another man
But a widow or divorced woman is not out of bounds provided she is not excluded for other reasons
A woman still under protection
This is a girl or woman who is under the protection of her mother father relatives or others rightfully entitled to be her guardians
This provision rules out elopements or secret marriages contrary to the wishes of the protecting party
