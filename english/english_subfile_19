Yet our desire impels us not to see this though impermanence stares us in the face from every single thing around
And it confronts us when we look within  mind and body arising and passing away
So don't turn on the TV go to the pictures read a book seize some food or a hundred other distractions just to avoid seeing this
This is the one thing really worth seeing for one who fully sees it in himself is Free

The Buddhist doctrine of anicca the transitoriness of all phenomena finds classical expression in the oftrecurrent formula Sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa and in the more popular statement Aniccaa vata sankhaaraa
Both these formulas amount to saying that all conditioned things or phenomenal processes mental as well as material that go to make up the samsaaric plane of existence are transient or impermanent
This law of impermanence is not the result of any kind of metaphysical inquiry or of any mystical intuition
It is a straightforward judgment arrived at by investigation and analysis and as such its basis is entirely empirical
It is in fact for the purpose of showing the insubstantiality and impermanence of the world of experience that Buddhism analyzes it into a multiplicity of basic factors
The earliest attempts at explaining this situation are represented in the analysis into five khandas twelve aayatanas and eighteen dhaatus
In the Abhidhamma we get the most detailed analysis into eighty one basic elements which are introduced by the technical term dhammaa
These are the basic factors into which the empiric individuality in relation to the external world is ultimately analyzed
They purport to show that there does not exist a unity substance atta or jiiva In the ultimate analysis the socalled unity is a complex of factors one is really many This applies to both mind and matter equally
In the case of living beings there is no soul or self which is immortal while in the case of things in general there is no essence which is everperduring
These basic factors according to Buddhism do not imply an absolute unity
They are not fractions of a whole but a number of coordinate ultimates
Although real they are not permanent
Nor are they mutually unconnected
As such they do not imply a theory of absolute separateness either
A good example of this kind of worldview is that of Pakudha Kaccaayana who seeks to explain the composition of the world with reference to seven eternally existing and mutually unconnected substances
This reduces the world to a concatenation of separate and discrete entities with no interconnection with no interdependence
The Buddhist view of existence does not amount to such an extreme for according to Buddhism the basic factors are interconnected with laws of causation and conditionality
Thus the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is based both on analysis and synthesis
It is through analysis that the empirical world is reduced to a multiplicity of basic factors and it is through causality that they are again synthesized
That existence does not consist of an eternal substance mental or material but is composed of a variety of constantly changing factors is the conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis into khandhas aayatanas dhaatus and dhammas
On the impermanence of the five khandhas that make up the empiric individuality we find this statement in the Samyuttanikaaya There is no materiality whatever O monks no feeling no perception no formations no consciousness whatever that is permanent everlasting eternal changeless identically abiding for ever Then the Blessed One took a bit of cowdung in his hand and he spoke to the monks Monks if even that much of permanent everlasting eternal changeless individual selfhood identically abiding for ever could be found then this living of a life of purity for the complete eradication of Ill would not be feasible
What is revolutionary about the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is that it is extended to include everything including consciousness which is usually taken to be permanent as the soul or as one of its qualities
The Majjhima Nikaaya records how Bhikkhu Saati misunderstood Buddha's teaching to mean that consciousness is a permanent entity which passes from one existence to another like the niraasraya vinnaana of the Upanisads
This led the Buddha to formulate the wellknown principle Annatra paccayaa natthi vinnaanassa sambhavo  There is no arising of consciousness without reference to a condition
This is further explained to mean that consciousness comes into being in dependence on a duality
What is that duality
It is eye which is impermanent changing becomingother and visible objects which are impermanent changing and becomingother such is the transient fugitive duality which is impermanent changing and becomingother
Eyeconsciousness too is impermanent
For how could eyeconsciousness arisen by depending on an impermanent condition be permanent
The coincidence concurrence and confluence of these three factors which is called contact and those other mental phenomena arising as a result are also impermanent

It is in view of the impermanence and insubstantiality of consciousness that Buddha has declared
Better were it bhikkhus that the uneducated manyfolk should conceive this fourelementmade body rather than citta to be soul
And why
The body is seen to persist for a year for two three four five ten or twenty years for a generation even for a hundred years or even for longer while that which is called consciousness that is mind that is intelligence arises as one thing ceases as another both by day and night
Because of its acceptance of this law of universal impermanence Buddhism stands in direct opposition to sassatavaada or eternalism which usually goes hand in hand with aatmavaada ie belief in some kind of immortal soul
The Brahmajaala Sutta of the Diighanikaaya alone refers to more than ten varieties of eternalism only to refute them as misconceptions of the true nature of the empirical world
But this refutation of eternalism does not lead to the acceptance on the part of Buddhism of the other extreme namely ucchedavaada or annihilationism which usually goes hand in hand with materialism
The Buddhist refutation of both these extremes finds classical expression in the following words of the Buddha
This world O Kaccaayana generally proceeds on a duality of the it is and the it is not But O Kaccaayana whoever perceives in truth and wisdom how things originate in the world for him there is no it is not in this world
Whoever Kaccaayana perceives in truth and wisdom how things pass away in the world for him there is no it is in this world
This statement of the Buddha refers to the duality of existence and nonexistence
These are the two theories of eternalism and annihilationism which find expression in many forms in various types of religion and philosophy
The former implies belief in a permanent and changeless substance or entity whether it is conceived as a plurality of individual souls as in Jainism or as a monistic worldsoul as in Vedaanta or as a deity of some kind as in most of the theistic religions
The latter on the other hand implies a belief in the temporary existence of separate souls or personalities which are entirely destroyed or dissolved after death
A good example of this kind of philosophy is the one advocated by Ajita Kesakambali which finds mention in the Saamannaphala Sutta
In contrast according to Buddhism everything is the product of antecedent causes and therefore of dependent origination
These causes themselves are not everlasting and static but simply antecedent aspects of the same ceaseless becoming
Every event is the result of a concatenation of dynamic processes
Neither Being nor nonBeing is the truth
There is only Becoming happening by way of cause continuity without identity persistence without a persistent substance
He who discerns origin by way of cause he discerns the Dhamma he who discerns the Dhamma he discerns origin by way of cause
Thus by accepting the theory of causation and conditionality Buddhism avoids the two extremes of sabbam atthi and sabbam natthi and advocates sabbam bhavati everything becomes ie happens by way of cause and effect
It is also because of this theory that Buddhism could avoid the two extremes of niyativaada and ahetuappaccayavaada
According to the former everything is absolutely predetermined according to the latter everything happens without reference to any cause or condition
According to both there is no room for free will and as such moral responsibility gets completely ruled out
By its theory of causation Buddhism avoids both extremes and establishes free will and moral responsibility
The second basic characteristic of the world of experience namely dukkha is but a logical corollary arising from this law of universal impermanence
For the impermanent nature of everything can but lead to one inescapable conclusion As everything is impermanent they cannot be made the basis of permanent happiness
Whatever is transient is by that very fact unsatisfactory  yad aniccam tam dukkham
Since every form of samsaaric existence is impermanent it is also characterized by unsatisfactoriness
Thus the premise sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa leads to the conclusion sabbe sankhaaraa dukkhaa
As indicative of a general characteristic of phenomena the term dukkha should not be understood in a narrower sense to mean only pain suffering misery or sorrow
As a philosophical term it has a wider connotation as wide as that of the term anicca
In this wider sense it includes deeper ideas such as imperfection unrest conflict in short unsatisfactoriness
This is precisely why even the states of jhaana resulting from the practice of higher meditation and which free from suffering as ordinarily understood are also included in dukkha
This is also why the characterization dukkha is extended even to matter
The Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa recognizes these wider implications of the term when it explains it as threefold namely dukkhadukkha viparinaamadukkha and sankhaaradukkha
As a direct and necessary corollary of this fact of dukkha we come to the third basic characteristic of all phenomena namely anatta which finds expression in the wellknown statement Sabbe dhammaa anattaa
For the unsatisfactory nature of everything should lead to this important conclusion If everything is characterized by unsatisfactoriness nothing can be identified as the self or as a permanent soul
What is dukkha is also anatta
What is not the self cannot be considered as I am as mine or as I am that
According to Buddhism the idea of self or soul is not only a false and imaginary belief with no corresponding objective reality but is also harmful from an ethical point of view
For it produces such harmful thoughts of I me and mine selfish desires attachments and all other unwholesome states of mind
It could also be a misery in disguise to one who accepts it as true
Do you see O bhikkhus such a soultheory in the acceptance of which there would not arise grief lamentation suffering distress and tribulation
Certainly not Sir
Good O bhikkhus I too O bhikkhus do not see a soultheory in the acceptance of which there would not arise grief lamentation suffering distress and tribulation
This brings into relief the close connection between the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence and Buddhist ethics If the world of experience is impermanent by that very fact it cannot be made the basis of permanent happiness
What is not permanent and therefore what is characterized by unsatisfactoriness cannot be considered as the self
And what is not the self cannot be considered as one's own or as a haven of security
For the things that one gets attached to are constantly changing
Hence attachment to them would only lead to unrest and sorrow
But when one knows things as they truly are ie as anicca dukkha and anatta one ceases to get agitated by them one ceases to take refuge in them
Just as attachment to things is to get fettered by them even so detachment from them is to get freed from them
Thus in the context of Buddhist ethics the perception of impermanence is only a preliminary step to the eradication of all cravings which in turn has the attainment of Nibbaana as its final goal
It will thus be seen that the Buddhist doctrine of anicca on which is also based the doctrine of dukkha and anatta can rightly be called the very foundation of the whole edifice of Buddhist philosophy and ethics
This explains why the Buddha has declared that the very perception of this fact namely that whatever comes into existence is also subject to dissolution is indeed the very arising of the stainless Eye of the Doctrine
The Buddhist doctrine of impermanence as explained in the canonical texts does really amount to a theory of momentariness in the sense that everything is in a state of constant flux
This becomes clear from a passage in the Anguttara Nikaaya where the three sankhatalakkhanas are explained
Here it is said that that which is sankhata has three fundamental characteristics namely uppaada vaya andthitassa annathatta
From this it follows that the Buddhist doctrine of change should not be understood in the ordinary sense that something arises exists for some time in a more or less static form and dissolves
On the contrary the third characteristic iethitassa annathatta shows that between its arising and cessation a thing is all the time changing with no static phase in between
Thus the Buddhist doctrine of change does really amount to a theory of universal flux
As far as the application of this theory of change is concerned there is nothing to suggest that early Buddhism had made any distinction between mind and matter
However some schools of Buddhism notably the Mahaasaanghikas Vaatsiiputriyas and Sammitiiyas while recognizing the momentary duration of mental elements assigned a relative permanence to matter
Others such as the Sarvaastivaadins Mahiisaasakas and Sautraantikas objected to introducing any such distinction and declared that all elements of existence mental as well as material are of momentary duration of instantaneous being
In the various schools of Buddhism the early Buddhist doctrine of change came to be explained on the basis of a formulated theory of moments
This theory is based on the three sankhatalakkhanas which we referred to earlier
It is in fact on the interpretation of the third sankhatalakkhana namelythitassa annathatta that the different schools of Buddhism differ widely as if to justify the very meaning conveyed by these two words
The Vaibhaasika School of Buddhism interpret sthityanyathaatva as jarataa postulate another characteristic called sthiti and thus increase the number of sankhatalakkhanas to four jaati sthitii jarataa anityataa
All elements mental as well as material characterised by them are samskrta
Only aakaasa and Nirvaana escape from their inexorable sway
At every moment all mental and material elements are affected by them
A moment is defined as the time during which the four characteristics accomplish their operation
The Vaibhaasikas also maintain that these characteristics are not only distinct from but also as real as the things which they characterize  showing thereby a strong predilection to naive realism
And in keeping with this theory it is also claimed that they are in turn characterized by secondary characteristics
The Sautraantika School of Buddhism does not agree with this interpretation of the Vaibhaasikas
In their view the four characteristics apply not to one but to a series of momentary elements The series itself is called sthiti its origin is called jaati its cessation is vyaya and the difference in its preceding and succeeding moments is called sthityanyathaatva
A momentary element so they argue cannot have a phase called sthiti or jarataa for whatever that originates has no time to subsist or decay but to perish
They also point out that these four characteristics are mere designations with no objective reality
They criticize the recognition of secondary characteristics on the ground that this would lead to the fallacy of infinite regress
For if the four characteristics require a set of secondary characteristics to account for their origination etc then these secondary characteristics will in turn require another set of secondary characteristics to account for their origination etc and in this manner the process could be stretched indefinitely
This problem does not arise  so runs the argument  if the characteristics are not recognized as real as the things they characterize
How the Theravaadins developed the doctrine of impermanence and how they interpreted the sankhatalakkhanas could be understood clearly when the subject is unfolded against this background
The most striking feature of the Theravada theory is that the fact of momentariness is explained in quite a different way Each dhamma has three moments namely uppaadakkhana the moment of originationthitikkhana the moment of subsistence and bhangakkhana the moment of cessation
These three moments do not correspond to three different dhammas
On the contrary they represent three phases  the nascent the static and cessant  of one momentary dhamma
Hence the statement that dhammas are momentary means that a given dhamma has three momentary phases or stages
It arises in the first moment subsists in the second moment and perishes in the third moment
Like the Sautraantikas the Theravaadins too accept the fact that a momentary dhamma has no phase called jarataa or decay
According to the argument of both schools the attribution of jarataa which implies some kind of change or transformation to a momentary dhamma is to accept parinaamavaada according to which the essence the substance remains the same while its modes undergo change
Change as it came to be finally defined in the schools of Buddhist logic is not the transformation of one and the same dhamma from one stage to another but the replacement of one momentary dhamma by another
The following argument in the Abhidharmakosa which is directed against the Vaibhaasikas who admit jarataa of one momentary dhamma clarifies this situation But how can you speak of jarataa or change in respect of one momentary dhamma
What is called jarataa or change is the transformation or dissimilarity between two stages
Is it possible to say that a dharma becomes different from itself
If it remains unchanged it cannot be another
If it is transformed it is not the same
Therefore the transformation of one dhamma is not possible
Hence the Sautraantikas and the Theravaadins apply the characteristic of jarataa only to a series of momentary dhammas
In their opinion what is called jarataa is the difference between the preceding and the succeeding moments of a series
There is however this difference to be noted Unlike the Sautraantikas the Theravaadins do not deny the static phase of a momentary dhamma
The Theravada argument in support of their accepting the static phase is as follows It is true that a dhamma that originates should also cease to exist
But before it could cease to exist there should be at least a moment when it turns towards its own cessation
It is this moment when a dhamma is facing its own cessation that we call the static phase
The logic of this argument is that a dhamma that arises cannot cease to exist at the same time for otherwise existence and nonexistence would become coexistent
One logical development of this theory of moments is the denial of motion
For if all the elements of existence are of momentary duration they have no time to move
In the case of momentary elements wherever appearance takes place there itself takes place disappearance
In keeping with this theory motion is given a new definition
According to this definition motion has to be understood not as the movement of one material element from one locus in space to another but as the appearance of momentary elements in adjacent locations creating a false picture of movement
The best example given in this case is the light of the lamp
The socalled light of the lamp it is argued is nothing but a common designation given to an uninterrupted production of a series of flashing points
When the production changes place one says that the light has changed
But in reality other flames have appeared in another place
According to the Theravada anicca is the first of what are often called in Buddhist literature the Three Characteristics or the General Characteristics
Anicca is usually treated as the basis for the other two though anattaa the third is sometimes founded on dukkha alone
The normal English equivalent for anicca is impermanent
The adjective anicca is derived in modern etymology from the negative prefix a plus nicca
The Paramatthamanjuusaa and also the PoraanaTiikaa agree that Because it denies everlastingness it is not permanent thus it is impermanent
The VibhaaviniiTikaa and Sankhepavannanaa prefer a derivation from the negative prefix an plus root i to go Cannot be gone to is unapproachable as a permanent everlasting state thus it is impermanent
Principal definitions given in the Sutta Pitaka are as follows
'Impermanent impermanent' it is said Lord
What is impermanent  Materiality is impermanent Raadha and so are feeling and perception and formations and consciousness 
This statement is summarized by a Canonical commentary thus What is impermanent
The five categories are impermanent
In what sense impermanent
Impermanent in the sense of rise and fall 
Again All is impermanent
And what is the all that is impermanent
The eye is impermanent visual objects eyeconsciousness eye contact whatever is felt as pleasant or unpleasant or neitherunpleasantnorpleasant born of eyecontact is impermanent
 or quite succinctly All formations are impermanent and Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation 
The Canonical commentary adds Materiality is impermanent in the sense of exhaustion 
For reasons given below impermanence in strict Abhidhamma treatment appears along with continuity etc only as one of the secondary constituents of the materiality category of which the commentary says Impermanence of materiality has the characteristic of complete breakup
Its nature is to make instances of materiality subside
It is manifested as their exhaustion and fall
Its footing is materiality that is completely breaking up
A section of the Vibhanga however which does not follow the strict Abhidhamma method extends impermanence to the highest kinds of heavenly existence beyond those with finemateriality to the immaterial where there is perception only of infinity of space infinity of consciousness nothingness or reduced perception of nothingness
The commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa elaborate the Sutta definitions further distinguishing between the impermanent and the characteristic of impermanence
The five categories are the impermanent
Why
Because their essence is to rise and fall and change and because after having been they are not
But the characteristic of impermanence is their state of rise and fall and alternation or it is their modetransformation called nonbeing after having been again The eye can be known as impermanent in the sense of its nonbeing after having been and it is impermanent for four reasons as well because it has rise and fall because it changes because it is temporary and because it denies permanence and Since its destiny is nonbeing and since it abandons its natural essence because of the transmission to a new state of being it is 'subject to change' which is simply synonymous with its impermanence
Having dealt with derivations and definitions we can now turn to the Suttas and commentaries again in order to see how this subject is handled there for in this article we shall be mainly concerned with quotations leaving discussion to other articles
But at this point it is convenient to approach the doctrine of impermanence first from the point of view of it as a description of what actually is leaving till later the point of view of it as a basis for evaluation and judgment which is the reason and justification for the description
Impermanence is observable empirically and is objectively and publicly evident always if looked for and from time to time forcing itself upon our notice
Externally it is found in the inconstancy of things which extends even to the periodical description of worldsystems and in one self it can be observed for instance in the body's inadequacy because it ages is prone to sickness dies and gradually decays after death life is short
But it would be better for an untaught ordinary man to treat as self this body which is constructed upon the four great entities then cognizance
Why
Because this body can last one year two years even a hundred years but what is called 'cognizance' and 'mind' and 'consciousness' rises and ceases differently through night and day just as a monkey ranging through a forest seizes a branch and letting that go seizes another
Nevertheless observance of empirical impermanence might not alone suffice for the radical position accorded by the Buddha to this characteristic
This is established however by discovery through reasoned attention of a regular structure in the subjectiveobjective process of its occurrence This body is impermanent it is formed and it is dependentlyarisen 
Here in fact three aspects are distinguished three necessary and interlocking constituents of impermanence namely change formation and a recognizable pattern in a changing process which pattern is set out in the formula of dependent origination
We shall take these three aspects in order
There is no single treatise on the characteristic of impermanence either in the Tipitaka or its commentaries and so we shall have to bring together passages from a number of sources
We may also bear in mind that the Buddha does not confine descriptions of a general nature such as this to the observed alone but extends them to include the observer regarded as actively committed in the world he observes and acting on it as it acts on him so long as craving and ignorance remain unabolished
That in the world by which one perceives the world and conceives concepts about the world is called 'the world' in the Ariyas's Discipline
And what is it in the world with which one does that
It is with the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
That same world is being worn away that is why it is called 'world' 
That impermanence is not only appropriate to all of any arisen situation but also to the totality of all arisen situations
Bhikkhu there is no materiality whatever feeling perception formations consciousness whatever that is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change that will last as long as eternity
Then the Blessed One took a small piece of cowdung in his hand he told the bhikkhu Bhikkhu if even that much of permanent everlasting eternal individual selfhood not subject to change could be found then this living of a life of purity could not be described as for the complete exhaustion of suffering

Wise men in the world say that there is impermanent materiality that is unpleasant and the subject to change and I too say there is that

Impermanence it is pointed out in the commentaries is not always evident unless looked for
The characteristic of impermanence does not become apparent because when rise and fall are not given attention it is concealed by continuity However when continuity is disrupted by discerning rise and fall the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent in its true nature
 Vis
Ch
xxip

When continuity is disrupted means when continuity is exposed by observation of the perpetual alteration of dhammas as they go on occurring in succession
For it is not through dhammas' connectedness that the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent to one who rightly observes rise and fall but rather the characteristic becomes properly evident through their disconnectedness as if they were iron darts
 VisA

This leads us to the second of the three aspects that of the formation mentioned above for to be impermanent is to have a beginning and an end to have rise and fall
Bhikkhus there are three formed characteristics of the formed arising is evident and fall is evident and the alteration of what is present is evident
And one who possesses the Five Factors of Endeavor has understanding possesses understanding extending to rise and disappearance
Acariya Buddhaghosa makes use of the empirically observable in order to arrive at the radical concept of rise and fall
A cup gets broken the asoka tree's shoot can be seen to change in the course of a few days from pale to dark red and then through brown to green leaves which eventually turn yellow wither and fall to the ground
The illustration of a lighted lamp is also used where it goes to when its oil and wick are used up no one knows But that is crudely put for the flame in each third portion of the wick as it gradually burns away ceases there without reaching the other parts That is crudely put too for the flame in each inch in each halfinch in each thread in each strand will cease without reaching the other strands but no flame can appear without a strand
By regarding seeming stability in ever shorter periods and minuter detail a momentary view is arrived at
Anything whatever first analyzed into a fivecategory situation is then regarded as arising anew in each moment and immediately dissolving like sesamum seeds crackling when put into a hot pan
This is further developed in the commentary to the Visuddhimagga
Formed dhammas' arising by means of cause and condition their coming to be after not being their acquisition of individuality is their rise
Their instantaneous cessation and exhaustion when arisen is their fall
Their other state through aging is their alteration
For just as when the occasion of arising dissolves and the occasion of dissolution succeeds it there is no break in the basis on the occasion facing dissolution in other words presence which is what the term of common usage 'aging' refers to so too it is necessary that the aging of a single dhamma is meant which is what is called 'momentary aging' And there must without reservation be no break in the basis between the occasions of arising and dissolution otherwise it follows that one arises and another dissolves
Acariya Buddhaghosa though not identifying being with beingperceived rejects the notion of any underlying substance  any hypostasis personal or impersonal  thus
understands that there is no heap or store of unarisen mentalitymateriality prior to its arising
When it arises it does not come from any heap or store and when it ceases it does not go in any direction
There is nowhere any depository in the way of a heap or store prior to its arising of the sound that arises when a lute is played nor does it come from any store when it arises nor does it go in any direction when it has ceased but on the contrary not having been it is brought into being by depending on the lute the lute's soundboard and a man's appropriate effort and immaterial dhammas come to be and having been they vanish

The transience and perpetual renewal of dhammas is compared in the same work to dewdrops at sunrise a bubble on water a line drawn on water a mustard seed on an awl's point and a lightning flash and they are as coreless as a conjuring trick a mirage a dream a whirling firebrand's circle a goblin city froth a plantain trunk and so on
Before leaving the aspect of rise and fall the question of the extent of the moment as conceived in the commentaries must be examined
A Sutta cited above gave arising fall and alteration of what is present as three characteristics of anything formed
In the commentaries this is restated as rise presence and dissolution which are each also called  moments
These submoments are discussed in the Vibhanga commentary
To what extent does materiality last
And to what extent the immaterial
Materiality is heavy to change and slow to cease the immaterial is light to change and quick to cease
Sixteen cognizances arise and cease while materiality lasts but that ceases with the seventeenth cognizance
It is like when a man wanting to knock down some fruit hits a branch with a mallet and when fruits and leaves are loosed from their stems simultaneously and of those the fruits fall first to the ground because they are heavier the leaves later because they are lighter
So too just as the leaves and fruits are loosed simultaneously from their stems with the blow of the mallet there is simultaneous manifestation of materiality and immaterial dhammas at the moment of relinking at rebirth And although there is this difference between them materiality cannot occur without the immaterial nor can the immaterial without materiality they are commensurate
Here is a simile there is a man with short legs and a man with long legs as they journey along together while longlegs takes one step shortlegs takes sixteen steps when shortlegs is making his sixteenth step longlegs lifts his foot draws it forward and makes a single step so neither outdistances the other and they are commensurate
 KhandhaVibhanga AVbh

Elsewhere it is stated that the submoments of arising and dissolution are equal for both materiality and cognizance only the presence submoment of materiality being longer
The MuulaTiikaa however puts the mental presence submoment in question commenting as follows on the passage just quoted Now it needs investigating whether there is what is here called 'presence submoment' of a cognizance or not It cites the Citta Yamaka as follows Is it when arisen arising
At the dissolution submoment it is arisen but it is not not arising and Is it when not arising not arisen
At the dissolution submoment it is not arising but it is not unarisen and two similar passages from the same source pointing out that only the dissolution submoment is mentioned instead of both that and the presence submoment as might be expected had the Yamaka regarded the presence submoment as having valid application to cognizance
For that reason the MuulaTiikaa concludes
nonexistence of a presence submoment of cognizance is indicated
For although it is said in the Suttas The alteration of what is present is evident that does not mean either that a continuity alteration which is evident cannot be called presence because of absence of any alteration of what is one only or that what is existent by possessing the pair of submoments cannot be called present
The third aspect of impermanence that of the pattern or structure of specific conditionality still remains
It is briefly stated thus That comes to be when there is this that arises with the arising of this That does not come to be when this is not that ceases with the cessation of this or in the words that first awakened the two Chief Disciples A Tathaagata has told the cause of dhammas that have come into being due to a cause and that which brings their cessation too such is the doctrine preached by the Great Samana
In more detail we find Consciousness acquires being by dependence on a duality
What is that duality
It is eye which is impermanent changing becomingother and visible objects which are impermanent changing and becomingother such is the transient fugitive duality which is impermanent changing and becomingother
Eyeconsciousness is impermanent changing and becomingother for this cause and condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness being impermanent changing and becomingother how could eyeconsciousness arisen by depending on an impermanent condition be permanent
Then the coincidence concurrence and confluence of these three impermanent dhammas is called contact but eyecontact too is impermanent changing and becomingother for how could eyecontact arisen by depending on an impermanent condition be permanent
It is one touched by contact who feels likewise who chooses likewise who perceives so these transient fugitive dhammas too are impermanent changing and becomingother
By further development we come to the formula of dependent origination but that is beyond the scope of this article

As he does so his underlying tendency to lust for the body and for pleasant feeling is abandoned Similarly when he contemplates unpleasant feeling his underlying tendency to resistance to the body and unpleasant feeling is abandoned and when he contemplates neitherunpleasantnorpleasant feeling his underlying tendency to ignorance of the body and of that feeling is abandoned

When a bhikkhu abides much with his mind fortified by perception of impermanence his mind retreats retracts and recoils from gain honor and renown and does not reach out to it just as a cock's feather or strip of sinew thrown on a fire retreats retracts and recoils and does not reach out to it

When a bhikkhu sees six rewards it should be enough for him to establish unlimitedly perception of impermanence in all formations
What six
All formations will seem to me insubstantial and my mind will find no relish in the world of all and my mind will emerge from the world of all and my mind will incline towards extinction and my fetters will come to be abandoned and I shall be endowed with the supreme state of a recluse

When a man abides contemplating impermanence in the bases for contact the outcome is that awareness of repulsiveness in contact is established in him and when he abides contemplating rise and fall in the five categories affected by clinging the outcome is that awareness of repulsiveness in clinging is established in him

The Visuddhimagga relies principally on the canonical commentary the Patisambhidaamagga in its handling of the contemplation of impermanence
There that contemplation introduces the first of what are called the Eight Knowledges namely the knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall
Also perception of impermanence heads the  Principal Insights which make their initial appearance is a group in the Patisambhidaamagga
In this connection it is stated as follows
One who maintains in being the contemplation of impermanence abandons perception of permanence
the contemplation of impermanence and contemplation of the signless are one in meaning and different only in the letter
one who maintains in being the contemplation of the signless abandons the sign

The contemplation of what is impermanent or contemplation as impermanent is contemplation of impermanence this is insight that occurs in apprehending impermanence in the three planes
The Visuddhimagga adds
Having purified knowledge in this way by abandoning perception of permanence etc which oppose the contemplation of impermanence etc he passes on and begins contemplation of rise and fall
 Vis

The following passage is then quoted
How is it that understanding of contemplating the change of presentlyarisen dhammas is knowledge of rise and fall
Presentlyarisen materiality is born the characteristic of its generation is rise the characteristic of its change is fall the contemplation is knowledge
Presentlyarisen feeling etc
 Ps
Naanakathaai 
He sees the rise of the materiality category in the sense of conditioned arising thus With the arising of ignorance with the arising of craving action with the arising of nutriment there is the arising of materiality one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the materiality Category
One who sees the rise of the materiality category sees these five characteristics
Cessation and fall are treated in parallel manner and this treatment is applied to the four remaining categories but substituting contact for nutriment in the cases of feeling perception and formations and mentalitymateriality for nutriment in the case of consciousness
Lastly a Sutta passage emphasizes a special relation with faith
Materiality is impermanent changing becoming other
Whoever decides about places his faith in these dhammas in this way is called mature in faith
He has alighted upon the certainty of rightness Whoever has a liking to meditate by test of experiment with understanding upon these dhammas is called mature in the true idea
He has alighted upon the certainty of rightness Whoever has a liking to meditate by test of experiment with understanding upon these dhammas is called mature in the true idea
He has alighted upon the certainty of rightness

This connection between faith and impermanence is taken up by the Visuddhimagga quoting the Patisambhidaamagga
When one gives attention to impermanence the faith faculty is outstanding and in the cases of attention to the unpleasant and notself the faculties of concentration and understanding are respectively outstanding
These three are called the Three gateways to liberation which lead to the outlet from the world

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
To the average man death is by no means a pleasant subject or talk for discussion
It is something dismal and oppressive  a veritable killjoy a fit topic for a funeral house only
The average man immersed as he is in the self ever seeking after the pleasurable ever pursuing that which excites and gratifies the senses refuses to pause and ponder seriously that these very objects of pleasure and gratification will some day reach their end
If wise counsel does not prevail and urge the unthinking pleasureseeking man to consider seriously that death can knock at his door also it is only the shock of a bereavement under his own roof the sudden and untimely death of a parent wife or child that will rouse him up from his delirious round of sensegratification and rudely awaken him to the hard facts of life
Then only will his eyes open then only will he begin to ask himself why there is such a phenomenon as death
Why is it inevitable
Why are there these painful partings which rob life of its joys
To most of us at some moment or another the spectacle of death must have given rise to the deepest of thoughts and profoundest of questions
What is life worth if able bodies that once performed great deeds now lie flat and cold senseless and lifeless
What is life worth if eyes that once sparkled with joy eyes that once beamed with love are now closed forever bereft of movement bereft of life
Thoughts such as these are not to be repressed
It is just these inquiring thoughts if wisely pursued that will ultimately unfold the potentialities inherent in the human mind to receive the highest truths
According to the Buddhist way of thinking death far from being a subject to be shunned and avoided is the key that unlocks the seeming mystery of life
It is by understanding death that we understand life for death is part of the process of life in the larger sense
In another sense life and death are two ends of the same process and if you understand one end of the process you also understand the other end
Hence by understanding the purpose of death we also understand the purpose of life
It is the contemplation of death the intensive thought that it will some day come upon us that softens the hardest of hearts binds one to another with cords of love and compassion and destroys the barriers of caste creed and race among the peoples of this earth all of whom are subject to the common destiny of death
Death is a great leveler
Pride of birth pride of position pride of wealth pride of power must give way to the allconsuming thought of inevitable death
It is this leveling aspect of death that made the poet say
It is the contemplation of death that helps to destroy the infatuation of sensepleasure
It is the contemplation of death that destroys vanity
It is the contemplation of death that gives balance and a healthy sense of proportion to our highly overwrought minds with their misguided sense of values
It is the contemplation of death that gives strength and steadiness and direction to the erratic human mind now wandering in one direction now in another without an aim without a purpose
It is not for nothing that the Buddha has in the very highest terms commended to his disciples the practice of mindfulness regarding death
This is known as marananussati bhavana One who wants to practice it must at stated times and also every now and then revert to the thought maranam bhavissati  death will take place
This contemplation of death is one of the classical meditationsubjects treated in the Visuddhi Magga which states that in order to obtain the fullest results one should practice this meditation in the correct way that is with mindfulness with a sense of urgency and with understanding
For example suppose a young disciple fails to realize keenly that death can come upon him at any moment and regards it as something that will occur in old age in the distant future his contemplation of death will be lacking strength and clarity so much so that it will run on lines which are not conducive to success
How great and useful is the contemplation of death can be seen from the following beneficial effects enumerated in the Visuddhi Magga  The disciple who devotes himself to this contemplation of death is always vigilant takes no delight in any form of existence gives up hankering after life censures evil doing is free from craving as regards the requisites of life his perception of impermanence becomes established he realizes the painful and soulless nature of existence and at the moment of death he is devoid of fear and remains mindful and selfpossessed
Finally if in this present life he fails to attain to Nibbana upon the dissolution of the body he is bound for a happy destiny
Thus it will be seen that mindfulness of death not only purifies and refines the mind but also has the effect of robbing death of its fears and terrors and helps one at that solemn moment when he is gasping for his last breath to face that situation with fortitude and calm
He is never unnerved at the thought of death but is always prepared for it
It is such a man that can truly exclaim O death where is thy sting
In the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha has said Oh Monks there are ten ideas which if made to grow made much of are of great fruit of great profit for plunging into Nibbana for ending up in Nibbana Of these ten one is death
Contemplation on death and on other forms of sorrow such as old age and disease constitutes a convenient starting point for the long line of investigation and meditation that will ultimately lead to Reality
This is exactly what happened in the case of the Buddha
Was it not the sight of an old man followed by the sight of a sick man and thereafter the sight of a dead man that made Prince Siddhattha living in the lap of luxury to give up wife and child home and the prospect of a kingdom and to embark on a voyage of discovery of truth a voyage that ended in the glory of Buddhahood and the bliss of Nibbana
The marked disinclination of the average man to advert to the problem of death the distaste that arouses in him the desire to turn away from it whenever the subject is broached are all due to the weakness of the human mind sometimes occasioned by fear sometimes by tanha or selfishness but at all times supported by ignorance
The disinclination to understand death is no different from the disinclination of a man to subject himself to a medical checkup although he feels that something is wrong with him
We must learn to value the necessity to face facts
Safety always lies in truth
The sooner we know our condition the safer are we for we can then take the steps necessary for our betterment
The saying where ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise has no application here
To live with no thought of death is to live in a fool's paradise
Visuddhi Magga says
Now that we have understood why such potency attaches itself to reflections on death let us proceed to engage ourselves in such reflections
The first question that the reflecting mind would ask itself will be What is the cause of death Ask the physiologist what is death he will tell you that it is a cessation of the functioning of the human body
Ask him what causes the cessation of the functioning of the human body he will tell you that the immediate cause is that the heart ceases to beat
Ask him why the heart ceases to beat he will tell you that disease in any part of the human system if not arrested will worsen and cause a gradual degeneration and ultimate breakdown of some organ or other of the human system thus throwing an undue burden on the work of the heart  the only organ that pumps blood
Hence it is disease that ultimately cause the cessation of the heart beat
Ask the physiologist what causes the disease he well tell you that disease is the irregular functioning of the human body or by the violation of rules of healthy living or by an accident  each of which can impair some part or other of the human system thus causing disease
Ask the physiologist what causes the entry of a germ or the violation of health rules or the occurrence of an accident
He will have to answer
I do not know I cannot say Certainly the physiologist cannot help us at this stage of our reflections of death since the question is beyond the realm of physiology and enters the realm of human conduct
When two persons are exposed to germ infection why should it sometimes be the man of lower resistance power who escapes the infection while the man of greater resistance succumbs to it
When three persons tread the same slippery floor why should one slip and fall and crack his head and die while the second slips and sustains only minor injuries while the third does not slip at all
These are questions which clearly show that the answer is not to be expected from the physiologist whose study is the work of the human body
Nor is the answer to be expected from a psychologist whose study is the work of the human mind only
Far far beyond the confines of physiology and psychology is the answer to be sought
It is here that Buddhist philosophy becomes inviting
It is just here that the law of Kamma also called the law of Cause and Effect or the law of Action and Reaction makes a special appeal to the inquiring mind
It is Kamma that steps in to answer further questions
It is Kamma that determines why one man should succumb to germinfection while the other should not
It is Kamma that decides why the three men treading the same slippery floor should experience three different results
Kamma sees to it that each man gets in life just what he deserves not more nor less
Each man's condition in life with its particular share of joys and sorrows is nothing more nor less than the result of his own past actions good and bad
Thus we see that Kamma is a strict accountant
Each man weaves his own web of fate
Each man is the architect of his own fortune
As the Buddha said in the Anguttara Nikaya Beings are the owners of their deeds
Their deeds are the womb from which they spring
With their deeds they are bound up
Their deeds are their refuge
Whatever deeds they do good or evil of such they will be heirs As actions are various reactions also are various
Hence the varying causes of death to various persons under various situations
Every cause has its particular effect
Every action has its particular reaction
This is the unfailing law
When Kamma is referred to as a law it must not be taken to mean something promulgated by the state or some governing body
That would imply the existence of a lawgiver
It is a law in the sense that it is a constant way of action
It is in the nature of certain actions that they should produce certain results
That nature is also called law
It is in this sense that we speak of the law of gravitation which causes a mango on the tree to fall to the ground not that there is a supreme external power or being which commands the mango to fall
It is in the nature of things the weight of the mango the attraction of the earth that the mango should fall
It is again a constant way of action
Similarly in the realm of human conduct and human affairs the law of cause and effect of action and reaction operates
It is not dependent on any extraneous arbitrary power but it is in the very nature of things that certain actions should produce certain results
Hence the birth and the death of a man is no more the result of an arbitrary power than the rise and fall of a tree
Nor is it mere chance
There is no such thing as chance
It is unthinkable that chaos rules the world
Every situation every condition is a sequel to a previous situation and a previous condition
We resort to the word 'chance' when we do not know the cause
Sufficient has been said for us to know that in Kamma we find the root cause of death
We also know that no arbitrary power fashions this Kamma according to its will or caprice
It is in the result of our own actions
Yadisam vapate bijam tadisam harate phalam  as we sow so shall we reap
Kamma is not something generated in the closed box of the past
It is always in the making
We are by our actions every moment contributing to it
Hence the future is not all conditioned by the past
The present is also conditioning it
If you fear death why not make the wisest use of the present so as to ensure a happy future
To fear death on the one hand and on the other not to act in a way that would ensure a happy future is either madness or mental lethargy
He who leads a virtuous life harming none and helping whom he can in conformity with the Dhamma always remembering the Dhamma is without doubt laying the foundation of a happy future life
Dhammo have rakkhati dhamma carim  The Dhamma most assuredly protects him who lives in conformity with it
Such conformity is facilitated by the contemplation of death
Death has no fears for one who is thus protected by Dhamma
Then shall he cheerful and unafraid be able to face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calm
Another approach to the understanding of death is through an understanding of the law of aggregates or Sankharas which states that everything is a combination of things and does not exist by itself as an independent entity
Sankhara is a Pali term used for an aggregation a combination or an assemblage
The word is derived from the prefix san meaning together and the root kar meaning to make The two together mean made together or constructed together or combined together All things in this world says the Buddha are aggregates or combinations That is to say they do not exist by themselves but are composed of several things
Any one thing be it a mighty mountain or a minute mustard seed is a combination of several things
These things are themselves combinations of several other things
Nothing is a unity nothing is an entity large or small
Neither is the sun nor moon an entity nor is the smallest grain of sand an entity
Each of them is a Sankhara a combination of several things
Things seem to be entities owing to the fallibility of our senses  our faculties of sight hearing touching smelling and tasting and even thinking
Science has accepted the position that our senses are not infallible guides to us
A permanent entity is only a concept only a name
It does not exist in reality
In the famous dialogues between King Milinda and Thera Nagasena the latter wishing to explain to the King this law of aggregates enquired from the King how he came there whether on foot or riding
The King replied that he came in a chariot
Where then Oh King asked Nagasena is this chariot in which you say you came
You are a mighty king of all the continent of India and yet speak a lie when you say there is no chariot
In this way by sheer analysis by breaking up what is signified by chariot into its various component parts Nagasena was able to convince the King that a chariot as such does not exist but only component parts exist
So much so that the King was able to answer thus
Similarly human being man I are mere names and terms not corresponding to anything that is really and actually existing
In the ultimate sense there exist only changing energies
The term Sankhara however refers not only to matter and properties of matter known as corporeality but also to mind and properties of mind known as mentality
Hence the mind is as much a combination or aggregate as the body
When it is said the mind is a combination of several thoughts it is not meant that these several thoughts exist together simultaneously as do the different parts of the chariot
What is meant is a succession of thoughts an unending sequence of thoughts now a thought of hatred thereafter a thought of sorrow thereafter a thought of duty near at hand and thereafter again the original thought of hatred etc etc in endless succession
Each thought arises stays a while and passes on
The three stages of being are found here also  uppada thiti bhanga  arising remaining and passing away
Thoughts arise one following the other with such a rapidity of succession that the illusion of a permanent thing called the mind is created but really there is no permanent thing but only a flow of thoughts
The rapid succession of thoughts is compared to the flow of water in a river one drop following another in rapid succession that we seem to see a permanent entity in this flow
But this is an illusion
Similarly there is no such permanent entity as the mind
It is only a succession of thoughts a stream of thoughts that arise and pass away
If I say that I crossed a river this morning and recrossed it in the evening is my statement true as regards what I crossed and what I recrossed
Was it what I crossed in the morning that I crossed in the evening
Is it not one set of waters that I crossed in the morning and a different set of waters that I crossed in the evening
Which of the two is the river or are there two rivers a morning river and an evening river
Had I recrossed at midday then there would also be a midday river
Asking oneself such questions one would see that every hour every minute it is a different river
Where then is a permanent thing called 'river'
Is it the river bed or the banks
You will now realize that there is nothing to which you can point out and say This is the river River exists only as a name
It is a convenient and conventional mode of expression for a continuous unending flow of drops of water
Just such is the mind
It is a continuous stream of thoughts
Can you point to any one thought that is passing through the mind and say This truly is my mind my permanent mind A thought of anger towards a person may arise in me
If that thought is my permanent mind how comes it that on a later occasion a thought of love towards the same person can arise in me
If that too is my permanent mind then there are two opposing permanent minds
Questioning on these lines one comes to the inevitable conclusion that there is no such thing as a permanent mind it is only a convenient expression for an incessant and variegated stream of thoughts that arise and pass away
Mind does not exist in reality
It exists only in name as an expression for a succession of thoughts
Chariot  river  body and mind  these are all combinations
By themselves and apart from these combinations they do not exist
There is nothing intrinsically stable in them nothing corresponding to reality nothing permanent no eternally abiding substratum or soul
Thus if body is only a name for a combination of changing factors and the mind is likewise only a name for a succession of thoughts the psychophysical combination called man is not an entity except by way of conventional speech
So when we say a chariot moves or a man walks it is correct only figuratively or conventionally
Actually and really in the ultimate sense there is only a movement there is only a walking
Hence has it been said in the Visuddhi Magga
Now how does this cold and relentless analysis of mind and body become relevant to the question of death
The relevancy is just this
When analysis reveals that there is no person but only a process that there is no doer but only a deed we arrive at the conclusion that there is no person who dies but that there is only a process of dying
Moving is a process walking is a process so dying is also a process
Just as there is no hidden agent back and behind the process of moving or walking so there is no hidden agent back and behind the process of dying
If only we are capable of keeping more and more to this abhidhammic view of things we will be less and less attached to things we will be less and less committing the folly of identifying ourselves with our actions
Thus shall we gradually arrive at a stage when we grasp the view so difficult to comprehend that all life is just a process
It is one of the grandest realizations that can descend on deluded man
It is so illuminating so enlightening
It is indeed a revelation
With the appearance of that realization there is a disappearance of all worries and fears regarding death
That is a logical sequence
Just as with the appearance of light darkness must disappear even so the light of knowledge dispels the darkness of ignorance fear and worry
With realization with knowledge these fears and worries will be shown as being empty and unfounded
It is so very easy to keep on declaring this
What is difficult is to comprehend this
Why is it so difficult
Because we are so accustomed to thinking in a groove because we are so accustomed to overlook the fallacies in our thinking because we are so accustomed to wrong landmarks and wrong routes in our mental journeying we are reluctant to cut out a new path
It is we who deny ourselves the benefits of samma ditthi
The inveterate habit of identifying ourselves with our actions is the breeding ground of that inviting belief that there is some subtle ego back and behind all our actions and thoughts
This is the arch mischief maker that misleads us
We fail to realize that the egofeeling within us is nothing more than the plain and simple stream of consciousness that is changing always and is never the same for two consecutive moments
As Professor James said The thoughts themselves are the thinkers
In our ignorance we hug the belief that this egoconsciousness is the indication of the presence of some subtle elusive soul
It is just the mind's reaction to objects
When we walk we fail to realize that it is just the process of walking and nothing else
We hug the fallacy that there is something within us that directs the walking
When we think we hug the fallacy that there is something within us that thinks
We fail to realize that it is just the process of thinking and nothing else
Nothing short of profound meditation on the lines indicated in the Satipatthana Sutta can cure us of our miccha ditthi
The day we are able by such meditation to rid ourselves of these cherished false beliefs against which the Buddha has warned us times without number beliefs which warp our judgment and cloud our vision of things shall we be able to develop that clarity of vision which alone can show us things as they actually are
Then only will the realization dawn on us that there is no one who suffers dying but there is only a dying process just as much as living is also a process
If one can train oneself to reflect on these lines it must necessarily mean that he is gradually giving up the undesirable and inveterate habit of identifying oneself with one's bodily and mental processes and that he is gradually replacing that habit by a frequent contemplation on anatta
Such contemplation will result in a gradual relaxation of our tight grip on our fond ego When one thus ceases to hug the egodelusion the stage is reached when there is complete detachment of the mind from such allurements
Then shall one be able cheerful and unafraid to face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calm
We have seen how reflections on the great law of Kamma and the great law of Aggregates or Sankharas can assist us to form a correct view of death and help us to face death in the correct attitude
Now there is a third great law a knowledge of which can assist us in the same way namely the law of change or anicca
It is the principle behind the first noble truth the truth of dukkha or Disharmony
It is precisely because there is change or lack of permanency in anything and everything in this world that there is suffering or disharmony in this world
This principle of change is expressed by the well known formula Anicca vata sankhara  all sankharas are impermanent Nothing in this world is stable or static
Time moves everything whether we like it or not
Time moves us also whether we like it or not
Nothing in this world can arrest the ceaseless passage of time and nothing survives time
There is no stability anywhere
Change rules the world
Everything mental and physical is therefore transitory and changing
The change may be quick or the change may be perceptible or it may be imperceptible
We live in an ever changing world while we ourselves are also all the while changing
A sankhara we have learned is a combination of several factors
These factors are also subject to the law of change
They are changing factors
Hence a Sankhara is not merely a combination of several factors
It is a changing combination of changing factors since the combination itself is changing
It is because there is change that there is growth
It is because there is change that there is decay
Growth also leads to decay because there is change
Why do flowers bloom only to fade
It is because of the operation of the law of change
It is this law that makes the strength of youth give way to the weakness of old age
It is on account of the operation of the law that though great buildings are erected towering towards the sky some distant day will see them totter and tumble
It is this aspect of the law of change the process of disintegration that causes color to fade iron to rust and timber to rot
It is such reflections that must have led the poet Gray contemplating a burial ground in a country church yard to say
Sometimes the working of this law is not apparent
Even that which looks so solid and substantial as a rocky mountain will not always remain as such
Science tells us that maybe after thousands of years it will wear down by the process of disintegration and that where a lake now is a mountain once was
If things arise they must fall Uppajjitva nirujjhanti says the Buddha  having arisen they fall
Aeons and aeons ago the earth and the moon were one
Today while the earth is still warm and alive the moon is cold and dead
The earth too science tells us is very slowly but surely losing its heat and water
Gradually and slowly it is cooling down
Aeons and aeons hence it will cease to support life
It will be a cold and lifeless planet
It will be a second moon
This is just one of several instances where the mighty law of change works imperceptibly
The Buddha also has foretold the end of the earth
Just as the law of change can cause decline and decay it can also cause growth and progress
Hence it is that a seed becomes a plant and a plant becomes a tree and a bud becomes a flower
But again there is no permanency in growth
Growth again gives way to decay
The plant must die
The flower must wither
It is an unending cycle of birth and death integration and disintegration of rise and fall
Hence it is that Shelley has aptly said
It is no arbitrary power that brings about these changes progressive and retrogressive
The tendency to change is inherent in all things
The law of change does not merely declare that things change but also declares that change is of the very essence of the things
Think of anything and you will find it to be a mode of change and a condition of change
Change is the working hypothesis of the scientist
One of the mightiest tasks of the scientist also his proudest boast was to destroy the idea of stability and fixity in the organic world
We have heard of the supposed entity of the atom being shown up as a combination of energies
While science has applied the law of change to the physical domain to split up unity into diversity the Buddha has applied the selfsame law to the entire mindbody complex and split up the seeming unity of being into the five aggregates known as Pañcakkhandha The Buddha has gone further and explained why this aggregate is temporary why it should some day disintegrate and why a fresh integration should arise upon the disintegration
Everything works upon a triple principle of uppada thiti and bhanga  arising remaining and passing away
Even in the case of a thought these three stages are present
When the Buddha dealt with the four chief elements of the world of matter and showed that they too are subject to the great law of change he proceeded to show that the human body which is also formed of the same elements must necessarily be subject to the same great law of change
What then of this fathomlong body asked the Buddha
Is there anything here of which it may rightly be said 'I' or 'mine' or 'am'
Nay verily nothing whatsoever
The sooner one appreciates the working of this law of change the more will one be able to profit by it attuning oneself to that way of living that way of thinking and speaking and acting where this law will work to his best advantage
The man who knows the subtle working of this law of change will also know how nama can change by purposeful action
However deeply he gets involved in evil he will not regard evil as a permanent obstruction because he knows that the evil mind can also change
He knows that by constant contemplation on what is good good thoughts tend to arise in the mind
The constant contemplation of good will cause kusala sankharas to arise in the mind and these kusala sankharas will dislodge the akusala sankharas  a process which hitherto appeared to him to be impossible
When his thoughts and tendencies change for the better when his mind is permeated thus with good tendencies his speech and deeds automatically change for the better  a pleasant surprise for him
With purer and purer conduct thus acquired deeper and deeper concentration is possible
Increased power to concentrate accelerates the pace towards the achievement of that Highest Wisdom known as pañña
Thus the bad in him changes into good
A bad man changes into a good man
By purposeful action the law of change is made to operate to his highest benefit
He now becomes a good man in the truest sense of the word
The good man is always a happy man
He has no fear of death because he has no fear of the life beyond
Of such a man has it been said in the Dhammapada
The powerful change brought about in his life will ensure upon its dissolution the birth of a more fortunate being  a result which he can confidently expect at his dying moment
Not for him then are the fears and terrors of death
Furthermore when one follows minutely the working of the Law of Change in respect of one's own body and mind and also in respect of another's body and mind one begins to acquire so close a familiarity with change that death will not appear as just one more example of the process of change to which one has been subject all along since birth
It will appear as something to be expected something that must occur to fit in with what had occurred earlier
To one who can thus reflect on death there is nothing to fear
Cheerful and unafraid he can face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calm
There is another angle from which we can study death and that is from the angle of law of conditionality which is closely akin to the law of anicca or Change
Not only are sankharas made up of several things but they are also conditioned by several factors and when these conditioning factors cease to exist the conditioned thing also ceases to exist
This is the law of conditionality and has been thus expressed in very general terms Imasmim sati idam hoti  when this exists that exists Imassa uppada idam uppajjati  when this arises that arises
Imasmim asati idam na hoti  when this is not that is not
Imassa nirodha idam nirujjhanti  when this ceases that ceases
As this principle is of universal applicability the working of the process of life and death also comes within its operation
The chain of lifeconditioning factors consists of twelve links or nidanas which together are known as the paticca samuppada or Law of Dependent Origination
A knowledge of this law is most necessary
In the Mahanidana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya Buddha addressing Ananda said It is through not understanding through not penetrating this doctrine that these beings have become entangled like a ball of thread
The formula of Dependent Origination runs as follows
This is the process that goes on and on ad infinitum
Hence has it been said
This important law is easier told than understood
This is one of the profoundest doctrines preached by the Buddha
It is only frequent and hard thinking on it that will bring out its deepest meanings
This is not the place to explain these twelve links in full but in order to dispel some of the misconception surrounding the notion of death it is necessary to make some observations on the first link  avijja or Ignorance and thereafter on the second and third links viz
activities and consciousness because it is these two links that involve death and rebirth
These twelve links it must be understood do not represent a pure succession of cause and effect a straight line of action and reaction
It is wrong to call this a causal series as it is not a chain of causes in strict sequence of time
Some of the links arise simultaneously and the next is of condition rather than cause
There are modes of conditioning which may operate in the relation of one factor to another
Each factor is both conditioning and conditioned
Many of these factors are both simultaneously and interdependently working
A few observations now on the first link of avijja or ignorance
When it is said the Ignorance is the first link it does not mean that Ignorance is the first cause of existence
The Buddha has definitely said that the first cause the ultimate origin of things is unthinkable Anamataggayam sansaro pubbakoit na paññayati Beginningless O monks is this course of existence
A starting point is not to be found Bertrand Russell has stated There is no reason to suppose that this world had a beginning at all
The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our imagination
Ignorance then is not the primary origin of things but is the originating factor of suffering in the process of life and death so far as man is concerned
All the twelve factors are continuing factors
It is only if we ponder deeply that we will be convinced of this truth namely that there can be no beginning to a process that has no end
What is meant by Ignorance as being the first link in the series
By Ignorance is here meant the Ignorance of the essentially fundamental facts of existence namely the fact of suffering or disharmony the fact of the cessation of suffering or disharmony and the fact of the way leading to the cessation of suffering or disharmony
In other words it is the ignorance of that which the Buddha has called the Four Noble Truths
Ignorance is always a dangerous condition
In such a condition you are at the mercy of everyone and everything
The second link is Activities
By Activities is here meant volitional activities called in Pali sankhara
The formula states  Dependent upon Ignorance arise activities This means that ignorance of the essentially fundamental facts of life becomes a conditioning factor for the volitional activities of man
It is only a knowledge and a realization of the Four Noble Truths that according to the Buddha enables a man to see things as they actually are
In the state of ignorance of these Truths man prevented as he is from seeing things as they actually are adopts various courses of action
These activities are not merely the outcome of ignorance once and for all but ignorance continues to condition these volitional activities so long as existence continues
These volitional activities or mental energies are multifarious
In the context of the paticca samuppada Sankhara can therefore be said to signify Kamma or Kammic Volition The first link of Ignorance and the second link of Activities refer to the past birth
The next eight links refer to the present existence and the last two refer to the future existence
The third link is viññana or Consciousness
The formula states  Dependent upon Activities arises Consciousness By consciousness is here meant relinking consciousness or rebirth consciousness
By this formula is therefore meant that the conscious life of man in his present birth is conditioned by his volitional activities his good and bad actions his Kamma of the past life
To put it in another way the consciousness of his present life is dependent on his past Kamma
This formula is highly important since it involves a linking of the past life with the present and thereby implies rebirth
Hence this third link is called patisandhi viññana or relinking consciousness or rebirth consciousness
It may be wondered how activities of the past life can condition a present birth
Material sciences seek to explain birth on the premises of the present existence only
The biologist says that it is the union of father with mother that conditions birth
According to the Buddha these two conditioning factors by themselves are insufficient to result in birth otherwise every complete union of father with mother should result in birth
These two are purely physical factors and it is illogical to expect that a psychophysical organism a mindbody combination known as man could arise from two purely physical factors without the intervention of a psychical or mental factor
Therefore says the Buddha a third factor is also necessary in addition to the two purely physical factors of the sperm and the ovum
This third factor is patisandhiviññana or relinking consciousness
The wick and the oil will not alone produce a flame
You may drown a wick in gallons of oil but there will never be a flame
You may use a wick of the most inflammable type but there will never be a flame
Not until a bright spark of light comes from elsewhere will the action of the oil and the wick produce a flame
We have considered that the activities of the past are certain energies  mental energies
The Kamma of the past releases these energies which are potent enough to create the condition for the being to be reborn in an appropriate place according to the nature of activities performed
These energies it is that produce the patisandhi viññana the third factor
It will thus be seen that these potential energies work in cooperation with the physical laws to condition the natural formation of the embryo in the mother's womb
Just as sleep is no bar to the continuance of bodily operations in consequence of the principle of life continuing within it even so death is no bar to the continuance of the operation of being which is only transformed to another suitable realm or plane there to be reborn and to relive in consequence of the willtolive remaining alive and unabated at the moment of dissolution
The lifestream the process of being thus continues while the Kammic forces it generates give it shape and form in the appropriate sphere of existence investing it with its new characteristics and securing for it a local habitation and a name
A seed coming in contact with the soil produces a plant but the plant is not born of the seed and the soil only
There are other factors drawn from unseen extraneous sources that come into play such as light and air and moisture
It is the combined presence of all these factors that provide the opportunity for the birth of the plant
The unseen extraneous factor where the birth of a being is concerned is the terminating kammic energy of the dying man or to express it in another way the reproductive power of the willtolive
Is there any need to doubt the potency of the past Kamma to create a present existence
Do you doubt that the activities of one existence can condition consciousness in another existence
If so calmly reflect on the incessant and multifarious nature of human activities the one feature of human life the unfailing characteristic of every moment of individual existence
When you have sufficiently grasped the fact of the incessant and multifarious nature of human activities ask yourself the question who or what propels these activities
A little reflection will reveal that the activities of man are propelled by a myriad of desires and cravings which ultimately spring from the desire to live
This willtolive by whatever name you may call it motivates all activities
We eat we earn we acquire we struggle we advance we hate we love we plot we plan we deceive  all in order that we may continue living
Even the desire to commit suicide paradoxical as it may seem arises from the desire to live  to live free from entanglements and disappointments
Just consider the cumulative effect of hundreds of desirepropelled activities performed by us day by day hour by hour minute by minute for a long period of years
These are all Kammas these are all energies released
These are all strong creative forces that are generated
It is difficult to imagine that with the present life will end all the desireforces it has brought into existence
There will always be at any given moment an outstanding balance of unexpected Kammic energies
These powers energies or forces contain within themselves the potentialities of attracting for themselves the conditions for further existence
These energies or forces are potent enough to create the conditions for reliving when the body which sustained these forces ceases to live
These then will constitute the terminating Kammic energy of the dying man or to express the same idea in another way this is the reproductive power of the willtolive
In short the willtolive makes it possible to relive
Now we see how the terminating Kammic energy of the dying man becomes the third factor the psychical factor which along with the two physical factors of the sperm and the ovum conditions future birth
It is this relinking consciousness that becomes the nucleus of a new namarupa or mindbody combination
This is the resultant terminal energy generated by the volitional activities of the past
Science teaches us that energy is indestructible but that it can be transmuted into other forms of energy
Why then cannot these powerful energies of the past Kamma impelled as they are by the pulsation of craving and motivated as they are by the willtolive continue to exert their potent influences albeit in some other manner and in some other sphere
What is it that travels from one existence to another you may ask
Do activities travel or do their resultant forces travel
Or does consciousness itself travel
The answer is an emphatic No None of these travel but the Kammic energy of actions performed is a tremendous force or power which can make its influence felt and to effect this influence distance is no bar
Distance is never a bar to Kammic energies making themselves felt
In the Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta of Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha strongly reprimanded the bhikkhu Sati for declaring as the Buddha's teachings that viññana or consciousness travels from existence to existence
Foolish man said the Buddha has not consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of in many a figure of speech by me saying 'apart from conditions there is no origination of consciousness' No physical contact is necessary for mind to influence matter
Sir William Crooke in his Edinburgh lectures on mental science has said It has also been proved by experiment that by an act of will the mind can cause objects such as metal levers to move
When the matter on which mental energies act is situated far away in other planes and spheres of existence we are only employing a figure of speech when we say that Kamma has traveled or that energy has traveled
Many a simile has been employed by the Buddha to show that nothing travels or transmigrates from one life to another
It is just a process of one condition influencing another
The resultant Kammic energies of human activity not yet expanded are so powerful that they can condition the formation of an embryo in another world and give it consciousness
One important point must not be overlooked
The patisandhiviññana or relinking consciousness arises only in the unborn child
In the prenatal stage the relinking consciousness may be said to exist only passively and not actively since the child is still part of the body of the mother and has no separate independent existence nor does it contact the external world
When however the child is born and assumes a separate existence and begins to contact the external world then it may be said that the bhavanga nature of the prenatal state of mind gives way for the first time to a fully conscious mind process the vithicitta
Distance is no bar to the sequence of cause and effect
Reference had already been made to the Buddha's reprimand of a bhikkhu called Sati for declaring as having been taught by the Buddha that consciousness passes from existence to existence
In the relinking consciousness arises the whole energy of the previous consciousness and thus the embryo while inheriting the characteristics of the new parents inherits also the impressions of the past experiences of the dying man
How else can one explain characteristics not accounted for by heredity
How else can one account for different characteristics in twins born of the same parents and growing under the same environment
We have now studied death from several angles
From whatever angle we look at death it is an integral part of the great process of life
Death is like the break up of an electric bulb
The light is extinguished but not the current and when a fresh bulb is fixed the light reappears
Similarly there is a continuity of life current the break up of the present body does not extinguish the current of Kammic energy which will manifest itself in an appropriate fresh body
The simile is not on all fours with life
Whereas there is nothing to bring the electric current and the fresh bulb together the type of life led the nature of thought entertained the quality of deeds performed will be strong enough to cause an immediate relinking consciousness of like nature to arise on the principle that like attracts like
Thus the dying man is drawn to an environment good or bad which he has created for himself by his thought word and deed for on these depend the nature of our future life
Every moment we are creating our future
Every moment then we must be careful
If we can visualize the immensity of the past and the immensity of the future the present loses its seemingly compelling importance
If we could but visualize the vistas of innumerable births and deaths through which we will pass in the future we should not we could not fear just this one death out of the endless series of birth and deaths rises and falls appearances and disappearances which constitute the ceaseless process of samsaric life
There is yet another law the understanding of which helps in the understanding of death
It is the Law of Becoming or bhava which is a corollary to the Law of Change or anicca
Becoming or bhava is also one of the factors in the scheme of Dependent Origination
According to Buddhism the Law of Becoming like the Law of Change is constantly at work and applies to everything
While the Law of Change states that nothing is permanent but is everchanging the Law of Becoming states that everything is always in the process of changing into something else
Not only is everything changing but the nature of that change is a process of becoming something else
Not only is everything changing but the nature of that change is a process of becoming something else however short or long the process may be
Briefly put the Law of Becoming is this Nothing is but is becoming A ceaseless becoming is the feature of all things
A small plant is always in the process of becoming an old tree
There is no point of time at which anything is not becoming something else
Rhys Davids in his American lectures has said In every case as soon as there is a beginning there begins also at that moment to be an ending
If you stand by the sea and watch how wave upon wave rises and falls one wave merging into the next one wave becoming another you will appreciate that this entire world is also just that  becoming and becoming
If you can stand by a bud continuously until it becomes a flower you will be amazed to see that the condition of the bud at one moment appears to be no different from its condition at the next moment and so on until before your very eyes the change has taken place through you could not discern it at all
The process is so gradual one stage merging into the next so imperceptibly
It is a becoming
If you close your eyes to this process if you see the bud one day and then see it a day later then only will you see a change
Then only will you speak in the terms of buds and flowers and not in terms of a process of a becoming
If you can keep on looking at a newborn babe without a break for ten years you will not perceive any change
The baby born at am
appears just the same at am
or at noon
Each moment shows no difference from the next
One condition merges into the next so imperceptibly
It is a becoming a continuous process of becoming
Close your eyes to this process and see the baby once a month
then only will you perceive a change
Then only can you speak in terms of baby and boy and not in terms of a process or a becoming
If you think you can watch minutely the progress of time see whether you can divide it into present past and future as do grammarians speaking of present tense past tense and future tense
In the view of Buddhist philosophy time is one continuous process each fragmentary portion of time merging into the other and forming such an unbroken continuity that no dividing line can precisely be drawn separating past time from present or present time from future
The moment you think of the present and say to yourself this moment is present time it is gone  vanished into the past before you can even complete your sentence
The present is always slipping into the past becoming the past and the future is always becoming the present
Everything is becoming
This is a universal process a constant flux
It is when we miss the continuity of action that we speak in terms of things rather than processes or becomings
Biology says that the human body undergoes a continual change all the cells composing the body being replaced every seven years
According to Buddhism changes in the body are taking place every moment
At no two consecutive moments is the body the same
In the last analysis it is a stream of atoms or units of matter of different types which are every moment arising and passing away
The body is thus constantly dying and reliving within this existence itself
This momentary death takes place every moment of our existence
In the Visuddhi Magga it is said that in the ultimate sense the life span of living beings is extremely short being only as much as the duration of a single conscious moment
Just as a chariot wheel continues the Visuddhi Magga when it is rolling touches the ground at one point only of the circumference of its tire so too the life of living beings lasts only for a single conscious moment
When that consciousness has ceased the being is said to have ceased Thus we see that every moment of our lives we are dying and being reborn
This being so why should we dread just one particular moment of death the moment that marks the end of this existence
When there are innumerable moments of death why fear the occurrence of one particular moment
Ignorance of the momentary nature of death makes us fearful of the particular death that takes place at the last moment of existence here especially as the next moment of living is not seen nor understood
The last moment in this existence is just one of the innumerable moments of death that will follow it
It is not life in this existence only that is a process of becoming
The process of becoming continues into the next existence also because there is a continuity of consciousness
The last consciousness in one life is followed by what is known as a relinking consciousness in the next life
The process of one consciousness giving rise to another continues unbroken the only difference being a change in the place where such consciousness manifests itself
Distance is no bar to the sequence of cause and effect
Life is a process of grasping and becoming and death is a change of the thing grasped leading to a new becoming
Grasping is a continuous feature where human living is concerned
It is this grasping that leads to becoming
What causes grasping
Where there is thirst there is grasping
It is this thirst this desire this craving this willtolive this urge which is known as tanha that causes grasping
The Kammic energy resulting from this tanha is like fire
It always keeps on burning and is always in search of fresh material upon which it can sustain itself
It is ever in search of fresh conditions for its continued existence
At the moment of the dissolution of the body that unexpected desireenergy that residuum of Kamma grasps fresh fuel and seeks a fresh habitation where it can sustain itself
Thus proceeds the continuous flux of grasping and becoming which is life
Let us now examine the unduly dreaded dying moment which marks the end of man's present existence only to commence another
The physical condition of any dying man is so weak that the volitional control by the mind at the dying moment lacks the power to choose its own thoughts
This being so the memory of some powerfully impressive and important event of the dying man's present existence will force itself upon the threshold of his mind the forcible entry of which thought he is powerless to resist
This thought which is known as the maranasaññajavana thought and precedes the cuticitta or terminal thought can be one of three types
Firstly it can be the thought of some powerfully impressive act done which the dying man now recalls to mind
Secondly the powerfully impressive act of the past can be recalled by way of a symbol of that act as for instance if he had stolen money from a safe he may see the safe
Thirdly the powerfully impressive act of the past may be recalled by way of a sign or indication of the place where he is destined to be reborn by reason of such act as for instance when a man who has done great charitable acts hears beautiful divine music
This is called gati nimitta or the sign of destination
It is symbolic of his place of rebirth
These three types of thoughtobjects which he cannot consciously choose for himself are known as death signs and any one of them as the case may be will very strongly and vividly appear to the consciousness of the dying man
Then follows the cuti citta or terminal thought or death consciousness
This last thought series is most important since it fashions the nature of his next existence just as the last thought before going to sleep can become the first thought on awakening
No extraneous or arbitrary power does this for him
He does this for himself unconsciously as it were
It is the most important act of his life good or bad that conditions the last thought moment of a life
The kamma of this action is called garuka kamma or weighty Kamma
In the majority of cases the type of act which men habitually perform and for which they have the strongest liking becomes the last active thought
The ruling thought in life becomes strong at death
This habitual kamma is called acinna kamma
The idea of getting a dying man to offer cloth to the Sangha or the idea of chanting sacred texts to him is in order to help him to obtain a good terminal thought for himself by way of asañña kamma or deathproximate Kamma but the powerful force of inveterate habit can supervene and in spite of the chantings by the most pious monks available the memory of bad deeds repeatedly performed may surge up to his consciousness and become the terminal thought
The reverse can also occur
If the last few acts and thoughts of a person about to die are powerfully bad however good he had been earlier then his terminal thought may be so powerfully bad that it may prevent the habitually good thought from surging up to his consciousness as is said to have happened in the case of Queen Mallika the wife of King Pasenadi of Kosala
She lived a life full of good deeds but at the dying moment what came to her mind was the thought of a solitary bad deed done
As a result she was born in a state of misery where she suffered but it was only for seven days
The effects of the good Kamma were suspended only temporarily
There is a fourth type of Kamma that can cause the terminal thought to arise
This last type prevails when any of the foregoing three types of Kamma is not present
In that event one of the accumulated reserves of the endless past is drawn out
This is called katatta kamma or storedup Kamma
Once the terminal thought arises then follows the process of thought moments lawfully linked with it
This terminal thought process is called maranasañña javana vithi
The terminal thought goes through the same stages of progress as any other thought with this differences that whereas the apperceptive stage of complete cognition known as javana or impulsion which in the case of any other thought occupies seven thoughtmoments
At this apperceptive stage the dying person fully comprehends the deathsign
Then follows the stage of registering consciousness when the deathsign is identified
This consciousness arises for two thoughtmoments and passes away
After this comes the stage of death consciousness
Then occurs death
This is what happens in this existence
Now let us consider what happens in the next existence
Already the preliminaries for the arrival of a new being are in preparation
There is the male parent and there is the female parent
As explained previously a third factor a psychic factor is necessary to complete the preliminaries for the arising of a live embryo and that is the relinking consciousness which arises in the next existence in the appropriate setting  the mother's womb
On the conjunction of these three factors life starts in the mother's womb
There is no lapse of time no stoppage of the unending stream of consciousness
No sooner has the deathconsciousness in the dying man passed away than rebirth consciousness arises in some other state of existence
There is nothing that has traveled from this life to the next
Even the terminal thought did not travel
It had the power to give rise to the passive or bhavanga state
At the moment of birth which marks a separate existence through contact with the outer world the unconscious or subconscious bhavanga state gives way to the vithicitta or conscious mind
From birth onwards activity again comes into play propelled by desire in some form or another
So proceeds the onward course of the lifeflux desirepropelled and desiremotivated
Now what is the relevancy of a knowledge of the law of conditionality to the question of our attitude towards death
Once we thoroughly comprehend the fact that the will to live proceeds from life to life we come to appreciate the view that this life and the next is but one continuous process
So also the life following and the next thereafter
To one who understands life thus as nothing more nor less than a long continuous process there is no more reason to grieve at death than at life
They are part of the same process  the process of grasping the process of giving effect to the willtolive
Death is only a change in the thing grasped
The man enriched with the knowledge of the law of conditionality comprehends that birth induces death and death induces birth in the round of sansaric life
He therefore cannot possibly be perturbed at death
To him birth is death and death is birth
An appreciation of the law of conditionality will reveal to him the importance of living his life well and when he has lived his life well death is the birth of greater opportunities to live a still better life
That is how he regards death
It all depends on the way one looks at death
Suppose there is only one gate to a house is that an exit gate or an entrance gate
To one who is on the road side of the gate it is an entrance gate
To the inmate of the house it is an exit gate but for both of them it is the selfsame gate which is thus differently viewed
As Dahlke says Dying is nothing but a backward view of life and birth is nothing but a forward view of death In truth birth and death are phases of an unbroken process of grasping
Death is a departure to those whom the dying man leaves behind
It is also an arrival to the members of the new family into which he is reborn
It is death or birth according to the way we look at it but we can only be oneway observers
If we observe the deathprocess we are not in a position to observe the birth process and if we observe the birth process we are not in a position to observe the death process
So birth and death do not get coordinated in our minds as one connected process
By our failure to see the close sequence of the two processes the coordination of birth with death or death with birth we are led to the illusion or at least the wish that we can have the one without the other
We want life but we do not want death
This is an impossibility
Clinging to life is clinging to death
The salient feature of life is clinginggrasping  and the logical result of clinging according to the law of conditionality is death
If you want to avert death you have to avert life you have to reverse the process of conditionality
This can only be done by abandoning the desire to cling the desire to grasp
Let there be no attachment to life
If you attach yourself unduly to the things of life happiness you may have for a brief time but some day when the things to which you have attached yourself disintegrate and disappear as they must by virtue of that mighty law of change working in conjunction with the equally mighty law of conditionality then the very objects of joy become objects of sorrow
To your disappointment and disgust you will find that all sources of earthly joy are sources of sorrow
You will then agree with the poet who said Earth's sweetest joy is but pain disguised As great was the joy of attachment so great will be the sorrow of detachment
Is not this suffering
Is not this wearisome  one day to pursue a phantom with excitement next day to abandon it with disgust one day to be exalted and the next day to be depressed
How long will your sense of selfrespect allow you to be thrown up and down this way and that like a football
Is it not far more satisfactory far more dignified far safer and far wiser to go through life unattached
If misfortune has to come it will if sickness has to come it will
We cannot change the events of life but we can certainly change our attitude towards them
The laws of change and conditionality will help us here
Fears and sorrows will change into hopes and joys
To such a one living a life of calm and peace viewing life with equanimity death holds no fears and terrors
Cheerful and unafraid he can face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calm
Let us now consider the cases of two persons who were overpowered with grief at the bereavement they had to suffer
First let us consider the case of Patacara
She lost her husband who was bitten by a snake
She was too weak to cross a river with both her children  a new born babe and a child about one year old
So she left the elder child on the bank and waded through the water with her newborn babe with the greatest difficulty
Having reached the thither shore and having left the newborn babe there she was returning through the water to reach the elder child
She had hardly reached midstream when a hawk swooped down on the newborn babe and carried it away thinking it to be a piece of flesh
When Patacara seeing this cried out in frantic grief raising both her hands the elder child on the other bank thinking that his mother was calling him ran into the river and was drowned
Alone weeping and lamenting she was proceeding now to her parental home whither she had intended going with her husband and her two children when one by one these calamities occurred
As she was proceeding she met a man returning from her home town and inquired from him about her parents and her brother
This man gave the dismal news that owing to a severe storm the previous day her parental house had come down destroying both her father and her mother and also her brother
As he spoke he pointed to some smoke rising into the air far away and said That is the smoke rising from the one funeral pyre in which are burning the bodies of your father mother and brother Completely distracted with grief she ran about like a mad woman regardless of her falling garments
Agony was gnawing at her heart agony of the most excruciating type
Advised to go to the Buddha she went and explained her plight
What did the Buddha tell her
Patacara be no more troubled
This is not the first time thou hast wept over the loss of a husband
This is not the first time thou hast wept over the loss of parents and of brothers
Just as today so also through this round of existence thou hast wept over the loss of so many countless husbands countless sons countless parents and countless brothers that the tears thou has shed are more abundant than the waters of the four oceans As the Buddha spoke these words of wisdom and consolation Patacara's grief grew less and less intense and finally not only did her grief leave her altogether but when the Buddha preached to her and concluded his discourse Patacara reached the stage of streamentry the first stage of sainthood
Now what is it that contributed to the removal of grief from the mind of Patacara
It is the keen realization of the universality of death
Patacara realized that she had lived innumerable lives that she had suffered bereavement innumerable times and that death is something which is always occurring
While Patacara realized the universality of death by reference to her own numerous bereavements in the past Kisagotami realized it by reference to the numerous bereavements occurring to others around her in this life itself
When her only child died her grief was so great that she clung to the dead body not allowing any one to cremate it
This was the first bereavement she had ever experienced
With the dead child firmly held to her body she went from house to house inquiring for some medicine that would bring back life to her child
She was directed to the Buddha who asked her to procure a pinch of white mustard seed but it should be from a house where no death had taken place
She then went in search of this supposed cure for her child which she thought was easy to obtain
At the very first house she asked for it but when she inquired whether any death had taken place under that roof she received the reply What sayest thou woman
As for the living they be few as for the dead they be many She then went to the next house
There also she came to know that death had made its visit to that house as well
She went to many houses and in all of them she was told of some father who had died or of some son who had died or of some other relative or friend who had died
When evening came she was tired of her hopeless task
She heard the word death echoing from every house
She realized the universality of death
She buried the dead child in the forest then went back to the Buddha and said I thought it was I only who suffered bereavement
I find it in every house
I find that in every village the dead are more in number than the living Not only was Kisagotami cured of her grief but at the end of the discourse which the Buddha delivered to her she too attained the stage of streamentry
Let us now contrast the cases of Patacara and Kisagotami with that of the ignorant rustic farmer the Bodhisatta was in a former life as mentioned in the Uraga Jataka
Rustic though he was he practiced mindfulness on death to perfection
He had trained himself to think every now and then Death can at any moment come to us This is something on which the majority of us refuse to do any thinking at all
Not only did he make it a habit to think so but he even saw to it that all members of his household did the same
One day while he was working with his son in the field the latter was stung by a snake and died on the spot
The father was not one bit perturbed
He just carried the body to the foot of a tree covered it with a cloak neither weeping nor lamenting and resumed his plowing unconcerned
Later he sent word home through a passerby to send up one parcel of food instead of two for the midday meal and to come with perfumes and flowers
When the message was received his wife knew what it meant but she too did not give way to expressions of grief neither did her daughter nor her daughterinlaw nor the maidservant
As requested they all went with perfumes and flowers to the field and a most simple cremation took place with no one weeping
Sakka the chief of gods came down to earth and proceeding to the place where a body was burning upon a pile of firewood inquired from those standing around whether they were roasting the flesh of some animal
When they replied It is no enemy but our own son Then he could not have been a son dear to you said Sakka
He was a very dear son replied the father
Then asked Sakka why do you not weep The father in reply uttered this stanza
Similar questions were asked from the dead son's mother who replied thus
Sisters surely are loving to their brothers
Why do you not weep asked Sakka of the dead man's sister
She replied
Sakka then asked the dead man's wife why she did not weep
She replied thus
Lastly Sakka asked the maidservant why she did not weep especially as she had stated that the master was never cruel to her but was most considerate and kind and treated her like a foster child
This was her reply
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
An anthology of the Samyutta Nikaaya prepared by Mr
John D
Ireland has already appeared in the Wheel series
It contained selections from all the five books of this large collection of the Buddha's discourses
The present volume supplements it with a further selection from the same books

As this Discourse Collection which follows an arrangement according to subject is representative of all the basic teachings of the Buddha it places at the disposal of the anthologist an array of suttas discourses rich both in variety and in excellence
He can however do justice to them within limits choosing such texts as bring out the salient features of those teachings in a more appealing way
Naturally he would have a preference for pithy discourses and those well illustrated by scintillating similes and metaphors
The present anthology while drawing from the existing translations and the commentaries attempts to repay a part of this debt in the form of suggested improvements on both
In the Notes to the Anthology the discussion of certain doctrinal points has entailed the inclusion of many parallel texts which are likely to elucidate the meanings of the selected Discourses
Thus have I heard
The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthi at Jeta Grove in Anathapindika's Park
Now a certain deity when the night was far spent shedding radiance with his effulgent beauty over the whole Jeta Grove came into the presence of the Exalted One and coming saluted him and stood at one side
So standing he spake thus to the Exalted One
How did you dear sir cross the flood 
Without tarrying friend and without hurrying did I cross the flood
But how did you dear sir without tarrying without hurrying cross the flood
When I friend tarried then verily I sank when I friend hurried then verily I was swept away
And so friend untarrying unhurrying did I cross the flood
Thus spoke the deity and the Teacher approved
And then the deity noting that approval saluted the Lord and having circumambulated him by the right vanished there and then
Near Saavatthi
Now a certain deity when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and coming saluted him and stood at one side
So standing he spake thus to the Exalted One
Do you dear sir know for them that live deliverance freedom detachment
I do know O friend for them that live deliverance freedom detachment
In what manner and how dear sir do you know for them that live deliverance freedom detachment
The Exalted One was once staying near Saavatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's Park
And a great number of the Satullapa company of deities when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and so standing one of the deities uttered this verse before the Exalted One
near Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove
Now Daamali son of the gods when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and coming saluted him and stood at one side
So standing he spake thus to the Exalted One
Thus I have heard The Exalted One was once staying at Saaketa in the Anjana Grove in the deer Park
Now Kakudha son of the gods when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and stood at one side
So standing Kakudha the son of gods spake thus to the Exalted One
Do you rejoice recluse
On getting what friend
Then do you grieve recluse
What is lost friend
Well then recluse you neither rejoice nor grieve
That is so friend
at Saavatthi standing at one side Rohitassa son of the gods spoke thus to the Exalted One
Where lord one does not get born nor grow old nor die nor pass away nor get reborn is one able lord by walking to come to know that end of the world or to see it or to get there
Where friend one does not get born nor grow old nor die nor pass away nor get reborn that end of the world I say you are not able by walking to come to know or to see or to arrive at
Wonderful is it lord
Marvelous it is lord how well it is said by the Exalted One 'Where friend one does not get born or to arrive at'
In times past lord I was a seer Rohitassa by name son of Bhoja gifted so that I could fly through the air
And so swift lord was my speed that I could fly just as quickly as a master of archery welltrained expert proficient a past master in his art armed with a strong bow could without difficulty send a light shaft far past the area covered by a palmtree's shadow
And so great lord was my stride that I could step from the eastern to the western sea
In me lord arose such a wish as this 'I will arrive at the end of the world by walking' And though such lord was my speed and such my stride and though with a lifespan of a century living for hundred years I walked continuously for a hundred years save the while I spent in eating drinking chewing or tasting or in answering calls of nature save the while I gave way to sleep or fatigue yet I died on the way without reaching the end of the world
Wonderful is it lord marvelous is it lord how well it is said by the Exalted One 'Where friend one does not get born or to arrive at' But neither do I say friend that without having reached the end of the world there could be an ending of ill
It is in this very fathomlong physical frame with its perceptions and mind that I declare lies the world and the arising of the world and the cessation of the world and the path leading to the cessation of the world
At Saavatthi On one occasion the Exalted One was instructing enlightening inspiring and gladdening the monks by a sermon relating to Nibbaana
And the monks with their whole minds applied attentive and intent were listening to the Dhamma
Then it occurred to Maara the evil one This recluse Gotama is instructing enlightening inspiring and gladdening the monks by a sermon relating to Nibbana
What if I were now to approach the recluse Gotama in order to blindfold him So Maara the evil one assuming the guise of a plowman bearing a mighty plow on his shoulder and holding an oxgoad in his hand his hair disheveled his raiment hempen his feet spattered with mud drew near to the Exalted One and said
Have you seen my oxen O recluse
But what have you evil one to do with oxen
Mine only recluse is the eye mine are the visible forms mine is the sphere of consciousness of the eye's contact
Where recluse will you go to escape from me
Mine only recluse is the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind mine are the mental objects mine is the sphere of consciousness of mental contact
Where recluse will you go to escape from me
Thine only evil one is the eye thine are the visible forms and thine is the sphere of consciousness of the eye's contact
But where O evil one eye is not visible forms are not the sphere of consciousness of the eye's contact is not there O evil one is no access for you
Thine only O evil one is the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind But where O evil one mind is not mental objects are not the sphere of consciousness of mental contact is not there O evil one is no access for you
Then Maara the evil one thought The Exalted One knows me
The Blessed One knows me
And sad and sorrowful he vanished there and then
at Saavatthi Sister Selaa dressed herself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe entered Savatthi for alms
And when she had gone about Saavatthi for it and had returned after the meal she seated herself at the foot of a certain tree for noonday rest
The Maara the evil one desirous of arousing fear trepidation and horripilation in her desirous of making her lose her concentration went up to her and addressed her in verse
Now it occurred to Sister Selaa Who now is this human or nonhuman that utters this verse And then it occurred to her Surely it is Maara the evil one who utters this verse desirous of arousing in me fear trepidation and horripilation desirous of making me lose my concentration Then the Sister Selaa knowing it was Mara the evil one replied him with verses
Then Maara the evil one thought Sister Selaa knows me and sad and sorrowful he vanished there and then
The Exalted One was once dwelling near Gayaa on the Stone Couch at the haunt of the Yakkha Suciloma
Now at that time Khara the yakkha and Suciloma the yakkha were passing by not far from the Exalted One
And Khara said to Suciloma That's a recluse
No that's not a recluse that's a mere shaveling but let me first ascertain whether he is a recluse or a mere shaveling
Then Suciloma came up to the Exalted One and bent his body up against him
And the Exalted One bent his body away
Then Suciloma said Do you fear me recluse
It is not that I fear you friend but contact with you is an evil thing
Recluse I will ask you a question
If you do not answer me I will either derange your mind or split your heart or I will take you by the feet and throw you over the Ganges
I see no one friend in the whole world with its gods Maras and Brahmas with its progeny of recluses and Brahmans gods and men who is able to derange my mind or split my heart or take me by the feet and throw me over the Ganges
Nevertheless friend ask whatever question you like
Thus have I heard The Exalted One was once staying near Saavatthi at Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's Park
There are these four nutriments monks for the maintenance of beings that have come to birth or for the assistance of them that seek to become
Which are the four
Material food coarse or fine secondly contact thirdly volition fourthly consciousness
These four are nutriments for maintenance of beings that have come to birth or for the assistance of them that seek to become
When this had been said the venerable Moliya Phagguna said to the Exalted One
Who now is it lord who feeds on the consciousness nutriment
Not a fit question said the Exalted One
I am not saying feeds on
If I were saying so to that the question would be a fit one
But I am not saying so
And I not saying so if anyone were to ask me 'Of what now lord is consciousness the nutriment' this were a fit question
And the fit answer to it is 'The consciousness nutriment is condition for renewed becoming of rebirth in the future
When that is come to pass the sixfold sensesphere contact comes to be' Who now lord exercises contact
Not a fit question said the Exalted One
I am not saying exercises contact
If I were saying so the question would be a fit one
But I am not saying so
And I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus 'Conditioned now by what lord is contact' this were a fit question
And the fit answer there would be 'Conditioned by the sixfold sensesphere is contact conditioned by contact is feeling' Who now lord is it who feels
Not a fit question said the Exalted One
I am not saying feels
If I were saying so the question would be a fit one
But I am not saying so
And I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus 'Conditioned now by what lord is feeling' this were a fit question
And the fit answer there would be 'Conditioned by contact is feeling conditioned by feeling is craving' Who now lord is it who craves
Not a fit question said the Exalted One
I am not saying craves
If I were saying so the question would be a fit one
But I am not saying so
And I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus 'Conditioned now by what lord is craving' this were a fit question
And the fit answer there would be 'Conditioned by feeling is craving conditioned by craving is grasping' Who now lord is it who grasps
Not a fit question said the Exalted One
I am not saying grasps
If I were saying so the question would be a fit one
But I am not saying so
And I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus 'Conditioned now by what lord is grasping' this were a fit question
And the fit answer there would be 'Conditioned by craving is grasping
Conditioned by grasping is becoming
Conditioned by becoming birth and conditioned by birth decayanddeath grief lamenting suffering unhappiness despair come to pass
Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill'
But from the utter fading away and cessation of the sixfold sphere of sensecontact Phagguna comes cessation of contact cessation of feeling from cessation of feeling cessation of craving from cessation of craving cessation of grasping from cessation of grasping cessation of becoming from cessation of becoming cessation of birth cessation of decayanddeath of grief lamenting suffering unhappiness despair
Such is the cessation of of this entire mass of ill
at Saavatthi
Now the venerable Bhuumija arising at eventide from solitary meditation came into the presence of the venerable Saariputta and exchanging greetings with him and compliments of friendship and courtesy sat down at one side
And so seated the venerable Bhuumija spoke thus to the venerable Saariputta
There are friend Saariputta certain recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself
There are friend Saariputta certain other recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by another
There are friend Saariputta yet other recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself as well as by another
And there are friend Saariputta still other recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought neither by oneself nor by another but they have arisen by chance
Herein friend Saariputta of what view is the Exalted One
What has he declared
And how if we were answering should we be repeating his views correctly without misrepresenting him and be explaining in accordance with he Dhamma so that no blame with justification can come upon us
The Exalted One has said friend that happiness and ill have arisen through a cause
And because of what
Because of contact
Thus speaking one will be repeating the views of the Exalted One correctly without misrepresenting him and one will be explaining in accordance with the Dhamma and no blame with justification can come upon him
Therein friend those recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  even that they do because of contact
Whatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by another  even that they do because of contact
Whatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself as well as by another  even that they do because of contact
And whatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought neither by oneself nor by another but have arisen by chance  even that they do because of contact
Therein friend recluses and brahman believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  that they will experience without contact is verily an impossibility And whatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought either by oneself nor by another but have arisen by chance  that they will experience without contact is verily an impossibility
The venerable Aananda was listening to this conversation between the venerable Saariputta and the venerable Bhuumija
Then the venerable Aananda went into the presence of the Exalted One saluted him and sat on one side
Thus seated the venerable Ananda so far as the venerable Saariputta had conversed with the venerable Bhuumija told all to the Exalted One
Well said
Well said
Aananda
Well might Saariputta explain as he has done
Indeed Aananda I have said that happiness and ill have arisen through a cause
And because of what
Because of contact
Thus speaking one will be repeating my views correctly without misrepresenting me and be explaining in accordance with the Dhamma and no blame with justification can come upon him
Therein Aananda those recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  even that they do because of contact
Therein Aananda those recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  that they will experience without contact is verily an impossibility
When body is there Aananda due to bodilyintention there arises internally pleasure and pain
When speech is there Aananda due to verbalintention there arises internally pleasure and pain
When mind is there Aananda due to mentalintention there arises internally pleasure and pain

Conditioned by ignorance Aananda either one by oneself concocts a bodily formation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and pain or others concoct for him that bodily formation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and pain
And Aananda either he deliberately concocts that bodily formation or he does it unwittingly
Either one by oneself Aananda concocts that verbalformation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and pain or others concoct it for him
And Aananda either he deliberately concocts it or he does it unwittingly
Either one by oneself Aananda concocts that mentalformation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and pain or others concoct it for him
And Aananda either he deliberately concocts that bodily formation or he does it unwittingly
These items Aananda are affected with ignorance
But from the utter fading away and cessation of ignorance Aananda that body is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and pain
That speech is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and pain
That speech is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and pain
That mind is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and pain
That field is not that ground is not that sphere is not that occasion is not conditioned by which there arises for him internal pleasure and pain
Thus have I heard
The Exalted One was once staying in the territory of the Bhaggas at Crocodilehaunt in Bhesakala Grove in the Deer Park
Then the householder Nakulapitaa came to the Exalted One saluted him and sat down at one side
Seated at one side the householder Nakulapitaa said thus to the Exalted One Lord I am a decrepit oldman aged far gone in years
I have reached the last stage of my life
I am sick in body and always ailing
It is rarely that I get the opportunity to see the Exalted One and those monks whose very sight is edifying
Let the Exalted One admonish and instruct me so that it will conduce to my weal and happiness for a long time to come
True it is true it is householder that your body is sickly soiled and cumbered
For householder who would claim even a moment's health carrying this body about except through sheer foolishness
Wherefore householder thus you should train yourself Though my body is sick my mind shall not be sick Thus householder must you train yourself
Then Nakulapitaa the householder rejoiced in and appreciated the words of the Exalted one and rising from his seat he saluted the lord circumambulated him by the right and then approached the venerable Saariputta
Having approached and saluted him he sat down at one side
And the Venerable Saariputta said thus to the householder Nakulapitaa who was seated at one side Clear are your faculties householder pure and clean is the complexion of your face
Have you had the opportunity today to listen to a talk of Dhamma from the very presence of the Exalted One
How could it be otherwise venerable sir
I have just been sprinkled with the nectar of a talk of Dhamma by the Exalted One
And in what way householder were you sprinkled with the nectar of a talk of Dhamma by the Exalted One
Well Venerable Sir I went to the Exalted One saluted him and sat down at one side
As I sat thus Venerable Sir I said to the Exalted One 'Lord I am a decrepit oldman aged far gone in years
I have reached the last stage of my life
I am sick in body and always ailing
It is rarely that I get the opportunity to see the Exalted One and those monks whose very sight is edifying
Let the Exalted One admonish and instruct me so that it will conduce to my weal and happiness for a long time to come'
When I spoke thus Venerable Sir the Exalted One said to me 'True it is true it is householder that your body is sickly soiled and cumbered
For householder who would claim even a moment's health carrying this body about except through sheer foolishness
Wherefore householder thus you should train yourself Though my body is sick my mind shall not be sick' Thus householder must you train yourself'
Thus it was Venerable Sir that I have been sprinkled with the nectar of a talk of Dhamma by the Exalted One
But did it not occur to you householder to question the Exalted One further
Thus 'Pray how far Lord is body sick and mind is sick too
And how far is body sick and mind not sick' I would travel far indeed Venerable Sir to learn the meaning of this saying from the presence of the Venerable Saariputta
It is good if the Venerable Saariputta should think it fit to expound to me the meaning of this saying
Well then listen householder apply your mind thoroughly and I will speak
Even so Venerable Sir said householder Nakulapitaa in response to the Venerable Saariputta
TheVenerable Saariputta thus spake And how is body sick householder and mind sick too
Herein householder the untaught average person taking no account of the noble ones unskilled in the doctrine of the noble ones untrained in the doctrine of the noble ones taking no account of the good men unskilled in the doctrine of the good men regards form as self or self as having form or form as being in self or self as being in form
'I am form' says he 'form is mine' and is obsessed with that idea
Even as he is so obsessed that form changes becomes otherwise and owing to the change and transformation of form there arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards feeling as self or self as having feeling or feeling as being in self or self as being in feeling
'I am the feeling' says he 'feeling is mine' and is obsessed with that idea
Even as he is so obsessed that feeling changes becomes otherwise and owing to the change and transformation of feeling there arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards perception as self or self as having perception or perception as being in self or self as being in perception
'I am perception' says he 'perception is mine' and is obsessed with that idea
Even as he is so obsessed those formations change become otherwise and owing to the change and transformation of formations there arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards formations as self or self as having formations or formations as being in self or self as being in formations
'I am the formations' says he 'formations are mine' and is obsessed with that idea
Even as he is so obsessed those formations changes become otherwise and owing to the change and transformation of formations there arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards consciousness as self or self as having consciousness or consciousness as being in self or self as being in consciousness
'I am consciousness' says he 'consciousness is mine' and is obsessed with that idea
Even as he is so obsessed that consciousness changes becomes otherwise and owing to the change and transformation of consciousness there arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
That householder is how body is sick and mind is sick too
And householder how is body sick but mind not sick
Herein householder the welltaught noble disciple who discerns the noble ones who is skilled in the doctrine of the noble ones welltrained in the doctrine of the noble ones who discerns the good men who is skilled in the doctrine of the good men well trained in the doctrine of the good men regards not form as self nor self as having form nor form as being in self nor self as being in form
He says not 'I am form' he says not 'form is mine' nor is he obsessed with that idea
That form of him who is not so obsessed changes becomes otherwise but owing to the change and transformation of form there do not arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards not feeling as self nor self as having feeling nor feeling as being in self nor self as being in feeling
He says not 'I am the feeling feeling is mine' nor is he obsessed with that idea
That feeling of him who is not so obsessed changes becomes otherwise but owing to the change and transformation of feeling there do not arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards not perception as self nor self as having perception nor perception as being in self nor self as being in perception
He says not 'I am perception perception is mine' nor is he obsessed with that idea
That perception of him who is not so obsessed changes becomes otherwise but owing to the change and transformation of perception there do not arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards not formations as self nor self as having formations nor formations as being in self nor self as being in formations
He says not 'I am the formations formations are mine' nor is he obsessed with that idea
Those formations of him who is not so obsessed changes becomes otherwise but owing to the change and transformation of formations there do not arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He regards not consciousness as self nor self as having consciousness nor consciousness as being in self nor self as being in consciousness
He says not 'I am consciousness consciousness is mine' nor is he obsessed with that idea
That consciousness of him who is not so obsessed changes becomes otherwise but owing to the change and transformation of consciousness there do not arise in him sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
Thus householder body is sick but mind is not sick
Thus spake the Venerable Saariputta and the householder Nakulapitaa rejoiced in the words of the Venerable Saariputta
at Saavatthi Then the Exalted One said
The one who approaches is not released the one who does not approach is released
Approaching form monks consciousness in persisting it would persist
With form as its support with form as its foothold sprinkled over with delight it may come by growth increase abundance
Approaching feeling Approaching perception Approaching formations monks consciousness in persisting would persist
With formations as its support with formations as its foothold sprinkled over with delight it may come by growth increase abundance
Were a man monks to declare thus 'Apart from form apart from feeling apart from perception apart from formations I will show forth the coming or the going or the decease or the rebirth or the growth or the increase or the abundance of consciousness'  to do that were impossible
If lust for the formmode monks is abandoned by a monk by that abandonment of lust the support is cut off and there is no establishment of consciousness
If lust for the feelingmode If lust for the perceptionmode If lust for the formationsmode If lust for the consciousnessmode monks is abandoned in a monk by the abandonment the support is cut off and there is no establishment of consciousness
That unestablished consciousness not growing and not concocting is freed due to its freedom it is steady by its steadiness it is contented owing to its contentment he is not troubled
Being untroubled of himself he is perfectly tranquilized and he knows Exhausted is birth lived is the holy life done is the task there is nothing beyond this for the conditions of this existence
At Saavatthi Then the Exalted One said
A monk who is skilled in the seven points monks who is an investigator in three ways is called 'accomplished' in this Norm and Discipline one who has reached mastership superman
And how monks is a monk skilled in the seven points

Herein monks a monk fully understands form the arising of form the ceasing of form and the path leading to the ceasing of form
He fully understands the satisfaction there is in form the misery that is in form the escape from form
He fully understands feeling
He fully understands perception
He fully understands formations
He fully understands consciousness the arising of consciousness the ceasing of consciousness and the path leading to the ceasing of consciousness
He fully understands the satisfaction there is in consciousness the misery that is in consciousness the escape from consciousness
And what monks is form
It is the four great elements and that form which is dependent on the four great elements
From the arising of nutriment comes the arising of form from the ceasing of nutriment is the ceasing of form and the path leading to the ceasing of form is this Noble Eightfold Path to wit Right Views Right Thoughts Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
That pleasure that happiness which arises because of form that is the satisfaction that is in form
In so far as form is impermanent is fraught with suffering and is liable to change that is the misery that is in form
That restraint of desire and lust that putting away of desire and lust which are in form that is the escape from form
Whatsoever recluses and brahmans monks by thus fully understanding form its arising its ceasing and the path leading to its ceasing by thus fully understanding the satisfaction that is in form the misery that is in form and escape from form are treading towards the disgust for the detachment from and the cessation of form they are rightly treading
They that are rightly treading are firm grounded in this Norm and Discipline
And whatever recluses or brahmans monks by thus fully understanding form its arising its ceasing and the path leading to its ceasing by thus fully understanding the satisfaction the misery and the escape from form are liberated without grasping due to their disgust for detachment from and cessation of form  they are truly liberated
They that are truly liberated are 'accomplished' and to them that are 'accomplished' there is no whirling round for purposes of designation
And what monks is feeling
Monks there are these six classes of feeling to wit feeling that is born of contact with eye feeling that is born of contact with ear nose tongue body mind
This monks is called feeling
From the arising of contact comes the arising of feeling from the ceasing of contact is the ceasing of feeling and the path leading to the ceasing of feeling is this Noble Eightfold Path to wit Right Views Right Concentration
That pleasure that happiness which arises because of feeling  that is the satisfaction that is in feeling
In so far as feeling is impermanent fraught with suffering and liable to change this is the misery that is in feeling
That restraint of desire and lust that putting away of desire and lust which are in feeling that is the escape from feeling
Now whatsoever recluses or brahmans monks by thus fully understanding feeling its arising its ceasing and the path leading to its ceasing by thus fully understanding the satisfaction the misery that is in feeling and the escape from feeling are treading towards the disgust for the detachment from and the cessation of feeling they are rightly treading
They that are rightly treading are firm grounded in this Norm and Discipline
And whatsoever recluses and brahmans monks by thus fully understanding feeling are liberated without grasping due to their disgust for detachment from and cessation of feeling  they are truly liberated
They that are truly liberated are 'accomplished' and for them that are 'accomplished' there is no whirling round for purposes of designation
And what monks is perception
Monks there are these six classes of perception perception of form perception of sound of smell taste tangibles and ideas that monks is called perception
From the arising of contact comes the arising of perception from the ceasing of contact is the ceasing of perception and the path leading to the ceasing of perception is this Noble Eightfold Path to wit Right Views Right Concentration there is no whirling round for purposes of designation
And what monks are the formations
Monks there are these six classes of intentions
The intention of forms the intention of sounds of smells of tastes of tangibles and of ideas
These monks are called formations
From the arising of contact comes the arising of formations from the ceasing of contact is the ceasing of formations and the path leading to the ceasing of formations is this Noble Eightfold Path to wit Right views Right Concentration there is no whirling round for purposes of designation

And what monks is consciousness
Monks there are these six classes of consciousness eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness and mindconsciousness
From the arising of 'nameandform' comes the arising of consciousness from the ceasing of nameandform is the ceasing of consciousness and the path leading to the ceasing of consciousness is this Noble Eightfold Path to wit Right Views Right Concentration
That pleasure that happiness which arises because of consciousness  that is the satisfaction which is in consciousness
In so far as consciousness is impermanent fraught with suffering and liable to change this is the misery that is in consciousness
That restraint of desire and lust that putting away of desire and lust which are in consciousness that is the escape from consciousness
Now whatsoever recluses or brahmans monks by thus fully understanding consciousness its arising its ceasing and the path leading to its ceasing by thus fully understanding the satisfaction the misery that is in consciousness and the escape from consciousness are treading towards the disgust for the detachment from and the cessation of consciousness they are rightly treading
They that are rightly treading are firm grounded in this Norm and Discipline
And whatsoever recluses and brahmans monks by thus fully understanding consciousness its arising its ceasing and the path leading to its ceasing by thus fully understanding the satisfaction the misery and the escape from consciousness are liberated without grasping due to their disgust for detachment from and cessation of consciousness  they are truly liberated
They that are truly liberated are 'accomplished' and to them that are 'accomplished' there is no whirling round for purposes of designation
In this way monks is a monk skilled in the seven points
And how monks is a monk an investigator of the three ways
As to that monks a monk investigates things by way of the elements by way of sensespheres by way of Dependent Arising
That is how monks a monk becomes an investigator of the three ways
A monk who is skilled in the seven points monks who is an investigator of the three ways  he is called 'accomplished' in this Norm and Discipline one who has reached mastership superman
Once the Exalted One was staying near Saavatthi in East Park at the palace of Migaara's mother with a great gathering of monks
Now on that occasion  it was the Uposatha day of the fifteenth on the night when the moon was full  the Exalted One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks
Then a certain monk rose from his seat and arranging his robe on one shoulder bowed before the Exalted One with folded hands and thus addressed the Exalted One Lord I would fain question the Exalted One on a certain point if the Exalted One would grant me an answer to the question
Then sit in your own seat monk and ask what you like
Even so lord replied that monk to the Exalted One and having sat down in his own seat thus addressed the Exalted One Are these the five aggregates of grasping lord to wit the formaggregate of grasping the feelingaggregate of grasping the perceptionaggregate of grasping the perceptionaggregate of grasping the formationsaggregate of grasping and the consciousnessaggregate of grasping
That is so monk
Those are the five aggregates of grasping as you say
It is well lord said that monk rejoicing in and appreciating the words of the Exalted One and put another question But these five aggregates of grasping lord in what are they rooted
These five aggregates of grasping monk have their root in desire
It is well lord said that monk and put another question Lord are just these five aggregates of grasping the whole of grasping or is there any grasping apart from these five aggregates of grasping
No indeed monk these five aggregates of grasping are not the whole of grasping and yet there is no grasping apart from those five aggregates of grasping
But it is the desire and lust in these five aggregates of grasping that is the grasping therein
It is well lord said that monk and put another question
Might there be lord a variety of desire and lust in the five aggregates of grasping
There might be monk replied the Exalted One
Herein monks one thinks thus 'May I be of such a form in the future
May I be of such a feeling in the future
May I be of such a perception in the future
May I be of such a formation in the future' In this way monk there might be a variety of desire and lust in the five aggregates of grasping
It is well lord said that monk and put another question
Pray lord how far does the definition of the term 'aggregate' go in the case of the aggregates
Any kind of form whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  this is called the aggregate of form
Any kind of feeling
Any kind of perception
Any kind of formations
Any kind of consciousness whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  this is called the aggregate of consciousness
Thus far monk does the definition of 'aggregate' go in the case of aggregates
It is well lord said that monk and put another question
What lord is the reason what is the condition for designating the formaggregate
What is the reason what is the condition for designating the feelingaggregate
What is the reason what is the condition for designating the formationsaggregate
What is the reason what is the condition for designating the consciousness aggregate
The four great elements monk are the reason the four great elements are the condition for designating the formaggregate
Contact is the reason contact is the condition for designating the feelingaggregate
Contact is the reason contact is the condition for designating the perceptionaggregate
Contact is the reason contact is the condition for designating the formationsaggregate
Nameandform is the reason nameandform is the condition for designating the consciousnessaggregate
It is well lord said that monk and put another question
Pray lord how does there come to be the personalityview
Herein monk the untaught average person taking no account of the noble ones unskilled in the doctrine of the noble ones untrained in the doctrine of the noble ones taking no account of the good men unskilled in the doctrine of the good men untrained in the doctrine of the good men regards form as self or self as having form or form as being in self or self as being in form he regards consciousness as self on self as having consciousness or consciousness as being in self or self as being in consciousness
That is how monk there comes to be the personalityview
It is well lord said that monk and he put another question
But lord how does there not come to be the personalityview
Herein monk the welltaught noble disciple who discerns the noble ones who is skilled in the doctrine of the noble ones welltrained in the doctrine of the noble ones who discerns the good men who is skilled in the doctrine of the good men welltrained in the doctrine of the good men does not regard form as self does not regard consciousness as self or self as having consciousness or consciousness as being in self or self as being in consciousness
That is how monk there does not come to be the personalityview
It is well lord said that monk and put another question
Pray lord what is the satisfaction what is the misery and what is the escape in the case of form
What is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of feeling
What is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of perception
What is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of formations
What is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of consciousness
The pleasure and happiness monk that arises in dependence on form  this is the satisfaction in the case of form
Form is impermanent painful and subject to change  this is the misery in the case of form
The restraint of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for form  this is the escape in the case of form
The pleasure and happiness monk that arises in dependence on feeling in dependence on perception in dependence on formations in dependence on consciousness this is the escape in the case of consciousness
It is well lord said that monk and put another question
How lord should one know how should one see so that in this body with its consciousness and in all external signs there be no idea of 'I' or 'mine' no latent conceits therein
Any kind of form monk whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near he sees all of it with right understanding thus 'This is not mine this am not I this is not my self
Any kind of feeling
Any kind of perception
Any kind of formations
Any kind of consciousness whatever 'this is not my self'
It is when one knows thus monk and sees thus that there come to be in him no idea of 'I' or 'mine' and no latent conceits in this body with its consciousness and in all external signs
At that moment there arose in a certain monk this train of thought
So it seems form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self formations are not self consciousness is not self
Then what self will the actions done by the not self touch
Then the Exalted One knew with his mind the thought in that monk's mind and he addresses the monks thus
It is possible monks that some foolish man unknowing and ignorant with his mind dominated by craving might fancy that he could bypass the Master's teaching thus 'So it seems form is not self Then what self will the actions done by the notself touch' But monks you have been trained by me by the counterquestion method on certain occasions in regard to certain teachings
Now what do you think monks
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent lord
That which is impermanent is it painful or pleasant
Painful lord
That which is impermanent painful and subject to change is it fit to be regarded thus 'This is mine this am I this is my self
Surely not lord
What do you think monks
Is feeling permanent perception formations consciousness
Surely not lord
Therefore monks any kind of form whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all form should be seen as it is with right understanding thus 'This is not mine this am not I this is not my self' Any kind of feeling perception formations consciousness 'not my self
Thus seeing the welltaught noble disciple becomes dispassionate towards form becomes dispassionate towards feeling becomes dispassionate towards perception becomes dispassionate towards formations becomes dispassionate towards consciousness
Being dispassionate he lusts not for it not lusting he is liberated when he is liberated there comes the knowledge 'liberated' And he understands 'Exhausted is birth lived is the holy life done is the task there is nothing beyond this for the conditions of this existence'
Once the Venerable Saariputta and the Venerable Upasena were staying near Raajagaha in Cool Grove at Snakeshood Grotto
Now at that time a snake had fallen on the venerable Upasena's body
Then the venerable Upasena addressed the monks saying Come hither friends lift this body of mine on to a couch and take it outside before it be scattered here just like a handful of chaff
At these words the venerable Saariputta said to the venerable Upasena We see no change in the venerable Upasena's body no change for the worse in his faculties
Yet the venerable Upasena says 'Come hither friends just like a handful of chaff' Indeed friend Saariputta it is to him who thinks 'I am the eye the eye is mine' or 'I am the ear the ear is mine' or 'I am the nose the nose is mine' or 'I am the tongue the tongue is mine' or 'I am the body the body is mine' or 'I am the mind the mind is mine' that there would be any change in the body any change for the worse in the faculties
But as for me friend I do not think 'I am the eye the eye is mine or 'I am the mind the mind is mine' How then friend Saariputta could there be for me any change in the body any change for the worse in the faculties
So then it seems the venerable Upasena has long since eradicated the latent conceits of 'I' and 'mine' Hence it is that it occurs not thus to the venerable Upasena 'I am the eye the eye is mine or 'I am the mind the mind is mine' Then those monks put the venerable Upasena's body on a couch and bore it outside
And the venerable Upasena's body there and then was scattered just like a handful of chaff
Owing to a dyad monks consciousness comes into being
And how monks does consciousness come into being owing to a dyad
Owing to the eye and forms arises eyeconsciousness
The eye is impermanent changing 'becomingotherwise' Forms are impermanent changing 'becomingotherwise' Thus this dyad is fleeting and transient impermanent changing and 'becomingotherwise' That cause that condition that gives rise to eyeconsciousness  that also is impermanent changing becomingotherwise' And how monks could eye consciousness having arisen dependent on an impermanent condition become permanent
Now the comingtogether the falling together the meetingtogether of these three things this monk is called 'eyecontact' Eyecontact too is impermanent changing 'becomingotherwise' And how monks could eyecontact having arisen dependent on an impermanent condition become permanent
Contacted monks one feels
Contacted one intends
Contacted one perceives
Thus these states also are fleeting and transient impermanent changing 'becomingotherwise'
Owing to the ear and sounds arises earconsciousness
The ear is impermanent
Owing to the nose and scents arises noseconsciousness
The nose is impermanent
Owing to the tongue and savors arises tongueconsciousnessThe tongue is impermanent
Owing to the body and tangibles arises bodyconsciousness
The body is impermanent
Owing to the mind and ideas arises mindconsciousness
The mind is impermanentcontacted monks one feels
Contacted one intends
Contacted one perceives
Thus these states also are fleeting and transient impermanent changing 'becomingotherwise'
Thus monks consciousness comes into being owing to a dyad
Gods and men monks delight in forms they are excited by forms
Owing to the change the fading away and the cessation of forms woefully monks dwell gods and men
They delight in sounds scents savors tangibles and ideas and are excited by them Owing to the change the fading away and the cessation of ideas woefully monks do gods and men dwell
But the Tathaagatha monks the Arahant the FullyAwakened One having understood as they really are the arising the passing away the satisfaction the misery and the escape from forms he delights not in forms is not attached to forms is not excited by forms
By the change the fading away and the cessation of forms blissfully monks dwells the Tathaagata
So also of sounds and the rest blissfully monks dwells the Tathaagata
Thus spake the Exalted One
So saying the Wellfarer the Teacher added this further
Once a number of eldermonks were dwelling at Macchikaasanda in Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder approached those eldermonks
Having approached them he saluted them and sat down at one side
So seated Citta the householder said to those eldermonks Let the venerable sirs the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal
And those eldermonks accepted by silence
Thereupon Citta the householder understanding the acceptance of those eldermonks rose from his seat saluted them and having circumambulated them by the right went away
Now the eldermonks when the night was gone robed themselves in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe went to the dwelling of Citta the householder and on reaching it sat down on seats prepared
Then Citta the householder came to those eldermonks and saluting them sat down at one side
So seated Citta the householder said to the venerable elder
As to these divers views that arise in the world Venerable Sir such as 'Eternal is the world not eternal is is the world finite is the world infinite is the world soul and body are the same soul and body are different the Tathaagata exists after death he exists not after death he both exists and exists not after death he neither exists nor exists not after death' also as to the sixtytwo views set forth in the Brahmajaala  owing to the existence of what Venerable Sir do these views prevail owing to the nonexistence of what do these views not prevail
At these words the venerable chiefelder was silent
Then Citta the householder put the same question for a second and a third time but the venerable chiefelder was silent
Now on that occasion the venerable Isidatta was the junior of that company of monks
Then the venerable Isidatta said to the venerable chief elder Venerable Sir may I reply to this question of Citta the householder
You may reply to it Isidatta
Now householder your question was this was it not
Yes Venerable Sir
Now householder as to those divers views that arise in the world such as 'Eternal is the world' and as to these sixtytwo views set forth in the Brahmajaala it is owing to the 'personalityview' that they arise and if the personalityview exists not they do not exist
But Venerable Sir how comes to be the personalityview
Herein householder the untaught average man That is how householder there comes to be the personalityview
But Venerable Sir how does there not come to be the personalityview
Herein householder the welltaught noble disciple That is how householder there does not come to be a personalityview
Whence comes the venerable Isidatta my lord
I come from Avanti householder
There is at Avanti Venerable Sir a clansman named Isidatta an unseen friend of ours who has gone forth
Has your reverence seen him
I have householder
Pray Venerable Sir where does that venerable one now dwell
At these words the venerable Isidatta was silent
Is your reverence the worthy Isidatta
I am householder
Then may the worthy Isidatta take his pleasure at Macchikaasanda
Lovely is wild Mango Grove
I will do my best to supply the worthy Isidatta with the requisites of robes alms lodgings and medicaments
That is kindly said householder
Thereupon Citta the householder was delighted with the words of the venerable Isidatta and rejoicing in them with his own hand he served the elder monks with choice food both hard and soft until they had eaten their fill
Then the eldermonks having had their fill and withdrawn hand from bowl rose up and went away
Then said the venerable chief elder to the venerable Isidatta
It was good friend Isidatta the way that question occurred to you
That question did not occur to me
Therefore friend Isidatta if on another occasion such a question arises you may reply in like manner
Then the venerable Isidatta having set his lodgings in order took bowl and robe and departed from Macchikasanda
And in thus departing from Macchikaasanda he was gone for good and came not back any more
Once the Exalted One was staying among the Mallas at Uruvelakappa a township of the Mallas
Then Bhadragaka the headman approached the Exalted One
Having drawn near he saluted him and sat down at one side
So seated Bhadragaka the headman said to the Exalted One
Well for me lord if the Exalted One would teach me the arising and passing away of ill
If I were to teach you headman the arising and the passing away of ill with reference to past time saying 'Thus it was in the past' you would have doubt and perplexity
And if headman I were to teach you the arising and the passing away of ill with reference to future time saying 'So will it be in the future' you would likewise have doubt and perplexity
But seated here as I am headman I will teach you even as you are sitting there the arising and the passing away of ill
Do you listen attentively
Apply your mind and I will speak
Even so lord replied Bhadragaka the headman to the Exalted One
The Exalted One said
Now what think you headman
Are there any people in Uruvelakappa owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame there would come upon you sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair
There are such people in Uruvelakappa lord
But headman are there any people in Uruvelakappa owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame no sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair would come upon you
There are such people in Uruvelakappa lord
Now headman what is the reason what is the cause why sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair would come upon you in respect of some but not of others
In the case of those lord owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame there would come upon me sorrow I have desire and attachment
And as for the others lord I do not have such desire and attachment in their case
You say 'I do not have such desire and attachment in their case' Now headman by this Norm thus seen and known attained and plumbed into without any timelag you draw an inference in regard to the past and future thus 'Whatsoever ill has arisen in the past  all that is rooted in desire caused by desire
Desire indeed is the root of ill' Wonderful lord
Marvelous lord how well said is the saying of the Exalted One 'Whatsoever ill that arises all that is rooted in desire caused by desire
Desire indeed is the root of ill'
Now Lord there is my boy  Ciravaasi is his name
He lodges away from here
Rising up betimes lord I send off a man saying Go my man inquire of Ciravaasi Then lord till that man comes back again I am in an anxious state lest some sickness may have befallen Ciravaasi
Now what think you headman
Would sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair come upon you if your boy Ciravaasi were slain imprisoned or suffered loss or blame
Lord if such were to befall my boy Ciravasi even my life will be at stake how should I not have sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair
In this manner too you must know this fact 'whatsoever ill that arises all that is rooted in desire caused by desire
Desire is indeed the root of ill'
Now what think you headman
When you had not seen had not heard about Ciravasi's mother did you then have any desire or longing or love for her
No indeed lord
But headman when you got sight of her heard about her did you then have desire or longing or love for her
Yes Lord
Now what think you headman
Would sorrow and lamentation come upon you if Ciravaasi's mother were slain or imprisoned or had any loss or blame
Lord if such were to befall Ciravaasi's mother even my life itself will be at stake how should I not have sorrow and despair
So in this manner too headman you must know this fact 'Whatsoever ill that arises all that is rooted in desire caused by desire
Desire indeed is the root of ill'
Once upon a time monks a shefalcon suddenly swooped down and seized a quail
Then monks the quail while it was being carried away by the shefalcon thus lamented 'Just my bad luck and lack of merit
for trespassing outside my own pasture into others' property
If I had kept my own ancestral beat today this shefalcon would have been no match for me if it came to a fight'
'But what is that pasture quail which is your own ancestral beat'
'It is a field turned up by the plowshare a place all covered with clods'
Then monks the shefalcon without being stiff in her assertion of strength not caring to argue with the quail on her own strength released the quail saying 'Off with you quail but even by going there you will not escape me'
So monks the quail went off to a plowed field to a place all covered with clods perched on a great clod and stood challenging the shefalcon thus 'Now come on you falcon
Now come on you falcon'
Then monks the shefalcon without being stiff in her assertion of strength not caring to argue with the quail on her own strength poising both her wings swooped down upon the quail
But monks as soon as the quail knew that the shefalcon had come too close to her she slipped inside that very clod
And then monks the falcon shattered her breast thereon
So it is monks with one who goes roaming out of his own pasture in others' property
Wherefore monks roam ye not outside your own pasture in others' property
To those who so roam monks Maara will get access
In them Maara will find a support
And what monks is not one's own pasture but others' property
It is the five kinds of sensepleasure
What five
Forms cognizable by the eye desirable charming pleasant delightful passionfraught and alluring
Sounds cognizable by the ear scents cognizable by the nose savors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body desirable charming pleasant delightful passionfraught and alluring
This monks is not one's own pasture but other's property in the case of a monk
Monks do ye range in your own pasture keep to your ancestral beat
To those who range their own pasture who keep to their ancestral beat Maara will get no access
In them Maara will find no support
And what monks is a monk's own pasture
What is his ancestral beat
It is the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
What four
Herein monks a monk dwells as regards body contemplating body ardent fully aware and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
He dwells as regards feeling contemplating feeling ardent fully aware He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind He dwells as regards mindobjects contemplating mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
This monks is a monk's own pasture this is his ancestral beat
On a certain occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Sumbha country in a township of the Sumbhas called Sedaka
There the Exalted One addressed the monks
Once upon a time monks a bambooacrobat set up his pole and called to his pupil Medakathaalika saying 'Come my lad Medakathaalika climb the pole and stand on my shoulders'
'All right master' replied the pupil to the bambooacrobat climbed the pole and stood on his master's shoulder
Then monks the bambooacrobat said to his pupil 'Now Medakathaalika my lad you protect me well and I shall protect you
Thus warded and watched by each other we will show our tricks get a good fee and come down safe from the bamboopole'
At these words Medakathaalika the pupil said to the bambooacrobat 'No no
That won't do master
You look after yourself master and I'll look after myself
Thus warded and watched each by himself we'll show our tricks get a good fee and come down safe from the bamboopole'
Therein that is the right way  said the Exalted One
Just as Medakathaalika the pupil said to his master 'I'll protect myself' so monks should the Foundations of Mindfulness be practiced
'I'll protect others' so should the Foundations of Mindfulness be practiced
Protecting oneself monks one protects others protecting others one protects oneself

And how monks does one in protecting oneself protect others
By frequent practice development and makingmuchof
Thus monks in protecting oneself one protects others
And how monks does one in protecting others protect oneself
By forbearance by nonviolence by lovingkindness by compassion
Thus monks in protecting others one protects oneself
'I shall protect myself' with this intention monks the Foundations of Mindfulness should be practiced
'I shall protect others' with this intention the Foundations of Mindfulness should be practiced
Protecting oneself one protects others protecting others one protects oneself
Once the Exalted One was dwelling in the Sumbha country at Sedaka a township of the Sumbha people
There the Exalted One addressed the monks
Suppose monks a large crowd of people flock together crying 'The beautyqueen
The beautyqueen' And if that beautyqueen is also a highly gifted performer as to dancing and singing a still larger crowd would flock together crying 'The beautyqueen is dancing she is singing'
Then comes a man who wishes to live and does not wish to die who desires happiness and abhors suffering
The people say to him 'Look here man
Here's a bowl filled to the brim with oil
You must carry it round between the large crowd and the beautyqueen
A man with uplifted sword will follow behind your back and wherever you spill even a little drop of the oil there itself he will chop off your head'
Now what do you think monks
Would that man without paying attention to that bowl of oil solicit heedlessness from outside
Surely not lord
Well monks this parable I have given to make the meaning clear
And its significance is this 'The bowl filled to the brim with oil' monks is a term for mindfulness relating to body
Wherefore monks thus must you train yourselves 'Mindfulness relating to body shall be cultivated by us shall be made much of made a vehicle a groundplan
It shall be made effective wellacquainted and consummate in us' Thus monks must you train yourselves

Translations from the Pali Text Society Translation Series
In the case of the first flood they bring out the ethical significance of the Noble Eightfold Path in the avoidance of the two extremes of selfindulgence and selfmortification
The former extreme tends to moral stagnation while the latter leads to extreme forms of asceticism which are not conducive to a healthy development of the mind
Since both attitudes of 'stagnation' and 'struggling' are ineffective against the flood of sensedesires the Buddha's Middle Path advocates sanity and moderation
Extreme reactions to the second flood took the form of Eternalism and Annihilationism which again reflect attitudes of attachment and aversion
The Eternalist 'leaned back' while Annihilationist 'overreached' himself in the face of the problem of existence
 Delighting in the existence monks are gods and men they are attached to existence and rejoice in it
When Dhamma is being preached their minds do not leap towards it do not become pleased established or released therein
Thus monks do some lean back
And how monks do some others overreach themselves
Being afflicted by and loathing this very existence some others delight in nonexistence thus 'Inasmuch as this being when the body breaks up after death gets annihilated will be destroyed and be no more after death this is peace this is excellent this is the true state' Thus monks some others overreach themselves
The former ran after his shadow while the latter tried in vain to outstrip it both being equally obsessed I taking it to be real
Here the Buddha's solution was to recognize the shadow for what it is by 'seeingthingsastheyare'  as dependently arisen  thus dispelling both Narcissistic love and morbid hate for it and ushering in equanimity in the light of wisdom
 and how monks do those who have eyes see
Herein a monk sees the 'become' as 'become' Having seen the 'become' as 'become' he treads the path towards the disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to the 'become' Thus it is monks that those who have eyes see
The third flood brought forth the dichotomy between the extreme views of absolute existence and absolute nonexistence  'nothing exists'
Avoiding these two extremes runs the Middle Path of Dependent arising 'He who with right insight sees the arising of the world as it really is does not hold with the nonexistence of the world
And he who with right insight sees the passing away of the world as it really is does not hold with the nonexistence of the world'
In place of the static worldview of the metaphysicians and the nihilists we have here a dynamic vision of the rise and fall of phenomena
The fourth flood resulted in the polarization of the extreme attitudes of extraversion and introversion both of which spelt delusion
This is the paradox of consciousness interdependent as it is on nameand form  each providing a footing or support for the other
The deepest riddle of existence lay between them as they doted upon each other forming the whirlpool of samsaara
'The consciousness turns back from nameandform it does not go beyond'
However much it tried to dart out of the vicious cycle with the force of samkhaaras or formations it found itself confronted by nameandform
Epistemologically all views  even those based on jhaanic experience  stood condemned since they all centered around some aspect or other of nameandform which in its turn implicated consciousness itself
'A seeing man will see nameandform and having seen he will understand just those things
Verily let him see much or little yet the experts do not speak of purity thereby'
Similarly the almost refrainlike pronouncement running through the concluding sections of the Brahmajaala Sutta 'even that is due to contact' is a disqualification of the whole range of sixtytwo views since 'contact' comes under 'nameandform'
The Buddha discovered a way out of this impasse in a unique realm of meditation in which the consciousness neither partakes of extraversion nor of introversion and is free from the samkhaaras that keep one leashed to existence
It is the 'DeliverancethroughKnowledge' having as its Fruit the Knowledge of Nibbaanic freedom The consciousness now is 'nonmanifestative' providing no footing for nameandform and it is neither distracted or diffuse without nor established within neither 'approaching' nor 'receding' neither 'turnedtowards nor 'turnedoutwards' neither 'focused' nor 'excitable'
Having no object it is 'unestablished' and noncontinuing'
It is not a state of pent up tension forcibly held in check by formations
This level of transcendental experience was so subtle and refractory to definition that the Buddha declared This too were a state very difficult to see that is to say the calming of all formations the renunciation of all assets the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbaana
The two words 'appatittham' and 'anaayuuham' can thus be interpreted with reference to the four floods in their ethical existential metaphysical and epistemological aspects
The validity of the interpretation is doubtful as there is Canonical evidence to show that some of the metaphors are suggestive of a different order of facts
To begin with the 'abyss' is clearly defined in the eponymous sutta at S
in terms of physical pains
A synonym monks is this for painful feelings of the body namely the 'abyss' Similarly 'the ocean' is defined for us at S
in the 'Ocean' Sutta in words which are in full accord with the imagery of the verse The eye monks is the ocean for a man
It has the 'force' of visual forms
Whoever withstands that force of visual forms he O monks is called 'one who has crossed the ocean of eye with its waves eddies seizures and demons
Having crossed over and gone beyond the saint stands on dry ground The ear The nose The tongue The body The mind monks is the ocean stands on dry ground This quotation itself provides the clue to the twelve eddies which as the comm
also suggests are the internal and external spheres of sense
The five arenas are indeed the five types of sensepleasures for at S
the arahant is called 'one who has crossed the five floods' It is the floods or currents that provide the sphere of action for the eddies and the abyss
The three stains can also be interpreted in accordance with the comm as lust hatred and ignorance on the strength of the following reference at S He in whom lust hatred and ignorance have faded away is the one who has crossed this ocean so hard to cross with its seizures demons and the danger of waves The 'turningtwice' most probably refers to the painful feeling and the pleasant feeling which form the counterparts in the 'seesaw' experience of the worldling
That it is a kind of blind alley for him is clearly stated at S He on being touched by painful feeling delights in sensepleasures
And why is this
Because the uninstructed worldling O monks knows no way out of painful feeling other than the sensepleasures Lastly as for the significance of that one root in the verse the following citation from 'Phassamuulaka Sutta' at S should suffice Monks there are these three feelings which are born of contact rooted in contact originating from contact and which depend on contact
Which are the three
Pleasant feeling unpleasant feeling and neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling
It is the painful bodily feeling that constitutes the most immediate and palpable aspect of suffering
The arahant's claim to have transcended all suffering will not be fully valid unless he has 'crossed over' this 'quaking abyss' as well
That paradoxical samaadhi of the arahant is just the 'refuge' from the 'floods' the 'eddies' and the 'abyss' The most emphatic illustration of this fact is perhaps the SakalikaSutta at S where the Buddha being mindful and aware is seen bearing up with an unruffled brow the bodily pains which are painful sharp acute distressing and unwelcome while gods draw near and express wonder and admiration at this remarkable feat of endurance
This aspect of Nibbaanic bliss is summed up in a verse at S 'Concentrated mindful and aware the disciple of the Buddha understands feelings the origin of feelings the state wherein they are destroyed and the path leading thereto
By the destruction of feelings the monk is devoid of hankering and is fully appeased'
The significance of the metaphor used with reference to painful bodily feelings can also be appreciated in the context of the Buddha's definition of the 'development of the body' and the 'development of the mind' in the Mahaa Saccaka Sutta
In whomsoever Aggivessana in this manner and on either side the pleasant feelings that are arisen do not obsess the mind due to the development of his body and the painful feelings that are arisen do not obsess the mind due to the development of his mind it is thus Aggivessana that he becomes one who is developed as to body and as to mind too The arahant in attaining to the 'Influxfree Deliverance of the Mind and the Deliverance through Wisdom' reaches the perfection of these two ideals
As the 'unshakable deliverance of the mind' arahantship is the unfailing refuge and shelter even from the quaking abyss of bodily feelings
While the 'Influxfree Deliverance of the Mind' provides him with an inner retreat from painful bodily feelings the 'Deliverance through Wisdom' serves as a permanent safeguard against the seductive and deluding character of pleasant feeling
The arahant 'freedinbothways' can therefore disengage himself from all percepts in addition to remaining undeluded in the face of experience
'Unto him who is detached from percepts there are no fetters and to him who is emancipated through wisdom there are no delusions'
Everything comes under the sway of name as a result of man's urge to familiarize himself with the world
Sorting out naming and defining things are practical necessities in ordinary life since they help us avoid 'trippingover' just as in the case of one groping in the dark
There is a constant need to recognize things and the easiest way of doing it is by putting a sign on them
While the five senses have their own separate modes of indentation mind largely relies on the labelingmode of attaching a name in the course of its own groping
Since mind partakes of the 'range' and pasture of the other five senses as well its own mode of indentation has a preponderating influence over the rest
Thus perceptual data of the five external senses in all their permutations and combinations finally come to be assigned names and pigeonholed as 'things' This convenient but superficial indentation beclouds the mind and prevents the immediate understanding of sensecontact
Its mode of apperception therefore is largely a process of 'imagining' and 'figuringout' of objects located in the darkness of ignorance and in its blind groping the phenomenon of sensecontact as such hardly receives any serious attention

The overriding power of name could only be nullified by the process of 'attendingbywayofmatrix' in order to understand the very structure of senseexperience
By comprehending the phenomenon of sensecontact for what it is the imaginary world of 'things' will cease to obsess the mind
When the light of wisdom is turned on there will be no 'gropinginthedark' and consequently no necessity to imagine or 'figureout' things for one now 'knows and sees' for oneself that there is 'Nothing'
And what monks is the passing away of the world
Dependent on the eye and forms arise visual consciousness
The concurrence of the three is contact
Conditioned by contact is feeling
Conditioned by feeling is craving
By the utter fading away and cessation of that craving grasping ceases by the ceasing of grasping becoming ceases by the ceasing of becoming birth ceases by the ceasing of birth decayanddeath grief lamentation suffering despair cease
Such is the ceasing of this entire man of Ill
This monks is the passing away of the world
The same sermon is introduced in the preceding sutta with the words I will teach you monks the arising and passing away of suffering The culmination of the notself attitude is the eradication of the conceit ' am'the percipient of 'notself attains to the eradication of the conceit 'I am' which is Nibbaana here and now
The removal of the subtle conceit 'I am' is tantamount to a destruction of that delusive superimposed 'frame' from which all measurings and reckonings of the world were directed through the instrumentality of the sensefaculties and by which the mass of relative concepts in the form of sensedata were so organized as to give a picture of 'the world' with 'self' mirrored on it
What we call the normal functioning of the five external senses is but the outward manifestation of the notion 'Iam' Given the notion 'Iam' monks there set in then the five sensefaculties 
When this 'frame' is dismantled the conveyors  the senses  losing their provenance and sanction become ineffective and their usual objects too fade away into insignificance Wherefore monks that sphere should be known wherein the eye ceases and the perception of forms fades away wherein the ear ceases and the perception of sounds fades away the nose ceases and the perception of smell fades away the tongue ceases and the perception of tastes fades away the body ceases and the perception of touch fades away the mind ceases and the perception of ideas fades away
That sphere should be known that sphere should be known
All percepts are 'signs' and when signs cease to be 'significant' they are as good as nonexistent
The 'signless deliverance of the mind' as one of the doorwaystodeliverance points to this reorientation of the arahant's mental life
Thus although he is wide awake when he is in this paradoxical samaadhi although his senseorgans appear to be all intact yet he is free form normal senseexperience
That very eye will be there those very visible forms will be there yet one will not experience the corresponding sphere of sense that same body will be there those very tactile objects will be there yet one will not experience the corresponding sphere of sense
He is not one with the normal perception nor is his perception abnormal
He is not nonpercipient nor has he put an end to perception
In the case of a monk who is fully emancipated in mind friends though many forms cognizable by the eye may come within the range of the eye they never obsess his mind unalloyed is his mind steady and become imperturbable and he sees its passing away
Though many sounds cognizable by the ear may come many smells cognizable by the nose many tastes cognizable by the tongue many tangibles cognizable by the body many ideas cognizable by the mind may come within the range of the mind they never obsess his mind unalloyed is his mind steady and become imperturbable and he sees its passing away
This 'nonmanifestative consciousness' of the arahant which is uninfluenced by extraneous forces and is steady and imperturbable is perhaps the 'Inertial Frame' in search of which Relativity Physics has in modern times set out
As the scientist gradually awoke to the truths of relativity he too longed for a 'stateofrest' from the everdeepening conflict of viewpoints' But his search for this imaginary laboratory was unsuccessful for like Rohitassa he searched it outside relying on the demonstrative apparatus known to science
The Buddha's exhortation to Rohitassa is therefore of refreshing relevance to the modern age in that it implies that the sphere wherein one transcends the labyrinths of relativity is not somewhere in outer space but within this very fathomlong physical frame
As an interesting sidelight it may be mentioned that according to the Theory of Relativity light is the topvelocity in the universe it propagates even in vacuum its velocity is constant and it propagates in all directions
Now that nonmanifestative consciousness of the arahant is described in the suttas as infinite and 'lustrous allaround' The arahant's consciousness is untrammeled by nameandform and has no object as its point of focus
Hence it is infinite and he is one of infinite range as regards his mental compass
Wisom according to the Buddha is a light which excels all other forms of light known to the world
It has the property of penetration and its function is comprehension of the consciousness which is called an illusion
Hence in that illumination through wisdom consciousness becomes infinite and 'lustrousallround' The mind thus 'lusterbecome and gone to the Fruit of Arahantship' lights up in its turn the five external senses
The senseobjects which are but the denizens of the dark world of ignorance fade away before the penetrative allencompassing luster
The illusion of consciousness  the magic of the senses  thereby becomes fully exposed to the light of wisdom
The six spheres of sense cease altogether and the arahant is now conscious merely of the cessation of existence which is Nibbaana itself
He is conscious in other words of the voidness of the world which the scientist might prefer to call the 'vacuum' which this lightofwisdom now pervades
The scientist however might hesitate to grant the possibility of a 'lightofwisdom' which is not amenable to any demonstrative apparatus
He has recognized only the purely physical notions of light and has already set a limit to this 'topvelocity'  km per second
He considers that 'the discovery of the existence in the Universe of the top velocity is one of the greatest triumphs of human genius and of the experimental capacity of mankind' On the basis of the foregoing observations it can be said that this 'greatest triumph' was made by the Buddha more than years ago when he discovered by means of his 'noble experiment' that the mind is intrinsically luminous and that when cleansed of all extraneous taints it develops that penetrative allpervasive luster of wisdom which liberates one from the labyrinths of the world of relativity
It is a penetration into the truth of impermanence by thorough reflection on the riseandfall of phenomena and the deeper it proceeds the more one becomes aware of the conflict
For Buddhism the conflict of viewpoints is a far more intricate affair than what the scientist would make it out to be
It is not simply a question of a spectator's physical presence at a point in time and space but one that deeply involves such facets of psychological life as interest and attention
Rooted in desire friends are all phenomena originating in attention are all phenomena
The result is an awareness of a conflict that affects life as a whole
This awareness naturally enough is the springboard for utter detachment through the perception of 'notself' the culmination of which as stated above is the eradication of the most subtle conceit of all  the conceit 'Iam'
The Buddha has pointed out that the liberation from the world of senseexperience is not possible until the influxes are made extinct and the influx of the notion of existence can only be destroyed by means of a penetrative perception of cessation focused on senseexperience itself
'As far as is the range of attainments to levels of perception so far is there a penetration into Knowledge'
The 'habitenergy' we have acquired in the course of our blind groping in Samsaara impelled by craving readily flows in in our ordinary sense experience and with its agglutinative effect creates before us a world of 'things' that we can 'grasp' Hence nothing short of an inner illumination could fully penetrate this faade and liberate us from the bondage of the senses
It is noteworthy that the paradoxical samaadhi of the arahants is also called 'aanantarika' in the sense that in it the extinction of the influxes is immediate
In his infinite and alllustrous consciousness where viewpoints have been displaced by an all encompassing vision of truth the 'signaltransmission' as to the impermanence of the senses and their objects occurs at such an infinite velocity that it prevents the most elementary coagulation or compounding which accounts for the six spheres of sense
Rohitassa's fantastic journey which was perhaps the prototype of modern spacetravel was undertaken for the purpose of 'coming to know and to see and reach that end of the world where there is no birth or death' According to the Buddha everything could not be verified in this manner
Monks there are these four realizable things
What four
There are things monks that are realizable through the body
There are things monks that are realizable through memory
There are things monks that are realizable through the eye
There are things monks that are realizable through wisdom
And what monks are the things that are realizable through the body
The eight deliverances monks are realizable through the body
And what through memory
One's former habitations monks are realizable through memory
And what through the eye
The death and rebirth of beings monks is realizable through the eye
And what monks are the things realizable through wisdom
The extinction of influxes monks is realizable through wisdom
These monks are the four realizable things
Just as much as one cannot board a timemachine and race back into the Past in order to verify the fact of one's former lives even so it is inherently impossible for one to take a leap into the Future in order to ascertain whether one has actually destroyed all influxes that make for rebirth
The verification can only be made through the penetrative faculty of wisdom  the 'eye' of wisdom  which gives one the certitude here and now that all influxes of existence as well as the sediments of speech associated with them 'are burnt out and are no more'
That his cycle of Samsaara is breached at its vortex is vouched for the arahant by the breached epicycle that he sees and experiences in his paradoxical samaadhi
The whirlpool cutoff whirls no more  this even this is the end of Ill
The end of the world is thus seen and realized in this very life in one's own immediate experience avoiding all pitfalls of speculative logic  a fact which accounts for such epithets of the Dhamma as 'sanditthiko' 'akaaliko' 'ehipassiko' 'opanayiko' 'paccatam veditabbo vinnuhi' and above all 'atakkaavacaro'
The ensemble of this realization is resented in that stereotyped sentence in the suttas which announces a new understood Extinct is birth lived is the holy life done is the task and there is nothing beyond this for the conditions of this existence
The fact that the arahant has transcended the relativity of space mass motion and time with which the scientist is still grappling is clear enough from certain Canonical statements
It is said that in his 'nonmanifestative consciousness' the concepts of earth water fire and air find no footing and that the relative concepts of long and short are cut off altogether
Likewise the concepts of 'here' 'there' and 'betweenthetwo' have lost their significance for him
He does not consider himself to be anywhere nor can any god or man trace him as to where he 'stands'
He has done away with the 'abode of the mind' and is 'abodeless' in the fullest sense of the term
The distinctions between a 'subtle' and a gross which may well be a reference to the relativity of mass have also faded away
So too the concepts suggestive of the relativity of motion such as 'coming' 'going and 'standing'
Relativity of time which the modern world regards as the 'brainchild' of Einstein was not only discovered but transcended by the Buddha in that extraordinary dimension of the mind
'Deathandbirth'  the most formidable dichotomy of all  has no sway at all in that jhanic consciousness of the emancipated one
The elusive phenomenon of time is hypostatised in Buddhist usage in that multiple personality of Maara  the god of Death
As his epithet 'kinsman of the indolent' ironically suggests he has the vicious trait of lying low in order to take his victims unawares
He is also very aptly called 'the Ender'
Maara as the symbol of death is indeed 'the curfew' that 'tolls the knell of parting day' Now the Buddha and the arahants are those who have outwitted Mara blinded him put him off the track and attained the Deathless
This feat was made possible by a recognition of the principle of the relativity of time
The Buddha discovered that the concepts of birth and death are correlative  the one being given the other follows
And the concept of birth itself is born in the matrix of the notion of becoming or existence
The 'becoming' the existence is an attempt to 'standforth'  that is to stand forth in defiance of the universal law of impermanence
It is an everfailing struggle but the struggle itself continues depending on the supply of fuel which is upaadaana
'Dependent on grasping is becoming having become one undergoes suffering unto the born there is death this is the origin of suffering'
The Buddha realized that Maara's tragic drama of birthdecayanddeath is staged on this supply of fuel itself 'Whatever they grasp in the world by that itself does Maara pursue a man'
Whatever they egotistically conceive of ipso facto it becomes otherwise
The only escape from Mara's strategy therefore lay in the complete givingup of all supplies of fuel which grasping implies
Save by their giving up all  no weal for beings do I behold
With the cessation of the process of grasping and becoming consequent on destruction of craving or 'thirst' all 'assets' are abandoned thus depriving Maara of the basic wherewithal for his drama
Once Mara in his role as Tempter declares in the presence of the Buddha that such assets like sons and cattle are a source of joy to a man but the Buddha's reprisal was that on the contrary they are a source of grief
All assets in the long run turn out to be liabilities
By giving them up the arahant has transcended time and the concepts of existence birth decay and death have lost their significance for him
Nibbaana is not only the Deathless it is also the Birthless
Epithets of Nibbaana such as the 'notbecome' the 'notmade' and 'not compounded' suggest the absence of that fundamental notion of existence which gives rise to the relative distinctions of birth decay and death
Monks there are these three compoundcharacteristics of the compounded
Which are the three
An arising is manifest a passing away is manifest a change in persistence is manifest Monks there are these three uncompounded characteristics of the uncompounded
Which are the three
No arising is manifest no passing away is manifest no change in persistence is manifest
The emancipatedone is 'in the world' but not 'of the world' For him the world is no longer the arena of a lifeanddeath struggle in which he is sorely involved but one vast illustration of the first principles of impermanence suffering and notself  of the separative privative and transformative nature of all existence
He experiences the ambrosial Deathlessness in the very destruction of craving and consequent detachment characteristic of that unique samaadhi that detachment that excellent deathless state which the Sakyan sage attained to being concentrated'  Sn
v

His contemplative gaze is now fixed not on the 'things' with their fluid superficial boundaries but on that nature of things  that causalstatus that causal orderliness namely the 'relatednessofthistothat'
'This being that becomes from the arising of this that arises
This not being that becomes not from the ceasing of this that ceases'
'Whatever is of a nature to arise all that has a nature to cease'
This law of Dependent Arising itself being always 'such' invariable and nototherwise in its contemplation the arahant's mind too is firm and steady
'Mind is steady and wellfreed and he sees its passing away'
Hence he is 'such' in his adaptability and resilience having understood the suchness of all conditioned phenomena
It is to one who takes his stand upon the concepts of existence and birth that the fear of decay and death can occur
To the emancipated one who is fully attuned to the reality of impermanence by giving up all standpoints there can be no fear at all
And when 'Death' does come as surely it must he is no more shocked at it than at the crash of an extremely brittle jar ascertained well in advance to be perforatedbeyonduse  a 'jar' notworthitsname
The prospect of eluding death by traveling into outer space has kindled the imagination of the modern scientist also though unlike Rohitassa he did not take it up in all seriousness
He has however speculated on the possibility of prolonging human life by flying to a distant star many lightyears away in an Einstein rocket
'Theoretically traveling at a sufficiently high speed we can reach the star and return to the Earth within a minute
But on the Earth years will have passes just the same
To all appearances we thus possess a way of prolonging human life though only from the point of view of other people since man ages according to his own time
To our regret however this prospect is illusory if we take a closer look at it'
No wonder that the prospect is illusory particularly when it is examined in the context of the Buddha's teachings
Indeed 'man ages according to his own time' and this as shown above was precisely the point of divergence for the Buddha
That end of the world where one does not get born nor die nor pass away nor get reborn is therefore within this very fathomlong physical frame with its perceptions and mind
This momentous declaration is quite popular with writers on Buddhism and perhaps for that very reason it has rarely enjoyed the privilege of a long annotation
Traditionally too it does not seem to have been much favored in this respect if Buddhaghosa's commentary to the sutta is any indication
As Mrs
Rhys Davids remarks 'It was a great opportunity for exegesis but Buddhaghosa makes no use of it'
This quotation provides the clue to that muchdisputed passage in Itiv
which defines the two 'NibbaanaElements'  the one with residual assets or appendages and the one without them
 And what monks is the Nibbaana element with residual assets
Herein monks a monk is an arahant whose influxes are extinct who has lived the Holy Life accomplished the task laid down the burden reached his Goal whose fetters of existence are fully extinct and who is freed through right knowledge
His five sensefaculties still remain which being undestroyed he partakes of the pleasant and the unpleasant and experiences the pleasurable and the painful
The extinction of lust hatred and delusion in him  this monks is called the NibbaanaElement with residual assets
And what monks is the NibbaanaElement without residual assets
Herein monks a monk is an arahant whose influxes are extinct and is freed through right knowledge
All his feelings monks will even here cool down not having been delighted in
This monks is called the Nibbaana Element without residual assets Once he has experienced within his own sensorium that transcendence which results from the removal of the latest conceit 'Iam' all his influxes are extinguished and he gains mastery over the 'mechanism' of the sixfold sensesphere in its five aspects  the arising the passing away the satisfaction the misery and the escape
For him the sensespheres become detachable since he now knows the principle on which they function  the law of Dependent Arising in its direct and indirect order which pivots upon Ignorance involving the notion 'Iam' While Saupaadidesaa Nibbaanadhaatu enables the Arahant to live 'in the world' Anupaadidesaa Nibbaanadhaatu ensures that he is 'not of the world' Once crossed over the suchlike One comes not back' 'To the further shore they go not twice'

 Upadhi The word has two distinct shades of meaning
Primarily in accordance with its etymology it means 'foundation' 'basis' 'ground' 'substratum' or 'support'
Secondarily in its Canonical usage it often stands for one's possessions
Being less impersonal than 'substratum' it captures the nuances of the secondary sense as well
Being less trenchant than 'clinging' or 'attachment' it is better suited in references to the arahant's 'SaupaadisesaNibbaanadhaatu' since he is no longer attached to the assets which are now for him mere appendages
'What now friend Saariputta is nameandform selfwrought or otherwrought or both selfwrought and otherwrought or else is it neither selfwrought nor otherwrought but arisen by chance
No indeed friend Kotthita nameandform is neither selfwrought nor otherwrought nor both selfwrought and otherwrought and arisen by chance but on the other hand conditioned by consciousness is nameandform
Here the words 'macrocosmic' and 'microcosmic' should be understood strictly according to the context
 The Sutta is found also in the Sutta Nipaata
Its commentary shows some modifications when compared with SA
The banyan tree runners and the Maaluvaa creeper depict a significant feature of thought processes
Once those thoughts connected with love hate dislike delight and terror which originate from within get attached to senseobjects their true source tends to be forgotten and the senseobjects themselves begin to dominate the scene
Just as the banyantree runners having 'grown up' conceal the original trunk and even as the parasite Maluvaa creeper literally 'throws into shade' the trees which gave it nourishment thoughts too once they get 'rooted' in senseobjects bring about an obsession in which their original source is completely ignored
And as it is said at S
p
Phagguna's question Who feeds on the consciousness nutriment  is not a fit question because the very concept of an individual implies both consciousness and nameandform bound in a reciprocal relationship
The passage of consciousness at death is merely a gravitation towards its object nameandform implicit in the last thought moment which thereby crystallizes into a new existence
The vortex has shifted consciousness has changed its station and a new world of experience has unfolded itself
This is the polarization between 'thisness' and otherwiseness' in Samsaaric existence
The other questions of Phagguna concerning contact feeling grasping and craving were similarly disallowed since they all fall within the orbit of the vortical interplay between consciousness and nameandform
 'samucchissatha'
Probably from sam  ud   sish  to remain
Without the support of consciousness nameandform cannot remain within the mother's womb nor can it result in rebirth
If Aananda consciousness having descended into the mother's womb were to slip out would nameandform be reborn into this state of existence No lord
The PTS
ed
follows the variant reading 'nandupasevanam'
For this sense of the word 'anannam'
'To a Supermanthere are only two careers and no other'
The commentary gives more than one interpretation
For instance at SA
I it is explained with particular reference to the preceding phrase thus Done is the task' the meaning is that the sixteenfold task has been accomplished
'Nomorefor thisness' now there is no more Pathdevelopment to be done for this state that is as regards this sixteenfold task or the destruction of defilements
Or else 'forthisness' means beyond this present process of aggregates of such a type there is no other process of aggregates
And he knew that these five aggregates on being comprehended just stand like a tree cut off at the root
Perhaps the meaning of 'naaparam itthattaaya' can best be elicited from the following two Canonical passages
This consciousness turns back from nameandform it does not go beyond
In so far can one be born or grow old or die or pass away or reappear in so far as this is to wit consciousness is dependent on nameandform nameandform on consciousness the six sensespheres on nameandform contact on the six sensespheres feeling on contact craving on feeling grasping on craving becoming on grasping birth on becoming and old age death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are dependent on birth
Thus is the arising of this entire mass of suffering DII f
Mahaapadaana S
In so far only Aananda can one be born or grow old or die or pass away or reappear in so far only is there any pathway for verbal expression in so far only is there any pathway for terminology in so far only is there any pathway for designations in so far only is there a whirling round for a designation of 'thisness' that is to say as far as nameandform together with consciousness
 D
II f
Mahaanidaana S
The very understanding that 'consciousness turns back from nameandform and that it does not go beyond is the savingwisdom which amounts to a full comprehension of the illusion that is consciousness
Between these two links of the Paticca Samuppaada there is a vortex or a whirlinground for a designation of 'thisness'
Now a vortex or an eddy is 'a current running back contrary to the main stream thus causing a circular motion' and this Samsaaric vortex too is the outcome of defying the flux of nature with its three characteristics of impermanence suffering and notself
When the reflexmechanism of the consciousness is discovered the motive force for this whirling round will lose its sanction
The nutrimentofconsciousness will expose itself to be a vicious 'feedback system' even as in the case of a vortex
'Nameandform' will be seen as a mere product of proliferation  a Narcissistic image doted upon due to delusion
With this vision 'ofthingsastheyare' there comes a disgust for this interplay which is nothing but a secondary manifestation of a conflict with the 'main stream' of Nature
This disgust gives rise to a 'turningaway' which leads to the Freedom from the conflict that characterizes Samsaaric existence as a whole
There can be a designation or a 'pointingout' as a 'thisness' only as long as the vortex of individual existence is kept going
When the vortex ceases all pathways of designation lose their point of reference since where there was an 'itthatta' now 'tathataa' prevails
The Tathaagata the Transcendent One thus truly becomes 'deep immeasurable unfathomable as is the great ocean' and the five aggregates which he has abandoned have only a semblance of connection with him now like the stirred up surface waters which still betoken a vortex long since ceased at its depths
'Naaparam itthattaya' is the guarantee of this freedom from the Samsaaric vortex
It conveys the arahant's conviction that 'in so far only'  that as far as nameandform together with consciousness  'can one be born or grow old or die or pass away or reappear' and that there is nothing beyond this for the designation of these conditions of Samsaaric existence
Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary p
The word 'saamaggiyam' though explained by the Comm
to mean 'fit and proper' seems to have a significance of its own as suggested by the context
It connotes the inner concord of the fullyintegrated arahant its primary sense being 'concord' or 'unanimity' in a social context
'Thus is form thus is its arising thus is its passing away
'Thus is feeling thus is its arising thus is its passing away
'Thus is perception thus is its arising thus is its passing away
'Thus is formations thus is their arising thus is their passing away
'Thus is consciousness thus is its arising thus is its passing away
Thus 'this' being 'that' becomes from the arising of this that arises this not being that becomes not from the ceasing of this that ceases
That is to say conditioned by ignorance formations come to pass conditioned by formations consciousness comes to pass conditioned by consciousness nameandform conditioned by nameandform the sixfold sensesphere contact conditioned by contact feeling conditioned by feeling craving conditioned by craving grasping conditioned by grasping becoming conditioned by becoming birth conditioned by birth oldage and death sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair come to pass
Such is the arising of this entire mass of suffering
But from the utter fading away and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of formations from the cessation of formations the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of birth oldage and death sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering'
This 'investigation by way of Dependent Arising' is an illustration of the practical application of that law in order to understand the structure of experience
By tracing experience to its very source  ignorance  one understands the cumulative process whereby the Five Aggregates of Grasping come into existence
'Attentionbywayofmatrix' is an integral element in the law of Dependent Arising as the Mahaapadaana Sutta clearly reveals
Ignorance when discovered is transmuted into Knowledge and as such the outcome of this yonisomanasikaara is the destruction of that foundation on which the structure of senseexperience rests precariously balanced
The three ways of investigation would thus lead to a comprehension of the three basic categories 'khandhaa' 'aayatanaani' and 'dhaatuyo'
Here the question concerns not so much the simple identity or difference between the two terms as the delimitation of their meaning and applicability
The usual Paali idiom for expressing identity and difference runs something like this 'Tam jiivam tam sariiram annam jivam annam sariiram' S
IV
In contrast with it is the idiom used in the present context 'Tanneva nu kho bhante upaadaanakkhandhaa udaahu annatra pancupadaanakkhandehi upaadaananti' Hence the rendering of this sentence at MLS
III is to be preferred to the one given at KS

At A
I we get a classification of three types of assemblies according to the modes of training adopted one of them being 'the assembly trained by the counterquestion method'
Moreover at A
II where four types of questions are mentioned it is said that some questions have to be dealt with by a counterquestion
That one has to be skilled enough to use one's discretion in determining to which category a question belongs is also clearly stated there
'One is that which admits of a categorical reply another requires an analytical statement the third type should be questionedinreturn while the fourth should be set aside
That monk who knows what type is applicable here and there according to circumstances such a one they say is an expert in the tetrad of questions'
The latter half of that sentence in the sutta with its clumsylooking iteratives can be better explained in the context of the above two verses
Its import is exactly the same as that of the second verse
The prefix 'anu' in 'anudhammatam' fulfills the same distributive function as does the phrase 'tesu tesu dhammesu' Hence it is clear that the Buddha is here reminding the monks that he has upon occasion trained them by the counterquestion method and this is just the method he proposes to employ on the present occasion too in order to dispel the wrong view of that monk
The catechism on the Three Signata with its arrestive 'whatdoyouthink' is in fact a kind of counterquestion by which the questioner's false assumptions are gradually exposed layer by layer
The final rhetoric question 'That which is impermanent painful and liable to change is fit to be regarded thus 'This is mine this am I this is my self'  goes to the root of the matter in its appeal to common sense
On the whole this catechism serves the very practical purpose of disabusing the questioner's mind of his prejudices thus shattering the very basis of his question
Some critics who have failed to appreciate the cathartic significance of this catechism in the present context seem to have interpreted it as some sort of a cavalier escapade from the point at issue
When the full import of the expression 'patipucchaaviniitaa' is understood there can be no provocation for such an attitude the less so since here the Buddha himself has taken the trouble to probe into the mind of that monk and bring out a question which otherwise might well have remained unasked
Equally unjustified is the attempt to find in this type of catechism an excuse for 'a self outsidethefiveaggregates'
Now the following verse of the Dhp
has a reference to dyads
'When the arahant becomes 'one who has gone beyond' with regard to the things forming the dyads then all fetters of the knowingone pass away'
The commentary takes the dyads to mean 'calmandinsight'
However on the strength of the Buddha's declaration cited above it is more reasonable to interpret it in the light of the present sutta
The word 'paaraguu' in the verse may be taken as an illusion to the 'Oceansutta' at S
IV which compares each of the six senses to an ocean with its respective object as its 'force and speaks of the arahant as one who has 'crossed over and gone beyond'
A distinction has to be made between this 'dyad' and the 'dichotomy' which is the theme in the Dvayataanupassana sutta of the sutta Nipaata since the latter is set out in the form of contrasts
Nibbaana as the Unshakable Deliverance of the Mind' is given four epithets in the Mahaa Vedalla S
It is called the highest form of 'Boundless Deliverance of the Mind' since the limitative tendencies of lust hatred and delusion are abandoned in the arahant
It is also the highest form of 'Possessionless Deliverance of the Mind' as it is devoid of those three taints each of which is a 'something'
For the same reason it is at the same time the highest 'Voidness Deliverance of the Mind'
In so far as lust hatred and delusion are 'significant' their absence in Nibbaana makes it the supreme Signless Deliverance of the Mind'
These four aspects of that Unshakable Deliverance of the Mind  the 'Boundless' the 'Possessionless' the 'Void' and the 'Signless'  are also suggestive of the infinite and nonmanifestative nature of the arahant's consciousness
There is reason to believe that those 'three and sixty views' referred to in that verse include Sammaa Ditthi Right as the sixtythird
They are collectively called 'resorts' 'dependent on talks of recluses' with percepts as their syllables and supported by percepts  all of which the Buddha is said to have dispelled when he reached the 'Flood's End'
In this connection the summingup occurring at the end of the Brahmajala Sutta is particularly significant
After setting forth the types of speculative views falling under each subheading the following declaration is made And this monks the Tathaagata knows  'These viewpoints thus taken up thus taken hold of lead to such and such bournes to such and such states after death' That the Tathaagata knows and he also knows something higher than that and even that knowledge he does not take hold of and not taking hold of it within himself appeasement has been understood
Having known the arising the passing away the satisfaction the misery and the escape in regard to feelings and not grasping liberated monks is the Tathaagata Towards the end of the sutta where the final summary of all the sixtytwo views comes it is clearly stated that this 'higher knowledge' is the understanding as they truly are the arising the passing away the satisfaction the misery and the escape in regard to the six spheres of sensecontact
The very synoptic nature of this higher knowledge comprehending all the five aspects of the spheres of sensecontact gives rise to detachment
It is the kind of mastery which an expert physician is endowed with and the Buddha as a matter of fact claimed himself to be one
The Four Noble Truths can be resolved respectively into the Malady its Cause Health and the Remedy the mastery of all four being the sine qua non for emancipation
To the emancipated one all dogmatic views appear as symptoms of a malady  as 'twitchings' and 'writhings' fraught with pain vexation despair and fever and through them he diagnoses the malady
Hence he is not in conflict with them and like a kind physician with perfect equanimity he understands the law of Dependent Arising implicit in that situation
'Given the malady  symptoms arise
Given the remedy  symptoms cease'
And his relations with the 'patient' will be purely on therapeutic lines
Likewise the abovementioned synoptic understanding of the spheres of sensecontact gives rise to detachment and equanimity
It signifies the Middle Path underlying the law of Dependent Arising
At S Right view is defined as the law of Dependent Arising which avoids the two extreme views of absolute existence and absolute nonexistence
Thus to the questions 'Does it exist' 'Does it not exist' and likewise to the questions 'Is it one
Is it many'  S
the reply is 'It depends' and this dependence takes the form of the twelvelinked formula in its direct and reverse order
The theme in brief is
'When ignorance arises the world arises
When ignorance ceases the world ceases
Seeing the arising of the world within one's own sixfold sensesphere one does not entertain the dogmatic view 'Nothing exists' and seeing the cessation of the world therein one does not incline to the other extreme view 'Everything exists'
This 'Sammaa Ditthi' as the understanding of the principle of Dependent Arising has an essentially disengaging quality
It is 'in the proximity of nonattachment disengagement nondelighting nonentanglement and nongrasping'
Its counterpart is 'disenchantment' which in its turn leads to detachment cessation Nibbaana
Rather in keeping with the pragmatic concept of truth the 'knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyreallyare' is one that merely serves the practical purpose of 'leading onwards' without inviting dogmatic involvement
Hence when Anaathapindika a 'Streamwinner' was questioned by the ascetics of other sects as to whether he is not himself attached to his view 'Whatever is become compounded thought out and impermanent that is suffering and whatever is suffering that is not mine that I am not that is not my self'  he silenced them with the reply that he knows a higher 'steppingout' even from that Right View
Because all views couched in percepts and syllables have a centripetal tendency as the word 'osaranaani' suggests the Noble Disciple does not cling even to the Right View but on the other hand developing the centrifugal force implied by 'nissarana' he attains Nibbaana
Those who explained to me before  outside the dispensation of Gotama  all of them said 'So it was' and 'so it will be' But all that is 'soandso' talk
All that is productive of logic
I did not delight therein
But as for you O sage you have taught me the Dhamma that is destructive of craving by knowing which and mindfully faring along one might get beyond the world's viscosity
Wherefore monks you stir up energy that you may reach what is still unreached that you may attain what is still unattained that you may realize what is still unrealized
'Thus will this goingforth of ours not be barren but fruitful and of consequence
And those offerings of them whose requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicaments we enjoy shall on our part be of great fruit of great consequence for them' Verily it is thus monks that you should train yourselves
For one who discerns his own good this is enough to call up diligent effort
For one who discerns another's good this is enough to call up diligent effort
For one who discerns the good of both this is enough to call up diligent effort
'The frequent practice development and making much of mindfulness' recommended by our sutta is one that is conducive to the good of both oneself and others
As the commentary observes even the mere appreciation of a monk who by his diligent practice attains to arahantship will be a thought productive of great merit
Besides one's devotion to the practice and exemplary life can be a source of inspiration to others
Since greed hatred and delusion are the mainsprings of all evil intentions resulting in harm to oneself and others in protecting one's mind from them one is at the same time protecting others as well
Forbearance nonviolence lovingkindness and compassion being positive altruistic attitudes directly concern one's relations with the outside world
Yet on the mental side too they exercise a wholesome influence conducive to one's own spiritual growth
They are all 'objectlessons' in the practice of mindfulness
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The present volume on anattaa concludes the treatment of The Three Basic Facts of Existence within The Wheel series
Though the Buddha's teaching on notself has been treated quite often in these publications it was felt that some more material from sources not easily accessible to the general reader should be offered here
From different angles these essays and translations will throw light on that central teaching of Buddhism anattaa
As the earlier books on anicca and dukkha this volume too concludes with a concise and systematic treatment of the subject by the late venerable anamoli Thera which is a valuable guide to the source material as well as to a deeper study of this profound doctrine
The diverse renderings chosen by the individual authors for the key term anattaa or nairaatmya have been retained
Hence it should be understood by the reader that egolessness soullessness impersonality and notself all stand for the Pali term anattaa
 Nyanaponika Thera
More and more the noble teaching of the Buddha seems to be on the way to conquer the world
More than ever before the Buddhists are working for its propagation in nearly all the countries of the earth
Especially in India the birth place of Buddhism whence it disappeared for nearly a thousand years Buddhism has again made its entrance and gained a firm footing and with rapid strides it is ever gaining more and more ground
One therefore should rather think it a good omen that India having regained its independence has adopted as its emblem the Buddhist FourLion symbol of Emperor Asoka and that at the proclamation of the Indian Republic behind the presidential throne crowned with this Buddhist emblem there appeared the Buddha's statue
Also all over Europe and America a mighty Buddhist wave is set in motion which no longer can be kept back and suppressed and which sooner or later will flood the world with its beneficial influence
The world is no longer satisfied with dogmas based on blind belief
Everywhere in the world there is found today a striving for freedom and independence externally and internally and ever more the thinking man feels that the destinies of beings are not dependent on the omnipotence and infinite goodness of an imaginary creator but that they rest entirely on the beings themselves
It is in Buddhism that one may find the true answers to many of the problems that are troubling men and which they wish to get solved
Everybody knows that Buddhism is not a revealed religion and not based on blind belief but that it is a doctrine to be realized by man's own understanding a doctrine that makes man free and independent in his thinking and assures him of happiness and peace
But of one thing I wish to warn all those who are working for the propagation of Buddhism namely not to allow themselves to be influenced or carried away by seemingly identical theosophical Christian or what is still worse materialistic teachings
For all these are in essence and substance very often diametrically opposed to the Buddha's doctrines and prevent a real understanding and realization of the profound law discovered and proclaimed by the Buddha
The most crucial point for most men seems to be the Buddha's fundamental teaching of phenomenality egolessness and impersonality of existence in Pali anattaa
It is the middle way between two extremes namely on the one hand the spiritualistic belief in an eternal egoentity or soul outlasting death on the other hand the materialistic belief in a temporary egoentity becoming annihilated at death
Therefore it is said There are three teachers in the world
The first teacher teaches the existence of an eternal egoentity outlasting death that is the Eternalist as for example the Christian
The second teacher teaches a temporary egoentity which becomes annihilated at death that is the annihilationist or materialist
The third teacher teaches neither an eternal nor a temporary egoentity this is the Buddha
The Buddha teaches that what we call ego self soul personality etc are merely conventional terms not referring to any real independent entity
And he teaches that there is only to be found this psychophysical process of existence changing from moment to moment
Without understanding the egolessness of existence it is not possible to gain a real understanding of the Buddhaword and it is not possible without it to realize that goal of emancipation and deliverance of mind proclaimed by the Buddha
This doctrine of egolessness of existence forms the essence of the Buddha's doctrine of emancipation
Thus with this doctrine of egolessness or anattaa stands or falls the entire Buddhist structure
Indeed for anyone who wishes to engage in the study of the Buddhist scriptures the best thing would be from the very start to get himself acquainted with the two methods in which the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the world
The first method is the teaching in conventional language the second method is the teaching in philosophically correct language
The first one relates to conventional truth the second to truth in the ultimate sense
Thus whenever the Buddha uses such terms as I person living being etc this is to be understood as conventional speech hence not correct in the highest sense
It is just as speaking of the rising and setting of the sun though we know thoroughly well that this does not correspond to reality
Thus the Buddha teaches that in the ultimate sense amongst all these psychophysical phenomena of existence there cannot be found any eternal or even temporary egoentity and hence that all existence of whatever kind is something impersonal or anattaa
In this connection I would like to emphasize the fact that this fundamental doctrine of egolessness and emptiness is not as some misinformed Western Buddhists assert only taught in the southern school of Buddhism but that even in the socalled the Mahayana schools it forms a most essential part
Without this teaching of anattaa or egolessness there is no Buddhism and without having realized the truth of egolessness no real progress is possible on the path to deliverance
The Buddha is in every respect a teacher at the golden mean ethically as well as philosophically
From the ethical standpoint for example the Buddha rejects two extremes the way of sensual pleasures and the way of selftorture
From the philosophical standpoint he rejects eternity as well as temporariness of an ego entity
Just so he rejects belief in an absolute identity and an absolute otherness of the various stages of the process of existence
He rejects the determinism as well as the belief in chance
He rejects the belief in absolute existence and absolute nonexistence likewise in freedom of will as well as in unfreedom of will
All these things will become clear to one who understands the egolessness and conditioned nature of all phenomena of existence
On the understanding of these two truths depends the understanding of the entire doctrine of the Buddha
Hence the understanding and final penetration of the egolessness and conditionedness of all phenomena of existence are the necessary foundation to the realization of the noble eightfold path leading to deliverance from all vanity and misery namely right understanding right thought right speech right bodily action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration of mind
Only this golden middle path based on these two kinds of right understanding namely of egolessness and conditionedness can alleviate and destroy these vain illusions of self and craving which are the rootcauses of all war and bloodshed in the world
But without these two kinds of understanding there is no realization of the holy and peaceful goal pointed out by the Buddha
There are however to be found various wouldbe Buddhists in the West who are attached to an imaginary Great Self and who uphold that the Buddha did in no way reject the view of an eternal Atman or soul behind and independent of the phenomena of existence and who believe that the Mahayana texts teach such a doctrine
Such assertions however do not in the least prove correct for neither do the Pali texts nor the early Mahayana texts proclaim an eternal self
Any reader who is unbiased in mind and free from prejudices can never from a study of the Buddhist scriptures come to the conclusion that the Buddha ever taught any such egoentity within or outside the corporeal mental and spiritual phenomena of existence
Nowhere in the world can there be found such an entity as was clearly pointed out by the Buddha
Regarding the questions whether the Holy One will continue after death or not continue etc the Buddha says that all such questions are wrongly put
And why
Because what is called the Holy One is here only a conventional term and refers to no real entity while in reality there is only to be found a process of corporeal mental and spiritual phenomena
In another text therefore the Buddhist asks a monk whether he considered corporeality as the Holy One or the feelings or the perceptions or the mental formations or consciousness
Or whether he believed the Holy One to exist within these five groups of phenomena or outside thereof
Or whether all these phenomena heaped together were the Holy One
And denying all these questions the Buddha further said that even during lifetime the Holy One could not be discovered in reality and that therefore it would be wrong to ask whether the Holy One will continue or not continue after death etc
Thus no entities are existing in the world but only everchanging processes
The Buddha further says Only because man does not understand corporeality feeling and the other mental and spiritual phenomena being impermanent unsatisfactory and impersonal and does not understand their conditioned origin their extinction and the path leading to their extinction therefore he will think that the Holy One does continue or does not continue after death etc
This therefore is the reason why the Buddha did not answer such questions
According to Buddhism the whole of existence is comprised in the five groups of phenomena mentioned above or still more briefly expressed in the three groups corporeality consciousness and the mental factors
And within these three groups are comprised the only and ultimate things given though also these again are mere fleeting and evanescent phenomena flashing up for a moment in order to disappear immediately thereafter forever
Thus whenever in the Buddhist scriptures mention is made of I self living being etc even of the Buddha these expressions accordingly are used merely as conventional terms without referring to any real entities
Therefore the Buddha has said It is impossible it cannot be that a man with real understanding should ever consider anything as a real entity
He who does not understand the egolessness of existence and who still attached to egoillusion such a one cannot comprehend and understand the four Noble Truths of the Buddha in the true light
These four truths are
He who has not penetrated the egoillusion and is still attached to selfvanity will believe that it is he himself that suffers will believe that is he himself that performs the good and evil deeds leading to his rebirth that it is he himself that will enter Nirvana that is he himself that will bring the eightfold path to perfection
Whoso however has fully penetrated the egolessness of existence knows that in the highest sense there is no individual that suffers that commits the kammic deeds that enters Nirvana and that brings the Eightfold Path to perfection
In the Visuddhi Magga it is therefore said
Therefore wherever the doctrine of the egolessness of all existence is rejected there the Buddha's word is rejected
But wherever through penetration of the egolessness of all existence the egovanity has reached ultimate extinction there the goal of the Buddha's teaching has been realized namely freedom from all vanity of I and Mine and the highest peace of Nibbaana
If something is yours you have power over it you can make it into whatever you wish
It will change according to your plans
But have you power over your self
Can you make your body larger or smaller or let it be this or that as you desire
If it is not governed by your power but by its own laws and processes then it is not yours
If it were the body would not be involved in sickness for you would be able to make it be whatever you wished
Admittedly one has control over the body to an extent but not as much as one has over this house or any other possession
Why
Your body was once very much more delicate and smaller than it is now
Now it is bigger and stronger
It will get weaker and degenerate later on
This body which you call yours  has it developed and deteriorated according to your will
Or perhaps the question of ownership does not arise  the body being subject to the same laws of nature as everything else ie birth decay and death
If this is so should one be concerned or unconcerned regarding the body
If neglected the natural processes of destruction act quickly disease and death soon resulting
Therefore food exercise and clothing must be used to maintain it and to stop the natural processes being accelerated
Do people feed and dress the body for maintenance only and if not why
Take a person who dresses only to keep his body protected from the elements
What's wrong with this
Should he be criticized and if he is for what
Because others don't dress similarly doesn't mean he's doing something wrong
Someone may say he looks ugly and unsightly but how did we learn what ugliness was in the first place
Is the person criticizing him or his clothes
Well him is not the body the person criticizing him is not taking offense at the body but just at the clothes
This is where opinion together with vanity creep in and facts become concealed
Leaving the body let us turn to another aspect of self  feeling
Say a man tries to grasp something which continually slips through his fingers
Can he say that thing is his
He tries to keep it but he can never clutch it solidly and he would never dream of calling that thing his own
But say he has a fountain pen
That really seems to be his own
It is always with him and it keeps its shape and doesn't change very much
How about feelings  happiness indifference and pain
Are not these like the first example
How can we ever say feelings are our own
If they were happiness would be ours for the rest of our life and not an illusive thing which comes and goes against our wishes
Body is born it decays and dies
Likewise we find on investigation that exactly the same is true for feelings
The body does not come from nothing
It starts off by the fusing of two cells from mother and father
By way of nourishment it grows and develops
Then it dies
Feeling is born of senseimpingement eg eye and material shape lead to sense impingement which leads to visual consciousness which leads to feeling  pleasant indifferent or painful according to whether or not what has been seen is liked or disliked as a result of past experience
Thus we see how feeling is born
But this feeling changes
If a painful feeling arises we are not content but crave to get away from it
Alternatively if we have perceived something that gives a pleasing feeling we long to keep this feeling and try to possess whatever has caused it to arise
Why don't feelings last
Because the very things from which they arise do not last
Therefore if we do not grasp after feelings we never suffer
Feelings are continually born and continually die but the body takes a long time to do so
If we cannot call body our own how much less so is this true of feelings
Let us now examine a third aspect of ourselves  perception
What do we perceive and is it we who actually perceive
Perception is the recognition of senseimpingements
How is it born
I hear a loud noise and recognize that a door has been slammed
What is the basis of this recognition
Firstly without the ear no sound would be heard therefore the ear is a necessary basis
The sound impinges on the ear this being sensory impingement
From this perception arises but like feelings it does not last and soon dies away another rising in its place
Do I enter into this perception
Do I perceive the door slamming
No
We have definitely seen that perception arose of its own accord with oneself not being involved at all
Well if body feeling and perception are not me what is
Before this can be answered there is yet another aspect of ourselves and this is volitional action
Here surely we shall find our true self
I say to a friend I am going to do that and I keep to what I've said
Here it appears a deliberate choice has been made between doing two specific things either I will or I won't
How does the will or act of choosing arise or is it there all the time
Does it only come into force when we have to make a choice
On investigation we find that this is so for example I'm going to ride my bicycle tonight
This is a deliberate choice
I could have gone to the cinema or for a walk
Why did I choose riding
Does volition come into this at all
What other volitional tendencies are there
I have killed a man
Surely volition was there
But if I ask myself why I wanted to kill him several interesting things come to light
For argument's sake let us say he murdered my wife
I was very attached to her
He took something away from me which I wanted
Missing the pleasurable feelings which were continually aroused by my wife's company a painful feeling took its place when I lost her and I craved to get the former feeling back
The only satisfaction for me was to get rid of the object which caused the painful feeling to arise and therefore I killed him
So we see from this example that the volitional drive had a basis for arising and we see also that after arising it passed away on completion of its primary object
Volition therefore is a conditioned force directed specifically toward something eg I can arouse myself to apply my mind to something
But as just proved volition is a conditioned phenomenon
Can I therefore be equated with volition
If so I only exist when volition is present when it passes away I die also
But we say we are present all the time  therefore I cannot be equated with volition
In conclusion we can state that if I say I'm going to do this or that what this really means is that this or that is going to be done not by me but through cause and necessity
Well we still have not found ourselves yet there is only one more aspect of ourselves to consider  consciousness
Are you conscious am I conscious
Yes is the usual immediate answer
If this were not so you would say I'd be unconscious Can you be conscious without being conscious of anything
Most people would say not
Let us find out what are the factors involved in being conscious
Can one be conscious without a body
Not that we know of so we can assume from this that consciousness arises dependent on the body
Will there be consciousness if no senseorgans are in the body
We can categorically state that there will not be
So our second step is that consciousness is dependent on the senseorgans
Will there be consciousness with body and senseorgans and no internal or external senseimpingement
Again we can say definitely No Given senseimpingement shall we be conscious
Yes but it will not be a very meaningful consciousness
We shall see a conglomeration of colors hear noises smell things have bodily sensations and taste things but not be able to recognize them
If perception is missing one cannot say I am conscious
We have already discussed perception and shown that it is not one's real self
Senseconsciousness together with perception gives us our awareness of things but is there an I who is aware
If you say I am conscious of a vase of flowers on the table are you really conscious of it
By our investigation we have tried to show that you do not enter into is at all and that consciousness like all the other aspects of self has birth decay and death
To fall into the delusion that the body feelings perception volitional action and consciousness are you is to suffer because unfortunately they are not of you and you are not of them and you cannot expect them ever to give satisfaction for very long
In conclusion I would say that the more disgusted one becomes with compounded things the closer one gets to things that give lasting happiness
 From The Maha Bodhi May
The labors of a succession of devoted scholars from Turnour to Rhys Davids has now made impossible at any rate for all serious students of religion the cruder misconceptions of Buddhism that were current in Europe at the end of last century
Its deeply intellectual character its unique and unsullied record of tolerance its priority of five centuries in promulgation of the higher ethic all these things are now widely known
And yet in spite of all this even among such as are devoid of prejudice it is seldom that one meets with a real penetrating understanding of the Teaching
To some its philosophy to others its influence appear alike unintelligible
Now the source of this perplexity it may safely be affirmed is invariably a failure to apprehend that characteristic and central doctrine or principle of Buddhism that is summed up in the Pali term anattaa
Without this there must appear to be an unbridgeable gap in the Buddhist doctrine of causation its power over the hearts and lives of men must seem incapable of explanation its final goal still present the insoluble enigma that it has for long presented to the European mind
Anattaa once comprehended however all whether thought or practice is clear and open
That is the key that unlocks the secret the way to the heart of the Buddhist mystery
The term is generally explained as meaning denial of the soul and yet such a translation is apt to be somewhat misleading to a European
For it involves in a certain sense both less and more than that
It does not by any means imply for example that death ends all in the sense of some of the Western schools
And on the other hand the idea of a soul is but a part though indeed the most important part of the great body of conceptions which it denies
Taken in connection with aniccaa the principle of impermanence that which it denies is the idea of separate and abiding substance in anything whatever in the whole unbounded universe whether psychical or physical
Psyche of course was the particular kind of substance which the Buddhist teachers had in view and its proper treatment is naturally psychological
But every kind of substance comes under the same condemnation and as the Western mind of today is far more at home in and thinks far more clearly and powerfully upon physical affairs a consideration of some of the physical and biological aspects of anattaa is likely to be the best possible preparation for an understanding of those psychical aspects of it which the Buddhist teachers so earnestly labored to convey the more so as such cases are it should most clearly be understood not illustrations or analogies only they are actual examples of the principle itself
Consider such a phenomenon as a rainbow
To the unsophisticated mind a rainbow is just as real as any other object much more vivid and real than the faint and distant hills that lie beyond it
A child indeed filled with longing will beg that it may be given to him that he may have and hold and possess for himself this beautiful and brilliant thing
Later on he learns something of its real nature learns that there is in it no thing whatever capable of being so held that it is but a conditioning of certain rays of light and drops of water and has no existence in itself at all
That is precisely the anattaa doctrine
The rainbow is anattaa
This step in sound philosophy every sane adult is taught to take
How many take any further steps
For most the cares of life and the deceitfulness of riches  riches often of another world as much as of this  occupy the mind entirely and there is no desire for further knowledge
Yet to some one day to all the question cannot but arise  If this be so if the rainbow be but a conditioning how about the things of which it is a conditioning
How about the light and water
Surely those are real enough
Very well then
The light first what is that
Little as we all know we know enough to answer that it is an undulation or vibration a particular kind of very rapid movement of something
But what is this but just the very answer that was given to the child about the rainbow given to the adult about the light
Just as that rainbow was a conditioning of the light and had no existence in itself so now the light proves to be a conditioning in its turn to have no more existence in itself than the rainbow had
The light too is anattaa
Yet if it be an undulation of what is it an undulation
Of the ether
And what is this ether
Here we are getting near the limits of our knowledge
Yet this much can be said that it is not matter
It is not this it is not that it is not the other  to any question concerning it such are the replies and yet it is not nonexistence
Seek it and it vanishes from the grasp of the mind just as the rainbow and the light did in their turn
It is the very type of insubstantiality of anattaa
The water however that at least is tangible and substantive enough
Here is existence in a way that cannot be denied
Go far enough to north or south and water will react to even the Johnsonian fist
Nevertheless let it but feel the touch of a lump of sodium or even of a few inches of hot copper and where is it
Vanished utterly and in its place two things that are no more water than it or light were rainbow
Water in itself then is not and never was  nothing was but a particular conditioning of these other things this hydrogen and oxygen as we call them and water is but a name for such conditioning
Nor need we even think that this waterconditioning is the rule and the waterabolishing experiments mere curious exceptions
Throughout the whole vast universe that is visible to us only in a score of tiny specks is that the case
Not for one fleeting moment in the great star that daily lights us or in a single one of the millions of its peers in the depths of space could the waterconditioning hold good
Both the constituents of the rainbow therefore are as truly anattaa as the rainbow itself
As in the case of the first constituent however the question leads us further
What of these elements this hydrogen and this oxygen into which the water has resolved itself
Well it is true that misled by the unsound views of the nature of things in which they were brought up many probably most chemists did for a long time think that in the ultimate combining particle the atom of such elements real separate and abiding substance had at last been hunted down
Not all indeed were so deceived
Hardly had the atomic theory been formulated when discerning minds began to seek first by one means then by another for that of which the atom must be but a compounding
The time had not come and they were baffled
How in the last few years they have been completely justified how abiding substance eludes us no less in the atom than it does elsewhere has been already told elsewhere
The hydrogen and oxygen therefore are in their turn nothing but conditionings of something else and when we inquire concerning that of which they are conditionings then as we have done to the ether we can give to it a name we can show that it must behave in such and such a way but the moment that we attempt to lay the profane finger of thought upon it and say that it is this or that it is gone
As of the rainbow so of all things process there is conditioning there is but nowhere the least trace of substance nowhere the least trace of self
That is the anattaa doctrine as exemplified by matter
According to the theory of the soul familiar to all of us from our childhood each living body at any rate each living human body is inhabited and informed by a single psychic entity the thinker of all its thoughts doer of its deeds and director of the organism generally
In Christianity until very lately such a soul was ascribed to human beings only animals had no souls
For them death ended all without even the hope of a future life in which might be redeemed some of their unmerited sufferings and the present writer well remembers his passionate yearnings as a child after a larger hope for some of the dear animals he loved so well and remembers the quenching of this hope by his orthodox instructors
The Roman Catholic Church still holds valorously to this ancient orthodoxy but the rapidlygrowing feeling of compassion for animal suffering that has sprung up in the Western world during the past hundred years and is one of its kindliest and noblest features has outside the Roman pale begun to modify opinion and souls are now postulated for at any rate the higher animals
Concurrently with this an influence of a different kind has accelerated the movement of men's minds in the same direction
This comes from the acceptance now general of the theory of evolution
Fear for the existence of the human soul was the motive indeed of much of the early opposition to that theory but now that resistance is no longer possible it is coming to be felt that a worthier way out of the difficulty is to be found in the concession of a soul to these our fellowbeings
The interrelationship and unity of all life left indeed no other way if the soul theory was to be held at all
The unity of life however has other bearings very searching some of them upon the whole question and a consideration of these may throw some light upon animistic views in general
For there is no stopping at the higher animals still less at those who are our especial friends and lovers
If we concede a soul to a dog so must we also to a wolf if to a cat then also to a tiger
Nor can we call a halt at any place as passing from these sensitive and splendid beings we descend lower and lower through the mammalia till we reach the very humblest of the primitive marsupials
But the mammalia form but one of the branches of the Tree of Life bird reptile fish put in the same claim and it cannot be denied to them
Not even the lowly Amphioxus brooks the refusal of a soul and he standing at the confines of his kingdom opens the gates to the still vaster and dimmer armies of the life we call Invertebrate
To cut an almost endless story short we find even here no place at which to stop and are fain to concede at last that the microscopic protoplasmic cellunits called the protozoa are as able to make good their title as the lordliest of the mammalia
Besides if we were inclined to pass them by with a De minimis non curat lex they could reinforce their claim by pointing out that man himself enters upon his existence as a protozoan unit indistinguishable from themselves and that if this unit contains a soul why should not each of them contain one likewise
There is another curious consideration
If my soul enters upon existence along with me and is mine and no one else's so also does any other being's even such as a protozoan's and it is his soul and no other protozoan's
Now man propagates his kind at an exceptionally slow rate but the rate of increase in the lower ranks of life is prodigious
Statisticians amuse themselves sometimes by computations of the progeny of a single codfish in quite a moderate space of time and the results are astonishing
But the multiplication of the protozoa proceeds by geometrical progression so that without books at hand I am afraid to quote the shortness of the period in which one such will have given rise to millions
The influx of new souls into this world alone therefore is proceeding at a rate beyond all power of numbers to convey and when we reflect that this has been going on throughout the whole of geological time the conception is truly staggering
Wellfound indeed must be the ship of speculation that can carry such a freight as that across the stormy seas of modern thought
So far we have considered the single soul in a single body such as we ourselves have been taught we are endowed with
But there are cases not so simple
Among the coelenterata and the polyzoa there are as well as a single hydroid animals many species of compound ones in which whole colonies of such beings are united by a coenosarc or fleshbody common to them all
What are we to say of the soul in a case of this sort
Shall we ascribe it to the individuals to the coenosarc or to the colony as a whole
The individual is just such another as any simple hydroid yet if we assign to him a soul like that of the simple one what becomes of the coenosarc which is just as much alive
Or if we assign it to the community then why to the hydra that is rooted in a coenosarc should be denied that which is conceded to his cousin who is rooted on a stone
And as if this were not perplexing enough sometimes a member of such a community will detach himself from it altogether and conduct his life on his own account
To return however to the higher beings ourselves included with a single body and its single soul
Closely bound up with the theory of evolution are the facts of histology the structures and relationships that is to say of the microscopic units that compose the living being
Let us consider first the corpuscles of the blood
They are of the two kinds the large white corpuscles and the smaller red ones
Both are cells but we will consider just now the white ones
They are minute specks of living protoplasm constantly changing their shape moving slowly about and living upon what they meet with
Now amongst the protozoa animals consisting of a single cell whose claims to a single soul we were obliged to admit capable of being made good with such irresistible effect is a creature known as the amoeba
It is a speck of protoplasm that moves slowly about from point to point changing its shape as it goes along and living upon any suitable object it can meet with
The white bloodcorpuscles in short and the amoeba are indistinguishable in composition aspect and behavior
They differ in nothing but their habitat the amoeboid corpuscle can make every whit as effective a claim to a single soul as the amoeba
The one however is an independent being the other an integral part of a most essential portion of our own economy essential indeed for without them the blood cannot perform its functions and is not the blood as we have long ago been told the life
Even if we take refuge in the brain and seek to locate the soul where thought goes on to that retreat also they pursue us for stop the blood and in a few short minutes thinking ceases
Clearly there is something wrong
It is evident that the simpleseeming hypothesis of a single soul in a single body hides a world of perplexities and complications
The difficulty of the hydrozoan coenosarc has reappeared in a more subtle form than ever and that within our own breasts the very citadel of the soulhypothesis
Nor is this even the end of the matter
The relations of the amoeboid corpuscle to the amoeba strike the mind at once and the lessons that they teach are past mistaking
But the red corpuscle is no whit less a cell which were it found elsewhere than in the blood would pass without challenge as one among many protozoan creatures
Nay further still
If we watch through the microscope a drop of pondwater full of paramecium or any other simple animals it will not be long before we see one of them constrict into a sort of waist develop there a medial cellwall and part along that into two each of which proceeds without more ado to go about its own business
In paramecium and its congeners the new cells leave each other but in slightly higher animals they remain united along the medial wall dividing perhaps and redividing until we have a tissue or colony of several cells
The members of such a tissue are to the free separating cells as the hydroids of a coenosarcal community to the solitary hydroids
The inner nature of the cell remains the same
Now all the tissues of the living body are neither more nor less than just such colonies
Modified in various ways according to the nature of the tissue here for muscle here for skin there for bone differently again for nerve and finally in a special way for brain itself the units of these tissues are throughout the body cells alike in their essential nature different only in their modifications
The blood corpuscles are just some of these cells which in order to perform a particular function remained detached and free to move like the protozoa
And every activity of the being physical or psychical depends entirely on the coordinated activities physical or psychical of this vast multitude which indeed no man can number
But each one of these is as we now perceive a being to whom if we set out the hypothesis of souls it is logically impossible to refuse a separate soulunit of its own
Seeking in the first part of this article for the essential inner self or being of the rainbow light water and their elements we found that there was not in any one of them any essential self or being whatsoever
Every one of them turned out to be by its very nature a conditioning of elements that were not itself and this held good to the last stages of analysis that knowledge could apply
Every one of them had to be pronounced anattaa
What have we now found to be the case of the living being
We have found it to be more conspicuously if possible than even those other phenomena a conditioning of a vast number of elements that are not one of them itself dependent absolutely upon these elements having apart from them and their activities no existence in itself whatever
Beginning with a phenomenon the rainbow with regard to which the Anattaa doctrine is already held by every sane adult we have followed that doctrine and found it to apply to the highest form of existence that we know upon this earth
From the biological point of view the living being is and that in a superlative degree anattaa
Further treatment of the anattaa subject is of course psychological
With that this article is not concerned
But any sound psychology must be in harmony not at variance with biology and physics
Suffice it then to say here that we may be sure that what is biologically compound will not prove to be psychologically simple
Were we ever inclined to regard the doctrines of anattaa and the khandhas as either fantastic or perverse we may wonder rather at the discernment which perceived the one long before biology and physics were and at the moderation which gave us but five khandhas where modern science would give for one of them alone something much more like five hundred millions
Far more marvellous however was that surpassing spiritual penetration that could see in this compositeness of our nature nothing less than the balm of sorrow the justification of the Golden Rule and life's liberation from the house of bondage
Parts of this article may have perhaps a somewhat polemical expression
Well argument if undertaken at all should be made conclusive and convincing if that be possible and should result in intellectual conviction
But intellectual conviction is not religion it may not even have religion as its consequence in life
Something more is needed
He who discerns not life's pathos and its sorrow will not find out the Annattaa path of love to sorrow's utter ceasing
 From The Buddhist Review Vol
III No
Narcissism is a passion the intensity of which in many individuals can only be compared with sexual desire and the desire to stay alive
In fact many times it proves to be stronger than either
Even in the average individual in whom it does not reach such intensity there remains a narcissistic core which appears to be almost indestructible
 Erich Fromm The Heart of Man
The word narcissism is derived from a Greek legend
Narcissus in mythology is a beautiful youth who loved no one till he saw his own body reflected in water
Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection finally he pined away died and was turned into the flower of like name
Thus the word narcissism derived from this legend has been generally used to refer to a kind of morbid selflove
The concept of narcissism was woven into psychological theory by Sigmund Freud
Freud himself borrowed this name from Paul Nacke who used the term to describe a perversion where an adult individual lavishes upon his own body all the caresses expended only upon a sexual object other than himself it was Freud however who grasped for the first time the tremendous significance of the concept of narcissism
Freud's essay on narcissism is one of the richest spots in his psychology unfortunately neglected by his fellow psychiatrists and submerged by the popular image of Freud's work
Freud's essay on narcissism is a little gem which would have been pushed into an insignificant corner in the field of psychological theory but for the efforts of Eric Fromm who remarks that One of the most fruitful and farreaching of Freud's discoveries is his concept of narcissism
Freud himself considered it to be one of his most important findings In this paper I shall very briefly refer to the Freudian concept of narcissism and then present Fromm's development on this against the background of the anattaa doctrine
Before his paper on narcissism appeared Freud made a clear distinction between the sexual instinct and the ego instinct or in more popular terms between love and hunger But he came across an interesting category of patients whose condition presented a great challenge to this distinction between sexual and ego instincts
We became slowly accustomed to the conception that the libido which we find attached to certain objects and which is the desire to gain some satisfaction in these objects can also abandon these objects and set the ego itself in their place says Freud
More reflection on this point made him realize that a fixation of this kind to the subject's own body and his person was not something accidental it is probable that this is the original condition of man out of which object love develops later without thereby necessarily affecting a disappearance of narcissism
This conception of narcissism was backed by evidence from a number of sources
In megalomania we get the subjective overestimation of selfimportance in dementia praecox we get the magical belief in the omnipotence of thought Freud also studied the mind of the infant and the primitive man and here too discovered an expression of narcissism
There are also other situations in life like disease after an accident in old age etc when the tendency to this withdrawal into selfpreoccupation is apt to become pronounced Normal love is also affected by a great deal of narcissism
The notion of narcissism was used to explain a wide range of distinct phenomena ranging from love jealousy and fear to mass phenomena
Continuing on these lines Fromm has worked out the spell of narcissism in group behavior nationalism and war
It was due to Fromm's insight that the concept of narcissism was salvaged from its limited base in the libido theory and given a more comprehensive interpretation
Fromm himself makes a reference to Buddhism which is extremely significant for an understanding of narcissism
Fromm says that the essential teachings of all the humanistic religions in the world can be summarized in one sentence It is the goal of man to overcome one's narcissism
Perhaps this principle is nowhere expressed more radically than in Buddhism Fromm concludes on these lines that if man sheds the illusion of his indestructible ego and the other objects of greed only then can he be totally open awake and be fully related to the world
The illusion of the indestructible ego that Fromm mentions is quite clearly a reference to the Buddhist doctrine of anattaa
There is no ego entity existing apart and independently of those physical and mental processes that constitute life
The illusion of the ego has two basic forms eternity belief and annihilation belief
The craving for selfish pursuits arises with a false conception of personality based on the dogma of personal immortality and the craving for annihilation arises with a false conception of personality based on the annihilationist view
An understanding of the doctrine of sakkaayaditthi helps us to grasp the Buddhist doctrine of egolessness
Where there is a mere complex of corporeality feeling perception dispositions and consciousness the individual being subject to the ego illusion assumes the existence of an ego
This does not mean that the ego is merely an intellectual construction
The roots of the ego illusion are strong and it is fed by deep effective processes
These processes are dormant proclivities described in the Discourses of the Buddha as the latent desire for continued existence
The origin of the Freudian concept of narcissism is the point at which Narcissus falls in love with his own body
In relating autoeroticism to narcissism Freud says that the ego is first and foremost a bodyego Fromm also says that one of the most elementary examples of narcissism can be found in the attitude to the body exhibited by the average person
The narcissistic relation to one's body has its parallel in the doctrine of the Buddha where he discusses the operation of personality beliefs in relation to corporeality
The majority of the people who are not skilled in the doctrine of the Buddha are subject to the egoillusion associated with their body
This egoillusion is described in the suttas These people who are untrained in the doctrine of the Buddha regard body as the self they regard the self as having a body body as being in the self the self as being in the body
'I am the body' say they 'body is mine' and they are possessed by this idea The Buddha also says that due to the excessive attachment to the body when it alters and changes sorrow and grief set in thus the doctrine of anattaa is linked to the doctrine of dukkha
However while the bodyimage concept of the ego dominates the thought of Freud the Buddha offers a more comprehensive analysis relating the egoillusion to feeling perception dispositions and consciousness
To use a phrase of Wolheim the corporeal overtones of the ego concept prevented Freud from presenting a broad base for his theory of narcissism
In fact Wolheim has pointed out a significant ambiguity in the Freudian analysis of narcissism
Sometimes Freud conceives narcissism as an attraction towards one's own person and sometimes as an attraction towards one's own body
Fromm has not merely revitalized the Freudian concept of narcissism but takes it very much beyond this and brings it close to the doctrine of the Buddha
Not merely does Fromm offer a theory of narcissism which is of interest to the Buddhist but he quite clearly refers to the doctrine of the Buddha The 'awakened' person of whom Buddhist teaching speaks is the person who has overcome his narcissism and who is therefore capable of being fully awake
The narcissistic person is not only proud of his body but he has an exaggerated and inflated image of all aspects of his personality his intelligence his honor and his wealth his social standing etc
Just as the narcissistic person has made his 'selfimage' the object of his narcissistic attachment he does the same with everything connected with him
His ideas his knowledge his house but also people in his 'sphere of interest' become objects of his narcissistic attachment As both Freud and Fromm point out one's narcissistic image about oneself is projected on to the children
This is extended to identification with wider groups culminating in nationalism
Karen Horney was quick to point out that at the root of this kind of narcissistic selfimage is found a kind of selfinflation rather than selflove with a need not for love but the admiration of others
At this point we see the relevance of the Buddhist concept of maana
Selfconceit according to the Buddha takes three forms I am superior to others I am equal to others I am inferior to others
Maana is one of the fetters that bind man to the ills of existence and it varies from a crude feeling of pride to a subtle feeling of distinctiveness that prevails till the attainment of arahantship
If a person is proud of his attainments exaggerates them and feels infuriated when someone gives a lower estimation of his doings he suffers from an inflated sense of vanity
If he feels frustrated disappointed and underestimates his attainments he is subject to a kind of inferiority complex
This is similar to what Fromm describes as depression The element of mourning in melancholia refers in my opinion to the narcissistic image of the wonderful 'I' which has died and for which the depressed person is mourning
Pride vanity and conceit manifest clearly in interpersonal relations as a reactive expression as wounded narcissism Its mechanism is similar to what Freud refers to as secondary narcissism One's wounded narcissism gives way either to an ego collapse depression and melancholy or to anger and fury
Apart from discussing the pathology of narcissism and its crippling impact on healthy personality growth Fromm raises the question whether there could be a kind of healthy selflove a benign form of narcissism as different from malignant narcissism
Is a certain degree of narcissism necessary for survival
Is there a necessary antinomy between love of self and others
Part of the problem could of course arise due to the linguistic issues besetting the use of the word self in diverse contexts
A grasp of the subtle mechanisms that bear upon the psychology of human motivation can clear up another facet of this issue
Ultimately this might involve a whole philosophical perspective or a way of looking at the universe and man
Fromm's analysis of this question too can be presented against the background of the Buddhist analysis of the issues involved
The problem arises when we consider love for others and love for oneself as alternatives which are mutually exclusive
Selfishness is not identical with mature selflove
In fact selfishness is caused by a real lack of genuine selflove
Love in principle is indivisible as far as the connection between the 'objects' and one's own self is concerned
Genuine love is an expression of productiveness and implies care respect responsibility and knowledge
It is not an 'affect' in the sense of being affected by somebody but an active striving for the growth and happiness of the loved person rooted in one's own capacity to love
Fromm says that it is only a symbiotic attachment which is rooted in one's narcissism
Symbiotic attachment takes two basic forms that of passive submission and active dominance
The masochistic person escapes from the unbearable feeling of separation and isolation by making himself a part and parcel of another person the sadistic person wants to escape from his aloneness by making another person part and parcel of himself
From the Buddhist standpoint a clear distinction could be made between selfdevoting motives and selfcentered motives
The practice of mettabhaavanaa is the finest expression of the fusing of selflove and love for others in Buddhism
The meditation of lovingkindness is first developed towards oneself and then radiates towards others
One first starts with the thought May I be happy and then extends it to the welfare and happiness of others
Even where a person makes a sacrifice and forgoes certain material benefits for the sake of others it merely strengthens his selfdevelopment
The very nature of the good is such that no one can seek the salvation of others without seeking his own
It is extremely important to mention that Buddhism considers the life of renunciation as the highest expression of the otherregarding instincts
This is very well expressed in the Kindred Sayings
In the suttas there is a classification of beings into four types He who is neither bent on his own profit nor on the profit of another he who is bent on the profit of another but not his own he who is bent on his own profits not another's and he who is bent on the profit both of himself and another
The Buddha considers the last category as the best
The context in which the Buddha made the analysis cited above may be a little different from the context in which Fromm has made a case for genuine selflove
But I do not see any fundamental difference between the approaches in Buddhism and that of Erich Fromm
It is true that the Buddha was basically concerned with the life of renunciation and the otherregarding virtues in Buddhism are based on a deeper doctrine of compassion
But if we present the basic human relations presented in a homily to Sigaala it will be quite clear that even in limited social situations the Buddha advocates mature human relations which deny any symbiotic attachment of abnormal domination or dependence
There is however a wider dimension in which the Buddhist analysis of selflove has to be presented
A layman who has made a necessary compromise with life will find it difficult to handle the obtruding ego while the recluse committed to the path of renunciation will have at his command a more effective therapeutic control over the spell of narcissism
The only way to bridge the gap is to discover significant similarities between the techniques used by the psychiatrist in special clinical situations and that the recluse who has made a lifelong commitment to a therapeutic procedure of his own
This short paper is essentially a response to a psychiatrist with vision who has opened a significant dialogue with humanistic religions
The five groups are a classification in which the Buddha has summed up all the physical and mental phenomena of existence and in particular those which appear to the ignorant man as his ego or personality
They are corporeality feeling perception mental formations and consciousness
It is said in the Visuddhi Magga Whenever different parts as axle wheels frame pole etc are combined in a certain manner we use the conventional designation 'chariot' But if we examine one part after the other we cannot in the ultimate sense discover anything that can be called a chariot It is likewise with the five groups of existence
If they are present one uses the conventional designation being or personality etc
But if we examine each phenomenon in its ultimate sense there is nothing that can form a basis for such conceptions as I am and I Hence in the ultimate sense only mental and physical phenomena exist
But who Venerable One is it that feels
This question is not proper said the Exalted One
I do not teach that there is one who feels
If however the question is put thus 'Conditioned through what does feeling arise' then the answer will be 'Through senseimpression is feeling conditioned through feeling craving through craving clinging'
But what are old age and death and to whom do they belong
I do not teach that there is one thing called old age and death and that there is someone to whom they belong
Verily if one holds the view that life is identical with the body in that case there can be no holy life
And if one holds the view that life is one thing but body another thing also in that case a holy life is impossible
Avoiding both of these extremes the Perfect One has taught the doctrine that lies in the middle namely Through rebirth conditioned are old age and death Through the process of becoming rebirth through clinging the process of becoming through craving clinging through feeling craving etc
Visuddhi Magga quotes
Better it would be to consider the body as the ego rather than the mind
And why
Because this body may last for or years even for years and more
But that which is called mind consciousness thinking arises continuously during day and night as one thing and as something different again it vanishes
Now here the learned and noble disciple considers thoroughly the Dependent Origination If this is then that becomes
Through the arising of this that comes to arise through the extinction of this that becomes extinguished namely Through ignorance conditioned arise the karmaformations through the karmaformations consciousness through consciousness corporeality and mind through the extinction of ignorance the karmaformations become extinguished through the extinction of the karmaformations consciousness etc
Corporeality feeling perception mental formations and consciousness are impermanentwoeful egoless be they of the past or the future not to mention the present
Understanding thus the learned and noble disciple does no longer cling to things past and he enters the path leading to the turning away therefrom to detachment and extinction
The five groups of existence are impermanent woeful and egoless
And also the causes and conditions of the arising of these groups of existence are impermanent woeful and egoless
How could that which has arisen through something impermanent woeful and egoless as its root be itself permanent joyful and an ego
All those ascetics and priests who again and again in manifold ways belief in an ego they all do so with regard to the five groups of existence or to one of them namely
There the ignorant worldling considers one of the five groups as the ego or the ego as the owner of that group or that group as included in the ego or the ego as included in that group
Now someone holds the view This is my ego this is the world
After death I shall remain permanent steady eternal and not be subject to any change
This eternityview is one karmaformation
But through what is this karmaformation conditioned
It is the craving which has arisen in the ignorant worldling while being impressed by a feeling conditioned through an infatuated senseimpression
It is through this craving arisen hereby that the karmaformulation has arisen
Hence that karmaformation is impermanent created and has conditionally arisen
In one who thus understands thus sees the immediate extinction of biases takes place
Again someone holds the view May I not be
May there nothing belong to me
I shall not be
Nothing will belong to me Also this annihilationview is a karmaformation is impermanent created and conditionally arisen
In one who thus understands thus sees the immediate extinction of biases takes place
To the monk Yamaka once the following wrong view had arisen Thus do I understand the doctrine shown by the Blessed One that he in whom all Biases have vanished at the dissolution of the body after death will become annihilated and will no longer exist after death
What do you think Brother Yamaka are corporeality feeling perception mental formations or consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent venerable sir
Now do you consider corporeality etc as the Perfect One
No venerable sir
Or do you consider the Perfect One as contained therein
No venerable sir
Or do you consider all these groups combined as the Perfect One
No venerable sir
Or do you think that the Perfect One is without corporeality or without feeling without perception without mental formations without consciousness
No venerable sir
Now since you cannot even during lifetime make out the Perfect One according to truth and reality how can you rightly maintain that the Perfect One will at the dissolution at the body become annihilated and no longer continue after death
Should someone asked me what will become of the Holy One I should answer thus 'Corporeality feeling perception mental formations and consciousness are impermanent and what is impermanent that is woeful and what is woeful that will become extinguished and annihilated'
Five groups of existence forming the objects of attachment have been taught by the Blessed One corporeality feeling perception mental formations consciousness
With regard to these five groups I do not find any ego or something belonging to an ego but still I am not yet a Holy One not yet freed from biases
Also concerning these groups of existence liable to attachment I am no longer subject to the thoughts of I am or this I am
The world as a rule is fettered by attachment and clinging to things and is firmly adhering to them
But the learned and noble disciple does no longer attach himself cling and firmly adhere and incline to the thoughts I have an ego and he knows Merely woe is it that arises merely woe that vanishes
Suppose a man who is not blind beheld the many bubbles on the Ganges as they drive along and he watched them and carefully examined them
After carefully examining them they will appear to him empty unreal and unsubstantial
In exactly the same way does the monk behold all corporeal phenomena feelings perceptions mental formations and states of consciousness whether past present or future one's own or external gross or subtle lofty or low far or near
And he watches them and examines them carefully and after examining them they appear to him empty unreal and unsubstantial
There is no corporeality no feeling no perception no mental formation no consciousness that is permanent enduring and lasting and that not subject to any change will eternally remain the same
If there existed such an ego that is permanent enduring and lasting and not subject to any change then a holy life leading to complete extinction of suffering will not be possible
Once the contemplation of impermanency has been developed and has attained full growth then it will overcome all craving for sensuous existence all craving for finematerial existence all craving for immaterial existence it will overcome and uproot all conceit of I am
The learned and noble disciple does not consider corporeality feeling perception mental formations or consciousness as the ego nor the ego as the owner of one of these groups nor this group as included within the ego nor the ego as included within this group
Of such a learned and noble disciple it is said that he is no longer fettered by any group of existence his own or external
Thus I say
It is possible that a virtuous man while contemplating the five groups of existence as impermanent woeful empty egoless may realize the fruit of streamentrance
The noble disciple who out of faith has gone forth from home to the homeless life has with regard to the five groups of existence to fulfil the task of living in contemplation of their impermanency woefulness and egolessness
And while penetrating these things he becomes freed therefrom freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation grief and despair becomes freed from suffering thus I say
What must exist and what must be the condition that such views may arise as 'This is my ego this the world
After death I shall continue be everlasting eternal not subject to any change'
The five groups of existence must exist that such views may arise
What do you think Are these five groups permanent or are they impermanent
Impermanent venerable sir
But what is impermanent is that joyful or woeful
Woeful venerable sir
But based on that which is impermanent woeful and subject to change may arise such views as 'This is my ego this the world
After death I shall continue be everlasting eternal not subject to any change'
No venerable sir
The visible objects are egoless sounds odors tastes bodily impressions and mindobjects are egoless
But of that which is egoless one has according to reality and true wisdom to know thus That am I not that does not belong to me that is not my ego
What is the totality of things
Eye and visible objects ear and sounds nose and odors tongue and tastes body and bodily impressions mind and mindobjects these are called the totality of things
All things are egoless
All things one has to comprehend fully all things one has to overcome all things one has to know directly
It is said that the world is empty
But why does one call the world empty
Because the world is empty of an ego and of something belonging to the ego therefore the world is called empty
But which are the things that are empty of an ego
Empty of an ego are eye and visible objects ear and sounds nose and odors tongue and tastes body and bodily impressions mind and mindobjects
One should not imagine oneself of being identical with the eye should not imagine oneself of being included within the eye should not imagine oneself of being outside the eye should not imagine oneself The eye belongs to me
One should not imagine oneself of being identical with the visible objects should not imagine oneself of being included within the visible objects should not imagine oneself of being outside the visible objects should not imagine The visible objects belong to me
One should not imagine oneself of being identical with eyeconsciousness should not imagine oneself of being included within eyeconsciousness should not imagine oneself of being outside of eyeconsciousness should not imagine The eyeconsciousness belongs to me
One should not imagine oneself of being identical with the totality of things
Thus not imagining any more the wise disciple clings no longer to anything in the world
Clinging no longer to anything he trembles not
Trembling no longer he reaches in his own person the extinction of all vanity Exhausted is rebirth lived the holy life and no further existence have I to expect thus he knows
Consciousness is egoless
Also the causes and conditions of the arising of consciousness they likewise are egoless
Then how could it be possible that consciousness having arisen through something which is egoless could ever be an ego
Whoso understands and contemplates the mind as egoless in him the egoview disappears
Whoso understands and contemplates as egoless the mindobjects mindconsciousness mindimpression and the agreeable disagreeable and indifferent feeling conditioned through mindimpression in him the egoview disappears
 Just as this body has in various ways been revealed disclosed and explained as egoless in exactly the same way one should explain also mind as egoless
 Empty village is the name for the six senseorgans
Thus whenever an experienced learned and wise man examines the six senseorgans eye ear nose tongue body or mindorgan then all these things appear to him as delusive empty and deceitful
I am is a delusion
This I am is a delusion
Corporeal shall I be is a delusion
Uncorporeal shall I be is a delusion
Endowed with perception shall I be is a delusion
Without perception shall I be is a delusion
Neither with nor without perception shall I be is a delusion
Delusion is a sickness an ulcer a thorn
 What is the minddeliverance of emptiness
There the monk repairs to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut
And he contemplates thus Empty is all this of an ego and of anything belonging to an ego
 If one develops the contemplation of impermanency of egolessness due to woefulness then all these contemplations are leading to higher blessing
Do not think such evil unwholesome thoughts as Life and body are identical or Life is one thing but another is the body' or 'Does the Perfect One live after death or not and why should one not think such thoughts
Because such thoughts are not profitable do not belong to the genuine holy life do not lead to the turning away and detachment not to extinction appeasement enlightenment and Nirvana
I shall show here the advantages arising from the realization of the characteristic of notself
If one can clearly perceive the characteristic of anattaa one achieves the knowledge pertaining to the path of streamentry wherein egodelusion and personality belief are totally eradicated
All beings who drift and circle in the long and beginningless round of rebirths called samsaara rarely encounter the teachings of a Buddha
They may not encounter them for the time of even a hundred thousand worldcycles
They may not get the opportunity of hearing of a Buddha's teachings even once while an infinite number of worldcycles elapse
The number of existences and worldcycles in which beings have been afflicted by evil and error predominate
Hence in the mental makeup of a being there is always an infinite number of unwholesome actions that can result in its falling into a world of utmost torment or in being reborn in other worlds of woe
Egodelusion is the foremost of the unwholesome kamma of old and accompanies beings incessantly
As long as personalitybelief exists these old unwholesome actions are fiery and full of strength
Though beings may be enjoying happiness and splendour as deities as divine rulers or in the finematerial or immaterial Brahma worlds yet they necessarily exist as it were with their heads forever turned towards the four worlds of woe
Palm fruits in a palm grove have an everexisting tendency to fall to the ground even though they may be attached to the very top of a palm tree
So long as the stalks are firm the fruits will remain on the tree but as soon as the stalks weaken they will inevitably fall to the ground
In the same way deities and Brahma gods afflicted with egodelusion will be able to exist in their respective worlds only as long as the stalks of vital life force as deities and Brahmas remain intact
But when these stalks of vital life force are severed they inevitably fall into worlds below just like the palm fruits
This happens because personalitybelief which is ever present in the mental makeup of a being is a great burden  heavier than even the Mount Meru  inasmuch as personalitybelief gathers in its fold an infinite number of unwholesome kamma accumulated in the past
Thus beings who harbor within themselves this personalitybelief are continually under pressure to gradually descend or directly to fall towards the worlds of woe although they may be living in the highest of the Brahma worlds
The cases of beings living in the lower Brahma worlds or in the celestial or human world are much worse and need no further comment
Although such beings may exist as the rulers of Brahma worlds or of celestial worlds yet their mental makeup contains readymade the eight great hells the lesser hells the worlds of ghosts and demons and the animal realm
It is because these beings do not know that the tendency towards those miseryfilled lower realms is always present in their mental makeup that the Brahma kings and divine kings can afford to derive pleasure and enjoyment from their form of existence
But all the old unwholesome actions that have accompanied beings throughout the long and beginningless round of rebirths will be extinguished completely when their head and chief personalitybelief has been made to disappear entirely
Apart from that old unwholesome kamma that had accompanied beings since time immemorial even in the case of the numerous unwholesome actions committed in the present existence their tendencies entirely disappear as soon as their head and chief the personalitybelief becomes completely extinguished
For such beings there may remain occasion to fear affliction by vermin but there no longer remains any occasion for them to fear the resultants of the infinite number of past unwholesome actions
Beings whose mental makeup is entirely freed from personalitybelief have as it were their heads turned towards the higher planes of the celestial and Brahma worlds even though they may be living in the human world
And if living in the lower celestial and Brahma realms their heads are always turned towards the higher planes of those worlds
They resemble the vapors that invariably rise upwards from forests and mountains during the latter part of the rainy season
This shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of personalitybelief as far as relating to past kamma
Human beings deities and Brahmas who have personalitybelief in their mental makeup may be good and virtuous beings today but any time later they may commit an unlimited number of evil deeds even grave offences like matricide parricide killing of arahants etc and this may happen to them tomorrow or the day after next month or next year or in following existences
Today they may be devotees within the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation while tomorrow or the day after etc they may be outside its pale or even become enemies and destroyers of the Buddha Saasana
Those beings however human or divine who well perceive the characteristic of notself and thus have entirely extirpated personalitybelief from their mental makeup will cease to commit evil deeds and other unwholesome kamma even in their dreams although they may continue to circle in samsaara for many more lives to come
From the day of freeing themselves from personalitybelief until their final existence before their attainment of Nibbaana they will always remain within the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation wherever they are reborn
They will never appear in a form of existence or in a world where the Buddha's Dispensation is absent
This shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of personalitybelief as far as relating to future kamma
How the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past become inoperative at the moment when personalitybelief is extinguished may be illustrated as follows
In a string of beads where a great number of beads are strung together by a strong silk thread if one bead is pulled all the others will follow the one that is pulled
But if the silk thread is cut or removed pulling one of the beads will not disturb the other beads because there is no longer any attachment between them
Similarly a being that possesses personalitybelief harbors a strong attachment to the series of the aggregates arisen during past existences and past world cycles and transforms them into an ego
Thinking In the past I have often been a human being a deity or a Brahmaa he acquires the thread that is personalitybelief
It is thus that the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past which have not yet produced resultants will accompany that being wherever he may be reborn
These unwholesome actions of the past resemble beads that are strung and bound together by a strong thread
Beings however who clearly perceive the characteristic of notself and have rid themselves of personalitybelief will perceive that the bodily and mental aggregates that arise and disappear even within the short period of one sitting do so as separate phenomena and not as a closely interlinked continuum
The concept of my self which is like the thread is no longer present
Those bodily and mental processes appear to them like the beads from which the thread has been removed
They clearly perceive that the unwholesome actions of the past committed by them are not persons nor beings not an I nor my actions but that they arise and disappear in an instant
That is why that past unwholesome kamma disappears as soon as personalitybelief disappears
It should be known however that only unwholesome kamma disappears
Wholesome kamma of the past does not disappear through the mere disappearance of personalitybelief
It is only when the stage of the path of sainthood is reached and when craving is completely eradicated that wholesome kamma of the past becomes inoperative
Personalitybelief is an evil that is extremely deeprooted and farreaching
A person who commits an evil deed and thus becomes extremely agitated and worried over the prospect of being reborn in states of woe transforms that evil deed of his into a self and becomes greatly distressed by such firmly held thoughts as I have done wrong
I have gravely erred But if that being fully comprehends and realizes the characteristic of notself and thereby can abolish attachment to such thoughts as I have gravely erred that kamma will no longer have the power of producing resultants so far as that being is concerned
But generally beings do not discard their attachment to such thoughts
Although that kamma does not as it were desire to accompany that being nor to produce resultants yet it is forced to do so by the fact that being takes possession of it by harboring such thoughts as I myself have committed that deed
It is my kamma Because of this forcible possessive act that kamma is obliged to produce its resultants
To this extent are beings possessing personalitybelief deluded and erring in their ways
It is the same in the case of unwholesome kamma of the past that remains operative
It is because of the forcible possessive act of personalitybelief that this kamma accompanies beings throughout their samsaric wanderings and will produce its resultants in due course
Beings find that they cannot discard their unwholesome actions though being oppressed by their resultants and suffering great privations in the process
They think I have committed those evil deeds and thus they take as it were possession of them
Thus these unwholesome actions cannot help to produce resultants and continue to do so disabling those beings to achieve release
To this extent personalitybelief is profoundly evil and erroneous
Beings are very much afraid of the dangers of disease old age and death
But through harboring such fear they become attached to the past incidents of disease old age and death by identifying themselves with those experiences in the thought For a long time in the past I have suffered these ills Thus they find it impossible to relinquish even such fearsome phenomena
Hence these phenomena of disease old age and death continue to accompany them as it were against their own will and continue to cause oppression
To this extent too is personalitybelief profoundly evil and erroneous
In this present existence too when external and internal dangers are encountered or disease and ailments occur beings attach themselves to them through such thoughts as I feel pain I feel hurt and thus take a possessive attitude towards them
This becomes an act of bondage that later may obstruct beings from ridding themselves of those diseases ailments and dangers
Because this bondage through personalitybelief is so strong beings have often found those diseases ailments or dangers to be their inseparable companions through many existences up to the present day
Thus personality creates a possessive attachment even to diseases ailments and dangers though these are so greatly oppressive
Also fears of encountering disease ailments and dangers in future will produce such a bondage
And as long as there is personalitybelief beings will certainly meet such eventualities also in future
This is a brief description of how personalitybelief is profoundly evil and erroneous
The attachments of craving and conceit are not necessarily attachments of wrong views
Craving develops an attachment for all the phenomena in the three spheres of existence in the form It is my property Conceit develops a proud attachment for them in the form It is I who owns it or It is I who has those great qualities In the case of beings who have personalitybelief craving and conceit follow the lead given by personalitybelief
In the case of streamwinners oncereturners and nonreturners who have eliminated personalitybelief craving and conceit follow the distortion of perception and the distortion of consciousness
The attachments produced by these distortions are superficial but those produced by personalitybelief are deep
This ends the description how unwholesome actions of the past totally cease with the disappearance of personalitybelief
Vacchagotta the Wanderer went to visit the Exalted One and said
Now master Gotama is there a self At these words the Exalted One was silent
How then master Gotama is there not a self For a second time the Exalted One was silent
Then Vacchagotta the Wanderer rose from his seat and went away
Now not long after the departure of the Wanderer the Venerable Aananda said to the Exalted One
How is it lord that the Exalted One gave no answer to the question of the Wanderer Vacchagotta
If Aananda when asked by the Wanderer 'Is there a self' I had replied to him 'There is a self' then Aananda that would be siding with the recluses and brahmins who are eternalists
But if Aananda when asked 'Is there not a self' I had replied that it does not exist that Aananda would be siding with those recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists
Again Aananda when asked by the Wanderer 'Is there a self' had I replied that there is would my reply be in accordance with the knowledge that all things are impermanent
Surely not lord
Again Aananda when asked by Vacchagotta the Wanderer 'Is there a self' had I replied that there were not it would have been more bewilderment for the already bewildered Vacchagotta
He would have said 'Formerly indeed I had a self but now I have not one any more'
In the SamuyttaNikaaya is the story of Vacchagotta the Wanderer the man who was concerned with the existence or nonexistence of his self
In the DighaNikaaya is the story of Potthapaada an inveterate asker of questions in search of a soul
It is of interest to note the different response these two inquirers received from the Buddha
Vacchagotta's questions remained unanswered while Potthapaada's doctrinal questions were discussed and answered in full
Both of these inquirers have their counterparts in the West today  those who are concerned with a self and those who are concerned with a soul While the two terms self and soul are often used as synonyms and interchangeable I think that those who use them in reference to themselves have a differential conception of the two words
The seeker for a self is more concerned with the preservation of his ego in the here and now whereas the wouldbe possessor of a soul is perturbed as to survival after death
It is empiric that the protagonists of the self theory or concept are by nature extrovert and egotistic
On the other hand those who most ardently cling to the soul concept are less concerned with asserting themselves before others but are concerned mainly with their inmost nature  natural introverts
Yet these too in their quiet way are also egotistical in that they desire to preserve their identity
While the Asian Buddhist world unanimously accepts and adheres to the doctrine of anatta  the absence of an abiding and stable entity  it is by no means uncommon to find nominal Buddhists in the West who are unable to shake off years of indoctrination of the soul concept and as a consequence bring to their Buddhism preconceived views often bolstered up by a syncretic admixture of other Indian beliefs
The story of Vacchagotta precedes this article
His questions are akin to asking a man if he has stopped beating his wife
The man may have not have lifted his hand against her at any time but if he answers Yes the inference is that he had previously beaten her
If he answers No the inference is that he still beats her
Had the Buddha agreed that Vacchagotta had a self for the Buddha did not deny the existence of phenomenon Vacchagotta could have taken it as a confirmation of the brahmin belief in an eternal atman or spark of the Divine to survive after death
Had the Buddha agreed that there was not a self in the ultimate sense Vacchagotta could have taken the reply as an endorsement of the view held by the annihilationists  that nothing survived after death
Vacchagotta was not asking questions idly but this was an occasion on which confusion could have arisen and so the Buddha maintained the noble silence and left Vacchagotta to ponder further on the point that was bothering him
He still had not grasped the higher truths of karma and aniccaa under which the conventional self is but a momentary manifestation of everchanging components to be cast aside at death and without a stable entity to be carried forward to a new birth
Later Vacchagotta did grasp these truths and he finally became one of the arahants
Those who are fond of quoting this dialogue between the Buddha and Vacchagotta to support their theory of a soul seldom if ever go on to the Buddha's final explanation to Aananda which closes the passage and which incidentally displays one of those flashes of the Buddha's humor that peeps out here and there in his dealings with inquirers
It would be stretching the argument beyond reason to presume that the Buddha was not capable or not inclined to make an assertion on the soul if it really existed in the light of his many expositions of its nonexistence
The commentator Kumaralabdha quoted by Dr
Malalasekera in the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism puts it in a nutshell
For our purpose we can dismiss the self seekers for while they insist on having a self to satisfy their ego many of them give at least lipservice to the anattaa doctrine
They have their self that thinks writes or teaches to present to the world
They have their self that strives to lift the self still higher in man's estimation till it equals or becomes part of the SELF and some go on to the Overself or Godhead by another name
These people see themselves as gods in the making and their word is final  so far as they are concerned
Their concepts are usually derived via Theosophy from preBuddhistic Brahmanism even though they may call themselves Buddhists Brahman the First Cause or Great SELF was personified as Brahma the Creator the Self and all beings were or had in them a spark of the Divine a lesser self which was still essentially of the same substance as the Great SELF to which it eventually returned when purified by rites and ceremonies
On the question of a soul Potthapaada and his friends were discussing the importance of consciousness its arising and its ceasing
One had put forward the theory that
States of consciousness come to a man without reason and without a cause and so also do they pass away
At the time when they spring up in him then he becomes conscious
This was rejected by a second speaker who protested
That sirs will never be as you say
Consciousness sirs is a man's soul
It is the soul that comes and goes
When the soul comes into a man then he becomes conscious when the soul goes away out of a man he becomes unconscious
Seeing the Buddha approaching they decided to ask his opinion on the matter and Potthapaada outlines the pith of their discussion and the various arguments that have been put forward
The Buddha refuted the former view by stating that it was precisely through a reason by means of a cause that states of consciousness come and go
By training some states of consciousness arise
By training others pass away Through training one sort of consciousness arises and through training another passes away
The Buddha illustrates his meaning by a lengthy discourse on training showing the causal origination of consciousness as a consequence
He then goes on to the cessation of consciousness dependent on the cessation of ideas as the adept in meditative practices achieves the various trance states of the jhaanas
To him neither thinking anymore nor fancying the ideas the states of consciousness he had pass away and no others coarser than they arise
So he enters in jhaana
Thus it is Potthapaada that the attainment of the cessation of conscious ideas takes place step by step
The first proposition of the independent arising of ideas leading to consciousness having thus been disposed of by the Buddha Potthapaada admits to not having heard this explained before but I now understand what you say He then proceeds to the second opinion that had been expressed by his fellow mendicants
Is then Sir the consciousness identical with a man's soul or is consciousness one thing and the soul another
But what then Potthapaada
Do you really fall back on the soul queries the Buddha
Potthapaada replies that he takes for granted the existence of a soul of some kind
Maybe a material soul he suggests tentatively but without much conviction
Failing that what about a soul the exact copy of the body but so subtle in texture that it could only be described as being made of mind No
Well then a soul without form and made of consciousness
To all of these suggestions the Buddha has but one reply
Suppose you did have a soul conforming to any of these descriptions still some ideas some states of consciousness would arise to the man and others would pass away so you can see how consciousness must be one thing and the soul would be another
However Potthapaada was still not convinced that he was totally lacking in a soul
On that point he had a closed mind as is shown by his next question
He does not ask Is there or is there not a soul but is it possible for him to ever understand what the soul is
Is it possible for me to understand whether consciousness is the man's soul or is the one different from the other
The Buddha's reply to Potthapaada is equally applicable to the soulseekers of today those who accept the Buddha's teachings with reservations  the right to reject what does not fit in with their preconceived notions beliefs and views
Hard it is for you Potthapaada holding as you do different views other things approving themselves to you setting different aims before yourself striving after a different perfection trained in a different system of doctrine to grasp this matter
Potthapaada abandons his search for a definition of his soul to which he still clings and changes the subject by propounding ten questions on the imponderables
The Buddha bears patiently with him and in answer to each question replies it is not a matter on which he had expressed an opinion for such questions were not calculated to profit were not concerned with his Dhamma nor to the attainment of Nirvana
But Potthapaada has not exhausted his propensity for asking questions
Then what is it that the Exalted One has determined
I have expounded what Dukkha is I have expounded what is its origin I have expounded what is the cessation of Dukkha I have expounded what is the method by which one may reach the cessation of Dukkha
The Buddha departed with dignity while Potthapaada was subjected to the jeers and sarcasm of his fellow mendicants for having failed to obtain the answers to his later questions
It is worthy of note that to the doctrinal questions the Buddha gave serious and ample replies sufficient to remove any reasonable grounds for differing from the Dhamma he taught but he refused to be drawn into any discussion that could not lead to finality such matters being outside of the Dhamma taught by him
The Buddha taught his doctrine of soullessness  anattaa  in two ways and by two methods demonstrated its truth and necessity if the major purpose of his teachings was to be accomplished  the cessation of Dukkha
One was by the analysis of constituents of personality the other was that any belief in a permanent self would conflict with the causal law and so deny the possibility of escape from the wheel of becoming
In regard to the analysis of personality there are so many passages that deal with this method that lack of space prevents more than a passing mention of them
Those who wish to clarify their thinking on this point will have no difficulty in finding them
The most common formula is to proceed with those who regard body as the self or the self as being in the body so with feelings with perception with activities with consciousness
Such ones become obsessed with the idea I am the body
The body is mine or I feel I perceive or there are activities I am conscious Feeling is mine perception is mine activities are mine consciousness is mine But when these change and alter owing to their unstable nature then arises sorrow woe and grief due to their impermanence and instability
In SN prior to an analysis as above a certain one asked of the Buddha
Pray Lord is there any body feeling perception activity or consciousness that is permanent stable by nature lasting unchanging like unto the eternal so that it will stand fast
Then the Exalted One took up a pinch of dust on the tip of his nail and said to that brother
Even thus much material form brother is not permanent stable eternal by nature unchanging like unto the eternal so that it will stand fast
If even thus much material form brother were permanent unchanging then the living of the holy life for the utter destruction of suffering would not be set forth
But inasmuch as even thus much material form brother is not permanent stable eternal by nature unchanging therefore the living of the holy life for the utter destruction of suffering is set forth
We have on previous occasions written that no one doctrine taught by the Buddha stands in isolation from any other or all of them
The Buddha's reply to Potthapaada quoted above as to what he expounded is the key to them all and the connecting link between them  Dukkha its origin its cessation and the way to its cessation  was the Buddha's only concern
All his doctrinal dissertations climaxed in moral perfection as the way to Dukkha's ceasing
The purpose of the analysis in expounding the anatta doctrine is to understand the functioning and the impermanence of the five aggregates that constitute the phenomenal person If this be accomplished the major delusion of a self that obsesses mankind generally will be eliminated
With the elimination of this illusory self the rootcause of our unhappiness is eliminated
The eternal thirst to satisfy its demands the grasping after sensepleasures to please it the clinging to phenomena that must fade and die is the source of Dukkha
So the doctrine of Anattaa becomes a coordinating link with all other doctrines leading to the ethical life and sorrow's ending
 From Metta Vol No
It is in vain that we return to the places that once we loved
We shall never see them again because they were situated not in Space but in Time and because the man who tries to rediscover them is no longer the child or the youth who decked them with the fervour of his emotions
The classic philosopher assumes that our personality is built about a hard and changeless core is a sort of spiritual statue which stands like a rock against the assaults of the external world
Such is man as viewed by Plutarch by Moliere and even by Balzac
But Proust shows us that the individual plunged in Time disintegrates
The day comes when nothing at all remains of the man who once loved who once made a revolution
My life as I saw it  wrote Marcel Proust presented me with the spectacle of a succession of periods so occurring that but for a brief space of time nothing of that which had been one's sustaining force continued to exist at all in that which followed it
I saw human life as a complex from which the support of an individual identical and permanent 'self' was so conspicuously absent was something so useless for the future so far extended into the past that death might just as well intervene at this point or that because it could never mark a conclusion that was other than arbitrary The successive selves are so different from one another that each ought really to have a different name
An electric light bulb has burned out
This small incandescent bulb that shone so brightly is now dark it will never shed light again it will no longer turn darkness into daylight in the nighttime
In its useless state it will nevermore be able to shine forth its miraculous rays to enable us to read and to see the other people and objects that surround us
There it hangs in its socket
It cannot respond to our command to render service it is lifeless it is dead
What do we do
Replace the bulb with another one of course
The used bulb that is no longer a part of life is consigned to the trash can but the living force the electricity that gave it life now courses through the new bulb that now hangs in the socket
Light and life go on
The discarded light bulb has not been able to take along the life that flowed through it to its final resting place
So it is with our life
It is one and indivisible although its ever changing forms are innumerable and perishable
There is in truth no death although every form must die
We cannot permanently possess the life that flows through us any more than the electric light bulb can own the current that gave it light
Life alone is continuous ever seeking selfexpression in new forms
So it is with what we call the soul
There is no substantial categorical entity as a soul which belongs to us and only to us in death as it did in life
A human individual is composed of psychological elements and a physical body
It is consciousness which unifies the individual
This relationship between consciousness and the psychophysical existence often gives rise to the egocentric belief that we possess an immortal unchanging soul the destiny of which may be eternal happiness or eternal misery according to the deeds of the personality it inhabits
Unfortunately this idea is so deeprooted in Western man so near and dear to him that he naturally experiences great difficulty in understanding any teaching contrary to this established notion
Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a separative soul self or aatman
According to the teachings of the Buddha the idea of self is an imaginary false belief which has no corresponding reality and produces harmful thoughts of me and mine Buddhism insists that the soul is not a rigid unchanging entity but a living evolving organism
The soul as Buddhists understand it is an ever growing changing bundle of attributes or characteristics forming our character and personality
All of these manifested things when analyzed are found to lack continuous form or unchanging substance
In reality there is nothing infinite apart from finite things
Whatever exists is in a constant state of flux through and through like the flame of the lamp and all existence is in a process which continues to constantly renew itself
Our mind and its thoughts is essentially a stream of consciousness
Thought however is not simply a physiological function but a kind of energy something like electricity
We should therefore strive to translate and activate this thought energy in the world we live in the life we live in this existence where the illusion of the separative self and the unchanging permanent soul can be forever eliminated no longer causing us to cling to forms that lack reality and substance
The bonds of selfhood are then broken
New vistas appear before us
A clearer unclouded understanding of the living forces of life is now ours
 from Suchness April
Saantaraksita was born in a royal family in India in the th century CE
He was one of the greatest Buddhist philosophers of his time and a chancellor of the famous Naalanda University
His main opus the TattvaSamgraha is a monumental work of philosophical criticism comprising no less than stanzas
A very voluminous commentary on it written by his pupil Kamalasila is likewise a work of great philosophical and critical acumen
Both stanzas and commentary are extant in their Sanskrit original and in a Tibetan translation
The Sanskrit text of both in Devanaagari script was published in in the Gaekward's Oriental Series in two volumes
In the same series a complete English translation of stanzas and commentary by Dr
Ganganath Jha appeared in and likewise in two volumes of together pages
The following extracts have been taken from that translation with some necessary changes chiefly in Buddhist terminology which were made after consulting the Sanskrit original
A few more extracts had been published earlier in Buddhism and God Idea
It is difficult to identify Saantaraksita's philosophical position with any of the contemporary schools since his work shows features of Madhyamika Vijnaanavaada as well as Sautrantika thought
Probably Saantaraksita took an independent and eclectic position of his own
His work and thought is still in need of careful research before it can be evaluated as it deserves it
Saantaraksita's life had also an active side together with Padmasambhava he founded the first monastery in Tibet Samye and had visited Tibet once before

Commentary
The doctrine of Nosoul is called the Gateway to the Highest Good because it is the means of entering Nirvana it is Nirvana that is meant by the term Highest Good
This doctrine causes fright in those who uphold wrong beliefs as for instance the soulbelief and are attached to unrealistic views
As it was said The foolish man is always beset with such fears as 'I am not I may cease to exist naught is mine nothing shall be mine' but in the wise fear has ceased
 stanza 
Commentary
 It is indeed omniscience that follows from the removal of the hindrance by the defilements and by cognizable things
It is because these very defilements ie greed hate etc obstruct an understanding of the real nature of things that one speaks of the hindrance consisting in the defilements
Though things are perceived the lack of capacity to discern them in all their aspects as to whether they are to be rejected or accepted and also the incapacity to conduct oneself  this is the hindrance in regard to cognizables
Of these two the hindrance caused by defilements is removed by the direct experience of Soullessness
The hindrance in regard to cognizables is removed by the dedicated constant and longcontinued absorption of that very doctrine of Soullessness
All these defilements as greed hatred and the rest have their root in the wrong notion of a soul
They do not arise from external things because even when the external thing is there the said defilements will not appear without unwise attention to them and conversely even when there is no external thing the defilements will appear when there is a confrontation with unwise imaginings
Thus when presence and absence of one thing do not follow the presence and absence of another the latter cannot be the cause of the former if it were so there would be incongruities
Defilements really proceed from the unrealistic notion of a self
For instance unless one seizes upon the notion of I one cannot have selflove
Nor can love arise for objects taken as self or self's property unless one seizes upon the notion of mine and on what is conducive to the arising of pleasure to oneself
Likewise hatred towards anything does not appear unless one seizes upon objects as being repulsive to one's self and self's property because there cannot be hatred against what is not harmful to one's self and its property nor against what removes that harm
From all this it is clear that it is the notion of a soul or self produced from time beginningless by a repeated habituation to one's nature which generates the grip on self's property
These two produce selflove which again generates hate and other defilements
From this concatenation it is abundantly clear that the defilements have their root in the clinging to self and its property originating from an excessive habituation to the notion of a self or soul
Contrary to this idea of soul or self is the idea of nosoul or notself because the latter rests upon a mode quite the reverse of the former
It is incompatible too that both these ideas  of Soul and Nosoul  should be identical or coexist in the same continuity because they are as contrary to each other as the notions of serpent and rope applied to the same object
Thus the doctrine of Nosoul being contrary to the doctrine of Soul it becomes contrary to  incompatible with  the defilements too ie
greed hatred and the rest
Consequently when the doctrine of Nosoul being incompatible with all defects and aberrations has been directly experienced then its contrary  ie the whole host of defilements as greed etc
 cannot obtain any footing just as darkness ceases in a place flooded with light
It is in that way that the hindrance caused by defilements is eliminated by the realization of the doctrine of Nosoul
But if it were impossible for the idea of Nosoul to appear in the continuity of a man whose defilements have not been destroyed then there would be no room at all for the arising of an understanding of Nosoul
It is however a matter of common experience that the idea of Nosoul presents itself before all men
And if it is meditated upon it is capable of reaching great intensity just as the thought about a young woman
Subsequently it becomes as obvious as if one were to observe a directly perceived thing
How then can it be impossible for the idea of Nosoul to arise in the minds of men
The host of defilements even in their most blatant forms are unable to shake the strength of the doctrine of NoSoul
Because being due to adventitious causes the defilements are never very firm
On the other hand as to the idea of NoSoul it forms the very nature of things and is also helped by the means of cognition hence it is strong and firm
It has been argued that even for those who have cognised the doctrine of NoSoul through inference the defilements as greed etc do appear
 But this is not conclusive because it is the knowledge acquired by meditation which through its clarity and distinctness directly envisages soulless things in a nonconceptual way and having as its object wellascertained things it is not erroneous
It is such an understanding of NoSoul that can entirely uproot the notion of a Soul and has on that account been described as being opposed to it
This knowledge is not of the kind derived from study and reflective thought
 stanzas 
Commentary
It is accepted that liberation consists in the absolute cessation of the series of rebirths
But the only means of attaining this consists in the teachings of the Blessed Lord as it is only here and nowhere else that we have the doctrine of NoSoul which is the sole destroyer of defilements that are the source of rebirth
All other philosophers are wedded to the false doctrine of a Soul
Thus it is the word of the Blessed Lord alone which as being the means of obtaining the highest good can be the indicator of Dharma hence it is this teaching alone that should be depended upon by all who seek their own welfare
 Such is the purport of the whole text
It might be argued that the Yogin does abrogate it But if the Soul were to be abrogated it could be repudiated only in the words it does not exist as otherwise there would be no point in repudiating it
Because if after having accepted the concept of a Soul one were to repudiate it as the source of pain then such repudiation would be useless because the repudiation of a thing is done for the purpose of abandoning it and no abandoning would be possible of what one regards as being one's everlasting Self hence that repudiation would be useless
Nor can those other philosophers repudiate the Soul as being nonexistent because having regarded it as existent if they now regard it as nonexistent this would mean a complete volteface on their part
Anattaa is the last of the three characteristics or general characteristics
Like the teaching of the four Noble Truths it is the teaching peculiar to Buddhas
The most usual English rendering which will be employed here is notself though the words soulless egoless and impersonal are often used for it

Etymologically anattaa consists of the negative prefix an plus attaa
There are two main Pali forms of the word namely attaa and atta
Neither form seems to be used in the plural in the Tipitaka the singular form being used with a plural verb subject
There is also a rare subsidiary form namely atumo and tumo
As principal Tipitaka uses of the very commonly employed attaa and atta the following five types of examples may be cited
The first two senses of attaa distinguished above may be assumed to have been ordinary usage and no subject of disagreement between the Buddha and his opponents
The last two are of minor import and need not concern us beyond noting them
The characteristic of Notself deals with the third the unidentifiable entity that is conceived and sought and made the subject of a certain class of views namely selfviews
Many suttas classify the conflicting notions of the nature of self held by opponents of the Buddha
It could be and apparently was for instance claimed that it had materiality or was immaterial or both or neither was percipient of oneness or of plurality or of the limited or of the measureless was eternal or uneternal or both or neither had only pleasure or only pain or both or neither each of these theories being maintained by its propounder as the only truth and all else wrong
Or else it could be described as having materiality either limited or infinite or as immaterial and either limited or infinite
And then whichever of these four is adopted it may be seen as such now or due to be such or in this way Though it is not yet real still I shall contrive for its reality
All these rationalized views stem from uncritical acceptance or overlooking of an underlying tendency or fetter  a natural predisposition  to regard to identify some aspect or other in the situation of perceiving a percept as this is mine or this is what I am or this is my self
These two levels  the selfview and the Isense  are respectively what are called the  fetter of views and the  fetter of conceit
The first is abandoned with the attainment of the first stage of realization while the second is abandoned only with the fourth and final stage
It may be noted here in parenthesis that the rendering of maana by pride though not wrong severs the semantic relationship with mannati and mannanaa which it is most important to preserve intact for the understanding of this situation
The overlooked fundamental conceit I am  a mirage that in the act of perceiving is conceived will fulfil its counterpart the intuitive sense of lack which is craving  in the basic ontological structure of ordinary perception provokes the ordinary man with no knowledge of the Buddha's teaching to indulge in uncritical speculation about what this may be that I am and consequently to build up selftheories
He perceives but the very act of his perceiving is tendentious so that he simultaneously conceives his percepts with an Itendency
But a streamenterer who has attained the first stage of realization has direct acquaintance where the ordinary man has perception owing to which fact the former has the possibility of hastening his attainment of arahatship and an arahant has no more conceivings at all
So long as a man leaves intact this fundamental tendency to conceive in the very act of perceiving accompanied by the tendency to formulate views he will look for answers to the questions that these two tendencies together prompt him to ask and he will invent them and try to prove them
This is how he gives unreasoned attention 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is doubtful in himself about the presently arisen extent thus 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Whence will this creature have come
Whither will it be bound'
When he gives unreasoned attention in this way one of the six kinds of view arises in him the view 'A self exists for me' arises as true and established or the view 'No self exists for me' or the view 'I perceive self with self' or the view 'I perceive notself with self' or the view 'I perceive self with notself arises in him as true and established or else he has some such view as 'It is this my self that speaks and feels and that experiences here and there the ripening of good and bad actions but this my self is permanent ever lasting eternal not subject to change and it will endure as long as eternity' This field of views is called the thicket of views the wilderness of views the vacillation of views the fetter of views
No untaught ordinary man bound by the fetter of views is freed from birth aging and death from sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair he is not freed from suffering I say

In assuming that I was etc
cannot be analyzed all these philosophical systems attempt to settle with unilateral certainty the dialectic questions what was I and the rest and to dispose of them on an inadequate ontological basis of selfidentity without querying how the questions come to be put in the first place or what is the structural nature of being
But any one answer I am this cannot as it happens be decisively established over its contrary opposite though it can be fortified by arguments more or less logical or emotional introducing my self and defining relations between it and what it is considered not to be endowing it then with certain qualities and values and with either eternal or temporary permanence according to bent
The impossibility of establishing absolutely any one of these views as the only truth may lead to abuse and even to violence in the end since it is often thought important to be right
The prerational conceit I am is a fetter but not a view
To perceive is to recognize and identify
In perceiving a percept the untaught ordinary man automatically conceives in the positional terms of I which then must seem involved in an Irelationship to the percept either as identical with it or as contained in it or as separate from it or owning it as mine That relationship so conceived is relished through want of full knowledge of the situation
The rational selfview is both a fetter and a view Though the conceit I am is normally associated with the tendency to formulate views these views need not by any means be definitely formulated but whenever they are none can be specifically described without reference to the five categories affected by clinging
For that reason they can all be reduced to one of the types of what is called the embodiment view plus kaaya  true body which is set up schematically as follows The untaught ordinary man who disregards the ariyas sees materiality as self or self as possessed of materiality or materiality in self or self in materiality
And likewise with feeling perception formations and consciousness
These four selfidentifications embracing the five categories make twenty types
For each of the four basic modes of identifying the Patisambhidaamagga gives a simile as follows
How does he see as self Just as if a man saw a lighted lamp's flame and color as identical thus 'What the flame is that the color is what the color is that the flame is' How does he see self as possessed of Just as if there were a tree possessed of shade such that a man might say 'This is the tree this is the shade the tree is one the shade another but this tree is possessed of this shade in virtue of this shade' How does he see in self Just as if there were a scented flower such that a man might say 'This is the flower this is the scent the flower is one the scent another but the scent is in this flower' How does he see self in Just as if a gem were placed in a casket such that a man might say 'This is the gem this is the casket the gem is one the casket another but this gem is in this casket'  Ps

Self so viewed is then taken either as eternal thus This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting or as temporarily permanent but eventually annihilated for instance thus As soon as this self is annihilated that is peace
All possible views of whatever shade are again classified under sixtytwo types in the first Sutta of the DiighaNikaaya called Brahmajaala Sutta or the Divine Net In this net all possible views are caught and so it can be seen how they come to be
Now all these views  and all these standpoints for views  are formed because it is impossible that anyone shall experience apart from contact and with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition being with being as condition birth with birth as condition aging and death come to be and also sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair that is how there is an origin to this whole aggregatemass of suffering
The structure of the conceit I am and the views to which it gives rise is in fact nothing else than the structure of being the structure of what is impermanent formed and dependently originated A Tathaagata understands that thus ' are formed and gross but there is cessation of formations there is that' By knowing and seeing the escape from them a Tathaagata transcends them 
The Buddha explains how he uses the word attaa in the second sense namely the person or individual noted above
There are these three kinds of acquisition of self gross constituted of mind and immaterial The first has materiality and consists of the four great entities and consumes physical food the second is constituted by mind with all the limbs and lacking no faculty the third consists of perception I teach the Doctrine for the abandoning of acquisitions of self in order that in you who put the teaching into practice defiling ideas may be abandoned and cleansing ideas increase and that you by realization yourselves here and now with direct knowledge enter upon and abide in the fullness of understanding's perfection If it is thought that to do that is an unpleasant abiding that is not so on the contrary by doing that there is gladness happiness tranquillity mindfulness full awareness and a pleasant abiding These are worldly usages worldly language worldly terms of communication worldly descriptions by which a Tathaagata communicates without misapprehending them

It is only after this sketch of views that we can treat of the doctrine of notself 
The first discourse given by the Buddha after his Enlightenment set out the Four Noble Truths
The second stated the characteristic of Notself as follows Bhikkhus materiality is not self
Were materiality self then this materiality would not lead to affliction and one could have it of materiality 'Let my materiality be thus let my materiality be not thus' And it is because materiality is not self that materiality leads to affliction and one cannot have it of materiality 'Let my materiality be thus let my materiality be not thus' The Buddha then continued
How do you conceive this bhikkhus is materiality permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  Is what is impermanent pleasure or pain  Pain Lord  Is what is impermanent painful and subject to change fit to be seen thus 'This is mine this is what I am this is my self'  No Lord 
Consequently bhikkhus any kind of materiality whatever whether past future or presently arisen in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near is all 'This is not mine this is not what I am this is not my self' That is how it should be seen with right understanding as it actually is

The characteristic is stated more succinctly in this way The eye is impermanent what is impermanent is suffering what is suffering is not self or All is notself
And what is the all that is not self
The eye is not self or again All things are notself
The canonical commentary the Patisambhidaamagga adds Materiality is notself in the sense that it has no core 
Aacariya Buddhagohosa's definitions are as follows The characteristics of impermanence and suffering are known whether Buddhas arise or not but that of notself is not known unless there is a Buddha for the knowledge of it is the province of none but a Buddha
The Blessed One in some instances shows notselfness through impermanence in some through suffering and in some through both
Why is that
While impermanence and suffering are both evident notself is unevident for the characteristic of notself seems unevident obscure arcane impenetrable hard to illustrate and hard to describe
He distinguishes the notself and the characteristic of notself Those same five categories are notself because of the words 'What is suffering is not self' Why
Because there is no exercising mastery over them
The mode of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery is the characteristic of notself
Again  is notself in the sense of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery over it
Or alternatively because there is no exercising of mastery over it in the following three instances namely 'Let it when arisen not reach presence' or 'Let it when already reached presence not age' or 'Let it when already reached aging not dissolve' it is void of that mode of exercise of mastery therefore it is notself for four reasons because it is void because it has no owner because it cannot be done with as one wants and because it denies self
The VibhaaviniTiikaa says Notself is the absence of self as conjectured by other teachers that notself as a characteristic is the characteristic of notself
What is conditioned by notself cannot be called self
Materiality is not self
The cause and condition for the arising of materiality are not self so how could materiality which is brought to being by what is not self be self

Nor can what is possessed of rise and fall
If anyone says that the eye is self that is not tenable
The eye's rise and fall is evident from which it follows that self would rise and fall
That is why should anyone say that the eye is self that is not tenable

Craving however provides an emotional attachment to the survival of the personality
Here someone's view is this 'This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity' He hears a Tathaagata or a Tathaagata's disciple teaching the True Idea for the elimination of all standpoints for views all decisions insistencies and underlying tendencies for the stilling of all formations for the relinquishment of all essentials for the exhaustion of craving for fading out cessation extinction
He thinks thus 'So I shall be annihilated
So I shall be lost
So I shall be no more' Then he sorrows and laments beating his breast he weeps and becomes distraught
That is how there is anguish about what is nonexistent in oneself  M

Some shrink back in that way from the truth but some go too far the other way
Some who are humiliated ashamed and disgusted with being relish nonbeing thus 'As soon as this self is annihilated on the dissolution of the body after death that is peace that is the supreme goal that is reality'  Iti II ii p

But One who has eyes sees how what is has come to be and by so doing he practices the way to dispassion for it
Bhikkhus the possession that one might possess that were permanent everlasting do you see any such possession  No Lord  The selftheory clinging whereby one might cling that would never arouse sorrow and despair in him who might cling thereby do you see any such selftheory clinging  No Lord  The view as support that one might take as support that would never arouse sorrow and despair in him who might take it as support do you see any such view as support  No Lord  Bhikkhus there being self there would be self's property  Yes Lord  Or there being self's property there would be self  Yes Lord  Bhikkhus self and self's property being unapprehendable as true and established then would not this view 'This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent endure as long as eternity' be the pure perfection of a fool's idea  How not Lord
It would be the pure perfection of a fool's idea

The Wanderer Vacchagotta during one of his numerous visits to the Buddha asked
How is it Master Gotama does self exist When this was said the Blessed One was silent
How then does self not exist A second time the Blessed One was silent
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta got up from his seat and went away
Soon after he had gone the venerable Aananda asked Lord why did the Blessed One not answer the wanderer Vacchagotta's question
Aananda if when asked 'Does self exist' I had answered 'Self exists' that would have been the belief of those who hold the theory of eternalness and if when asked 'Does self not exist' I had answered 'Self does not exist' that would have been the belief of those who hold the theory of annihilation
Again if when asked 'Does self exist' I had answered 'Self exists' would that have been in conformity with my knowledge that 'All things are notself'
No Lord
And if on being asked 'Does self not exist' I had answered 'Self does not exist' then Vacchagotta who is already confused would have become still more confused 'My self certainly existed but it does not exist now'  S

Self is conceivable only on the basis of clinging to the five categories
But so conceived it must always founder owing to the radical impermanence of their existence
And no other basis for it is possible since no other can be found which does not fall within them
Why this characteristic is hard to see is explained in the commentaries as follows
The characteristic of notself does not become apparent because when resolution into the various elements is not given attention it is concealed by compactness
However when the resolution of the compact is effected by resolving it into its elements the characteristic of notself becomes apparent in its true nature
 Vis
Ch
XXIp

The Paramatthamanjuusaa further explains as follows
Resolution of the compact is effected by resolving in this way The earth element is one the water element is another and so on distinguishing each one and in this way Contact is one feeling is another and so on distinguishing each one When the resolution of the compact is effected means that what is compact as a mass or as a function or as a supporting object has been analysed
For when material and nonmaterial dhammas have arisen mutually steadying each other then owing to misinterpreting that as a unity compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressure
And likewise compactness of function is assumed when although definite differences exist in such and such dhammas functions they are taken as one
And likewise compactness of supportingobject is assumed when although differences exist in the ways in which dhammas that take supportingobjects make them so those supportingobjects are taken as one
But when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand
They are mere dhammas occurring dependent on conditions and void
That is how the characteristic of notself becomes more evident
The Visuddhimagga repeatedly emphasizes that no doer is discoverable but only doing Ch
XVIp XIXp
 that there is no experiencer of the fruit of action and that there is no one who feels
The simile of the blind man able to walk who mounts on his shoulder the cripple who can see so that together they can travel as they like is used to illustrate the radical contingency of dhammas and contingency also forms the subject of a verse quoted from the MahaaNiddesa
'Void world void world' is said Lord
In what way is 'void world' said  It is because of what is void of self or self's property that 'void world' is said Aananda
And what is void of self or self's property
The eye forms eyeconsciousness eyecontact any feeling whether pleasant or unpleasant or neitherunpleasantnorpleasant that arises born of eyecontact is void of self or self's property

Voidness as voidness in formations  for instance the more general as void of the more particular  is exemplified in one Sutta and voidness of self in another
Voidness is variously classified in the Patisambhidaamagga Sunnakathaa
The void minddeliverance is that connected with attasunnataa
One discourse shows how the tendency to perceive in terms of I underlies theories of self
Whatever samanas or brahmanas see self in its various types all of them see the five categories affected by clinging on one or other of them
What five
Here an untaught ordinary man who disregards the ariyas is unconversant with their teaching and undisciplined in it sees materiality as self or self as possessed of materiality or materiality in self or self in materiality he sees feeling perception formations consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or self in consciousness or consciousness in self
So he has this way of seeing and also this attitude 'I am' When there is the attitude 'I am' then there is the organization of the five faculties of eye ear nose tongue and body
There is mind and there are ideas and there is the element of ignorance
When an untaught ordinary man is touched by whatever is felt born of the contact of ignorance it occurs to him 'I am' and 'I am this' and 'I shall be' and 'I shall not be' and 'I shall be formed' and 'I shall be formless' and 'I shall be percipient' and 'I shall be nonpercipient' and 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' Now in the case of the welltaught disciple of the ariyas while the five faculties persist in the same way nevertheless ignorance is abandoned and knowledge arisen in him
With the fading out of ignorance and the arising of knowledge it no more occurs to him 'I am' and 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient'  S

It is this conceit that takes on the appearance of pride
When any samana or braahmana with materiality as the means which is impermanent painful and subject to change sees thus 'I am superior' or 'I am equal' or 'I am inferior' what is that if not blindness to what actually is

Again when the Elder Khemaka was questioned by other elders he said
I do not see in these five categories affected by clinging any self or self's property Yet I am not an arahant with taints exhausted
On the contrary I still have the attitudes 'I am' with respect to these five categories affected by clinging although I do not say 'I am this' I do not say 'I am materiality' or 'I am feeling' or 'I am perception' or 'I am formations' or 'I am consciousness' nor do I say 'I am apart from consciousness' yet I still have the attitude 'I am' with respect to the five categories affected by clinging although I do not say 'I am this'
Although a disciple of the ariyas may have abandoned the five immediate fetters still his conceit 'I am' desire 'I am' underlying tendency 'I am' with respect to the five categories affected by clinging remains unabolished
Later he abides contemplating rise and fall thus 'Such is materiality such its origin such its disappearance' and by so doing his conceit 'I am' eventually comes to be abolished

On a certain occasion it had been stated by the Buddha how when a man knows and sees the five categories whatever their mode thus this is not mine this is not what I am this is not by self there come to be no more underlying tendencies to treat this body with its consciousness and all external signs in terms of I and Mine
Then in a certain bhikkhu's mind this thought arose So it seems materiality is not self nor are feeling perception formations and consciousness
Then what self will the action done by the notself touch'
He was rebuked for ignoring the Buddha's teaching of dependency
Again when the Buddha was asked by the naked ascetic Kassapa whether suffering was of one's own making or of another's or both or neither the Buddha replied Do not put it like that When asked whether there was no suffering or whether the Buddha neither knew nor saw it the Buddha replied that there was and that he both knew and saw it
He then said Kassapa if one asserts that 'He who makes feels being one existent from the beginning his suffering is of his own making' then one arrives at eternalism
But if one asserts that one makes another feels being one existent crushed out by feeling his suffering is of another's making' then one arrives at annihilationism
Instead of resorting to either extreme a Tathaagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle way 
Now what is called an acquisition of self  in other words the person or individuality  may be physical or mental or immaterial according to the plane of being in which rebirth has taken place
Also from birth to birth any one kind can succeed and so must exclude any other
That being so it cannot be successfully argued that only one of the three kinds is true and the others wrong one can only say that the term for each one does not apply to the other two
Just as with milk from a cow curd from milk butter from curd ghee from butter and fineextract of ghee from ghee the term for each applies only to that and not to any of the others
That is how there are these worldly usages by which a Tathaagata communicates without misapprehending 
Individual selfhood is what the physical body is called or it is simply the pentad of categories since it is actually only a descriptive device derived upon the pentad of categories
Here when the categories are not fully known there is naming of them and of the consciousness as 'self' that is the physical body or alternatively the five categories presence as a mere description in the case of what is called a 'being' though in the ultimate sense the 'being' is nonexistent 
A Tathaagata is indescribable in terms of being or of consciousness
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu's mind is liberated the gods when they seek him do not find the consciousness of one who is thusgone with anything as its support
Why is that
One thusgone is here and now no longer knowable I say
So saying so proclaiming I have been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly misrepresented by some samanas and brahmanas thus 'The samana Gotama is one who leads away he describes an existent creature's annihilation loss nonbeing' As I am not as I do not proclaim so I have been wrongly misrepresented

For these and other reasons the Buddha refused to answer the ten undecided matters ending with the four logical questions whether after death a Tathaagata is is not both is and is not neither is nor is not
These ten and some others as well not answered all contain some concealed assumption in fact which either of the answers yes or no would alike confirm
Self in any form particular or absolute one or many cannot be conceived apart from identification without which no meaningful statement can be made about it and any identification is always wrong
There are three principal types of argument used by the Buddha with which he exposes selftheories by means of the very basis on which they are built
These are affliction impermanence and nonexistence 
If self is identified with any of the five categories indiscriminately or with say the eye then since one cannot have any of these as one wishes in this way Let it be thus let it be not thus one suffers affliction by it and so cannot claim to have mastery over it consequently it cannot rightly be called self
If it is claimed that self is consciousness then it can be shown that because consciousness always arises dependent on impermanent conditions it too is impermanent
Again if self is identified with feeling it can be asked With pleasant or unpleasant or neutral feeling
Whichever is admitted then since the three kinds of feeling come and go self must come and go too
Consequently such a self is likewise untenable
If on the other hand it is claimed that self is not feeling and has nothing to do with it then it can be asked whether where there is no feeling at all one can say I am and no affirmative answer can be given
Again if it is claimed that self while not feeling is not without experience of feeling since it feels and is inseparable from the idea of feeling then it can be asked whether if feeling altogether ceased one could say I am this and no affirmative answer can be given
This last argument among others precludes predicating attaa of nibbaana which is called cessation of perception and feeling
The characteristic of notself unlike those of impermanence and suffering does not have its opposite applied to extinction attaa cannot be and never is applied to nibbaana
When asked how he taught his followers the Buddha replied
I discipline my hearers thus 'Bhikkhus materiality is impermanent and so are feeling perception formations and consciousness materiality is notself and so are feeling perception formations and consciousness
All formations are impermanent all things are notself'  M

The contemplation is described as follows
What is perception of notself
Here a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to a room that is void considers thus Eye is not self forms are not self ear sounds nose odors tongue flavours body tangibles mind ideas are not self
That is how he abides contemplating notself in these six inoneselfandexternal bases

Whatever is conditioned should be judged according to its actual nature of impermanence and contingency no matter whether even a pleasant abiding or a quiet abiding
Whatever is there to be included as materiality or feeling or perception or formations or consciousness such things he sees as impermanent as suffering as ailment as a cancer as a dart as a calamity as an affliction as alien as disintegrating as void as not self
And again Whatever is not yours abandon it
When you have abandoned it that will be long for your welfare and happiness
What is not yours
Materiality is not yours
When a bhikkhu abides much with his mind fortified by perception of notself in suffering his mind is rid of conceits that treat in terms of 'I' and 'mine' this body with its consciousness and all external signs
And when a bhikkhu sees six rewards it should be enough for him to establish perception of notself unlimitedly in all formations
What six
'I shall be aloof from the world of all I shall be no more impeded by treating in terms of I and likewise of mine I shall come to possess knowledge not shared and I shall see clearly causation and also causally arisen things'
When a man knows and sees the eye as not self his fetters come to be abolished and Perception of notself reaches the abolition of the conceit 'I am' which is extinction here and now
Lastly It is impossible that anyone with right view should see any thing as self
The perception of notself is the third of the Eighteen Principal Insights of which the Visuddhi magga says One who maintains in being the contemplation of notself abandons perception of self and contemplation of notself and contemplation of voidness are one in meaning and only the letter is different since one who maintains in being the contemplation of notself abandons misinterpreting On the development of the contemplation of notself based on rise and fall given in the Visuddhimagga see article Anicca
The Patisambhidaamagga connects this contemplation specially with the faculty of understanding and it is there called the third Gateway to Liberation When one gives attention to notself the understanding faculty is outstanding

Unsupported unmoving devoid of object  that indeed is the end of dukkha
And this dhamma is profound hard to see hard to awaken to peaceful excellent beyond logic subtle and to be experienced by the wise
 Translated from the Royal Chanting Book compiled by HH the th Sangharaja of Siam Sa Pussadevo and printed at Mahamakut Press Bangkok
Upon the Full Moon of the month of Visakha now more than two thousand five hundred years ago the religious wanderer known as Gotama formerly Prince Siddhattha and heir to the throne of the Sakiyan peoples by his full insight into the Truth called Dhamma which is this mind and body became the One Perfectly Enlightened by himself
His Enlightenment or Awakening called Sambodhi abolished in himself unknowing and craving destroyed greed aversion and delusion in his heart so that vision arose superknowledge arose wisdom arose discovery arose light arose  a total penetration into the mind and body its origin its cessation and the way to its cessation which was at the same time complete understanding of the world its origin its cessation and the way to its cessation
He penetrated to the Truth underlying all existence
In meditative concentration throughout one night but after years of striving from being a seeker He became the OnewhoKnows the OnewhoSees
When He came to explain His great discovery to others He did so in various ways suited to the understanding of those who listened and suited to help relieve the problems with which they were burdened
He knew with his Great Wisdom exactly what these were even if his listeners were not aware of them and out of His Great Compassion taught Dhamma for those who wished to lay down their burdens
The burdens which men indeed all beings carry round with them are no different now from the Buddhatime
For then as now men were burdened with unknowing and craving
They did not know of the Four Noble Truths nor of Dependent Arising and they craved for fire and poison and were then as now consumed by fears
Lord Buddha One attained to the Secure has said
The notunderstanding of Dependent Arising is the root of all sorrows experienced by all beings
It is also the most important of the formulations of Lord Buddha's Enlightenment
For a Buddhist it is therefore most necessary to see into the heart of this for oneself
This is done not be reading about it nor by becoming expert in scriptures nor by speculations upon one's own and others' concepts but by seeing Dependent Arising in one's own life and by coming to grips with it through calm and insight in one's own mind and body
Let us now see how this Teaching is concerned with our own lives
The search of every living being is to find happiness in whatever state human or nonhuman they find themselves
But what it is really important to know is this the factors which give rise to unhappiness so that they can be avoided and the factors from which arise happiness so that they can be cultivated
This is just another way of stating the Four Noble Truths
In the first half of this statement there is unhappiness or what is never satisfactory called in Pali language Dukkha
This Dukkha is the first Noble Truth which we experience all the time usually without noticing it which does not make the dukkha any less
First there is occasional dukkha birth old age disease and death for these events usually do not compose the whole of life
Then we have frequent dukkha being united with what one dislikes being separated from what one likes not getting what one wants and this is everyday experience
Finally as a summary of all kinds of dukkha there is continuous dukkha the five graspedat groups that is to say body feeling perceptions volitions and consciousness the components of a human being
Explanation of these in full would take too long here but all the readers are provided with these kinds of dukkha in themselves
They should look to see whether these facts of existence are delightful or not
This Dhamma should be thoroughly known in one's own person and life that is where the first Noble Truth may be discovered
Then the factors which give rise to unhappiness were mentioned
Here again one's person and life should be investigated
Now when living creature are killed intentionally by me when I take what is not given when I indulge in wrong conduct in sexual relations when I speak false words and when I take intoxicating drinks and drugs producing carelessness  now are these things factors for happiness or unhappiness
When I covet the belongings of others when I allow illwill to dwell in my heart and when I have as the tenants of my heart ignorance delusion and views which lead astray  is this for my welfare or destruction
There are many ways of describing these factors which make for unhappiness but all of them derive from unknowing and craving which are just two sides of the same thing
This is the Second Noble Truth of the Arising of Dukkha
When craving is at work when unknowing clouds one's understanding then one is sure to experience dukkha
Lord Buddha instructs us for our own benefit and for the happiness of others that this craving should be relinquished
Now happiness in the second half of the statement above can be of many kinds
Two kinds dependent upon conditions can be seen illustrated by the world while one kind unsupported by conditions should be realized in one's own heart
We are all looking for happiness so let us see what is needed for it
First there is materially produced happiness
This is born of possessions and jugglery with conditions of life out there Called amisasukha in Pali this happiness is most uncertain for all the factors supporting it are subject to instability and change
Moreover they are out in the world and not in one's own heart so that they call for expert jugglery to save one from dukkha
And failure and disappointment cannot be avoided if one goes after this sort of happiness
So this sort of happiness is shortlived and precarious
A great improvement on this is the happiness which comes from practicing Dhamma called nonmaterial happiness or niramisasukha
This kind of happiness is made sure whenever a person performs wholesome kamma such as doing the following ten things giving moral conduct minddevelopment reverence helpfulness dedicating meritorious acts to others rejoicing in the meritorious acts of others hearkening to Dhamma teaching Dhamma and setting upright one's views
People who practice this Dhamma purifying their hearts in this way are sure to reap happiness
But this happiness though more lasting than the first is not to be relied upon forever
As a fruit of it one may dwell among the gods for aeons or be born as a very fortunate man but even the gods have to pass away let alone man
And the fruits of kamma good or evil are impermanent so it cannot be relied upon to produce a permanent happiness
This can only be found by removing entirely the cause for dukkha when craving is uprooted no growth of dukkha can take place
On the contrary with purity compassion and wisdom one has reached the Supreme Happiness of Nibbana which is stable indestructible and never subject to changing conditions
This is the Third Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha by the removal of its cause
A good deal of hard work is needed to get to this which should be realized and that work must be done along the right lines hence the Fourth Noble Truth
This is called the Truth of the Path which should be cultivated It comprises elements of wisdom Right View and Right Attitude elements of moral conduct Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood and elements of meditation Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Collectedness
These will not be explained in detail here
It is certain that any one who practices Moral Conduct Collectedness and Wisdom in his life has the conditions which sustain happiness
From his practice he may have Dhammahappiness or the Supreme Happiness according to the degree he practices for the latter requires welldeveloped meditation both in calm and in insight
These Four Noble Truths  Dukkha Cause Cessation and Path  are the heart of the Dhamma and they are in the heart of every man who cares to see them
From their seeing and understanding comes happiness but by trying to escape them only more misery is born
These Truths are illustrated by the formula of Dependent Arising which is found elaborated in various ways
The simplest form is
But Dependent Arising can be given in much more detailed ways than this
The important principle to understand is that whatever is experienced by us all that arises due to many conditions
An aspect which grows in size from birth throughout youth which develops certain characteristics in maturity and as old age creeps on becomes infirm in various ways and finally dies
The processes which govern this growth and decline are of great complexity and interdependence
The body to keep going at all needs clothes food shelter and medicines at least
But once the internal chemistry starts the process leading to old age and death none of the exterior supporting conditions can do more than retard the process for a little while
The body as a whole does not arise from nocause nor is it derived from one cause
If examined nothing which we experience arises from only one or no cause at all on the contrary our experiences all arises dependently
Sight is actually dependent on the eye as base the object to be seen and the operation of eyeconsciousness
Similarly there is ear sound earconsciousness nose smell noseconsciousness tongue taste tongueconsciousness body touch bodyconsciousness and mind thoughts mindconsciousness
All of our experience falls within these eighteen elements and there is nothing which we know outside them
It is also important to understand that much of what one experiences arising dependently is the fruit of one's own actions
The happiness one feels and the dukkha one feels although sometimes brought about by events in the physical world is very often brought about by one's own past intentional actions or kamma
And in the present time with each deliberate action one performs more kammas which will come to fruit as experience in the future
So if one wants to experience the fruits of happiness the seeds of happiness must be planted now
They may fruit immediately in this life or in a future existence
We make ourselves we are the creators of ourselves no one else has a hand in this creation
And the Lord of Creation is no other than Ignorance or Unknowing
He is the Creator of this Wheel of Samsara of continued and infinitely varied forms of dukkha
And this Lord resides in the hearts of all men who are called ordinarymen We shall return to this in more detail later
Dependent Arising is explained many times and in many different connections in the Discourses of Lord Buddha but He has not compared it to a wheel
This simile is found in the Visuddhimagga and in the other commentarial literature
Although Theravada tradition has many references to this simile it does not seem to have been depicted at all
But in Northern India and especially in Kashmir the Sarvastivada school was strongly established and besides producing a vast literature upon Discipline and the Further Dhamma they produced also a way of depicting a great many important Buddhist teachings by this picture of the Wheel which is the subject of the present essay
In Pali it is the bhavacakka or Samsaracakka which is variously rendered in English as the Wheel of Life the Wheel of Becoming or the Wheel of Rebirth
In their collections of stories about Lord Buddha and his disciples there is one which opens with the story of this wheel
Readers will observe that the story refers to Lord Buddha's lifetime and says that He has authorized the painting of this picture as well as laying down its contents
It is certain that in the Buddhatime painting was well known while the other facts given in this short introductory story are quite in accord with the spirit of the Pali Discourses
Even the collection of stories in which this account is contained was compiled according to some scholars before the Christian era
So if one does not believe that this painting was ordained by Lord Buddha still it has an age of two thousand years a venerable tradition indeed
Of all teachingaids this expression of Buddhist skillfulmeans must surely be the oldest
Now let us turn to the story
Lord Buddha was staying at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feedingplace
Now it was the practice of Venerable Mahamoggallana to frequent the hells for a certain time then the animalkingdom also to visit the ghosts the gods and men
Having seen all the sufferings to be found in the hells which beings there experience as they arise and pass away such as maiming dismembering and so forth having witnessed how animals kill and devour others how ghosts are tormented by hunger and thirst how the gods lose fall are spoiled and come to their ruin and how men crave and come to naught but thwarted desires  having seen all this he returned to Jambudipa and reported this to the four assemblies
Whatever had a fellowbhikkhu or a bhikkhupupil leading the holy life with dissatisfaction he would take him to Venerable Mahamoggallana 'The Venerable Mahamoggallana will exhort and teach him well'
And the Venerable Mahamoggallana would exhort and teach him well
Such would again lead the holy life with keen interest even distinguishing themselves with the higher attainments since they had been taught and exhorted so well by the Venerable Mahamoggallana
At that time the Venerable Mahamoggallana was surrounded by the four assemblies consisting of bhikkhus bhikkhunis pious laymen and women
Now the illustrious Enlightened Ones who Know ask questions
Thus Lord Buddha asked the Venerable Ananda
Venerable Ananda then related Venerable Mahamoggallana's experiences and said that he instructed discontented bhikkhus with success
 'The Elder Moggallana or a bhikkhu like him cannot be at many places
Therefore in the gateways a wheel having five sections should be made'
Thus the Lord laid down that a wheel with five sections should be made 'But the bhikkhus do not know what sort of wheel should be made'
The Lord explained 'The five bourns should be represented  the hellish bourn that of the animal kingdom of ghosts of men and the bourn of the gods
In the lower portion the hells are to be shown together with the animalkingdom and the realm of the ghosts while in the upper portion gods and men should be represented
The four continents should also be depicted namely Pubbavideha Aparagoyana Uttarakuru and Jambudipa
In the middle greed aversion and delusion must be shown a dove symbolizing greed a snake symbolizing aversion and a hog delusion
Furthermore the Buddhas are to be painted halos pointing out Nibbana
Ordinary beings should be shown as by the contrivance of a waterwheel they sink and rise up again
The space around the rim should be filled with the twelve links of Dependent Arising in the forward and reversed order
must show clearly that everything all the time is swallowed by impermanence and the following two verses should be added as an inscription
Thus at the instance of the bhikkhus it was laid down by the Lord that the Wheel of Wanderingon with five sections should be made in the gateways
Now brahmans and householders would come and ask 'Reverend Sir what is this painting about'
Bhikkhus would reply 'We also do not know'
Thereupon the Lord advised 'A bhikkhu should be appointed visitors in the gateway and to show them'
Bhikkhus were appointed without due consideration foolish erring confused persons without merit
'They themselves do not know so how will they explain to visiting brahmans and householders'
The Lord said 'A competent bhikkhu should be appointed' Tibetan legend says that Lord Buddha outlined the Wheel with grains of rice while walking with bhikkhus in a rice field
However this may be in India at least in all the Sarvastivada monasteries this painting will have adorned the gateways arousing deep emotions in the hearts of those who knew its meaning and curiosity in others
It is a measure of how great was the destruction of the Buddhist religion in India that not a single example survives anywhere since no gateways to temples are known to have survived
A solitary painting in Ajanta cave number seventeen may perhaps be some form of this wheel
In the translation above the pictures for representing the twelve links of Dependent Arising were not given and it is said that these were supplied from the scriptures by Nagarjuna a great Buddhist Teacher
From India the pattern of this wheel was taken to Samye the first Tibetan monastery by Bande Yeshe and there it was the Sarvastivada lineage of ordination which was established
The tradition of painting this wheel thus passed to Tibet where due to climatic conditions it was painted in the vestibule of the temple there to strike the eyes of all who entered
Tibetan tradition speaks of two kinds of Wheel the oldstyle and the newstyle
The oldstyle is based upon the text translated above while the newstyle introduces new features
The great reformer Je Tsongkhapa founder of the Gelugpa gave authority for the division of the Wheel into six instead of five and for drawing the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara in the guise of a Buddha in each of the five nonhuman realms
Both these features may be seen upon the drawing of the Tibetanstyle Wheel
The sixth realm is that of the titans who war against the gods of the sensualsphere heavens
These troublesome and demonic characters are included in a separate part of the world of the gods in my drawing
The introduction of a Buddhafigure into each realm illustrates the universal quality of a Buddha's great compassion for Avalokitesvara it the embodiment of enlightened compassion
The writer has preferred to retain the oldstyle representation according to the text as it agrees perfectly with Theravada teachings
The terrors and violence of samsara which are with us all the time may be seen plainly in the ravishment of Tibet by the Chinese invaders
Tibetan artists have kept this tradition alive to the present day and still paint under difficulties as refugees in India
But this ancient way of presenting Dhamma deserves to be more widely known and appreciated
Buddhist shrines could well be equipped with representations of it in the present day to remind devotees of the nature of this whirling wheel of birth and death
We now turn to the pictures of the Bhavacakka accompanying this book
One is from a Tibetan original after Waddell
The second is a modern version executed by the author in which the scenes and figures have been given a contemporary coloring
The hub of this painting is the central point for us who live in the realm of samsara so it is the best point to start a description of the symbolism
In this center circle a cock a snake and a hog wheel around each having in its mouth the tail of the animal in front
These three representing Greed Aversion and Delusion which are the three roots of all evil are depicted in the center because they are the root causes for experience in the wandering on
When they are present in our hearts then we live afflicted in the transitory world of birth and death but when they are not there having been destroyed by wisdom or pañña developed in Dhammapractice then we find rest the unshakable peace of Nibbana
It is notable that Tibetan paintings show these creatures against a blue ground showing that even these afflictions of mind although powerful have no real substance and are void as are all the other elements of our experience
The cock of fiery yellowred represents greed
This greed includes every desire for all kinds of I wish I want I must have I will have and extends from the violent passion for gross physical form through attachments to views and ideas all the way to the subtle clinging to spiritual pleasures experienced by meditators
The color of the cock a fiery red is symbolic of the fact that the passions burn those who indulge in them
Passions and desires are hot and restless just like tongues of flame and never allow the heart to experience the cool peace of nonattachment
The cock is chosen as a symbol of greed because as an animal it is observed to be full of lust and vanity
In the cock's beak there is the tail of a green snake indicating that people who are not able to satisfy their oceanlike greeds and lusts tend to become angry
Aversion of any form springs up when we do not get what we want or when we get what we do not want
This also can be very subtle from aversion to mental states ranging through hostile thoughts against other beings to expressions of inward resentment finding their way out in untruthful malicious or angry words or as physical violence
The greenness of the snake indicates the coldness the lack of sympathy with others while the snake itself is an animal killing other beings by poison and strangulation which is exactly what aversion does to those who let it grow in their hearts
Our lives can be corrupted by this venomous beast unless we take very good care to remove it
At the bottom of the picture there is a heavy hog the tail of which is chewed by aversion's snake while in turn it champs upon the tail feathers of greed's cock
This heavy hog is black in color and represents delusion
This black hog like its brethren everywhere likes to sleep for long to root for food in filth and generally to take no care at all over cleanliness
It is a good symbol for delusion which prevents one from understanding what is advantageous and what is deleterious to oneself
Its heaviness is that sluggishness of mind and body which it induces in people called variously stupidity dullness boredom but worry and distraction with skeptical doubt also arise from this delusionroot
One who is overwhelmed by delusion does not know why he should restrain himself from evil for he can see neither his own benefit with wisdom nor the benefit of others by compassion  all is blanketed by delusion
He does not know or does not believe that kamma have results according to kind
Or he has wrong views which lead him astray from the highway of Dhamma
When people do not get what they want either using greed or aversion then they turn dull and the pain of their desire is dulled by delusion
From this black hog are born the fiery cock and the cold green snake
These three beasts none more dangerous anywhere are shown each biting the tail of the other meaning that really they are inseparable so that one cannot have say greed without the other monsters lurking in its train
Even characters which are rooted predominantly in one of these three have the other two present while most people called normal have a sort of unhealthy balance of these three in their hearts ever ready to influence their actions when a suitable situation occurs
These three beasts revolve endlessly in the heart of the ordinaryman and ensure that he experiences plenty of dukkha
One should know for oneself whether these beasts control one's own heart or not
Out from the innermost circle the first ring is divided into two one half with a white background and the other having a black background
In the former four people are seen ascending the bhikkhu holding a Dhammalight goes on in front being followed by a whiterobed nun after which come a man and a woman in present day dress
The four of them represent the Buddhist Community made up of monks nuns laymen and laywomen
They are representative of anyone practicing the path of good conduct in mind speech and body
They represent as well two classes of persons going from dark to light and going from light to light In the first case they are born in poor circumstances and have few opportunities due to past evil kamma but in spite of this they make every effort to practice Dhamma for their own good and others' happiness
Thus they go towards the light for the fruit of their present kamma will be pleasant and enjoyable
The latter class going from light to light are those people who have attained many benefits with plentiful opportunities in their present life due to having done much good kamma in the past
In the present they continue with their upward course devoting themselves to further practice of Dhamma in their lives
What is this Dhammapractice
There are two lists both of ten factors which could be explained here but the space required would be too great for more than a summary
The first list is called the ten Skilled Kammapaths three of which pertain to bodily action four to speech and three to mental action
Paths here means ways of action and skillful means neither for the deterioration of one's own mind nor for the harm of others The bodily actions which one refrains from are destroying living creatures taking what is not given and wrong conduct in sexual desires
In speech the four actions which should be avoided are false speech slanderous speech harsh speech and foolish chatter
The three actions of mind which should be avoided are covetousness illwill and wrong views
Anyone who restrains himself from these ten practices a skillful path a white path which accords with the first steps of training in Dhamma
The other ten factors are called the Ten Ways of making Puñña
They have a different range from the first list of ten being divided into three basic ways and seven secondary ones
The basic factors are giving moral conduct and mind development while the remaining seven are counted as aspects of these three reverence helpfulness dedicating one's puñña to others rejoicing in other's puñña listening to Dhamma teaching Dhamma and straightening out one's views
These actions lead to uprightness skillful conduct and to the growth in Dhamma of oneself as well as the benefit of others
Those who tread upon this white path going toward the light are able to be born in two bourns either as men or as shiningones  the gods in the three sorts of heavens of sensuality subtle form and formlessness
A life of good practice is thus usually followed by a life in one of these two bourns called sugati or the good bourns
But Lord Buddha does not declare that everyone who has led such a life is necessarily born there
This depends not only upon the intensity of their Dhammapractice but also upon the vision which arises at the time of death
Through negligence at the last moment one can slip into the three evil bourns difficult to get out of
The round of Samsara is very dangerous even for those who lead almost blameless lives
More of this below
To be born in the two good bourns is the fruiting of puñña or skillful kamma and the more purified one's heart the higher and more pleasant will be one's environment
In the dark half of the ring naked beings are tumbling downwards in disorder
Their nakedness symbolizes lack of shame in doing evil and their disorder shows the characteristic of evil to cause disintegration and confusion
Downwards means that they are falling by the commission of subhuman actions to subhuman states of existence
In some Tibetan versions they are chained together and pulled downwards by a female demon who squats at the bottom
This demoness is craving of tanha
This craving is of course not outside those who follow the path of evil but in their own hearts
On this path there are two sorts of persons those going from light to dark and those going from dark to dark The former have good opportunities in this life but do not make use of them or else use them for evil ends without laying up any further store
Instead they prefer from delusion to store up evil now for fear and distress in future
Those who go from dark to dark do not have even the advantages of the former group for they are born in conditions of deprivation due to past evil kamma and then driven on by the fruit of suffering received by them they commit more evil
The Ten Unskillful Kammapaths are the ways along which they walk destroying living creatures taking what is not given wrong conduct in sexual desires false speech slanderous speech harsh speech foolish chatter covetousness illwill and wrongviews
They do not delight in making puñña but are by nature mean immoral undeveloped in mind proud selfish grasp at possessions envious never listen to Dhamma and certainly never teach it while their hearts are ridden with confused and contradictory views and ideas
For their pains having pursued evil these beings upon their death already having destroyed humanness in themselves fall down to the three lower states which are called the Evil Bourns
These are in order of deterioration and increase of suffering the hungry ghosts the animals and the hellwraiths
Truly a case of
as the Thai proverb says
These two halfcircles are also an illustration of the refrain which closes every one of the Avadana stories Thus bhikkhus completely black kamma bears completely evil effects completely white kamma bears completely good effects and composite kamma bears composite effects
Therefore bhikkhus abstain from doing completely black kamma and composite kamma strive to do kamma completely white
Thus O bhikkhus must you train yourselves
The two good bourns and the three evil bourns contain the whole range of possibilities for rebirth
In most Tibetan illustrations including the one shown here a sixth bourn is given by dividing the devas and asuras
In this section the five or six bourns will be described together with the ways to get to them
Birth in any bourn is a fruit or effect and here we shall see the causes
A person who has done evil persistently or even one heavy crime is likely to see at the time of death a vision either relating to his past evil actions or else to the bourn which his past evil actions or kamma have prepared for him
When his physical body is no longer a suitable basis to support life his mind creates a body ghostly and subtle in substance which then and there begins to experience one of the evil bourns
But in case his kamma drives him to be born as animals there is the vision of animals copulating and he is dragged into the womb or egg of those animals
Kamma which leads to birth as an animal is a strong interest in the things which mankind shares with the animals that is eating drinking and sex
If a man strengthens the animal in himself to become an animalman he can expect only to be born as an animal
Human beings interested in only these things strengthening the Evil Root of Delusion in their minds have already the minds of animals
There is no essential manness which can prevent such a catastrophe for no unchanging human soul exists
If a man wishes to guard himself against this he must protect the conditions for humanity which are the Five Precepts
Sinking below the level of conduct of these precepts is to sink into the subhuman levels
Once rebirth as an animal has taken place it is by no means easy to gain human birth again as Venerable Nagarjuna has written
Kamma dragging one to the hells which are the most fearful and miserable states are actions involving hatred killing torture and violence generally
People lead themselves to experience hell because they have made the Evil Root of Aversion very strong within themselves
On the other hand those who have strengthened the Evil Root of Greed while they were men having been mean possessive and selfish are liable to arise as spirits with strong cravings forever unsatisfied for which reason they are known as hungry ghosts
However it does sometimes happen that one who has led an evil life turns sincerely to religion upon his deathbed
When this occurs with his mind centered upon Dhamma and purified by faith a person like this may be reborn among men even arise among the devas
That evil kamma which has been done though it may have no chance to fructify in those good bourns remains a potential for creating very unpleasant results whenever conditions are favorable to its fruition
The reverse of this may happen as when good and noble men become distracted at death and so remember some small evil done or see a vision of evil done in some past life the result of which is the arising of unwholesome consciousness leading to the evil bourns
It is more usual for one who has followed the path of white deeds to be born as a man or among the gods
The basis for the former is the practice of the Five Precepts which constitute the level of humanness
They are in brief refraining from destroying living creatures refraining from taking what is not given refraining from wrong conduct in sexual desires refraining from false speech and refraining from distilled and fermented intoxicants which cause carelessness
Those who refrain from such things having really lived as men having strengthened the base of humanness in their own hearts are born again as men wellendowed with the riches of fine qualities of varied opportunities as well as with a wealth of worldly goods
The path to the heavens is cultivated by those who make special efforts to live with purity and selfrestraint exercising lovingkindness toward all beings and so purifying their minds to some extent through meditation
At the time of death having fulfilled the ten Skillful Kamma paths and the ten Ways of Making Puñña the heart will be joyful and peaceful to varying degrees which will result in the experience of arising in one of the many heavenly levels according to the degree of purity and concentration which has been attained
All these possibilities are within the scope of the mind the quality of which can be changed in this way or that by kamma good or bad
From the type of mind which performs the duty of relinkingconsciousness at birth is determined the kind of senseorgans possessed by a being and hence the kind of world experienced by him
Perception varies  as the famous Buddhist verse puts it
From such verses we catch a glimpse of the mysterious depths of the mind and of the truth of the Exalted Buddha's words which open the Dhammapada
To come now to a description of the picture
In the world of the gods or shiningones the gilded palaces and glittering jewel trees of the gods of sensuality are shown in the lower part of the drawing
The Tibetan picture shows more details of these superlatively beautiful worlds in which there is also a kind of subtle sexual relationship
Being based upon sensuality as this world of men is these devas must also pay the price for this  which is conflict
This conflict is an everrecurring battle with the asuras the antigods or titans who have in past times fallen through their quarrelsome nature from the heavens and who now enviously try to invade the celestial realms
In my picture they share a segment of the world of gods and they are equipped with ancient and modern weapons and are in the dress of soldiers
But they do not only battle with the gods but also among themselves and so a bit of insubordination is depicted as well
The Tibetan picture gives them a world to themselves among the frontiers of which they are fleeing from the victorious heavenly hosts led upon a very large elephant by Sakka the lord of the sensualrealm gods
These titans only understand force so the Buddha shown in their world bears a sword with which to duly impress them after which they may be able to hear a little Dhamma
By contrast the Buddha appearing among the gods bears a lute in order to lure them into listening to Dhamma sung in exquisite strains for it was believed that they would not be interested in mere spoken words
Above the battling of the sensualrealm gods dwell the Brahmas of subtle form and of formlessness experiencing meditative happiness serene joy or sublime equanimity
The Tibetan picture also shows a magnificent Brahma world palace in the upper lefthand corner
About all this heavenly splendor Ven
Nagarjuna warns us
He goes on to speak of the devas as those
The Brahmas of formlessness dwelling for unthinkable ages in the realms of infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness and neitherperceptionnornonperception being quite without any form naturally cannot be shown but even their states are not eternal but come to an end
Among men the progress of the humanbeing is shown birth and death but with this basis of dukkha men can also understand Dhamma
Lord Buddha foremost among men sits highest in the human world teaching Dhamma in a forest grove to his first five disciples
In the original version which my picture follows He is shown only in the human world thus emphasizing the value of human birth during which it is possible to gain insight into Dhamma
The religious aspirations of man are represented by a Hindu temple a Christian church and Muslim mosque while a war and a bar show his tendencies towards aversion and greed
The Tibetan picture shows several mundane activities such as plowing the fields while people climb towards the top of the picture where there is a temple in which they can listen to Dhamma
In the center stands a Buddha carrying the almsbowl and staff showing to men the way of peacefulness leading to Sublime Peace of Nibbana
This is shown in my picture by the sure Dhammapath which issues from the mouth of the Exalted Buddha
Upon this way a bhikkhu lends a hand to help householders out of the realms of samsara leading them forward upon the Eightfold Path
Venerable Nagarjuna has this to say
Hungry ghosts or peta crave for food and drink but find that it turns to fire or foul things when they are able to get it
I have shown a huge moon and a tiny sun as the verse says
Then there is a skygoing peta being torn to shreds by birds as seen by Venerable Moggallana one resting upon rocks under a leafless tree which is the simile used by the Exalted Buddha in the suttas to symbolize the sole comforts of this realm and two ghosts sunk in the water up to their lower lips their gaping mouths just a little too high to get any of it
The state of Tantalus was obviously birth among the hungry ghosts
The ghosts all have bloated bellies extremely slender necks and needlemouths Their sufferings are illustrated further in the Tibetan
They have to bear intense cravings for food and drink and then more sufferings when they manage to get a little of it for it turns to swords and knives in their bellies
The Buddha in this abundantly painful realm carries celestial food to allay the ghosts' cravings
In the words of Ven
Nagarjuna
They ghostly kamma made
 LK

The animals in the Tibetan illustration are being encouraged in the Dhamma by a Buddha holding a book illustrating the point that animals have little ability to understand and are in need of wisdom
My picture illustrates the sufferings of animallife as described by Ven
Nagarjuna
In the animalworld where feelings experienced are painful sharp and severe one can see the dukkha the hunter and the hunted in my illustration
The birds of the air are being shot while a vulture is feeding on its prey
A wasp struggling in the net of a spider represents the horrors of life among the insects while among the larger animals a buffalo is being forced to work a deer is being shot and a lion feeds upon his prey
The fish fare no better and are shown being devoured by larger fish or else hooked and netted by men
Slithering down the division of this world from the hells there is a gecko
The Tibetan picture illustrates the diversity of animal life and shows under the waters the palace of the serpentspirits or naga half snake and half man
The hells which are not permanent states of course have some new horrors of our day for railway lines run into a concentration camp from the chimneys of which belches sinister black smoke while a uniformed member of some secret police force compels a suppliant hellwraith to swallow molten metal
Towards the viewer flows the river of caustic soda called Vaitarani which burns the flesh off the bones of those swirling along in it mingled with a stream of blood from the clashing mountains
Whatever torments hellwraiths experience though their bodies are mangled crushed and ripped apart yet they survive still for vast ages of time experiencing feelings which are exclusively painful sharp and severe unrelenting and uninterrupted
In the foreground is the hell of filth where hellwraiths who as men had corrupted the innocent are devoured by gigantic maggots while floundering in a stinking ooze
To the left are the trees of the swordblade forest which have to be climbed so that hell wraiths are pierced through and through
This particular aspect of hell is said to be the punishment which adulterers bring on themselves
Various murderers and torturers are impaled upon stakes while a steelbeaked bird rips out the entrails of former cockfighters
Venerable Nagarjuna has some more verses upon these lower and mostmiserable states
Jetsun Milarepa the great sage and poet of Tibet who had seen the heavens and hells and other states once sung this verse
Those who now violate the peoples of Tibet and their Dhamma might well take note
This brief survey of the Five Bourns may be concluded with a verse of exhortation from The Letter of Kindheartedness
Our description has now come to the Rim or felly of the Wheel which depicts the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising
It is these links which chain the entire universe of beings to rebecoming and to suffering
It is a wellestablished tradition to explain this chain as referring to three lives
While the present is the only time which is real it has been moulded in the past
It is in the present that we produce kamma of mind speech and body to bear fruit in the future
In the twelve nidanas or links around this wheel are set out the whole pattern of life and in it all questions relating to existence are answered
The teaching of Dependent Arising central in our DhammaVinaya is not however for speculation but should be investigated and seen in one's own and others' lives and finally it may be perceived in one's own heart where all the Truths of Dhamma become clear after practice
But people who do not practice Dhamma are called upholders of the world they let this wheel whirl them round from unknowing to oldage and death
The Exalted Buddha urged us not to be world upholders but through Dhammapractice to relinquish greed aversion and delusion so that by the cessation of unknowing there comes to be a cessation of birth oldage and death
Now let us have a look at these twelve links in brief
This Pali word avijja is a negative term meaning not knowing completely but it does not mean knowing nothing at all This kind of unknowing is very special and not concerned with ordinary ways or subjects of knowledge for here what one does not know are the Four Noble Truths one does not see them clearly in one's own heart and one's own life
In past lives we did not care to see dukkha so we could not destroy the cause of dukkha or craving which has impelled us to seek more and more lives more and more pleasures
The cessation of dukkha which perhaps could have been seen by us in past lives was not realized so we come to the present existence inevitably burdened with dukkha
And in the past we can hardly assume that we set our feet upon the practicepath leading to the cessation of dukkha and we did not even discover streamentry
We are now paying for our own negligence in the past
And this unknowing is not some kind of first cause in the past for it dwells in our hearts now
But due to this unknowing as we shall see we have set in motion this wheel bringing round old age and death and all other sorts of dukkha
Those past selves in previous lives who are in the stream of my individual continuity did not check their craving and so could not cut at the root of unknowing
On the contrary they made kamma some of the fruits of which in this present life I as their causal resultant am receiving
The picture helps us to understand this a blind old woman with a stick picks her way through a petrified forest strewn with bones
It is said that the original picture here should be an old blind shecamel led by a driver the beast being one accustomed to long and weary journeys across inhospitable country while its driver could be craving
Whichever simile is used the beginninglessness and the darkness of unknowing are well suggested
We are the blind ones who have staggered from the past into the present  to what sort of future
Depending on the existence of unknowing in the heart there was volitional action kamma or abhisankhara made in those past lives
Intentional actions have the latent power within them to bear fruit in the future  either in a later part of the life in which they were performed in the following life or in some more distant life but their potency is not lost with even the passing of aeons and whenever the necessary conditions obtain that past kamma may bear fruit
Now in past lives we have made kamma and due to our ignorance of the Four Noble Truths we have been worldupholders and so making good and evil kamma we have ensured the continued experience of this world
Beings like this obstructed by unknowing in their hearts have been compared to a potter making pots he makes successful and beautiful pottery and he is sometimes careless and his pots crack and break up from various flaws
And he gets his clay fairly well smeared over himself just as purity of heart is obscured by the mud of kamma
The simile of the potter is particularly apt because the word Sankhara means forming shaping and compounding and therefore it has often been rendered in English as Formations
Depending on the existence of these volitions produced in past lives there arises the consciousness called relinking which becomes the basis of this present life
This relinking consciousness may be of different qualities according to the kamma upon which it depends
In the case of all those who read this the consciousness leaping into a new birth at the time of conception was a human relinking consciousness arising as a result of having practiced at least the Five Precepts the basis of humanness in past lives
One should note that this relinking consciousness is a resultant not something which can be controlled by will
If one has not made kamma suitable for becoming a human being one cannot will when the time of death comes round Now I shall become a man again The time for intentional action was when one had the opportunity to practice Dhamma
Although our relinkingconsciousness in this birth is now behind us it is now that we can practice Dhamma and make more sure of a favorable relinking consciousness in future  that is if we wish to go on living in Samsara
This relinkingconsciousness is the third constituent necessary for conception for even though it is the mother's period and sperm is deposited in the womb if there is no being desiring to take rebirth at that place and time there will be no fertilization of the ovum
Appropriately the picture shows a monkey the consciousness leaping from one tree the old life to another tree
The old tree has died while the one towards which it jumps is laden with fruits  they may be the fruits of good or evil
The Tibetan picture shows a monkey devouring fruit experiencing the fruits of deeds done in the past
Dependent upon relinkingconsciousness there is the arising of mindbody
This is not a very accurate translation but gives the general meaning
There is more included in rupa that is usually thought of as body while mind is a compound of feeling perception volition and consciousness
This mind and body is two interactive continuities in which there is nothing stable
Although in conventional speech we talk of my mind and my body implying that there is some sort of owner lurking in the background the wise understand that laws govern the workings of both mental states and physical changes and mind cannot be ordered to be free of defilements nor body told that it must not grow old become sick and die
But it is in the mind that a change can be wrought instead of drifting through life at the mercy of the inherent instability of mind and body
So in the illustration mind is doing the work of punting the boat of psychophysical states on the river of cravings while body is the passive passenger
The Tibetan picture shows a coracle being rowed over swirling waters with three other passengers who doubtless represent the other groups or aggregates
With the coming into existence of mindbody there is the arising of the six sensespheres
A house with six windows is the usual symbol for this link window
These six senses are eye ear nose tongue touch and mind and these are the bases for the reception of the various sorts of information which each can gather in the presence of the correct conditions
This information falls under six headings corresponding to the six spheres sights sounds smells tastes tangibles and thoughts
Beyond these six spheres of sense and their corresponding six objective spheres we know nothing
All our experience is limited by the senses and their objects with the mind counted as the sixth
The five outer senses collect data only in the present but mind the sixth where this information is collected and processed ranges through the three times adding memories from the past and hopes and fears for the future as well as thoughts of various kinds relating to the present
It may also add information about the spheres of existence which are beyond the range of the five outer senses such as the various heavens the ghosts and the hellstates
A mind developed through collectedness is able to perceive these worlds and their inhabitants
The six sensespheres existing there is contact
This means the contact between the six senses and the respective objects
For instance when the necessary conditions are all fulfilled there being an eye a sightobject light and the eye being functional and the person awake and turned toward the object there is likely to be eyecontact the striking of the object upon the sensitive eyebase
The same is true for each of the senses and their type of contact
The traditional symbol for this link shows a man and a woman embracing
Where contact arises feeling exists
When there have been various sorts of contact through the six senses feelings arise which are the emotional response to those contacts
Feelings are of three sorts pleasant painful and neither pleasant nor painful
The first are welcome and are the basis for happiness the second are unwelcome and are the basis for dukkha while the third are the neutral sort of feelings which we experience so often but hardly notice
But all feelings are unstable and liable to change for no mental state can continue in equilibrium
Even moments of the highest happiness whatever we consider this is pass away and give place to different ones
So even happiness which is impermanent based on pleasant feelings is really dukkha for how can the true unchanging happiness be found in the unstable
Thus the picture shows a man with his eyes pierced by arrows a strong enough illustration of this
When feelings arise cravings are produced
Up to this point the succession of events has been determined by past kamma
Craving however leads to the making of new kamma in the present and it is possible now and only now to practice Dhamma
What is needed here is mindfulness for without it no Dhamma at all can be practiced while one will be swept away by the force of past habits and let craving and unknowing increase themselves within one's heart
When one does have mindfulness one may and can know this is pleasant feeling this is unpleasant feeling this is neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling  and such contemplation of feelings leads one to understand and beware of greed aversion and delusion which are respectively associated with the three feelings
With this knowledge one can break out of the Wheel of Birth and Death
But without this Dhammapractice it is certain that feelings will lead on to more cravings and whirl one around this wheel full of dukkha
As Venerable Nagarjuna has said
In Sanskrit the word trisna means thirst and by extension implies thirst for experience For this reason craving is shown as a toper guzzling intoxicants and in my picture I have added three bottles  craving for sensual sphere existence and the craving for the higher heavens of the Brahmaworlds which are either of subtle form or formless
Where the kamma of further craving is produced there arises Grasping
This is an intensification and diversification of craving which is directed to four ends sensual pleasures views which lead astray from Dhamma external religious rites and vows and attachment to the view of soul or self as being permanent
When these become strong in people they cannot even become interested in Dhamma for their efforts are directed away from Dhamma and towards dukkha
The common reaction is to redouble efforts to find peace and happiness among the objects which are grasped at
Hence both pictures show a man reaching up to pick more fruit although his basket is full already
Where this grasping is found there Becoming is to be seen
With hearts boiling with craving and grasping people ensure for themselves more and more of various sorts of life and pile up the fuel upon the fire of dukkha
The ordinary person not knowing about dukkha wants to stoke up the blaze but the Buddhist way of doing things is to let the fires go out for want of fuel by stopping the process of craving and grasping and thus cutting off Unknowing at its root
If we want to stay in samsara we must be diligent and see that our becoming which is happening all the time shaped by our kamma is becoming in the right direction
This means becoming in the direction of purity and following the white path of Dhammapractice
This will contribute to whatever we become or do not become at the end of this life when the pathways to the various realms stand open and we become according to our practice and to our deathconsciousness
Appropriately Becoming is illustrated by a pregnant woman
In the presence of Becoming there is arising in a new birth
Birth as one might expect is shown as a mother in the process of childbirth a painful business and a reminder of how dukkha cannot be avoided in any life
Whatever the future life is to be if we are not able to bring the wheel to a stop in this life certainly that future will arise conditioned by the kamma made in this life
But it is no use thinking that since there are going to be future births one may as well put off Dhamma practice until then  for it is not sure what those future births will be like
And when they come around they are just the present moment as well
So no use waiting
Venerable Nagarjuna shows that it is better to extricate oneself
Naturally where there is Birth is also Oldage and Death
In future one is assured given enough of Unknowing and Craving of lives without end but also of deaths with end
The one appeals to greed but the other arouses aversion
One without the other is impossible
But this is the path of heedlessness
The Dhammapath leads directly to Deathlessness the going beyond birth and death beyond all dukkha
The Tibetan picture shows an old man carrying off a bundledup corpse upon his back taking it away to some charnel ground
My picture has an old man gazing at a coffin enclosing a corpse
We are well exhorted by the words of Acarya Nagarjuna
This is a very brief outline of the workings of this wheel which we cling to for our own harm and the hurt of others
We are the makers of this wheel and the turners of this wheel but if we wish it and work for it we are the ones who can stop this wheel
Both pictures show the Wheel as being in the grip of a fearful monster
In my drawing the monster's name is engraved upon his crown so that people should not think of him as a common demon
He is no such thing for his name is Impermanence and his crown shows his authority over all worlds whatever
He devours them and they are all heavens and hells together securely held in the grasp of his taloned hands
The crown upon his head is adorned with five skulls representing the impermanence of the five groups or aggregates comprising the person
His eyes ears nose and mouth have flames about them an illustration of the Exalted One's Third Discourse in which He says The eye is afire and so on
Above the monster's two eyes there is a third one meaning that while for the fool impermanence is his enemy for the wise man it helps him to Enlightenment
Although the monster has adorned himself with earrings and the like he fails to look attractive  in the same way this world puts on an outer show of beauty puts its beauty fades when examined more carefully
Below the painting of the wheel some Tibetan examples show parts of a tigerskin adorning the monster a symbol of fearfulness
In my drawing I show the monster's tail which has no beginning looping back and forth
In the same way we have been born lived and then died countless times in the whirl of samsara
Sometimes our deeds were mostly good and sometimes mostly bad and we have reaped the fruit of it all
The whole wheel glows with heat and is surrounded by flames burning with the fires of greed aversion and delusion as the Exalted One has repeated many times in His Discourses
In the upper right corner of both pictures stands the Exalted Buddha shown crossed over to the Further Shore meaning Nibbana
The Tibetan picture shows him pointing out the moon upon which is drawn a hare the symbol of renunciation the way to practice Dhamma and the way out of this wheel
In my picture He indicates with his hand the nature of samsara and warns us to beware
He is adorned with a radiance about Him symbolizing the spiritual freedom and majestic wisdom won by Him which can be described in many ways but is finally beyond the limitations of everything known to us
The Tibetan picture shows in the upper left a drawing of Avalokitesvara the embodiment of compassion as the way and the goal for those who follow the bodhisattvapath
My picture has the Path of Dhamma of eight lotuses leading to the wheel of Dhamma
The eight lotuses are the eight factors of the Noble Path the first two  Right View Right Attitude  being the wisdomsection the next three  Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood  being the morality section and the last three  Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Collectedness  being the section of collectedness or meditation
The Wheel of Dhamma has at its center suññata the Void another name for the experience of Nibbana
Around its hub are the ten petals of a lotus representing the ten perfecting qualities which are necessary for complete attainment generosity moral conduct renunciation wisdom determination energy patience truthfulness lovingkindness and equanimity
Eight spokes radiate from the hub which stand for the practice by the arahant the one perfected of the Eightfold Path when each factor instead of being just right becomes perfect
On the inside of the wheel's nave there are jewels symbolizing the thirtyseven factors of Enlightenment while the outer edge of the nave is adorned with four groups of three jewels showing the Four Noble Truths in each of the three ways wherein they were viewed by the Exalted Buddha when he discovered Enlightenment
This picture teaches us and reminds us of many important features of the Dhamma as it was intended to by the teachers of old
Contemplating all its features frequently helps to give us true insight into the nature of Samsara
With its help and our own practice we come to see Dependent Arising in ourselves
When this has been done thoroughly all the riches of Dhamma will be available to us not from books or discussions nor from listening to others' explanations

Publisher's Note In accordance with the official change of the island's name in throughout the text the word Ceylon has been changed to Sri Lanka or Lanka except in a few cases where it was thought necessary or desirable to retain Ceylon 
Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in be
and became the national religion of the Sinhalese from that date
It is however necessary for a proper study of the history of Buddhism in the island to consider the state of the island and its social and political developments and the culture and character of the people immediately preceding this period
This will enable us to get a clear understanding of the manner in which such a farreaching revolution in the beliefs manners customs and character of a people was effected by the introduction of this new religion and the progress in literature art and culture that has been manifested through its influence
According to the early chronicles relating the historical traditions of Sri Lanka a prince named Vijaya and his followers who came from India and landed in Lanka on the day of the Parinibbaana of the Buddha were the first human inhabitants of this island
When they came the island was occupied by yakkhas
Yakkhas and naagas are also said to have inhabited Lanka in the time of the Buddha
A legend relating the existence of a great civilization before this time under a king named Raavana is also current though the early chronicles make no mention of it
The Vijaya legend of these chronicles is taken by modern historians as a poetic expression of the actual aryanization of Sri Lanka in about the sixth century BCE The term yakkhas and naagas may refer to the aborigines who occupied the island before their arrival
No traces of an advanced civilization however have yet been discovered to support the Raavana legend
Archaeologists have discovered chert and quartz implements and tools at various sites believed to have been used by aborigines of Sri Lanka and they indicate that these people were a primitive tribe who lived by hunting
These aborigines have not left traces of a strong political organization or an advanced culture
The present Veddas are believed to be their descendants
Vijaya and his followers are described in the Lankan chronicles as a set of adventurous young men who when they were banished from their Indian homeland Laala came in search of new land for settlement
Other legends some of which are even older relating how the first aryan inhabitants came to settle down in Lanka are found in several Pali and Sanskrit works
Most of them show that the settlement of early aryan settlers is due to the enterprise of the pioneering merchant mariners who came to this island for pearls and precious stones
Historians thus do not lay much reliance on the details of the Vijayan legend but they accept Vijaya as the first traditional ruler of the newcomers  the Sinhalese
Vijaya who was a Kshatriya landed in Lanka according to the chronicles on the day of the Parinibbaana of the Buddha
He allied himself with an aboriginal princess named Kuveni and married her and with her influence soon became the master of the country
Later he drove Kuveni away and obtained a princess from Maduraa whom he made his queen
Maidens of high birth came from the Pandyan kingdom as wives of his followers
Vijaya ruled from his settlement Tambappanni and his ministers founded other settlements like Anuraadhagaama Upatissagaama Ujjeni Uruvelaa and Vijitapura
Thus the earliest settlements that were founded in the time of King Vijaya were located along the river banks in the northwestern region of Lanka like the Malvatuoya and the Kalaaoya
Vijaya died after a rule of years
Since he had no son to succeed him before his death he sent messengers to his brother Sumitta in Sihapura to come and rule here
Sumitta sent his youngest son Panduvaasudeva since he himself was king of Sihapura and was also too old
Panduvaasudeva Vijaya's nephew arrived one year after Vijaya's death during which period the ministers of Vijaya ruled the country
When Panduvaasudeva came he brought with him sons of ministers
The early chronicles preserve an episode which connects the Sakka family of the Buddha with the sovereignty of Lanka from the time of King Panduvaasudeva
According to this account Bhaddakaccaanaa who also arrived in Lanka with other maidens shortly after Panduvaasudeva arrived was the daughter of Pandu Sakka who himself was the son of Amitodana an uncle of the Buddha
Panduvaasudeva ruled for years and was succeeded by his eldest son Abhaya who ruled for years
Abhaya's successor was Pandukaabhaya the son of his sister Ummaadacitta
Pandukaabhaya was a great ruler in whose reign Anuraadhapura developed into a great city with wellmarked boundaries
After a long reign of years Pandukaabhaya was succeeded by his son Mutasiva who ruled for years
Mutasiva's second son Devaanampiya Tissa succeeded him in BCE that is years after the accession of Vijaya
These years could be reckoned as a separate period in the history of Sri Lanka for it formed the background for the offical introduction of Buddhism which occurred during the opening years of the next ruler King Devaanampiya Tissa
During this period the aryan colonists founded settlements along the fertile river banks almost throughout the island
They chose the river banks because they were mainly agriculturists
Thus the regions watered by the Malvatuoya Kalaaoya Valaveganga Kirindioya Menikganga and Kumbukkanoya the Kelaniganga and some regions around the Mahaveliganga soon became populated
Anuraadhapura became a wellorganized city with boundaries marked lakes dug and hospitals and other buildings constructed
In the south Mahaagaama became the center of activity
The majority of the aboriginal inhabitants were absorbed into the new community through intermarriage while a few withdrew to the Malayadesa the highlands
It is evident from the chronicles relating the early history of Sri Lanka that before the introduction of Buddhism in the reign of King Devaanampiya Tissa there was no single religion which was widely accepted as the national religion of the country
Nevertheless there was a wide range of religious beliefs and practices different from one another and each individual seems to have freely observed his religion according to his belief
A noteworthy feature of the preBuddhist religion of Sri Lanka is that it was a mixture of the aboriginal cults and the beliefs of the aryan newcomers
The worship of yaksas and yaksinis was a widely prevalent aboriginal custom of preBuddhist Lanka
King Pandukaabhaya the grandfather of Devaanampiya Tissa provided shrines for many of these spirits and also gave them sacrificial offerings annually
Some of these yaksas and yaksinis mentioned by name are Kaalavela Cittaraaja Vessavana Valavaamukhi and Cittaa
Vyaadhadeva Kammaaradeva and Pacchimaraajini though not known as yaksas and yaksinis also belong to the same category of aboriginal spirits
Trees like the banyan and palmyrah were also connected with the cults of these spirits showing that treeworship was also prevalent
Many scholars agree that these yaksas and other nonhuman beings are none but the spirits of the dead relatives and tribal chiefs who the people believed were capable of helping friends and harming enemies
This belief as is widely known formed one of the main features of the primitive religion and is extant even today
Accounts relating the preBuddhist history of Sri Lanka also show a considerable influence of the religious trends of India on the society of Lanka
Several niganthas such as Giri Jotiya and Kumbhanda lived in the reign of Pandukaabhaya and hermitages were constructed for them and other ascetics like aajivakas brahmans and the wandering mendicant monks
Five hundred families of heretical beliefs also lived near the city of Anuraadhapura
The brahmans occupied a high place in society and their religious beliefs were also respected
The worship of Siva too may have been prevalent
The account in the Mahaavamsa of the settling of the adherents of various sects by King Pandukaabhaya does not specifically mention the presence of any adherents of Buddhism among them
But the work refers to three visits of the Buddha to Sri Lanka a statement which though not corroborated by other evidence has not been disproved
Legendary accounts also claim that two stuupas  the Mahiyangana and the Girihandu  were constructed before the introduction of Buddhism
Among the newcomers too there could have been some members who were acquainted with Buddhism especially as Bhaddakaccaanaa who arrived with other maidens in the guise of nuns was a close relative of the Buddha
Buddhism as a form of religious expression gained ascendency in India during this period
Emperor Asoka was crowned according to the chronicles in the year of the Buddhist era
Like his father Bindusaara and grandfather Candragupta Asoka was a follower of the brahmanical faith at the beginning of his reign
In the early years of his reign he followed an expansionist policy and in the eighth year of his coronation he conquered Kaalinga in the course of which were slain and taken prisoners
But the carnage of the Kaalinga war caused him much grief and the king was attracted towards the humanistic teachings of Buddhism
According to the Sri Lanka chronicles it was a young novice named Nigrodha who converted Asoka
After the conversion of this great emperor Buddhism flourished under his patronage
He inculcated the teachings of the Buddha and set up edicts of morality at numerous places of his vast empire so that his subjects would adhere to them and his successors might follow him
He himself followed those morals and set an example to the others
The king is reputed to have built stupas
The monks were lavishly provided with their requisites
The king even permitted his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamittaa to join the Order when they were twenty and eighteen years of age respectively
These two illustrious disciples became noted for their piety attainments learning and profound knowledge of the Dhamma
Vast numbers joined the Order in the reign of Asoka solely to share the benefits showered on it by the king and such people were not only lax in their conduct but also held doctrines counter to the teachings of the Buddha
It was this dissenting element that led to the holding of the Third Buddhist Council under the patronage of King Asoka in order to purify the Buddhist religion
It was at this Council held by a thousand theras under the leadership of Moggaliputta Tissa at Paataliputta that the Pali Canon of the Theravaada as it exists today was finally redacted
At this Council was also taken the important decision of sending missionaries to different regions to preach Buddhism and establish the Saasana there
Thus the thera Moggaliputta Tissa deputed Majjhantika Thera to KaasmiraGandhaara Mahaadeva Thera to Mahisamandala Rakkhita Thera to Vanavaasi YonaDhammarakkhita Thera to Aparaantaka Dhammarakkhita Thera to Mahaarattha Mahaarakkhita Thera to Yonaloka Majjhima Thera to Himavanta theras Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhuumi and Mahinda Thera with theras Itthiya Uttiya Sambala and Bhaddasaala to Lanka saying unto the five theras Establish ye in the delightful land of Lanka the delightful religion of the Vanquisher
Mahinda was thirtytwo years old when he undertook the mission to Sri Lanka
He had adopted the religious life at the age of twenty mastered the doctrines and attained the highest spiritual life ie arahantship
Pondering on the fitting time to come to Lanka he perceived that Mutasiva the ruler at that time was in his old age and hence it was advisable to tarry until his son became ruler
In the meantime Mahinda visited his relatives at Dakkhinaagiri and his mother at Vedisagiri along with his companions
His mother Devi whom Asoka had married while he was yet a prince was living at Vedisagiri at that time
Having stayed for six months at Dakkhinaagiri and a month at Vedisagiri Mahinda perceived that the right time had come for the old ruler was dead and his son Devaanampiya Tissa had become king
Devaanampiya Tissa was the second son of Mutasiva
He was a friend of Asoka even before he became king but the two had not seen each other
The first thing that Devaanampiya Tissa did when he became king was to send envoys to Asoka bearing costly presents
The envoys when they returned brought among other things the following message from Asoka
Aham Buddhañ ca Dhammañ ca Sanghañ ca saranamgato upaasakattam vedesim Saakyaputtassa saasane tvamp'imaani ratanaani uttamaani naruttama cittam pasaadayitvaana saddhaaya saranam bhaja
I have taken refuge in the Buddha his Doctrine and his Order I have declared myself a laydisciple in the religion of the Saakya son seek then O best of men refuge in these best of gems converting your mind with believing heart
This message of Asoka was conveyed to King Devaanampiya Tissa in the month of Vesakha and it was the fullmoon day of the following month Jettha that Mahinda fixed for his arrival in Sri Lanka
Among the companions of Mahinda were the theras Itthiya Uttiya Sambala and Bhaddasaala the saamanera Sumana who was the son of Sanghamittaa and the laydisciple Bhanduka who was the son of a daughter of Devi's sister and had become an anaagaami on hearing a sermon of Mahinda preached to Devi
Thus on the fullmoon day of the month of Jettha in the year be
Mahinda and his companions departing from Vedisagiri rose up in the air and alighted on the Silakuuta of the pleasant Missaka hill presently Mihintale eight miles east of Anuraadhapura
The thera alighted here for he had perceived that he would meet the king there on that day
The first meeting of the king of Lanka and the thera Mahinda is graphically described in the chronicles of Sri Lanka
The fullmoon day of Jettha was a day of national festival in Lanka
Men and women were engaged in amusing themselves
The king with a large party of followers went to Mihintale hills on a hunting expedition
There he saw the theras with shaven heads dressed in yellow robes of dignified mien and distinguished appearance who faced him and addressed him not as ordinary men addressing a king but as those to whom a king was their inferior
The conversation impressed the king and his immediate surrender to the wisdom and piety displayed by the thera was complete
Mahinda Thera in reply to the king's inquiry as to who they were and whence they had come said
Samanaa mayam Mahaaraaja Dhammaraajassa saavakaa tav'eva anukampaaya Jambudiipaa idhaagataa
We are the disciples of the Lord of the Dhamma
In compassion towards you Mahaaraaja We have come here from India
When he heard these words of the thera the king laid aside his bow and arrow and approaching the thera exchanged greetings with him and sat down near him
Mahinda then had a conversation with the king and realizing that the king was intelligent enough to comprehend the Dhamma preached the Cuulahatthipadopama Sutta
At the end of the discourse the king and his retinue of forty thousand people embraced the new faith
Having invited the missionaries to the city the king left for his palace
Mahinda spent his first day in Sri Lanka at Mihintale where he solemnized the first ecclesiastical act by admitting to the Order the layfollower Bhanduka who had accompanied him from India
On the invitation of the king Mahinda and the other theras arrived at Anuraadhapura the following day
Going forward to meet the theras the king respectfully led them into the palace where he himself served them with dainty food
After the meal Mahinda preached the Petavatthu the Vimaanavatthu and the Saccasamyutta to the royal household
The people of the city who heard of the theras flocked near the palacegate to see them and the king prepared a hall outside the palace so that the townspeople could see the theras
On this occasion Mahinda preached the Devaduuta Sutta
This hall too was not spacious enough for the vast gathering and seats were prepared for the theras in the Nandanagarden in the royal park where Mahinda preached the Baalapandita Sutta
In the evening the theras expressed their desire to go back to Mihintale
The king who wished them to stay in his capital granted to the Sangha the royal park Mahaamegha for their residence
The king himself marked the boundaries by plowing a furrow
Thus was established the Mahaavihaara which became the earliest celebrated center of the Buddhist religion
Having spent twentysix days in the Mahaamegha Park the thera returned to Mihintale for the rainretreat
This was the beginning of the Cetiyagirivihaara another great monastic institution of early Buddhist Sri Lanka
Many women of Sri Lanka headed by Queen Anulaa desired to enter the Order of disciples and thus it came about that emissaries led by the king's nephew Arittha were sent to Emperor Asoka to obtain the help of female disciples to enable the women of Lanka to obtain ordination
Sanghamittaa the sister of Mahinda Thera who had entered the Order and had received ordination was sent out to Lanka at the request of the king and the people and on the recommendation of Mahinda Thera
The message sent by thera Mahinda to Emperor Asoka pleased him very much for in it he realized that the mission to Lanka had been eminently successful and the king and the people of Lanka had accepted the new doctrine with enthusiasm
Emperor Asoka decided on sending a token of the Great and Enlightened One to the land of Lanka and prepared a branch of the Sacred Bodhi Tree under which the Lord attained enlightenment
He planted the branch in a golden vessel and when it had taken root conveyed it to the ship depositing it in the ship
He also sent a large number of attendants to accompany the tree
The chronicles mention that these were selected from the brahmans nobles and householders and consisted of families
Sanghamittaa Therii and her attendants embarked on the same ship as well as the ambassadors and messengers who came from Lanka
The ship sailed from Taamralipti and arrived at the port in Lanka in seven days
The port was known as Jambukola and was situated in the north of the island
The king of Lanka on hearing of the arrival of the ship had the road from Jambukola to the capital city of Anuraadhapura gaily decorated
He arrived in state and himself took charge of the Sacred Bodhi Tree
This tree was planted in the Mahaamegha garden of Anuraadhapura with great festivities and tended with honor and care
Up to this date it flourishes as one of the most sacred objects of veneration and worship for millions of Buddhists
Arittha the king's nephew who had obtained the king's permission to enter the Order of monks on his return from India did so with five hundred other men and all became arahants
With the ordination of Anulaa and the other women both the Bhikkhusaasana and the Bhikkhunisaasana were established in the island
Separate residences for monks and nuns were built by the king
The Thuupaaraamacetiya enshrining the right collarbone and other bodily relics of the Buddha was built and the Sacred Bodhi Tree was planted for the devotion of the laity
When these acts of religious devotion were accomplished the king asked Mahinda Thera whether the Saasana had been firmly established in the island to which the latter replied that it had only been planted but would take firm root when a person born in Sri Lanka of Sinhalese parents studied the Vinaya in Sri Lanka and expounded it in Sri Lanka
Arittha Thera had by this time become noted for his piety and his learning and on an appointed day at a specially constructed preaching hall in the presence of numerous theras the king and the chiefs Arittha Thera was invited to give a discourse on the Vinaya in the presence of the thera Mahaa Mahinda
And his exposition was so correct and pleasing that there was great rejoicing as the condition required for the firm establishment of the Saasana was fulfilled by him
Devaanampiya Tissa ruled in Sri Lanka for forty years
It was in the first year of his reign that Buddhism was introduced and from that time the king worked for the progress of the new faith with great zeal
Apart from the Mahaavihaara the Cetiyapabbatavihaara the Thuuparaama and the Sacred Bodhi Tree he established numerous other monasteries and several Buddhist monuments
The chronicles mention that he built monasteries a yojana from one another
Among these monuments the Isurumunivihaara and the Vessagirivihaara are important centers of worship to this day
He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamakacetiya the Jambukolavihaara and the Hatthaalhakavihaara and the refectory
Thousands of men and women joined the Order during his reign
The king not only built vihaaras for their residence but also provided them with their requisites
It was not only in the capital city that Buddhism spread in his reign but even in distant regions like Jambukola in the north and Kaajaragaama and Candanagaama in the south
The remarkable success of Mahinda's mission and the rapid spread of the religion in a very short time were mainly due to the efforts of Mahinda and the unbounded patronage of King Devaanampiya Tissa
Apart from them the people of Lanka too were eminently ripe at this period for receiving and adopting the teachings of the Buddha
The people in the land were prosperous their wants were few and these were supplied by the fertile soil
There was prosperous trade for merchants came from all lands to barter goods their art was well developed for in the leisure people enjoyed they were able to build cities and tanks great and small and to perform works both of utility and artistic value
Contentment reigned supreme
Where such conditions existed the people were ready to embrace new ideals that had the prospect of helping their culture and elating their thoughts and activities and as such the new doctrine preached by Mahinda Thera fell on a fertile soil where it soon rose to its full height
Hundreds of thousands of men and women rose to high spiritual attainments on hearing the new message and thus the Law of the Blessed One was firmly established
Both Mahinda and Sanghamitta survived Devaanampiya Tissa
Mahinda lived to the age of years and Sanghamittaa to the age of years
They spent nearly years in the island
The former died in the eighth year and the latter in the ninth of the reign of King Uttiya brother and successor of Devaanampiya Tissa
Uttiya performed their funerals with great honor and built stuupas over their relics
The king himself died in the following year be after a reign of ten years
The hierarchy of the disciples was continued in pupilary succession
Arittha Thera succeeded Mahinda Thera he was in turn succeeded by Isidatta Kaalasumana Diighanaama and Diighasumana
Twenty years after the death of Uttiya foreign usurpers from South India seized Anuraadhapura
Two of them Sena and Guttika reigned together for twentytwo years and another Tamil usurper Elaara reigned for fortyfour years
The lack of interest of these Tamil rulers in the Buddhist faith and the vandalism of their supporters evidently retarded the progress of the religion
Furthermore the Sinhalese rulers were not free to work for the religion during these periods of political unrest
Nevertheless the people held strongly to their new religion and showed no signs of laxity
It was a young prince from Maagama of the southeastern principality of Ruhuna who restored the lost glory of the Sinhalese and their religion
He was Abhaya known to posterity by a nickname which means disobedient Dutthagaamani
He was a descendant of Mahaanaaga who had established himself at Maagama when his older brother Devaanampiya Tissa was ruling at Anuraadhapura
Kaakavanna Tissa and Vihaaramahaadevi were his parents
After a thorough preparation for war Dutthagaamani defeated and killed Elaara in battle and became the ruler of Anuraadhapura
Thus the sovereignty of the Sinhalese rulers of Anuraadhapura was once more established
Dutthagaamani reigned for twentyfour years
The advancement of the Buddhist religion was his main concern
The Ruvanvelisaaya the most celebrated stupa in Sri Lanka was his greatest work
The magnificent edifice of nine storeys and nine hundred chambers called the Lohapaasaada the Brazen Palace was constructed by him for the use of the monks
Mirisavetidaagaba was another of his works
Dutthagaamani was not only a supporter of Buddhism but was also a zealous follower himself
Many episodes in the Pali commentaries depict him as a pious monarch
Under his patronage there flourished several learned monks during his reign
It is well to find out the social and cultural development of the Sinhalese during the two centuries following their acceptance of the Buddhist religion
We have many incidents and stories in the Sri Lanka chronicles from which a definite idea regarding these conditions can be inferred
For instance the Rasavaahinii a Pali work composed in the thirteenth century of the Christian era contains over a hundred stories of the life of the people during this early period
According to these stories among the Sinhalese there do not appear to have been any caste divisions
Brahmans are mentioned as living apart in their own villages and they were more or less counted as foreign to the Sinhalese
The members of the royal families were held in a class by themselves and those of such families who aspired to the kingdom had to marry a member of a royal family or at least from a Brahman family
The rest of the people were grihapatis
The Candaalas were those without a fixed abode they were despised on account of being tramps and vagrants with no fixed residence
In some cases the word Candaala was used in a selfdeprecatory manner in order to indicate unworthiness
There is the instance of Prince Saali son of King Dutthagaamani who fell in love with a village artisan's daughter Devi
In addressing the prince she said that she was a Candaali as she did not belong to a family into which a member of the royal family was allowed to marry
The two divisions of people merely appear to be those who had a fixed abode and those who had no fixed abode
There were at this time no special caste divisions for trades or occupations for a householder or members of a family were in general expected to engage themselves in one of the three occupations as traders as artisans or as cultivators
Prince Dighaabhaya when appointed as governor of Kasaatota required attendants and asked each chief family of a village to send one of its sons for service and sent a messenger to Sangha the chief of the village
The chief called together his seven sons
The elder six asked him to send the youngest to the king's service as he was idling his time at home without engaging in any work
We six are engaged in such occupations as trade industries and cultivation and work hard at our occupations Again in another story the father a chief of a village addressing his daughter regarding her husband tells her that her husband is living in idleness and like her brothers should engage himself in an occupation such as cultivation industry and commerce
Thus it appears all trades were common and the same family engaged in work as artisans tradesmen and cultivators without distinction
The religion of the Sinhalese during this period was purely and entirely Buddhist and the stories indicate much practical activity in religious affairs both in endowment and maintenance of religious institutions and the practice of religious principles
The Orders of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis flourished during this period a very large number of men and women entered the religious Orders
Some of the vihaaras had thousands residing in them
There were also large numbers who were practicing meditation in forests and rock caves
They were well supported by the laity
There were four classes of disciples the novices bhikkhus theras and mahaatheras There are no Sangharaajas mentioned in any of the stories and no interference by kings or ministers in appointment or in giving ranks to the members of the Order
The affairs of the Sangha were managed by the monks themselves under well established rules of the Vinaya
There appear to have been large numbers of disciples who had attained to the state of arahant ie saints who had gained emancipation
In addition practically every man or woman was an upaasaka or upaasikaa a devotee who regularly performed religious duties
The bhikkhus lived in their vihaaras during the rainy season and at other seasons traveled far and wide in the country visiting villages other vihaaras and as pilgrims worshipping at shrines
Both laymen and bhikkhus are frequently mentioned as going on pilgrimages to Gayaa in India to worship at the sacred Bodhi Tree there
These parties of pilgrims sometimes crossed over to Southern India and walked all the way to Gayaa taking about six months on the journey sometimes they went by sea and landed at Taamralipti at the mouth of the Ganges and reached Gayaa in half the time
The canonical scriptures had not been committed to writing at this time though writing was known
The bhikkhus learned the Dhamma and many committed to memory the scriptures or parts of them thus preserving the tradition by frequent rehearsal
That the art of writing was probably introduced to Sri Lanka only after the introduction of Buddhism seems deducible from the circumstance that so far no preBuddhist writing lithic or other has been identified
The earliest lithic records date back to the time of King Uttiya successor of Devaanampiya Tissa
The bhikkhus were the instructors of the people
This was practically a duty
The Dhamma was expounded individually on every occasion and sermons to congregations were also held from time to time
There is mention of the periodical expounding of the Dhamma at a temple
Each temple in a district sometimes took its turn once a year to preach the Ariyavamsa Sutta which was continued each time for seven days the gatherings on these occasions appear to be very large as in instances mentioned it is said that the crowds were so great that large numbers usually had to stand outside the hall for the whole night and listen to the Dhamma the audience including bhikkhus and the laity
There is also mention of discourses by lay preachers well versed in the Dhamma employed by the king at halls of preaching
It is not clearly stated whether brahmans who lived in brahman villages practiced their own religion
Mention is made of sannyaasis or yogis who practiced asceticism and sometimes lived in cemeteries scantily clad with bodies covered with ashes and as the story says pretending to be saints while at the same time they led sinful lives
There is no mention of brahman temples or places of worship
Women had a very high status in society during this period
Practically in every strata of society the position of women showed no distinction from that of men
They freely took part in every activity of life and their influence is well marked
Their character is depicted in most favorable terms they were gentle courteous and good natured hospitable tender and intelligent ever ready to help others to preserve the honor of their families devoted to religion and country with untrammelled freedom of action
The position of women is further seen from the fact that monogamy was a definite institution
There is no mention of any other form of marriage
Women had freedom to choose their husbands
After the death of King Dutthagaamani his younger brother Saddhaatissa ruled for eight years and did a great deal for Buddhism
He was succeeded by his sons Thuulatthana Lanjatissa Khallaata Naaga and Vattagaamani Abhaya in succession
The period of Vattagaamani Abhaya also known as Valagambahu is noteworthy in the history of early Buddhism in Sri Lanka
Five months after his accession to the throne in BCE a brahman named Tiya from Ruhuna South Lanka revolted against him
At the same time a Tamil army led by seven Tamil chiefs landed at Mahaatittha and waged war against the king
The Tamil army vanquished Tiya and defeated Vattagaamani in battle after which the latter fled and lived in exile for fourteen years
These fourteen years of Tamil domination were disastrous to the cause of Buddhism especially because the country was also ravaged by an unprecedented famine during that period
Food was so scarce during that time that even cases of cannibalism are said to have occurred
Many thousands of monks and laymen died of starvation
The monasteries were deserted
The Mahaavihaara of Anuraadhapura was completely abandoned and the Mahaathuupa was neglected
Trees grew in the courtyards of vihaaras arahants from the Tissamahaaraama and another from the Cittalapabbatavihaara passed away in the forest due to lack of food
While thousands of monks died in the country many left the country and went to India
As a result of the death of most of the learned monks there was even the fear that some parts of the scriptures would be lost
The Mahaaniddesa of the Sutta Pitaka for instance was on the verge of being lost for this text was known by only one monk at that time
The monks in their earnestness to preserve the teachings of the Buddha subsisted on roots and leaves of trees and recited the scriptures lest they should forget them
When they had the strength they sat down and recited and when they could no longer keep their bodies erect they lay down and continued their recitation
Thus they preserved the texts and the commentaries until the misery was over
After Vattagaamani Abhaya regained the throne he demolished the monastery of a nigantha named Giri for having mocked him when he was fleeing
He built a Buddhist monastery called the Abhayagirivihaara over it which he presented to a monk named Kupikkala Mahaa Tissa who had helped the king in his exile
Later the monks of the Mahaavihaara imposed the punishment of expulsion on Tissa on the charge of improper contact with lay families
Tissa's pupil Bahalamassu Tissa who resented the punishment imposed upon his teacher was likewise expelled from the Mahaavihaara
He then went away with a following of five hundred monks and lived at Abhayagirivihaara refusing to return to the Mahaavihaara
There was thus a group of monks who broke away from the Mahaavihaara and lived separately in the Abhayagirivihaara but they did not yet disagree with each other either in the theory or the practice of the Dhamma
The actual schism occurred only when monks of the Vajjiputta sect in India came to Sri Lanka and were received at the Abhayagiri not long after Tissa and his followers occupied that monastery
Tissa and his followers liked the new monks and adopted their doctrines
Thenceforth they came to be known as the Dhammaruci sect after the name of the great Indian monk who was the teacher of the newcomers to Abhayagiri
There was no official suppression of the new sect presumably because the king was in their favor but the Mahaavihaara monks opposed them as unorthodox and heretical
From this time the Abhayagiri existed as a separate sect opposed to the Mahaavihaara
It is stated in the early chronicles that after the acceptance of Buddhism by the people in Lanka and after the formation of a hierarchy of disciples who were Sinhalese a council was held under Mahinda Thera where all the leading theras were present and the teachings were recited and authoritatively laid down as was done in the third convocation held in India under the direction of Emperor Asoka
Theravaada was thus established in Sri Lanka and according to tradition and custom the various parts of the Tipitaka were learned by the members of the Order committed to memory and preserved as oral traditions
It was seen how during the famine that broke out in the time of King Vattagaamani Abhaya a great strain was put on the continuance of this form of preserving the teachings of the Tipitaka
When conditions became normal the members of the Order considered that they could lose the teachings if any similar calamity or calamities were to occur in the future and they decided that the time had arrived for committing these teachings to writing so that they might be preserved for future generations
The advent of schisms about this time might also have weighed strongly in favor of this decision
Thus the members of the Order assembled at the Mahaavihaara at Anuraadhapura took counsel together and with the permission and encouragement of the king a convocation was held
The teachings were recited and scribes were engaged to commit to writing on palm leaves the Pali canonical texts consisting of Vinaya Sutta and Abhidhamma and the Sinhalese commentaries
According to the Nikaaya Sangraha a Sinhalese work of the fourteenth century dealing with the history of the Buddhist order after the convocation at the Mahaavihaara at Anuraadhapura the selected number of reciters and scribes in all went to Alulena cave temple close to Matale in the central province
There in retirement they completed the work assigned to them and thus for the first time brought out in book form the teachings of the Buddha
About two centuries after the formation of the Dhammaruci sect at the Abhayagirivihaara in the days of King Vohaarika Tissa the monks of the Abhayagirivihaara adopted the Vaitulyavaada
Thereupon the monks of the Mahaavihaara having compared it with their own texts rejected the Vaitulya doctrines as being opposed to traditional doctrine
The king who had them examined by a learned minister named Kapila burnt them and suppressed the Vaitulyavaadins
Despite the suppression by Vohaarika Tissa the Vaitulyavaadins began to assert themselves again and a few years later in the time of King Gothaabhaya the Dhammaruci monks of Abhayagiri again accepted Vaitulyavaada
When this happened about three hundred monks left the Abhayagirivihaara to reside at the Dakkhinavihaara founding a new sect known as Saagaliya
The king having assembled the bhikkhus of the five great monasteries of the Theriya Nikaaya had the Vaitulya books examined ordered the books to be destroyed and expelled the Vaitulya monks
Sixty of them left for the Chola country in South India
The struggle did not end here for the adherents of the new doctrine were firmly established in South India and they planned to undermine the Mahaavihaara Nikaaya in Sri Lanka
With this object a very learned monk by the name of Sanghamitra came to Sri Lanka and obtained the post of tutor to the king's two sons
Sanghamitra gained considerable influence over the young pupil Mahaasena and was able to instil into him the new doctrine and make him a follower of his views
When Mahaasena ascended the throne the opportunity looked forward to by the Vaitulyans came
The new king became a great supporter of his tutor and as such persecuted the Mahaavihaara monks
The king at the instigation of Sanghamitra Thera ordered that no one should give food to the monks of the Mahaavihaara
The Mahaavihaara as a result had to be abandoned for nine years
The supporters of Sanghamitra destroyed the buildings of the Mahaavihaara and carried away their material to construct new buildings for the Abhayagirivihaara
Two persons a minister and a queen came forward this time to suppress Vaitulyavaada and save the Mahaavihaara
The minister Meghavannaabhaya by name managed to persuade the king to rebuild the Mahaavihaara
The queen caused Sanghamitra to be put to death and burned the Vaitulya books
But the king who was yet favorable towards the followers of Sanghamitra built and gave the Jetavanavihaara to a monk named Tissa
Tissa who was later charged by the Mahaavihaara monks of a grave offense was expelled from the Order
The monks of the Sagaliya sect at Dakkhinavihaara then came to reside in the Jetavanavihaara
In the reign of Silaakaala a Vaitulyan book called the Dharmadhaatu which was brought to Sri Lanka from India was kept at the Jetavanavihaara and venerated
Thus from this time the monks of Jetavanavihaara too became adherents of Vaitulyavaada
In the reign of King Aggabodhi I a great monk and teacher named Jotipaala coming from India so exposed the fallacies of the Vaitulya doctrines that in his day they fell into disrepute and disappeared from Sri Lanka
Since that time the monks of the Abhayagiri and Jetavana vihaaras who adhered to Vaitulyan doctrines abandoned their pride and lived in submission to the monks of the Mahaavihaara
Intercourse with India was so frequent that from time to time other unorthodox doctrines occasionally found favor with certain monks but these had no marked effect on the general progress or the stability of the Mahaavihaara Nikaaya
For nearly three centuries after the time of Aggabodhi I the chronicles make no mention of the Vaitulyavaada or any other heretical teaching until in the reign of King Sena I a monk of the Vaajraparvata Nikaaya came to Sri Lanka from India and introduced Vaajiriyavaada converting the king to his doctrines
It was at this time that teachings like the Ratnakuutasuutra were also introduced to Sri Lanka and another heresy called Nilapatadarsana appeared
Sena II who succeeded Sena I managed to suppress these new doctrines
From his time until the Chola conquest in the early eleventh century there is no mention of any heretical sect in Sri Lanka
However a survey of the religious monuments of that period clearly shows that their teachings survived side by side with the teachings of the Theravaada
It is opportune here to enquire about the nature of the new doctrines that were mentioned in the previous chapter as having been introduced into Sri Lanka from time to time since the first century ac
It was the monks of the Vajjiputra sect in India who were the first to introduce a new teaching
The Vajjiputra sect is mentioned in the Sri Lanka chronicles as one of the groups that parted from the Theriya Nikaaya after the Second Buddhist Council to form a new sect
They thus evidently held some views different from those of the orthodox teachings
Buddhaghosa mentions in the Pali commentaries that the Vajjiputrakas held the view that there is a persistent personal entity which is opposed to the accepted theory of anattaa of the Theravaada teachings
They also believed that arahants may fall away from their attainment
These followers of the Vajjiputraka doctrines residing at the Abhayagirivihaara became adherents of the Vaitulya doctrines about two centuries afterwards and until the beginning of the seventh century Vaitulyavaada became closely associated with Abhayagirivihaara and Jetavanavihaara
Like the Vajjiputra sect the Vaitulyavaada is mentioned in the Nikaaya Sangraha as one of the sects that arose in India after the Second Buddhist Council
The Nikaaya Sangraha also states that the Vaitulya Pitaka was composed by heretic brahmans called Vaitulyas who entered the Order in the time of King Asoka to destroy Buddhism
It has been noticed that the terms Vaitulya Vaipulya and Vaidalya are commonly used as a designation for Mahaayaana suutras and hence the term Vaitulyavaada is used in the Sri Lanka chronicles to denote Mahaayaanism in general without having a particular Buddhist school in view
The Vaitulyavaadins were considered even more heretical than the Vajjiputrakas
The Pali commentaries mention some of their heretical views
They held the view that the Buddha having been born in the Tusita heaven lived there and never came down to earth and it was only a created form that appeared among men
This created form and nanda who learned from it preached the doctrine
They also held that nothing whatever given to the Order bears fruit for the Sangha which in the ultimate sense of the term meant only the path and fruitions does not accept anything
According to them any human pair may enter upon sexual intercourse by mutual consent
The Diipavamsa used the term Vitandavaada in place of Vaitulyavaada and the Pali commentaries mention them as holding unorthodox views regarding the subtle points in the Dhamma particularly the Abhidhamma
Buddhaghosa also refers to the Vaitulyavaadins as Mahaasuññavaadins
The philosophy of the Mahaayaana as expounded by the great Mahaayaana teacher Naagaarjuna was Suunyavaada
Thus the fact that the first appearance of Vaitulyavaada in Sri Lanka took place shortly after Naagaarjuna's teachings spread in South India and that Vaitulyavaada is also identified with Suunyavaada of Naagaarjuna suggests that it was the teaching of Naagaarjuna that was received by the monks of Abhayagirivihaara in the days of Vohaarika Tissa
The book called Dharmadhaatu which was brought to Lanka in the reign of Silaakaala is described in the chronicles as a Vaitulyan book
The monks of the Abhayagirivihaara and the Jetavanavihaara are connected with the honors paid to it
It has become evident that a book named Dharmadhaatu was known and held in high esteem in the tenth century in Lanka and it is quite probable that this book was a Mahaayaanistic treatise dealing with the doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha found among the teachings of the Mahaayaana
Vaajiriyavaada was introduced in the reign of King Sena I by a monk of the Vajraparvata Nikaaya
Scholars have pointed out that the Vaajiriyavaadins are identical with the Vajrayaanists a school of Buddhism which flourished in eastern India about this time and which was an exponent of the worst phases of Tantrism
The Nikaaya Sangraha describes their writings as secret teachings and the Guudhavinaya ie the secret Vinaya is one of the compositions of the Vajrayaanists
The Nikaaya Sangraha mentions that about this time the Ratnakuutasuutra was introduced to Sri Lanka
In the Chinese Canon the second of the seven classes of the Mahaayaanasuutras is called the Ratnakuuta
The Niilapatadarsana which was also introduced about this time was also an extreme form of Tantrism
Blue has been a color often favored by Tantrists
An important event in the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is the arrival of Buddha's Tooth Relic the left eyetooth from India about be during the time of King Sirimeghavanna son and successor of King Mahaasena
Ever since this Sacred Tooth Relic was received in Sri Lanka it has been a national treasure of great value and a tangible token of the attachment of the Sinhalese to the doctrine of the Blessed Tathaagata
King Sirimeghavanna held a great festival for the Tooth Relic and decreed that it should be brought every year to the Abhayagirivihaara and the same ceremonial should be observed
Today it is enshrined in golden caskets in the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy which has become the center of devout pilgrims from all over the island and from Buddhist lands elsewhere
Ancient customs and ceremonies are scrupulously kept up offerings are made daily and in honor of the Sacred Relic an annual festival lasting fourteen days is held in Kandy every year during August
The Perahera or procession on these occasions is conducted by the temple authorities with elephants lights music and dancers and is witnessed by thousands of devotees
Chiefs in full ancient attire accompany the procession
Large tracts of land have been set apart as fees for services at this temple and the tenants of these lands have various services apportioned to them
The exhibition of the Sacred Relic itself takes place at rare intervals when tens of thousands of pilgrims find their way to the Temple to worship and view the Relic
A medieval chronicle chiefly of the eastern part of the island mentions the existence of the right eyetooth and its enshrinement in Somavati Cetiya in preChristian times
The Sacred Tooth Relic was in the possession of King Guhasiva of Kaalinga before it was brought to Sri Lanka
When he was about to be defeated in battle he entrusted it to his daughter Hemamaalaa Hemamaalaa with her husband Dantakumaara brought the Sacred Tooth to Lanka and handed it over to King Sirimeghavanna at Anuraadhapura
From this date the Sacred Tooth Relic became the care of the kings of Lanka who built special temples for it
During the many vicissitudes of the fortunes of the kings of Lanka the Sacred Relic was conveyed from place to place where the fortunes of the king happened to take him
Replicas of the Sacred Tooth were made at various times and were owned by princes claiming the throne
About the year King Anawrahta of Burma sent various presents to King Vijayabaahu I of Sri Lanka and in return received a duplicate of the Sacred Tooth Relic which he received with great veneration and a shrine was built for it in Burma
The Portuguese in one of their expeditions to Sri Lanka claim to have captured the Sacred Tooth Relic at Jaffna in the year
Jaffna was an outlying port away from the strongholds of Sinhalese kings and the relic said to have been found by the Portuguese in a temple at Jaffna appeared to be one of the several duplicates which had been made at various times
On this question Prof
Rhys Davids wrote in the Academy of September Jaffna is an outlying and unimportant part of the Ceylon kingdom not often under the power of the Sinhalese monarchs and for some time before this it had been ruled by a petty chieftain there is no mention of the Tooth brought by Dantakumaara having been taken there  an event so unlikely and of such importance that it would certainly have been mentioned had it really occurred
We have every reason to believe therefore that the very Tooth referred to in the Daañhaavamsa is preserved to this day in Kandy
In the British occupied Kandy
As usual the Sacred Tooth Relic had been taken to the mountains for security and one of the earliest tasks of the Agent of the British Government in the Kandyan Province was to arrange for the bringing back of the Relic with due ceremony
The houses and streets of Kandy were decorated the surface of the streets whitened and the Relic was brought in a magnificent procession
In there was a rebellion in the Kandyan provinces and the Sacred Tooth Relic was taken away from Kandy and hidden in a forest
After the suppression of the rebellion the British were able to find the Sacred Tooth Relic and bring it back to Kandy
The Sacred Tooth Relic continued to be in the custody of the British Government till when by order of the Secretary of State for the Colonies the charge was given over to the Diyawadana Nilame and the chief monks of Malwatte and Asgiriya monasteries in Kandy
The compilation of the Pali Atthakathaa by Buddhaghosa Thera is another important event in the annals of Sri Lanka which marks the progress of Buddhism
As has already been stated the Pitakas or the teachings of the Buddha which were being handed down orally were committed to writing in be
and the commentaries on these composed in Sinhalese were also committed to writing at this time
Since this period much by way of exegetical works in Sinhalese was added from time to time and during the next five hundred years literary activity progressed considerably
By about be when King Mahaanaama reigned at Anuraadhapura the fame of Buddhist literature in Sri Lanka was well recognized throughout India and tradition mentions Sinhalese Buddhist monks visiting India China and other countries and introducing the literature produced in Sri Lanka
Monks from India and China also visited Anuraadhapura during this time to procure Buddhist books
It was about this time that Buddhaghosa Thera came to Sri Lanka in the reign of King Mahaanaama
Mahaanaama succeeded to the throne years after the death of King Sirimeghavanna during whose reign the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka and three rulers namely Jetthatissa II Buddhadaasa and Upatissa I reigned in between
The story of Buddhaghosa is given in detail both in the Mahaavamsa and the Sinhalese works composed in later times
According to these sources Buddhaghosa was a brahman youth who was born in the vicinity of Buddha Gayaa and became well known as an exponent of Veda and philosophy
He was such a proficient scholar that in his youth he was able to assert his knowledge among the great scholars of the time
He traveled from place to place from one seat of learning to another from one set of teachers to another triumphantly asserting his knowledge and scholarship
At a wellknown Buddhist monastery at Tamluk he met Revata Mahaathera one well versed in the doctrines and philosophy of Buddhism
There he entered into discussions and found not a peer but one superior to him in knowledge and understanding
This made him join the Order of Buddhist monks as a pupil of Revata Mahaathera
At this vihaara he studied Buddhist philosophy diligently and produced a treatise on Buddhism aanodaya he also planned to compose commentaries on the Abhidhamma and the suttas
His teacher at this stage advised him to go to Anuraadhapura before undertaking this work as he said that in Lanka were preserved not only the Tipitaka the teachings of the Buddha himself but also the Sinhalese commentaries and various expositions of the teachings which were very valuable and of high repute
Buddhaghosa Thera proceeded to Sri Lanka and stayed at the Mahaapadhaanaghara of the Mahaavihaara
He then asked the monks at Anuraadhapura for access to books for the compilation of commentaries
The learned theras at Anuraadhapura tested his knowledge and ability by setting him a thesis on which he compiled the wellknown Visuddhimagga
They were so pleased with this work that he was given facilities for his projected work and books were placed at his disposal for the preparation of Pali commmentaries
The old Sinhalese commentaries from which Buddhaghosa drew material for the compilation of his Pali commentaries are occasionally named in his works
The Mahaa Atthakathaa occupied the foremost position among them while the Mahaapaccari Atthakathaa and the Kurundi Atthakathaa were also important
These three major works probably contained exegetical material on all the three Pitakas
Apart from these there were other works like the Sankhepatthakathaa Vinayatthakathaa Abhidhammatthakathaa and separate commentaries on the four AAgamas or Nikaayas namely the Diigha Nikaaya Atthakathaa Majjhima Nikaaya Atthakathaa Samyutta Nikaaya Atthakathaa and the Anguttara Nikaaya Atthakathaa
References to numerous other sources like the Andhakatthakathaa the aacariyaa and the Poraanaa are also found in Buddhaghosa's works
Utilizing the copious material of these commentaries and other sources which sometimes contained conflicting views and contradictory assertions Buddhaghosa compiled his Pali commentaries including all authoritative decisions sometimes giving his own views but leaving out unnecessary details and repetitions as well as irrelevant matter
The first of such commentaries was the Samantapaasaadikaa on the Vinaya Pitaka
The Kankhaavitaranii on the Paatimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka was compiled later
These books were followed by the commentaries on the four Nikaayas the Sumangalavilaasinii on the Diigha Nikaaya the Papañcasuudanii on the Majjhima Nikaaya the Saaratthappakaasinii on the Samyutta Nikaaya and the Manorathapuuranii on the Anguttara Nikaaya
The Dhammapadaññhakathaa on the Dhammapada the Jaatakaññhakathaa on the Jaataka and the Paramatthajotikaa on the Khuddaka Nikaaya are also ascribed to him
On the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka Buddhaghosa compiled the Aññhasaalinii on the Dhammasanganii the Sammohavinodanii on the Vibhanga and the Pañcappakaranaññhakathaa on the other five books
The voluminous literature which Buddhaghosa produced exists to this day and is the basis for the explanation of many crucial points of Buddhist philosophy which without them would have been unintelligible
His commentaries become all the more important since the old Sinhalese commentaries gradually went out of vogue and were completely lost after the tenth century
Buddhaghosa's activities gave an impetus to the learning of Pali in Sri Lanka which resulted in the production of many other Pali commentaries and other literary works and also established the preeminence of Sri Lanka as the home of Theravaada Buddhism
Some time before and after the compilation of the Pali commentaries by Buddhaghosa two important literary works of a different type were produced in Sri Lanka
They are the Diipavamsa and the Mahaavamsa described in the foregoing pages either as the Sri Lanka chronicles or the Pali chronicles
These two works are the earliest extant literary records giving a continuous history of the activities of the kings of Sri Lanka from preBuddhistic times up to the end of the reign of King Mahaasena
Both works are composed in Pali metrical verses
The Diipavamsa is the earlier of these two chronicles
It is not a compilation of one individual author but is the outcome of several previous works to which additions have been made from time to time taking its present form about the fourth century ac
The chronicle does not name any author but it has been held by some scholars from the abundant material it contains about nuns that the Diipavamsa is a work compiled and continued by nuns from time to time
The Diipavamsa consists of chapters
They contain accounts of the three visits of the Buddha to Sri Lanka the ancestry of the Buddha the three Buddhist councils and the different Buddhist schools which arose after the Second Council the activities of King Asoka the colonization of Sri Lanka by Vijaya his successors the introduction of Buddhism in the reign of King Devaanampiya Tissa and the activities of his successors especially Dutthagaamani Vattagaamani and Mahaasena
The narrative ends with the reign of Mahaasena
The Diipavamsa has obtained its material from different sources of which the Sihala Mahaavamsatthakathaa was preeminent
Besides this there were several other sources like the Uttaravihaara Mahaavamsa Vinayatthakathaa and the Dipavamsatthakathaa
By these names were known the records collected and preserved in the Mahaavihaara and the other monasteries
The Mahaavamsa which is the better work in its comprehensiveness arrangement of facts and high literary standard was compiled by a thera named Mahaanaama either in the late fifth century or the early sixth century ac
It also covers the same period of history and its material is drawn from the same sources as the Diipavamsa but it contains much more additional material presented in a better form
The Mahaavamsa contains chapters in all
They deal mainly with the same events as those of the Diipavamsa but there are much longer accounts and greater details of the activities of several kings such as Pandukaabhaya and Dutthagaamani and events like the establishment of Buddhism and the rise of new schools
These two chronicles contain many myths and legends
Yet they are among the primary sources for the reconstruction of the early history of Sri Lanka for they contain a great deal of historical facts especially in the narratives dealing with the period after the nd century BCE corroborated by epigraphical archaeological and other evidence
The Mahaavamsa has been continued in later times at three stages giving a connected history of the island up to modern times
This continuation of the chronicle which is in three parts is called the Cuulavamsa
The first part brings the history down to the twelfth century the second part to the fourteenth century and the third part to modern times
The political situation in Sri Lanka from about the middle of the fifth century ac
until the third quarter of the eleventh century ac
was not favorable towards the progress of Buddhism
This period of Sri Lankan history is marked with continuous warfare between the reigning king and his rival claimants or the foreign invaders
Often when the reigning king was defeated in battle he fled to India and came back with a Tamil troop to regain his lost throne and as a result the Tamils who thus settled down in Sri Lanka from time to time also became an important element even powerful enough to seize political power for themselves
Such a political situation evidently did not give the rulers an opportunity to work for the religion and as a result the community and the monasteries were neglected
Some rulers like Aggabodhi III and Daathopatissa I even resorted to the evil practice of robbing monasteries of their gold images precious gems and other valuables which had accumulated there for centuries for the purpose of financing their military operations when the royal treasury had become empty
Daathopatissa I also removed the gold finial of the Thuupaaraama and the gemstudded umbrella of the cetiya
Relic chambers of stuupas were opened and valuable offerings were removed
Their Tamil soldiers were allowed to burn down monastic buildings like the Sacred Tooth Relic Temple and take away the valuables
The Pandya and the Chola invaders from South India who also attacked Sri Lanka several times during this period ransacked the monasteries and carried away vast treasures
These conditions necessarily worsened when Sri Lanka passed into the hands of the South Indian Cholas in and remained a part of the Chola empire until
Amidst this political unrest and the resultant religious decline several events important in the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka occurred
In the reign of Moggallaana I the Sacred Hair Relic of the Buddha was brought to Sri Lanka from India and the king placed it in a crystal casket in an image house and held a great festival
The writing of the Mahaavamsa by a Mahaavihaara monk is ascribed to the reign of his successor Kumaara Dhaatusena
In the reign of Silaakaala the Mahaayaana book the Dharmadhaatu was brought to Sri Lanka and in the reign of Aggabodhi I the monk Jotipaala defeats the Vaitulyavaadins in a public controversy
Apart from these special events several rulers purified the Saasana and repaired the old and neglected monasteries
They also encouraged the recital of Dhamma
In the year Vijayabaahu I succeeded in defeating the Cholas and becoming the king of Sri Lanka
Residing at Polonnaruwa which he made the capital of his kingdom he turned his mind to the noble task of repairing the damage that had been inflicted upon the national religion by the invaders
The great religious edifices the pirivenas and the monasteries which were in utter destruction were restored and new ones were built
But the greatest of his tasks was the restoration of ordination of monks
When he found that the five ordained monks required to carry out an ordination ceremony could not be found in the whole island he sent an embassy to his friend and ally King Anuruddha of Burma soliciting his help in restoring the Saasana in Sri Lanka
King Anuruddha sent a number of eminent theras who reestablished the Saasana in Sri Lanka and instructed a large number of monks in the three Pitakas and the commentaries
The king also brought about a reconciliation of the three Nikaayas of the Mahaavihaara Abhayagiri and Jetavana and restored their ancient monasteries to them
Thousands of laymen joined the Order
The religious revival inaugurated by King Vijayabaahu led to a great intellectual reawakening and a large number of religious literary works in Pali and Sanskrit were written
King Vijayabaahu also encouraged learned men to come and settle down in Sri Lanka and also induced his courtiers to engage in literary pursuits
These activities suffered temporarily with his death in but were revived after the accession of Paraakramabaahu the Great in
King Paraakramabaahu the Great ascended the throne after a great struggle with rival claimants and even after his accession he had to suppress many rebellions
Being a great leader of men he was able to restore order and even carry his prowess as a conqueror to foreign lands including South India and Burma
He rebuilt the city of Polonnaruwa
King Paraakramabaahu also undertook the restoration of the ancient capital city of Anuraadhapura which had been neglected and abandoned after the Cholas had captured and devastated it about a century and a half earlier
The four great thuupas were overgrown with trees and bears and panthers dwelt there
The king restored all the important monuments at Anuraadhapura and the entire Mihintale monastery
But the most important task which the king performed for the establishment of the Saasana was its purification and the unification of the Sangha
In spite of the activities of King Vijayabaahu I there were by this time members of Sangha who were unfit to lead the monastic life
Some of the monks are said to have even supported wives and children
With a learned thera named Mahaa Kassapa of Udumbaragiri Vihaara at its head the king convened a Council of the leading monks of the dissentient schools and was convinced that the teachings of the Mahaavihaara were correct and their claims were in keeping with the Dhamma
Consequently with great care and patience the king made investigations into the members of the schismatic schools
Many of the unworthy monks were persuaded to leave the Order and those who were not open to persuasion were expelled
Some monks were made to return to the status of novices
After that the three fraternities of the Mahaavihaara the Abhayagirivihaara and the Jetavanavihaara remained united
Subsequent to this purification of the Sangha the king with the assistance of the leading monks proclaimed a code of regulations for the guidance of the bhikkhus
After the proclamation of that code the internal discipline of the Sangha was in the hands of the monks themselves and the king acted only when a necessity arose
The code of regulations enforced by King Paraakramabaahu became a royal proclamation
It gave directions for the proper observance of the Vinaya rules and dealt with the procedure that should be followed by his subjects who had become or who wished to become lay pupils novices and subsequently ordained monks
The king also caused this proclamation to be engraved on the rock surface of the Uttaraaraama presently known as Galvihaara which exists to this day
It is now known as Polonnarukatikaavata or the Paraakramabaahukatikaavata
The great interest taken by the king in the affairs of the religion coupled with internal peace and prosperity brought about a revival of Buddhist learning which created a rich literature during this period
It has been mentioned earlier that Buddhaghosa Thera compiled the Pali commentaries to many of the texts of the Tipitaka in the early part of the fifth century
Buddhaghosa was however not able to compile commentaries to all the books of the Tipitaka due perhaps to the fact that the illness of his teacher Revata in India caused him to leave Sri Lanka before he finished the entire work
Fortunately there were several other scholars who took up the work left undone by Buddhaghosa and in the succeeding years they compiled commentaries to the rest of the texts of the Pali Canon
Thus the commentator Dhammapaala Thera compiled the commentaries to the Udaana Itivuttaka Vimaanavatthu Petavatthu Theragaathaa Theriigaathaa and Cariyaapitaka of the Khuddaka Nikaaya all these commentaries are known by the name Paramatthadiipanii Upasena Thera compiled the Saddhammappajjotikaa on the Niddesa
Mahaanama Thera compiled the Saddhammappakaasinii on the Patisambhidaamagga and Buddhadatta Thera compiled the Madhuratthavilaasinii on the Buddhavamsa
The author of the Visuddhajanavilaasinii which is the commentary on the Apadaana is not known
Of these commentators Buddhadatta was a contemporary of Buddhaghosa Upasena and Mahaanaama flourished about the latter part of the sixth century and Dhammapaala about the latter part of the tenth century
The political disturbances from the time of King Dhaatusena until the reign of Vijayabaahu I greatly hampered literary activities and as a result only a few religious works were composed during this period
About the end of the tenth century a thera named Khema wrote an expository work on the Abhidhamma called the Paramatthadiipanii
To the same period belongs also the Pali Mahaabodhivamsa which gives primarily the history of the Sacred Bodhi Tree at Anuraadhapura and the ceremonies connected with it
A poem entitled Anaagatavamsa on the future Buddha Metteyya is also ascribed to this period
To the tenth or the early part of the eleventh century belongs a Pali poem of stanzas called the Telakañaahagaathaa in the form of religious exhortations of a great elder named Kalyaaniya Thera who was condemned to be cast into a cauldron of boiling oil
King Vijayabaahu I in whose reign occurred a great intellectual reawakening was himself a great patron of literature and a scholar of high repute
Many Sinhalese works including a Sinhalese translation of the Dhammasanganii are attributed to him but not one of them exists today
About this time a monk named Anuruddha composed the Anuruddhasataka the Abhidhammatthasangaha the Naamaruupapariccheda and the Paramatthavinicchaya
The first is a Buddhist devotional poem of stanzas in elegant Sanskrit
The second work is a compendium on the teachings of the Abhidhamma and is held in high esteem by all Buddhists of the southern school
The third and fourth are two short works in verse on the Abhidhamma giving the reader a general idea of the subjects dealt with in the Abhidhamma Pitaka
The reign of King Paraakramabaahu the Great ushered in another great epoch of literary activity
Three great scholarly monks flourished in his reign namely Mahaa Kassapa of Dimbulaagala Vihaara Moggallaana Thera and Saariputta Thera
Mahaa Kassapa was the author of a Sinhalese paraphrase to the Samantapaasaadikaa which is now lost
He is also reputed to have written a subcommentary to the Abhidhammatthasangaha
It is probable that he was also the author of several other works such as the Mohavicchedanii which is a treatise on the Abhidhamma and Vimativinodanii which is a commentary on the Vinaya
Moggallaana a contemporary of Mahaa Kassapa was the author of the Pali grammar Moggallaana Vyaakarana
He is also credited with the authorship of the Abhidhaanappadiipikaa which is the only ancient Pali dictionary in Sri Lanka
Saariputta was the most prominent scholar of the reign of Paraakramabaahu the Great
A clever Sanskrit scholar as he was Saariputta compiled two works on Sanskrit grammar
Another work by him the Vinayasangaha was a summary of the Vinaya Pitaka
This work was known by several titles and was widely known in Burma
On this work Saariputta himself wrote a subcommentary and a Sinhalese paraphrase
The most comprehensive and therefore important work of Saariputta is the masterly subcommentary called the Saaratthadiipanii which he composed on Buddhaghosa's commentary on the Vinaya the Samantapaasaadikaa
The immense and valuable information it contains shows that his knowledge was extensive and profound even as that of the great commentator Buddhaghosa
He further wrote a Sinhalese paraphrase to the Abhidhammatthasangaha of Anuruddha Thera and this paraphrase is still held in high esteem by modern scholars
Saariputta is also credited with the authorship of two other ñiikaas the Saratthamañjuusaa on the Manorathapuuranii and the Liinatthappakaasinii on the Papañcasuudanii which are commentaries on the Anguttara and Majjhima Nikaayas respectively by Buddhaghosa
To this period also belong the ñiikaas on the other three Nikaayas of the Sutta Pitaka collectively known as the Saratthamañjuusaañiikaa
It should be mentioned here that the ñiikaas named above formed one of the major groups of Pali literature compiled during this period
As described in the Saddhammasangaha a Pali work of the th century Mahaa Kassapa and a large congregation of monks who assembled at the Jetavana Vihaara at Polonnaruwa decided to compose exegetical commentaries since the existing subcommentaries on the old Atthakathaas were unintelligible
Acting on this decision they compiled ñiikaas namely the Saaratthadiipanii on the Vinaya Pitaka the Saratthamañjuusaa in four parts on the first four Nikaayas of the Sutta Pitaka and the Paramatthadiipanii in three parts on the Abhidhamma Pitaka
These ñiikaas or subcommentaries were works containing expositions of points in the Atthakathaas compiled by Buddhaghosa and other commentators which needed further elucidation for their correct interpretation
There were ñiikaas compiled from time to time subsequent to the compilation of the commentaries and what the council headed by Mahaa Kassapa performed was the bringing of these various ñiikaas together and making a synthetic summary of them
Though the Saddhammasangaha does not give any prominence to the part played by Saariputta at this council it is well known that several ñiikaas were compiled either by him or under his supervision
Several religious works written in Sinhalese also belong to this period
The Sinhalese exegetical works on which the Pali commentaries were based were preserved in the Mahaavihaara as late as the tenth century
Likewise there were the collections of Jaataka stories and the stories connected with the verses of the Dhammapada in the Sinhalese language
A collection of stories from which the Pali Rasavaahinii drew material and a work called the Siihalaññhakathaa Mahaavamsa on which the Pali chronicles were based also existed in Sinhalese
None of these works is now extant
Several Sinhalese religioliterary works which were composed in or about the twelfth century are popular even today
Among them are the Sasadaavata which is a poem on the Sasa Jaataka the Muvadevdaavata which is a poem on the Makhaadeva Jaataka and the Kavsilumina which is a poem on Kusa Jaataka
Gurulugomi's Amaavatura and Dharmapradiipikaava and Vidyaacakravarti's Butsarana are also generally ascribed to the twelfth century
After the death of Paraakramabaahu the Great there was much internal disturbance in the country caused by rival claimants to the throne and invasions by foreigners
As a result Buddhism was on the decline again
Paraakramabaahu's immediate successor Vijayabaahu II promoted trade and religious relations between Burma and Sri Lanka but was slain after a year's rule by a usurper
The usurper was however slain five days later by Nissankamalla who thereafter reigned for nine years
Nissankamalla was a great benefactor of Buddhism
He built several notable religious edifices in Polonnaruwa his capital
Some of these like the Ruvanvelidaagaba the beautiful Vatadaage the Sacred Tooth Relic Temple and the Nissankalataamandapa exist to this day
He made occasional tours in his kingdom visiting places of religious significance like the Sumanakuuta and the Dambuluvihaara
He built almshouses at several important places and purified the Saasana by expelling corrupt bhikkhus from the Order
The period of two decades that followed the death of King Nissankamalla was one of the most disturbed periods in Sri Lanka during which time occurred several assassinations of rulers and invasions by foreigners
In a foreigner named Megha invaded defeated the Sinhalese ruler and reigned for years
His reign was one of the most disastrous for Buddhism for he plundered the monasteries and made them over to his soldiers to dwell in
The people were persecuted by torture and were forced to adopt a different faith
He also destroyed libraries containing many valuable books
The situation was temporarily saved by Paraakramabaahu II who ruled from Dambadeniya from while Maagha was still dominating north Lanka
Paraakramabaahu II who was a ruler of great learning earned for himself the title Kalikaala Sahitya Sarvajña Pandita
He made efforts to restore the Saasana by bringing over monks from the Chola country in South India and holding a festival to admit monks to the higher ordination
He established several monasteries and pirivenas and encouraged learning
The king also held a great council of monks under the leadership of the great thera Aranyaka Medhankara and purified the Saasana
Subsequently like Paraakramabaahu I he formulated rules for the proper conduct of the monks the code of these rules being known by the name Dambadeni Katikaavata
At Palaabatgala he constructed a great monastery for the hermitmonks who were full of virtue and were able to undergo strict austerities
Two succeeding kings Vijayabaahu IV and Paraakramabaahu III took much interest in maintaining Buddhism and consolidating the efforts of their predecessor
The religious revival brought about by Paraakramabaahu II continued until about the fifteenth century though there was not much political stability in the country during that period
The outstanding feature of the period is the compilation of a large number of religioliterary works
Paraakramabaahu II himself obtained teachers from India to teach Lankan monks
He persuaded his younger brother Bhuvanekabaahu to become a scholar and be a teacher to many thousands of elders
The king's minister Devapatiraaja was a great patron of learning
To Paraakramabaahu II is ascribed the authorship of the Sinhalese translations to the Visuddhimagga and the Vinaya Vinicchaya the Sinhalese poem Kavsilumina the masterpiece of Sinhalese poetry based on the Kusa Jaataka and the Sinhalese prose work Daladaasirita
In the reign of Paraakramabaahu II lived the thera Dharmakirti who was the author of the Pali poem Daathaavamsa and the first part of the Cuutavamsa
The Thuupavamsa on the erection of stuupas in Lanka the Hatthavanagallavihaaravamsa on the history of the ancient vihaara at Attanagalla the Rasavaahinii which is a collection of stories about ancient India and Sri Lanka the Samantakuutavannanaa on the Buddha's visit to Sumanakuuta the Kesadhaatuvamsa on the history of the hairrelics of the Buddha the Paaramimahaasataka on the ten perfections the SaddhammaSangha which gives an account of the history and development of Buddhism in Lanka are several of the religious works of merit composed in Pali from the time of Paraakramabaahu II until the fifteenth century
A large number of Sinhalese works on religious subjects too belongs to this period
The Saddharmaratnaavalii which narrates the stories of the Pali Dhammapadatthakathaa in Sinhalese the Puujavalii which relates the honor and offerings received by the Buddha the Pansiyapanasjaataka based on the Pali Jaataka commentary the Sinhala Bodhivamsa on the history of the Bodhi Tree the EluAttanagaluvamsa which is a translation of the Pali work the Saddharmaalankaara based on the Pali Rasavaahinii the Guttilakaavyaya based on the Guttila Jaataka the Kaavyasekharaya based on the Sattubhatta Jaataka the Budugunaalankaaraya which narrates the dispelling of the calamity in Vesaali by the Buddha and the Lovedasangaraava containing religious instructions for the laity are the standard works among them
As a result of this religious revival the reputation of the Sangha in Sri Lanka became so well established that in the year King Dhammaceti of Burma decided to send twentytwo selected bhikkhus to Lanka to obtain ordination and bring back to Burma the traditions of Lanka
He sent these bhikkhus with numerous presents in charge of two ministers Citraduuta and Raamaduuta
They came in two ships
The first ship with eleven bhikkhus and their attendants in charge of the minister Citraduuta arrived in Colombo and the other ship in charge of Raamaduuta with eleven bhikkhus and attendants arrived at Weligama on the southern coast of Lanka
These deputations were received with due ceremony and given a cordial reception by King Buvanekabaahu VI who reigned at Kotte six miles from Colombo
The king of Burma sent the following message to the chief theras of Lanka My Lords I am sending many articles to be offered to the Sacred Tooth Relic etc
and I request you to make an endeavor to offer these to the Sacred Tooth Relic
May the noble ones obtain facilities for the twentytwo bhikkhus and their pupils and the two ministers Citraduuta and Raamaduuta who are attending on these bhikkhus to assist them in worshiping honoring and viewing the Sacred Tooth Relic if they are so fortunate as to get an opportunity to do so after which may the Noble Ones be pleased with their endeavor to enable the twentytwo bhikkhus and their pupils to be ordained in the community of succession from Mahaavihaara fraternity founded by the great thera Mahinda by selecting such bhikkhus who hold an established high reputation and giving the ordination of Upasampadaa in the Siimaa in the river Kalyaani which has been made sacred by its association with our Great Lord
The request made by the king of Burma was duly granted the bhikkhus were ordained in the Siimaa in the Kalyaani River
The minister Raamaduuta with twenty bhikkhus and thirtythree pupils duly ordained returned to Burma
The other minister Citraduuta and his party of bhikkhus were shipwrecked and six of these bhikkhus met with their death
The remaining ones reached their country
In Burma King Dhammaceti built an ordination hall known as Kalyaani Siimaa and the bhikkhus ordained there went by the name of Kalyaanivamsa
At a later period ordination of this Nikaaya was carried to Siam from Burma
The connection with Burma at this period has an important bearing on the fortunes of Buddhism in Sri Lanka for through these embassies the books that existed in Lanka were taken to Burma Siam and Cambodia and the Mahaavihaara Nikaaya was established in these countries
This helped Lanka to reobtain the books and the ordination at a subsequent period when ordination had disappeared in the island and the books were lost
The political stability that was maintained by Paraakramabaahu II and his successors until about the fifteenth century began to weaken by the end of that century
At this time the Sinhalese king who ruled at Kotte was the head of a very small territory
The interior regions of the country were in the hands of several petty chiefs who did not care about the religion or the welfare of the people
The Moors on the other hand controlled the trade of the coastal regions
Economically too the country had sunk to such a very low level that by this time Sri Lanka had become dependent on India even for food
Such was the condition when the Portuguese who were engaged in discoveries and conquests in the East and were in pursuit of Eastern trade landed in Lanka in when Vira Paraakramabaahu VIII was ruling at Kotte
The Portuguese promised him military aid against his rivals and great riches from the trade which they proposed to establish
They then gained a foothold in Lanka by erecting a fortress on the rocky beach in Colombo and establishing many trading settlements
Before long the entire coastal region passed into the hands of the Portuguese and the kings of Kotte were entirely at the mercy of their allies
They even made several assaults on the interior of the country in order to become masters of the whole island
The Portuguese arrived in Colombo in and gradually occupying all maritime provinces remained in their possession up to
The Lanka chronicles as well as the records of their friendly historians describe them as cruel inhuman rapacious bigoted and savage persecutors of Buddhism in their endeavor to impose their own faith  Roman Catholicism  on the people of Sri Lanka
A few decades after the arrival of the Portuguese King Bhuvanekabaahu VI who ruled at Kotte sought the assistance of his allies the Portuguese to ensure the succession of his grandson Dharmapaala to the throne
For this purpose an ivory image of Dharmapaala was sent to Portugal where a coronation of the effigy was held by the Portuguese emperor
When the Sinhalese ambassadors returned they were accompanied by a party of Franciscans who under the direction of the Portuguese emperor and with the permission of the king of Kotte preached the Christian Gospel in Lanka
Thus for the first time Christian communities were organized in the maritime provinces of Lanka
Dharmapaala who had become a baptized Christian under the name of Don Juan Dharmapaala as an expression of thankfulness to the Portuguese gave them a deed of gift after his accession transferring to them the Daladaa Maaligaawa the temple at Kelaniya and all the temple revenues in the island for the maintenance of the missionary establishments
Thus there was the necessary assistance given to the Portuguese by the rulers of Kotte to suppress the national religion of the Sinhalese and propagate their own religion  Catholicism
With this support they set about their task
In their conversions they adopted two distinct methods namely inducement by offices and other temporal favors and brutal punishment where inducement failed
People who wished to obtain high offices under them and who wished to earn the goodwill of those in power readily adopted the new faith and took up new Biblical names
Others who hesitated to give up their national faith and showed resistance were brutally punished
There are lurid accounts of men thrown into rivers to be eaten by crocodiles babies spitted on the soldiers' pikes and held up before the parents or crushed between millstones before the eyes of their mothers who later were to be tortured to death
Those who dared to worship in public or wear the yellow robe were put to death
Buddhist monasteries and institutions were destroyed and their treasures looted
Libraries were set on fire
Thus did the period of Portuguese rule become one of the darkest periods of Buddhism in Sri Lanka
The Portuguese were not the only enemies of Buddhism at this period
King Raajasinha I who was the son of Mayaadunne a brother of Bhuvenekabaahu VI ruled from Sitawaka when the Portuguese were holding power at Kotte
A gallant leader as he was Raajasinha succeeded in gaining the confidence of the Sinhalese who opposed the Portuguese rule and winning several battles against the Portuguese the battle at Mulleriyaawa being the most famous
But as the chronicles mention his popularity was shortlived
The foolish king in his thirst for power slew his old father with his own hands
Later being seized with the fear of his crime Raajasinha sought the advice of the monks for setting himself free from the sin
When the monks explained to him that it was too great a crime to be absolved the king was provoked to anger
He then became a follower of the Saivites in whose advice he took refuge and became an enemy of Buddhism
The chief Buddhist elder was stoned to death and many other monks were buried neckdeep in the earth and their heads plowed off
Some others were put to the sword
The sacred edifices and the monasteries were pulled down and the sacred books were reduced to ashes
The lands which had been endowed in earlier times to the monastic establishments were taken away and Sri Paada the Sacred Footprint of the Buddha on Adam's Peak was handed over to the Saivites
Those monks who managed to escape from the king's wrath disrobed themselves and fled
In the year in which Raajasinha died a Sinhalese ruler Vimala Dharmasuriya I ascended the throne of the hill capital Kandy and ruled for twelve years
Though he had been educated by the Portuguese and was originally favored by them the king soon after his accession turned against them out of his love for the country and the religion
Vimala Dharmasuriya I was a great patron of Buddhism of that time
After his wars with the Portuguese he set his heart on repairing the damage done by Raajasinha
Several Buddhist monuments were restored
Finding that there was hardly a single monk left in the country who was properly ordained Vimala Dharmasuriya sent an embassy to the country of Arakan to obtain monks to restore ordination in Sri Lanka
The mission was successful several monks led by the elders Nandicakka and Candavisaala came to Kandy and in the year an ordination ceremony was held in the Udakukkhepa Siimaa at Getambe near Kandy many men of noble families entering the Order on this occasion
The king also built a storeyed pavilion and bringing back the Sacred Tooth Relic from the Delgamuvihaara where it was hidden deposited it in the pavilion
The control of Sri Paada was taken from the Saivites and handed over to the Buddhist monks
Vimala Dharmasuriya was succeeded on the throne of Kandy by Senarat a man zealous in religious works
In his reign the Portuguese invaded Kandy and the king carried away the Sacred Tooth Relic to Mahiyangana for safety
Senarat's son and successor Raajasinha II was a great warrior but was not zealous
In his reign ended the Portuguese rule in the maritime provinces of Lanka a feat which the king accomplished with the aid of the Dutch in June
It was as early as that the Dutch visited the court of Kandy in the reign of Vimala Dharmasuriya I seeking an alliance
In a treaty was agreed upon between the Dutch and King Senarat the then king of Kandy and in accordance with this agreement in Raajasinha II sought Dutch assistance against the Portuguese
From that time the two European nations fought each other until in the Portuguese were expelled from the country and the Dutch came to occupy those regions which formerly were occupied by the Portuguese
They remained in possession until in which year they were ousted by the British
The Dutch whose religion was Protestant Christianity followed a policy which was in marked contrast to that of the Portuguese
Extension of commerce was their main concern and since peace was essential to achieve this end they even endured with subdued humbleness and patience whatever insult and provocation came from the Sinhalese
They even assisted the Sinhalese in two embassies to Siam which were sent to obtain monks to establish higher ordination in Sri Lanka
The Dutch however had an established system of education throughout their territories
The school building was both church and school the schoolmaster was both teacher and representative of the religion
Services were held regularly at these places births and marriages were registered according to Christian rites
When the agent of the Church was so disposed he was able to get those who did not attend church punished for the alleged offense
All civil rights and inheritance depended on a person's church affiliation
No person who was not a Christian could hold even a minor office under government no person who was not a Christian could get married legally or register the birth of a child
There was however one redeeming feature of this system
The organization was so extensive that they had to employ Sinhalese as their teachers and agents of religion
The vast majority of these Protestant agents were at heart Buddhists they were Christians only in the sense of their office
The people themselves followed this plan they were Buddhists inwardly but were officially Christians for the purpose of registering their marriages the births of their children for holding office etc
Thus the efforts of the Dutch in the propagation of their religion did not affect Buddhism much
On the other hand the Portuguese where they had priests and where they had established churches under the direct control of these priests were able to look after the congregations and gradually established their religion in such centers
Most of them were zealous and earnest in their duties and took a genuine interest in the welfare of their flocks
When the Dutch were occupying the maritime provinces several Sinhalese rulers of the Kandyan kingdom made attempts to restore Buddhism
One of them was Vimala Dharmasuriya II son and successor of Raajasinha He constructed a threestoreyed pavilion for the Sacred Tooth Relic
The king also made a pilgrimage to Sumanakuuta on foot
Seeing that the state of the Order of monks was unsatisfactory again to such an extent that not more than five ordained monks were found in the whole country the king sent an embassy to Arakan and obtained monks for an ordination ceremony
With the help of these monks an ordination ceremony was held at Getambe at the place where a similar ceremony had been held formerly in the reign of Vimala Dharmasuriya At this ceremony thirtythree novices were given higher ordination and another one hundred and twenty persons were admitted to the Order
Vimala Dharmasuriya II was succeeded by his son Sri Viraparaakrama Narendrasinha a just ruler mindful of the welfare of the religion
He constructed a twostoreyed building for the Sacred Tooth Relic provided the monks with their requisites and induced several members of the laity to enter the Order
However during his reign many a monk had resorted to scandalous practices
His successor Sri Vijaya Raajasinha also a pious ruler induced many a young person to join the Order and also held several religious festivals
He spent money on getting religious books written caused preaching halls to be constructed at several places and took measures to educate the people in the doctrine
Discovering that the Order of the Sangha was almost extinct in the island he sent two missions to Siam with the help of the Dutch who lent a ship for the voyage
The first expedition proved disastrous due to shipwreck and before the second mission returned the king died
Thus his attempt to restore higher ordination failed
Sri Vijaya Raajasinha was succeeded by King Kirti Sri Raajasinha whose reign proved to be one of the most inspiring periods for Buddhism in that century
At the time of his accession the Order of monks had sunk to very low levels of degeneracy
There was not a single monk in the whole island who had received the higher ordination
There were plenty of novices but apart from a few skillful and pious ones among them the majority were leading a life unbecoming to monks
They set aside the study of Dhamma and Vinaya and resorted to the study of astrology medicine and devil worship led scandalous lives and engaged in cultivation of land and in trade
The older saamaneras ordained only the sons of their relatives so that they could obtain the immense wealth which the generations of kings and ministers had dedicated to the service of the Order
Kirti Sri Raajasinha was determined to set right this state of affairs
With the aid of the Dutch who gave a vessel for the voyage the king sent an embassy to King Dhammika of Siam and reestablished the higher ordination in Sri Lanka
Several hundreds were ordained and education was fostered
The king also proclaimed a code of conduct for the guidance of the monks
In all these religious activities of King Kirti Sri Raajasinha he was inspired and guided by a great personality a saamanera who was distinguished for his piety enthusiasm learning and determination
He was Velivita Pindapaatika Sri Saranankara
Born in at Velivita a village near Kandy he became a novice at the age of sixteen as a pupil of an elder saamanera called Suuriyagoda
With great effort and devotion he studied the Pali language and the doctrine for which purpose he traveled from place to place in search of books and tutors
Later he went about preaching the Dhamma thus encouraging others to rise up for the welfare of the religion
These activities of Saranankara Saamanera soon made him popular as a teacher of great renown who devoted his life to his own welfare and that of others a poet preacher and controversialist
Apart from his skill as a scholar he was also known for his austere practices
When he went round the country learning or preaching he depended for his sustenance on the ancient practice of a bhikkhu called pinnapaata gathering his food from house to house in his almsbowl
For this he became known as Pindapaatika Saranankara
When King Vimala Dharmasuriya II reigned he was a saamanera but his sincere devotion had pleased the king so much that he made a gilt casket set with seven hundred gems and presented it to Saranankara Saamanera with many books
This king also provided the monk with the requisites and induced him to write several literary works
When King Sri Vijaya Raajasinha came to the throne it was at the request of Saranankara Saamanera that the king sent two embassies to Siam
In the reign of King Kirti Sri Raajasinha Saranankara Saamanera offered his fullest cooperation in his activities in the revival of Buddhism and the king depended upon the saamanera for guidance advice and inspiration
He urged the king to send the embassy to Siam and himself wrote the messages that were taken to the Siamese king and the Sangharaaja of that country
The king's ministers who constituted the embassy were chosen on his advice and this mission was successful mainly due to his exertions
After the return of the embassy Saranankara Saamanera was given higher ordination and was appointed Sangharaaja of Sri Lanka the highest office conferred on a monk
The activities of Saranankara Thera not only restored the higher ordination and the purity of the Sangha but also brought about a literary revival as a result of the impetus given by him to the study of the Pali language and the Buddha's teachings
Saranankara Thera himself compiled several important religious works such as the Munigunaalankaara a Sinhalese poem in praise of the Buddha the Saaraartha Sangraha a treatise on various doctrinal teachings in Buddhism
Abhisambodhialankaara a Pali poem in a hundred stanzas on the life of the Buddha from the time of Dipankara up to his enlightenment the Madhuraartha Prakaasanii which is a Sinhalese commentarial paraphrase to the Pali Mahaabodhivamsa and the Ruupamaalaa a work on Pali grammar
Several others who were pupils of Saranankara Thera also composed many literary works
The great monk died in ac
at the age of
The successors of Sri Saranankara Thera are known as belonging to the Syaamopaali Nikaaya now popularly called the Siyam Nikaaya
Only those who belonged to what was regarded as the highest caste could obtain higher ordination in that Nikaaya
In the year a saamanera named Ambagahapitiya aanavimalatissa who did not belong to that caste went to Amarapura in Burma to obtain higher ordination and on his return he established the Amarapura Nikaaya in
Subsequently in Ambagahawatte Sri Saranankara Thera established the Raamañña Nikaaya
These three Nikaayas exist up to this day with no doctrinal differences between them
King Kirti Sri Raajasinha whose reign as was seen above was one of the most fruitful for the cause of Buddhism was succeeded by his brother Raajaadhi Raajasinha
A scholar of Pali Sanskrit and Sinhalese as he was the king himself composed the beautiful Sinhalese poem Asadisadaakava and worked for the religion by taking necessary steps to preserve the purity of the Saasana
His nephew Sri Vikrama Raajasinha was the next and last king of Lanka
This ruler who was in constant fear of the intrigues of his Adigar Pilima Talawe and his allies had recourse to intoxicating drinks hoping thus to forget his sorrows and tortured all his enemies with appalling cruelty
There was general unrest in the kingdom and these conditions were evidently not conducive to the progress of Buddhism
It was in during the reign of Raajaadhi Raajasinha that the Dutch who were defeated in battle surrendered their territories to the British colony and Sir Frederick North was sent as the first British governor
Before long North realized that the opportunity would come soon for them to possess the whole island for Pilima Talawe the Adigar of King Sri Vikrama Raajasinha of Kandy disclosed his plans to ruin the king to the British governor himself
However this plan of Pilima Talawe was revealed to the king and the Adigar was beheaded in
Ehelepola who became the next Adigar was detected in an attempt to organize a general rebellion against the king and as punishment the king tortured his wife and children cruelly
Subsequently the king punished all whom he suspected and as a result unrest and disorder became the order of the day
In these circumstances Ehelepola appealed to the British for help
In January a British army marched to the capital city of Kandy and took the Sinhalese king captive
On the nd of March at a solemn assembly of the Kandyan chiefs and the monks the king was deposed and his dominions were vested in the British Crown
Thus ended the glamour of the Kingdom of Kandy which had withstood the invasions and attacks of the Portuguese and the Dutch and for some time the English
Thus ended too the line of the Buddhist kings of Lanka who for years from the accession of Vijaya in BCE brought glory and fame to their country and religion
It was seen in the previous chapter how the British occupied the lowcountry of Lanka in and the Kandyan territories in
These territories remained in their hands until in which year Sri Lanka regained her independence
Mention has already been made of the solemn assembly of the nd of March held in Kandy
At this assembly a treaty was signed between the British rulers and the Kandyan chiefs by which the chiefs handed over the country to the British and the British promised to safeguard Buddhism declaring its rites and ceremonies sacred and inviolate
The inclusion of this clause referring to Buddhism in the very treaty by which the chiefs handed over the country to the British is very significant
On the one hand it indicates how concerned the Sinhalese leaders were about the future of Buddhism even in the hour of their misfortune
On the other hand the British had obviously considered that its omission would bring disastrous results
However the British attitude towards Buddhism soon caused dissatisfaction among the Sinhalese chiefs
The chiefs and the Buddhist monks realized that the British had no desire to respect the clause of the treaty relating to Buddhism and that they were keen to convert the people to their own faith
During the early years after the signing of the treaty the British governor took part in the annual ceremonies connected with the Sacred Tooth Relic and appointed the chief theras as had been done by the Sinhalese kings in former times
This created resentment on the part of the Christian missionaries in Sri Lanka and the Christian authorities in England and soon both practices were dropped severing whatever connection they had with Buddhism
From the bhikkhus were required to elect and appoint their own chiefs and in the British government handed over the Tooth Relic from their custody to the Diyawadana Nilame and the chief monks of the Malwatte and the Asgiriya monasteries
While thus violating the treaty of the British rulers even prohibited the Buddhists from enjoying some of the privileges that were granted to the followers of the Christian faith
Thus for instance even as late as no child could be legally registered without previous baptism by a Christian minister and the clergy did not solemnize the marriage of unbaptized individuals
Further only those who adopted the Christian faith were favored with government employment
This attitude of the British made vast numbers of Buddhists adopt the new faith without any understanding of its teachings
These people saw in Christianity not only happiness in the world which is to come but what was more important to them the promise of this life as well
Some of the British governors in their attempt to disrupt the Buddhist organization even tried to bring about disunity between the monks and the laity and also to win over some of the leading Buddhist monks to their side
For they realized that the monks were the main obstacle to their conversions and that as long as the monks and the laity remained united their attempts would not meet with great success
Lastly the British rulers gave all possible support to the Christian missionaries to carry out their educational and missionary activities
How these missionary bodies attempted the Christianization of Lanka will be discussed in the next chapter
From the beginning of the period of British rule several Christian missionary bodies engaged themselves actively in missionary activities in Sri Lanka
The Baptists had already started their activities in
They were followed by the Wesleyan Methodists in the Americans in and the Church of England in
These missionary bodies received every encouragement and assistance from the government
The establishment of missionary schools in various parts of the island was one of the principal undertakings of these missionary bodies
These schools were manned and managed by the missionary societies with the assistance of the British government and were partly financed by public funds
The schools attracted large numbers of Buddhist children because they were the centers where young men were trained for high government offices
Hitherto the temple had been the village school and the monks were the instructors of the village children in secular learning as well as in spiritual wisdom
But under the British government temple education could not provide the learning necessary for government employment
Thus the Buddhist parents who wished to see their children in high government offices willingly sent them to the new missionary schools
In these schools the children were molded according to the requirements of the missionary bodies
The authorities did not insist that one should become a Christian before admission but each student was required to learn the Christian religion and to participate in the morning and evening religious services in the school
They had no opportunity of participating in their own religious observances
Almost every school had its own church
The lessons imparted to these children were arranged with a view to undermining their Buddhist religion
The teaching of the Buddha was criticized and condemned and the Buddhist practices were ridiculed
Buddhism was held up as a religion of the vulgar masses as opposed to the Christianity of civilized people
This disparagement in course of time naturally had its expected result
People gradually began to give up their national faith for the new faith which they were trained to think of as more refined and cultured
It now became the fashion to adopt the Christian faith and Christian names and customs
Even those who did not embrace Christianity became indifferent to their own religion
When they grew up they did not even mind their conversion to any religion
The missionaries also did not neglect the education of the girls
Convents were opened up with boarding facilities and in them the girls were brought up and educated with the utmost care until they were married in due time with the sanction of the Christian guardians
The following table enumerating the assisted schools in Sri Lanka in belonging to the different denominations shows the extent of missionary activities in Lanka in the sphere of education
NUMBER OF ASSISTED SCHOOLS IN 
Apart from the Christianization carried out through schools these missionary bodies sought conversion by distributing books and pamphlets which criticized and ridiculed the Buddhist religion and sang the praises of Christianity
For this purpose the missionaries themselves studied the doctrines of Buddhism and the Buddhist literature and also the Sinhalese language thus enabling them to write tracts in Sinhalese attacking the Buddhist religion and extolling the virtues of Christianity
Christian preachers went about from village to village distributing these books and pamphlets and denouncing Buddhism and exhibiting the supremacy and the divine origin of Christianity
When the Christian missionaries were thus active in towns and villages propagating their gospel and converting the Buddhists to their faith the Buddhist monks were not able enough to offer much resistance
When the villagers assembled in the temple on Poya days they attempted to refute the arguments of the Christian preachers in the course of their sermons but this method was not very effective
It was at this time about that a young Buddhist saamanera named Mohottiwatte Gunaananda appeared on the scene and challenged the Christian missionaries to meet him in opendebate
This young novice had obtained his early education in Christian schools and had thus studied the Christian scriptures and was also well versed in the Buddha's teachings
He went from village to village making public speeches and held meetings in several Christian strongholds often challenging the Christian clergy to face him in open debate
Soon he earned a great reputation for his eloquence and people flocked in thousands to hear him
The Christian clergy at first took no notice of the challenge of this monk but later quite confident of their success they accepted the challenge
This resulted in three public controversies one at Udanvita in another at Gampola in and the last at Panadura in
The Panadura controversy which lasted for a week was the most important of them all
It was the culmination of his efforts and it led to a Buddhist reawakening
The controversy was to take place in the presence of leading Sinhalese Christians and Buddhists
Rules were laid down so that the meeting could be held in a fair manner
The leading English newspaper of the time The Ceylon Times sent a special representative to report the proceedings
A complete report of all the speeches corrected by the speakers themselves was published in English day by day
The controversy ended with victory for the Buddhists
The Buddhist orator not only replied effectively to the fallacies of the Christian speakers but also enlightened them on the principles and tenets of the Buddhist doctrine
When the Christians retired from the debate defeated the Buddhists were overjoyed
Festivities were held in every temple to mark their triumph and the effigy of Gunaananda Thera was carried in procession in every village
The triumph of the Buddhists over their Christian adversaries at the Panadura controversy flushed into their veins vigor and enthusiasm to work for the recovery of their lost glory
An American scholar named Dr
Peebles who happened to be in Sri Lanka on a visit about the time of this Panadura controversy was so impressed with it that he published its proceedings in book form on his return to America
The attention of Colonel Henry Steele Olcott was first drawn towards Buddhism by this report of the controversy which he happened to read in a public library in America
Olcott was an American by birth who had spent his early life as a very successful farmer and a colonel of both the army and the navy
At an early age of years in he gave up all worldly fortunes and together with Madame Blavatsky formed the Theosophical Society for the quest of truth in all religions
Having read the reports of the Panadura controversy he realized the importance of the teachings of the Buddha and in he came over to Lanka along with Madame Blavatsky to gain a firsthand knowledge of Buddhism
When his studies soon convinced him of the teachings of the Buddha he embraced Buddhism and worked for the upliftment of the Buddhists in Lanka
Olcott showed the Buddhist leaders of Sri Lanka that if Buddhism was to raise its head against the Christian missionary activities they should open up Buddhist schools to educate their children
Under his guidance and leadership and with the support of all the leading Buddhist monks the lay Buddhist leaders in Sri Lanka at that time founded the Buddhist Theosophical Society on th June
The primary objects of the society were the establishment of Buddhist schools and the bringing together of Buddhist workers in a cooperative body without distinction of caste or position for the purpose of promoting the welfare of the Buddhists of Lanka
At the time of Olcott's arrival there were only three Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka which obtained government grants one at Dodanduwa another at Panadura and the third at Bandaragama
In twelve years after the establishment of the society there were boys' schools girls' schools and mixed schools founded by the society
In there were schools under the management of the society with an attendance of about children
In the number of schools had risen to
Olcott and his supporters went from village to village appealing to the people to donate subscriptions for the maintenance of these schools and funds were readily forthcoming
Several leading educationists of his day made his educational plans a great success
Mention should be made among them of W
Leadbeater Bowles Daly F
Woodward A
E
Bultjens and Mrs
M
M
Higgins
Mrs
Higgins was particularly responsible for the successful education of the Buddhist girls
The leading Buddhist schools of the present day such as Ananda and Nalanda Colleges in Colombo Dharmaraja in Kandy Mahinda in Galle Dharmasoka in Ambalangoda Visakha in Bambalapitiya and Museus in Colombo are outstanding examples of the success of his efforts
Olcott pointed out to the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders of his time that they should have their own publications to give publicity to Buddhist and national opinion
For this purpose the Buddhist Theosophical Society started the Sinhalese newspaper Sarasavisandarasa in December and later its English supplement The Buddhist now a monthly of the YMBA Colombo
Colonel Olcott worked hard to win back for the Sinhalese their lost rights
It was as a result of his efforts that the Buddhists of Lanka gained freedom to hold their Buddhist processions and that the fullmoon day of Vesak was declared a public holiday
The present Buddhist flag is also a creation of Olcott which he appealed to the Buddhists to hoist on all important Buddhist occasions
His efforts also resulted in the appointment of Buddhist registrars of marriages
Of the Panadura controversy and the consequent arrival of Colonel Olcott it could justly be said that these two events jointly closed down a dark period in Lankan Buddhism and ushered in a new bright era
This noble personality who awakened the Sinhalese Buddhists and showed them the path on which they should proceed passed away in while he was in India
Apart from meeting the Christian opponents in open debate Mohottivatte Gunaananda Thera and his companions had planned other devices to counteract the antiBuddhist propaganda of the Christian missionaries and revive the Buddhist faith in the country
One of these devices was the establishment of a printing press whereby they could reply to the criticisms of the Christians and also publish books for the study of Buddhism
Thus the first press controlled by Sinhalese Buddhists was established in under the name of Lankopakaara Press
It was a donation by the king of Siam
In the same year Mohottivatte Gunaananda Thera established the Sarvajñasaasanaabhivurddhidaayaka Press at Kotahena near Colombo
Consequently the Lakrivikirana Press was established in and the Lankabhinavavisruta Press in
In the meantime learned monks of the period with the assistance of lay followers brought about a revival of Buddhist learning
Pioneers among them were the venerable Hikkaduve Sri Sumangala who founded the Vidyodaya Pirivena of Maligakanda in Colombo in and the venerable Ratmalaane Sri Dhammaaloka who founded the Vidyaalankara Pirivena of Peliyagoda in Colombo in
In these two great centers of learning a vast number of monks and lay people received education and in a short time the fame of these two pirivenas spread even in foreign countries
The scholars whom these two centers produced opened up other pirivenas in different parts of the country and also contributed to Buddhistic studies by compiling and editing numerous books
It was also about this time that devoted scholars from foreign countries who happened to be in Sri Lanka evinced a great interest in Buddhism its culture and literature and created an interest in their kinsmen in the West through their valuable treatises
Turner Tennant Childers Rhys Davids and Geiger were but a few among them
A different type of revivalistic activity was carried out by a group of lay Buddhist leaders just at this time the foremost of this group being Anagaarika Dharmapaala
The fame of this great personality lies in his successful effort of reforming the Buddhist society in Sri Lanka which had fallen into a very low moral state and also in his activities in India for the purpose of reviving Buddhism in that country and for winning back the Buddhist sacred places there for their rightful owners the Buddhists
We are presently concerned only with his social reformation in Sri Lanka
Anagaarika Dharmapaala formerly known as David Hewavitarana was born in as the eldest son of a leading businessman in Colombo who had migrated to the capital city from Matara in south Lanka
The father mother and the grandfather of the child were devoted Buddhists who were close associates of the venerable Hikkaduve Sri Sumangala Thera
At home the child was thus brought up in a Buddhist environment though he received his education in Christian schools
Those were the days when Mohottiwatte Gunaananda Thera was engaged in verbal battles against the Christian missionary activities and young Dharmapaala had not only listened to the orations of the great speaker with much inspiration but also had become a favorite of the monks by his constant visits to the temple at Kotahena
When Colonel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky arrived in Lanka in Dharmapaala then a youth of years naturally became a great favorite of the two foreigners through his association with Gunaananda Thera
The speeches and activities of Colonel Olcott greatly inspired the young enthusiast
In consequent upon a brutal assault on a Buddhist procession by a Catholic mob at Kotahena Dharmapaala left his Catholic school and in the following year became a member of the Buddhist Theosophical Society in Colombo of which his grandfather was the president
At the age of Dharmapaala obtained permission from his father to leave home and lead a celibate life as he wished to devote all his time to the welfare of the Saasana
From that time he stayed at the headquarters of the Buddhist Theosophical Society
In when Colonel Olcott returned to Sri Lanka after a short stay abroad and planned to go round the country addressing public gatherings and collecting money for the Buddhist Educational Fund Anagaarika Dharmapaala joined him as his interpreter
For this purpose he obtained leave from the Education Department where he was working as a junior clerk and subsequently vacated his post in order to dedicate all his life to the good of the religion
As the interpreter of Colonel Olcott Dharmapaala gained immense experience as a speaker
He now traveled throughout the country with or without his companion Olcott
Those were the days when the Buddhists of Lanka were reluctant to declare themselves Buddhists for Buddhism was considered to be the faith of the unurbanized masses
It was the fashion at that time to become a Christian to study English and other allied subjects to adopt a foreign name and to imitate the dress of the foreigners and their customs and manners
Buddhism and Buddhist culture were subjected to ridicule and were the heritage of villagers in the interior
Anagaarika Dharmapaala was the foremost among those who rose against this mentality of the Buddhists
Through his public speeches and numerous articles in newspapers and journals he vehemently opposed the habit of imitating foreigners in religion names and customs
He emphatically pointed out that this tendency to imitate was a clear manifestation of a lack of the primary element of selfesteem
In keeping with his preaching he himself changed his name from David to Dharmapaala
The people listened to his sermons and attentively read his articles in journals and newspapers and were convinced of the truth of his philosophy
Gradually there came about a cultural revival
The people began to take pride in their religion their language and their customs
Above all several younger men of his time joined the Buddhist forward movement to guide the destinies of future generations of Buddhists in Sri Lanka
This great personality who indefatigably gave his services for the revival of Buddhism in Lanka India and other parts of the world in his last days entered the Order as the venerable Devamitta Dhammapaala Thera
He passed away in the year while he was in India
To perpetuate his memory Sri Lanka and India celebrated his birth centenary in 
The leading men in the Buddhist community at the beginning of the twentieth century were inspired by the activities of Anagaarika Dharmapaala and they formed into organized bodies for the promotion of the Buddhist revivalistic movement
Among them were great personalities such as Sir D
B
Jayatillake FR
Somnayake Valisinha Harishchandra and WA
de Silva
To them the Buddhist revival was the national revival
These prominent men whose names have gone into history became active members of leading Buddhist associations like the Buddhist Theosophical Society the Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association the Maha Bodhi Society and the Ceylon Buddhist Congress and worked with remarkable success to achieve the aims and objects of those organizations
Through such organizations these Buddhist leaders were able to unite and bring together all Buddhists in Sri Lanka to inspire them to be active to collect funds for educational and other religious purposes to give the Buddhist children a sound religious and secular education to do a great deal of social work and to raise the spiritual and moral standard of the people
A great deal of literary work was produced during this period
The Vidyodaya and the Vidyaalankaara Pirivenas and their affiliated institutions which numbered about had produced many scholars who edited several canonical and commentarial works in the early twentieth century
Simon Hewavitarana the youngest brother of Anagaarika Dharmapaala had left a large legacy which was to be used for the printing and publishing of Pali books and this greatly facilitated the production of books at this time
From about many modern scholars both monks and laymen have edited and published many more texts of Pali Buddhism and have also compiled several secondary works on the different aspects of Buddhism
To name these scholars and their publications is not necessary since they and their works are very well known
A great enthusiasm was also created for the rebuilding of ancient Buddhist shrines in the old capitals of Sri Lanka
The Ruwanveli Daagaba was the first to receive attention
The other shrines too were renovated one by one and today the old city of Anuraadhapura has once more become a sacred city with the Catholic Church and the commercial sites which were in the city being moved to other places
Sri Lanka has not only reorganized her Buddhist activities within the country but has also taken a leading part in sending Dhammaduutas messengers of the Dhamma abroad
In the World Fellowship of Buddhists was set up in order to bring all Buddhist countries together and several conferences were held in the subsequent years
It is a very significant fact that this revival of Buddhism in the twentieth century was accelerated towards the middle of that century as a result of the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders of the time gaining control of the reins of government
Ultimately in Sri Lanka regained its independence after a period of British rule of years
The Buddhist leaders who worked indefatigably for the cause of Buddhism were also the Sinhalese national leaders who led the struggle for liberation from foreign rule
It was therefore to be expected that when these leaders gained national freedom and took over the reins of government from the British rulers they were mindful of their national faith and its culture and therefore took the necessary steps to set things right so that Buddhism would once more receive its rightful place
In the year on the rd of May which was the Vesak fullmoon day of that year the Buddhists in Sri Lanka and other parts of the world celebrated the Buddha Jayanti
That was the th anniversary of the Buddha's Parinibbaana a day specially significant to the Buddhists the world over on account of the tradition that it constitutes half the lifespan of the Saasana and that from that year the Dhamma would flourish and spread far and wide
The history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka from the closing years of the last century has clear indications that the prophecy as far as Lanka is concerned is coming true
In other parts of the world too it is seen that more and more people who were not Buddhists by birth are becoming interested in Buddhism
The government of Sri Lanka on its part undertook numerous activities in commemoration of the Buddha Jayanti
A committee of leading Buddhist monks and laymen was appointed to advise the government on all matters relating to the Buddha Jayanti celebrations
Arrangements were made to translate the Tripitaka into Sinhalese and compile an Encyclopaedia of Buddhism in English and one in Sinhalese as well
It was also decided to compile other books dealing with the biography of the Buddha his teachings and the history of Buddhism
The completion of the renovation of the Daladaa Maaligawa in Kandy before the Buddha Jayanti and to aid the reconstruction of the Mahiyangana Thupa were among its other undertakings
A substantial grant was also given to the organization which was handling the construction work of a Sanghaaraama for the Buddhist monks at the University of Ceylon Peradeniya
Arrangements were made to hold a World Buddhist Conference in Colombo in the following year
From the Buddha Jayanti year it was noticeable that the Buddhists in Lanka applied themselves more keenly to the practice of morality taught in Buddhism while showing interest in the celebration of Buddhist festivals
More and more people observe the eight precepts on the Poya days and young children are given a sound religious education
The government on its part has given the necessary encouragement for this religious reestablishment
In January the Vidyodaya and the Vidyaalankaara Pirivenas were made two universities
The private Buddhist and Christian schools were taken over in December and are now managed by the government
The four Poya days of the month were made the weekend holidays in instead of Sundays as in previous times
It has also been planned to start a new Bhikkhu University in Anuraadhapura
Sri Lanka has today about
million Buddhists which is about sixtyfive percent of her total population
There are nearly Buddhist monasteries all over the island with approximately monks
Almost all the monasteries in the island have their Dhamma schools where Buddhist children are given religious instruction on the Poya days
The Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association conducts an islandwide examination annually for the pupils of these Dhamma schools
The children are provided with free books by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and prizes are given to those who pass these examinations including one on the Dhammapada and this association spends annually a large sum of money on the religious education of children
In  children sat for the Dhamma examination
The foregoing account will tell the reader of the vicissitudes that this great religion Buddhism had to face during its history of over years in this isle of Sri Lanka
It had its tidal ebb and flow
During the four centuries of foreign domination Buddhism withstood all the assaults that almost crushed it
Since Sri Lanka gained its independence in there has been a revival of the Buddhist religion and culture in the country and this reawakening was particularly noticeable when the Buddha Jayanti was celebrated in
The progress achieved since the eighties of the last century may well be called remarkable
Yet to the Buddhists of Lanka this should not be a cause of complacency for which there is no room in a world of change
It remains the duty of the present generation and the coming ones to preserve and strengthen these achievements against the corrosive forces of a materialist age and to work devotedly so that the Buddha's message of Wisdom and Compassion may take still firmer and deeper roots in Lanka and also spread its beneficial influence over the world
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The following pages were originally intended as new sections to be added to the second edition of my introductory book on the Dhamma What is Buddhism
However as many people are greatly interested in the practice of meditation and as many are also separated from the sources of a living tradition it is hoped that the following may be of value even apart from the sections of the book which they supplement
When we consider meditation we cannot stress too much the importance of having the right reasons for taking it up
Meditation  or as a better translation of samadhi collectedness  is only one aspect of Buddhist practice and must to be successful go hand in hand with such other practices as generosity gentleness nonviolence patience contentment and humility
If such genuine qualities of the Dhamma neither exist in oneself initially nor grow through one's practice then something is drastically wrong and only a foolhardy person will try to proceed
The practice of collectedness is based upon firm roots of virtue and cannot succeed in anyone who does not make a real effort to be strict in keeping the precepts
The signs of progress in collectedness are not strange visions peculiar feelings and the like but rather an allround and harmonious growth in the way of Dhamma
If one is without a teacher then one has to be doubly vigilant otherwise one will never become aware whether one of Mara's distractions is likely to succeed or whether one does in fact tread the Middle PracticePath
This essay is an extract from Buddhism Explained the second edition of the book formerly known as What is Buddhism published by The Social Science Press of Thailand Phya Thai Road Chula Soi Bangkok
Two apparently distinct streams of Buddhist meditation may be discerned though when meditation is established these are seen to be complementary
It may be profitable for some people whose minds are very active and who suffer from distraction to follow with mindfulness the mad monkeymind's acrobatics
As the mind is really a series of mental events which arise and pass away with incredible rapidity each of which is a mind complete with supporting mental factors so at the beginning this kind of mindfulness is really one mindful mind watching other minds
One thereby develops the ability to look into the mind and to see where it has gone to
Has it gone to the past present or future
Has it gone to materiality or to feelings or perhaps to cognitions to volitional activities or has it gone to consciousness
By this method of Where has it gone the distracted mind slowly comes under the surveillance of the mindful mind until mindfulness forms a strong foundation for further development
Considerable though mundane brilliance of mind is both needed and developed by this practice which however should be balanced by the tranquillity of the absorptions
When the mind has become calm one should start to practice for the absorptions which will in their turn be the basis for the arising of real insight
This method is called wisdom leading to calm
Other methods suited to those whose minds are less disturbed initially include the classic forty subjects of meditation and these together with more developed types of meditation practice involve the use of a definite object for concentration
This may be one's own body or a part of it a color or a picture a word or a phrase or abstract contemplation and so forth
All these methods involve some firm but gentle discipline of the mind in that each time it strays away it must be gently brought back again to concentrate again on the chosen subject
Some people have the quite mistaken idea that practice of this sort must necessarily lead to tranquillity almost at once
They may be surprised when beginning to practice themselves since they actually experience more troubles than they had previously
This is firstly because they never before really looked into their mind to know the state it has always been in and secondly because having taken up a discipline of the mind it is as though one stirs up with a stick a stagnant pond or pokes with a stick a fire smoldering under ashes
The wild elephant of the mind long accustomed to roam in the jungle of desires does not take readily to taming or to being tied to the post of practice with the thongs of mindfulness
However diligence and heedfulness will eventually win for one the fruits of tranquillity
All these forty subjects are of this second type in which the calm gained from practice is then used for the arousing of wisdom
They are for this reason called calmleadingtowisdom methods and are very important in the present distracted age
For their full explanation one should consult the Path of Purification although even the great learning in that book cannot replace the personal contact with a teacher
Turning from the psychological to the practical aspect meditation for laypeople may be divided into two categories that which is done intensively and that which one practices while going about one's daily life
The meditation practiced intensively is also of two sorts regular daily sitting and occasional retreat practice
We shall first discuss the regular daily period of intensive sitting which should where possible be made every day at the same time
One should guard against its becoming a ritual by earnestness and by being intensely aware of why one had undertaken it
The following suggestions may be found helpful as well
As to material considerations the place for meditation should be fairly quiet
If one has a small room which can be used for this purpose so much the better and in any case it is better to meditate alone unless other members of the household also practice
Where this latter is the case one should make sure that one's mind is pure also in relation to others for otherwise greed hatred and the rest of the robber gang are sure to steal away the fruits of meditation
Quietness is best obtained by getting up early before others rise and this is also the time when the mind is clear and the body untired
The sincere meditator therefore keeps regular hours for he knows how much depends on having just enough sleep to feel refreshed
After rising and washing one should sit down in clean loose clothing in the meditation place
One may have a small shrine with Buddhist symbols but this is not essential
Some people find it useful to begin by making the offerings of flowers incense and light carefully reflecting while doing so
It is very common in Buddhist countries to preface one's silent meditation by chanting softly to oneself Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa with the Refuges and Precepts
If one knows the Pali passages in praise of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha these may also be used at this time
Another useful preliminary is a reflection a discursive recitation of some truths of the Dhamma such as the passage suggested below
In looking to the welfare of others I shall not forget my own progress on the path of Dhamma
May I indeed come to know how driven here and there by the winds of kamma I have suffered an infinity of lives in all the realms of existence
I must also turn my mind to consider how short and fleeting is this life
How mind and body are ever changing arising and declining from moment to moment
How neither mind nor body belongs to me neither of them is mine
I must also turn this mind to consider how beset by troubles is this brief life
Having been sired by craving and born out of ignorance I must realize that death is inescapable that old age and disease are natural to my condition
I must make efforts to realize for my own good and the good of others that this person called 'myself' is a complex of mentality and materiality wherein no abiding entity such as a soul or self is found
May I through this practice experience insight into impermanence ill and noself
May I be one who dwells in the Void
And having realized this sublime truth may I show the way to others
When sitting care should be taken that the body is kept erect yet relaxed
There should be no strain but neither should the head droop nor the lumbar region sag
The body should feel poised and balanced upright
Although the crosslegged positions are best when the meditator is seated on a fairly soft mat a chair may be used by those unaccustomed to the lotus posture or else unable to train themselves to sit in that way
Sitting in lotus posture or halflotus posture will be found much easier if a rather hard cushion is placed so as to raise the buttocks
The knees will then tend to touch the ground and a firm three pointed sitting is then attained
One should sit for the same length of time every day until as one becomes more proficient in collecting the mind automatically one will feel like extending the practice
One widely used method for measuring the meditation period is sitting for the length of time taken for a stick of incense to burn down
Having placed the hands in meditation posture relaxed in the lap the eyes may be closed or left slightly open according to which is found most comfortable
Methods used for helping to concentrate the mind are many and the two main streams in classical meditation have been briefly reviewed in the section above
Other helpful methods include the repetition of a word or phrase and perhaps with it the use of a rosary
If one practices mindfulness of breathing one may find the use of a word such as Buddho or Araham good for quietening the mind
The first syllable is silently repeated when breathing in and one concentrates on the second during the outbreathing
Also the counting of breath is used as an aid for concentration
But any such aids should be dropped when concentration improves
When the meditation is on a phrase only a rosary may be used in conjunction each repetition being marked by one bead
One's meditation goes well if one finds the mind increasingly absorbed on the chosen meditation subject but one should not assume that meditation is useless just because for a period longer or shorter not much more than sleepiness or distraction is experienced
These hindrances have to be faced and if they are met not by irritation or despair but by quietly observant mindfulness they can and will be overcome
For success great persistence and evenness of effort are necessary
The meditation period may close with some chanting the usual subject being the well being of others and the distribution of merits to them
A translation or the original Pali of the Metta Sutta may be chanted at this time and as it is not long can be easily memorized
As methods of chanting vary it is very helpful if one can obtain recordings perhaps on tape of the passages one wishes to learn recorded by bhikkhus
While on the subject of chanting it is very useful to know a few discourses of Lord Buddha in one of the Buddhist classical languages and to use these for collecting the mind if there should be an occasion when no concentration at all can be obtained
At such a time a meditator should not feel depressed but should continue sitting and chant softly to himself
This is what Buddhist monks do twice a day as part of their mental development and it is useful as well for fostering a more devotional approach necessary as balance with intellectual characters
Another useful method for the overcoming of distraction is walkingpractice which may be done in any passage of the house or in a secluded walk in the garden
A length of twenty or thirty paces will be sufficient for if longer the mind tends to wander and if shorter distraction may be increased
One should walk at the speed one feels to be natural with the hands clasped the left in the right and arms relaxed in front of the body
At the ends of the walk one should turn in a clockwise direction
Perhaps a few words on devotion would not be out of place here for this is very important in meditation practice
No one who is not a devoted Buddhist takes up Buddhist meditation for the simple reason that he does not have the Buddhist ideals in his heart
The taking to heart of the Triple Refuge and the understanding of the Triple Gem are closely linked with Buddhist meditation
A really devoted Buddhist who puts his whole life into the Dhamma will have no insurmountable difficulties in meditation practice
Whatever obstacles he comes to those he leaps over sustained by devotion
He is prepared for the way to be long and hard because he realizes that he has made it like that
If he finds his way blocked his meditation failing to progress and he himself without a teacher he does not waver or falter on the way
He thinks I am now experiencing the results of intentional actions made by me in the past And he remembers Lord Buddha's last words Subject to breakingup are all compounded things
With mindfulness strive on All difficulties are compounded things and will eventually change meanwhile much may be done with mindfulness vigor and devotion
If one is not too tired after work and if there is opportunity in the evening another period of sitting can be undertaken then
In any case before sleep it is a wise practice to sit if only for a few minutes so as to purify the mind before lying down
One may consider thus When I lie down there is no certainty that I shall awake One may therefore be lying down to die and this is a good reflection to rouse skillful states of mind and banish sensual unskillful ones
If one practices this the lyingdown to die it will be a very good preparation for the real event which is bound to take place at some time in the unknown future
It may even generate the right conditions for the arising of insight allowing one to die giving up the grasping at what does not belong to one that is the mind and body
At this time also a Dhamma phrase or word may be used repeating which one eventually falls to sleep
In this way one ends and begins the day with practice of Buddhist teachings
And apart from devotion of one's whole day to them what could be better
Regarding the second division of intensive practice that is when undertaken in retreat much will depend upon what facilities are available to the earnest student
There are now a few places in the West where meditation instruction can be sought
The most important thing is to have direct contact with an able meditation master
After satisfying this one condition only one other is necessary one must strive with diligence to practice and realize his teachings
If these two conditions are fulfilled then one is the most fortunate among human beings
Many will be without access to a teacher and some may like to try a period of solitary meditation in some quiet part of the country
This should only be attempted if one has already developed a good power of mindfulness
Otherwise what was meant to foster meditation may become a very unprofitable time perhaps accompanied by the seeming intensification of the mental defilements
As to the other sort of meditation practice which is performed in daily life though much may be written the following few words may serve as a guide
First one should not deceive oneself regarding concentration of the mind
It is of no use pretending to oneself or to others that one's daily life is meditation  unless of course one has already great powers of concentration
Only the real adept often one who has sat for many years keeping the monastic discipline can really perceive ordinary life as meditation and such a one would be most unlikely to tell others of this fact
Refusing to allow pride an opportunity to distort the real state of mental affairs one should take stock with fairness and admit one's limitations
This is already a great step forward
The layman who thinks of himself as an arahant already has blocked off very effectively all real progress while the honest man has at least the wisdom to be humble
Much may be accomplished with mindfulness while without it there is no hope for meditation in daily life
How are quite ordinary events capable of being made into meditation
By mindfulness which to begin with may be defined as awareness of the present work in hand
At first great effort has to be made in order to remain mindful of what one is supposed to be doing nor can one pretend that such mindfulness is pleasant always
To escape from dull and unliked work and situations we tend to turn either to fantasy worlds hopes or else to memories which are respectively the delusive escapes into the present future or past
But for one really interested in understanding himself none of these courses is very rewarding since they are compounded of delusion with various ingredients such as fear craving or ignorance
While in the practice of strict meditation mindfulness may follow all the wanderings of the mind in daily life it is better that the mind should be constantly returned to the job in hand
One should not send one's mind anywhere neither to a dreamworld nor to the past nor to the future
Lord Buddha compared these periods of time thus
Such a simile may be useful as the mind darts about between dreams mirages and clouds all insubstantial though the everchanging present so like the clouds in the sky is the only aspect of time compared to things of greater reality
One may also consider meditation as the exercise of mindfulness which keeps the mind inside this body that is always focused upon some aspect of it
Of course only the most sincere meditator who sees the advantage in this to be greater than any pleasure offered by the world is likely to practice in this way since this cuts off not only interest in outer objects but also the toying with pleasant or intriguing ideas
Indeed with work that is really interesting the way of mindfulness is the only way to convert one's day into something worthwhile
Days pass and bring us nearer to death and an unknown rebirth while it is now that one has the chance to practice Dhamma
Instead of reacting with aversion or deluded fantasies towards what one does not like the Way of Mindfulness constitutes the Middle PracticePath transcending these ancient patterns of reaction
There is no need to be ruled either by greed or by hatred nor to be dominated by delusion but only mindfulness shows the way beyond these
Constantly bringing the mind back and disengaging it from tangles is the basic practice in everyday life
It is also wise to take advantage of those odd times during work when one waits for something to do to meet someone for a bus or train or any time when one is alone for a few minutes
Instead of turning to a newspaper for distraction to the wireless or to another person for gossip it is more profitable to retire inside oneself
Disengaging attention from exterior objects take up mindfulness of breathing or the repetition of some phrase of Dhamma or significant word such as Buddho or Arahant doing this until one has again to attend to work
Going inwards as often as possible will be found very useful strengthening one's sitting practice just as the latter in turn strengthens the ability to turn within
Mindfulness of breathing is especially good as a concentration method for use during travel and during the times when one is restlessly expecting a bus or a train
Why be agitated or impatient
A little mindful breathing is just the practice for these moments since it calms the feverish workings of the mind and the restless movements of the body
One does not have to aimlessly stare out of windows while traveling
Why be a slave of the eyedominant when a little useful practice could take its place
One does not have to listen to the idle chatter of others so why be a slave to the eardominant
One cannot shut one's ears but everyone can withdraw attention to some extent while practicing mindfulness
It is mindfulness also which helps to bring into focus counteractive contemplations
Lust for instance is soon dissipated by thoughts of a decaying corpse
The looks which are bestowed on pretty girls seem ridiculous when it is thought that old ladies and equally ancient men never attract such desirefilled attention
Only when one sees how lust burns up the one who indulges in it only then does it seem worth relinquishing
Similarly gluttony even in a mild form can be demolished by contemplating the bodily processes connected with food
Chewed food looks a good deal less palatable then when the same stuff before mixing with spittle was nicely laid out on plates
Vomit is just the same substances in the process of change but does not readily arouse greed
Excrement even if placed on the finest gold plate fails to become attractive  yet this is the remnants of the food so eagerly gorged
By the time that one has contemplated food in these three stages greed has quite disappeared and one may take food just as a medicine to preserve the body
Mindfulness is also responsible for becoming sufficiently aware in a moment of anger to turn the mind to other subjects or persons
It is mindfulness that warns one of an approaching situation where anger may arise and makes it possible to turn aside and dwell in equanimity or where the Divine Abidings are well developed in friendliness
When envy rears its ugly head mindfulness gives one presence of mind to know envy has arisen and if efforts to arouse gladness with others' joy fail it is mindfulness that helps one dwell in equanimity or if all else fails helps turn attention to other objects
Lord Buddha has truly said Mindfulness I declare is helpful everywhere
The social implications of meditation should be obvious from the above
Those who have the strange delusion that Buddhism is a religion of meditative isolation offering society no social benefits should understand that a Buddhist believes society can only be changed for the better and with some degree of permanence by starting work on himself
Buddhist ideals of society are expressed in a number of important discourses addressed by Lord Buddha to lay people and in them the developments of the individual is always stressed as a very necessary factor
The advantages of a society in which there are a large number of those dwelling at peace with themselves need hardly be stressed
The development of wisdom and compassion by one man has its effect in leavening the materialistic dough around him
The Buddhist call is therefore first to gain peace in one's own heart when will follow quite naturally peace in the world
Trying to obtain peace the other way round will never be practical nor produce a lasting peace for the roots of greed hatred and delusion have still a firm grip on the hearts of people
Impractical
Only for those who do not practice
Those who take up the cultivation of mindfulness find out for themselves how it helps to solve life's problems
Although many journeys to remote and attractive places are now performed with ease the way leading to Nibbana still needs effort
But if the way is sometimes drear with mindfulness the only guiding light at least from reflection one knows that the goal is glorious and of great worth not only for oneself but for others as well
The way to that goal leads through what are called the Divine Abidings which train the deeprooted emotions from being unskillful into the skillful way of the Dhamma
As had already been emphasized above the aim of oneself as of all beings is to gain happinessproducing conditions
Therefore one must act in such a way that happiness will result from one's actions
One should in this case treat others as they would wish to be treated for every living being is dear to itself and wishes its own welfare and happiness
One cannot expect to have an isolated happiness arising from no cause or from itself nor can happiness be expected if one maltreats other beings human or otherwise
Every being desires life and is afraid of death this being as true of ourselves as of other creatures
Only a man who constantly leads an upright and compassionate life is really dear to himself for he does actions which are of great profit of great happiness
Other people although they think that they are dear to themselves are really their own worst enemies for they go about doing to themselves what only an enemy would wish for them
Good conduct depends on a welltrained mind which has gradually been freed from the clutches of greed hatred and delusion
To hold one's neighbor as dear as one should truly hold oneself is easily said but with difficulty done
It is the particular merit of Lord Buddha's teachings that they always point out how a method is to be translated into experience the method here being the mental training of the Divine Abidings
When we say mental this word should be understood not in the narrow sense of the intellectual processes but rather to include the full range of the mindandheart intellect and emotions
There are four states of Divine Abidings friendliness compassion gladness and equanimity
These especially the first are very popular meditations in Buddhist countries
What follows is a short explanation of each
Friendliness is an unselfish love which can be extended to everyone
This becomes easy once one has gained the meditative absorptions when the quality of friendliness becomes an integral part of one's character
In the normal way of things people only love the few people to whom they are especially attached by ties of family etc
Such is love with sensual attachment a limited love and those outside that love are either ignored or disliked
Sensual love then is not only linked to attachment but also to hatred and delusion so that the person who is content with this love pays a heavy price for it
A love without attachment is scarcely conceivable to many people but such love is much superior to the former being without attachment it can become infinite and need not be confined to this or that group of beings
As it can be made infinite leaving none outside it there is no question of the three roots of unskill being linked with it
Friendliness can be developed gradually in one's meditation period every day but if it is really effective it must show in one's daily life
It makes life easier by turning persons whom one formerly disliked or hated into at the beginning those whom one disregards and then as one's practice becomes stronger into objects for the arising of lovingkindness
It is Lord Buddha's medicine for the disease of hatred and dislike
Finally one is warned that it has two enemies the near one is sensual attachment often miscalled love while the far enemy to its development is hatred
In the development of friendliness one must beware of these two
Compassion is taking note of the sufferings of other beings in the world
It overcomes callous indifference to the plight of suffering beings human or otherwise
Likewise it must be reflected in one's life by a willingness to go out of one's way to give aid where possible and to help those in distress
It has the advantage of reducing one's selfishness by understanding others' sorrows
It is Lord Buddha's medicine for cruelty for how can one harm others when one has seen how much they have to suffer already
It has also two enemies the near one is mere grief while its far enemy is cruelty
Gladness is to rejoice with others over their success gains happiness
It overcomes the grudging attitude to others and the envy which may arise on hearing of others' joy
It must show in one's life as a spontaneous joy at the very time when one learns that other people have some gain or other material or immaterial
It has the advantage of making one openhearted towards others and does away with secretiveness
A person who develops gladness attracts many friends who are devoted to him and with them and others he lives in harmony
It is Lord Buddha's medicine for envy and jealousy which it can inhibit completely
The two enemies of gladness are the merely personal happiness of reflecting on one's own gains  this is the near enemy while the far one is aversion to or boredom with this gladness
Equanimity is to be developed to deal with situations where one should admit that it is beyond one's powers to change them
It overcomes worry and useless distraction over affairs which either do not concern one or else cannot be changed by oneself
It is reflected in one's life by an ability to meet difficult situations with tranquillity and undisturbed peace of mind
The advantage to be seen in its development is that it makes one's life more simple by disengaging from useless activity
It is Lord Buddha's medicine for distraction and worry and its enemies are mere indifference which is the near one while greed and its partner resentment which involve one unskillfully in so many affairs are its far enemies
The mind wellpracticed in these four virtues and then welltrained by their use in daily life has already gained very much
Three of the perfections or qualities practiced by many Buddhists who aspire to enlightenment may also be outlined here as they too have an intimate bearing on the practice of meditation
Patience is an excellent quality much praised in Buddhist scriptures
It can be developed easily only if restlessness and hatred have already been subdued in the mind as is done by meditation practice
Impermanence which has the tendency to make one rush around and thus miss many good chances results from the inability to sit still and let things sort themselves out  which sometimes they may do without one's meddling
The patient man has many a fruit fall into his lap which the gogetter misses
One of them is a quiet mind for impatience churns the mind up and brings with it the familiar anxietydiseases of the modern business world
Patience quietly endures  it is this quality which makes it so valuable in mental training and particularly in meditation
It is no good expecting instant enlightenment after five minutes practice
Coffee may be instant but meditation is not and only harm will come of trying to hurry it up
For ages the rubbish has accumulated an enormous pile of mental refuse and so when one comes along at first with a very tiny teaspoon and starts removing it how fast can one expect it to disappear
Patience is the answer and determined energy to go with it
The patient meditator really gets results of lasting value the seeker after quick methods or sudden enlightenment is doomed by his own attitude to long disappointment
Indeed it must soon become apparent to anyone investigating the Dhamma that these teachings are not for the impatient
A Buddhist views his present life as a little span perhaps of eighty years or so and the latest one so far of many such lives
Bearing this in mind he determines to do as much in this life for the attainment of Enlightenment as possible
But he does not overestimate his capabilities he just quietly and patiently gets on with living the Dhamma from day to day
Rushing headlong at Enlightenment like a bull in a china shop is not likely to get one very far that is unless one is a very exceptional character who can take such treatment and most important one who is devoted to a very skillful master of meditation
With patience one will not bruise oneself but will go carefully step by step along the way
We learn that a Bodhisatta is well aware of this and that he cultures his mind with this perfection so that it is not disturbed by any of the untoward occurrences common in this world
He decides that he will be patient with exterior conditions  not to be upset when the sun is too hot or the weather too cold
Not to be agitated by other beings which attack his body such as bugs and mosquitoes
Neither will he be disturbed when people utter harsh words lies or abuse about him either to his face or behind his back
His patience is not broken even when his body is subjected to torment blows sticks and stones tortures and even death itself he will endure these steadily so unflinching is his patience
Buddhist monks also are advised to practice in the same way
In Buddhist tradition the perfection of patience is rather better known than some of the others
This is because a quite outstanding Birth Story illustrates it
The Khantivadi Birth Story should be read many times and made the object of deep and frequent reflections
Only an exceptionally noble person in this case Gotama in a previous life when he was called the Patienceteaching Rishi can gently exhort a raging and drunk monarch who out of his jealous anger is slowly cutting that person's body to pieces
Such nobility did the Bodhisatta have and such nobility steadfast endurance and gentleness is required of all who would try to reach the goal of Enlightenment
Just as Enlightenment is inconceivable unless a person has patience so it is not attainable without effort being made
The Dhamma never encourages the doctrine of fatalism and true Buddhists never think of events as being rigidly predetermined
Such fatalism is combated by mindfulness and by energy itself
This perfection is the counterpart of the previous one and balanced by practice they ensure that the sincere Buddhist neither passively accepts what he should combat nor rushes around to the disturbance of himself and others when he should have patience
By way of warning it may be mentioned here that in the Buddhist world can be found a number of methods which seem to promise the riches of Dhamma all in no time
One hears such remarks as What's the use of books and study Or even The development of calm is a waste of time
One should only develop insight Such lopsided approaches do not reflect the wisdom of Lord Buddha who taught time and again the necessity of a balanced development of mind
Books and their study are useful to some people who wish to gain a good background of what Lord Buddha really said before taking up more intensive practice
As for the other assertion no real insight will arise to the person whose mind has no experience of calm
Such views as these which are usually based on some peculiar experience of those teachers who originate them are apt to mislead many since the craving for quick results coupled with the dislike of the necessary hard work are easily stirred up
There must be patience to accept that the conditions required for success of meditation have to be fulfilled and the only result if failing to do so is straying off the Way
The meditator applies himself steadily to whatever task he has in hand and coming to the end of it does not feel tired at all but straightaway takes up a new objective
It is interesting in this respect that tiredness is of two kinds that relating to physical exhaustion and the other kind which is mentally induced and involves the unskillful factors of sloth and torpor
While the former is of course unavoidable the latter occurs only when the unskillful root of delusion becomes predominant in the mind
This happens when there is a situation which is unpleasant to me unwanted and from which I want to escape
People complain that they become much more tired sitting in meditation while practicing intensively than they do when say they do a bit of heavy reading
When the self feels threatened by a selfrevealing event then this self rooted in unknowing throws up a dense fog of torpor proceeding from the root of delusion
On the other hand many who have practiced much meditation remark that they do not have to sleep so long as they did formerly while energy when it becomes a perfection as practiced by the Bodhisatta is quite natural and unforced
This perfection is illustrated by the story of the caravanleader who saved the merchants men and animals entrusted to his care by vigorous action
When others would have given themselves up to death since the caravan had taken a wrong course in the desert and all supplies were exhausted their leader forced one of them to dig for water which he found
In this way in a previous life did Gotama as the caravanleader make effort not only for his own life but also for the welfare of others
Monks are also referred to as caravanleaders in several places in Pali scriptures showing that it is not only Lord Buddha or a Bodhisatta who is able to guide others
If we deal energetically with our own training then we too have energy for the advancement of others
Many other stories like the above could be found in Buddhist works showing how necessary is energy from which spring persistence and determination for the seeing of the truly real Nibbana
Bearing in mind the meanings of this word together with such specialized terms as development absorption insight onepointedness and meditation exercise we may now examine what constitutes perfected collectedness
What especially marks off the good Buddhist's practice whether he be a Bodhisatta or not from that of an ordinary meditator is that the latter will most likely become firmly attached to the delights occurring in the upper reaches of the sensual realm or to the pure joys of the realm of form and as a result come to birth in one of these heavenly states
If one gets oneself trapped in one of these bourns where pleasures and joys are great and sufferings but little then it is unlikely that one will be able to generate the energy necessary for the perfection of wisdom
Therefore the good meditator tries to become proficient in the absorptions while not being attached to them
But one should note that this applies only to the skilled meditator who has already obtained the absorptions
If one has not reached to these levels then ardent aspiration not detachment will be the correct attitude
After these absorptions have been attained they may be reviewed as impermanent unsatisfactory and devoid of self or soul at which time detachment from them will naturally arise and insight be experienced
The absorptions are thus in the Buddhist way of training never an end in themselves but are always used to promote insight and wisdom which arise when the collected mind is set the task of examining the mind and body in order to know completely their characteristics
A story which brings out the meaning of this perfection is told of Kuddalamuni's life
His name means the Mattock sage and he was thus called because of the difficulty he experienced in freeing himself from attachment to his mattock
Several times leaving his house with intent to meditate in the forest he was dragged back by the memory of his mattock and his old occupation of farming
One day reflecting on the inconstancy with which he pursued meditation he took his mattock and whirling it round his head sent it spinning into the depths of the nearby Ganges
Having done this he burst out in a great cry of joy
The local rajah who was passing that way with his army sent a man to enquire why this farmer was so joyful to which the sage replied by relating his experience
The rajah and many others were much impressed by his reply and some followed him to take up a meditative life in the forest after which we are told all passed away to experience life in the realm of form
The Mattocksage who was none other than Gotama in a past life exhibited even then another aspect of the perfection of meditation the ability to train others in meditation after gaining proficiency in it oneself
Finally we may add brief notes on some of the dangers to meditation practice
While the number of ways a meditator may go astray is legion the few mentioned below deserve a special mention due to their common occurrence
First a danger that cannot be stressed enough is the lack of right motivation for the practice of meditation
When the Eightfold Path is described in its wisdom section standing next to the intellectual right understanding comes right motivation thus emphasizing that the emotional roots underlying practice of the Way must be skillful ones those connected with renunciation goodwill and nonviolence are mentioned
If one approaches Buddhist meditation with neither right understanding regarding dukkha and its cessation nor with right motives then one's meditation is liable to seriously astray
There have for instance been those who took up meditation as a way to invest themselves with power so that they could easily sway or hypnotize disciples
Others have seen it as a quick way to gain both disciples and riches
Fame may also be an unworthy motive
All these as motives for playing with meditation may easily lead the unwary into illness and sometimes mental unbalance
There is nothing worse in Buddhist meditation where a person's own sure experience is of paramount importance than a halfbaked disciple who sets himself up as a master
This obviously leads on to a further danger  that of pride of which there are several forms
One such is the pride of the person who has seen manifestations of light during meditation and supposes this to be the sign preceding mental absorption
Then there is the pride of one who touches on a mental absorption if only for an instant and as a result assumes that he has become a Noble One and this can be a very powerful factor in convincing himself if not others
Quite ordinary people who take up meditation may beware of the common holierthanthou attitudes I make an effort whereas you or I meditate every day whereas you Pride is a great obstacle to any progress and while it is only a Buddha or arahant who is entirely rid of it everyone should have the mindfulness to check it
Related to this is the danger for the person who always looks for socalled progress
He is sure that he is making progress because in meditation he sees lights hears sounds or feels strange sensations
He becomes more and more fascinated by these as time goes by and gradually forgets that he started with the aspiration to find the way to Enlightenment
His meditation then degenerates into visions and strange happenings leading him into the realms of occultism and magic
There is no surer way for a meditator to become entangled than this way
Fascinating though all such manifestations may be they should be rigorously cut down by resorting to bare attention never permitting discursive thought regarding them and thus avoiding these distractions
Among visions which one may see whether they be internal or external there may be for some meditators an experience of the fearful such as the sight of one's own body reduced to bones or inflated as a rotting corpse
If such an experience occurs or others of a similar nature one should withdraw the mind from the vision immediately supposing that one has no teacher
Visions of the fearful variety which occur to some people may be very useful if rightly employed but without a teacher's guidance they should be avoided
Another danger is trying to meditate while one is still too emotionally insecure unbalanced or immature
An understanding of the value of meritorious deeds or skillfulness will come in useful here
As merit purifies the mind it will be an excellent basis for minddevelopment and both the ease with which absorptions are gained and the ease with which insight arises are to some extent dependent upon merit
Meritorious deeds are not difficult to find in life
They are the core of a good Buddhist life giving and generosity undertaking the precepts help and service to others reverence listening wholeheartedly to Dhamma setting upright one's understanding of Dhamma  all these and more are meritorious deeds which bring happiness and emotional maturity
Merit one should always remember opens doors everywhere
It makes possible it makes opportunities
To have a mind at all times set upon making merit is to have a mind that may be trained to develop absorptions and insight
Obviously it follows that to try to practice meditation while all the time retaining one's old cravings likes and dislikes is to say the least making one's path difficult if not dangerous
Meditation implies renunciation and no practice will be successful unless one is at least prepared to make efforts to restrain greed and hatred check lust and understand when delusion is clouding the heart
How far one carries renunciation and whether this involves outward changes depends much on a person and his circumstances but one thing is sure inward renunciation an attitude of givingup with regard to both unskillful mental events and bodily indulgence is absolutely essential
Often connected with the above dangers is another to be seen in cases where a man suddenly has an opportunity to undertake a longer period of meditation practice
He sits down with the firm resolve Now I shall meditate but though his energy is ever so great and though he sits and sits and walks and walks still his mind is disturbed and without peace
It may well be that his own strong effort has much to do with his distractions
Moreover he has to learn that it is necessary to meditate knowing the limitations of his character
Just as any other worker who knows the limits of his strength and is careful not to exhaust himself so is the able meditator careful
With mindfulness one should know what are the extremes of laziness and of strain to be avoided
It is through straining or forcing meditation practice that many emotionally disturbed states arise
Sudden bursts of intense anger all over insignificant trifles fierce cravings and lusts strange delusions and even more peculiar fantasies can all be produced from unwisely arduous practice
With all these dangers it is a skilled teacher who is most necessary to give advice so that these and other wrong turnings are avoided and one keeps straight along the way to Nibbana
Those who are without a teacher should proceed with utmost caution making sure that their development of mindfulness is very good indeed
If they are mindful and see that despite their efforts their meditation practice is making no real difference to their lives in terms of greater internal peace or externally in relation to others then it should be apparent that something is wrong
Meditation may be laid aside for some time while making efforts to contact a genuine source of information preferably a living meditation master in the meantime giving due attention to unsolved moral problems which until sorted out will not permit the mind to develop and making a great effort to live one's life according to Buddhist standards
When quite basic matters of this sort are neglected one cannot hope to make much progress upon the Middle PracticePath
If one has no meditation teacher from whom one may request a meditation subject then one has to rely upon one's knowledge of one's character in order to prescribe for oneself a suitable meditation
There are forty meditation exercises noted by the great teacher Buddhaghosa as being suited to certain types of character
For the purposes of meditation he considers six characters faithful intelligent and speculative and greedy hating and deluded
The trouble here is twofold firstly very few pure types can be found most people being mixtures of two or more of them  and moreover everchanging mixtures and secondly it is rather difficult to judge which class one's character belongs to since one's own delusion and pride are apt to blur one's judgments
This is but one small matter in which the value of the meditation teacher may be discerned very easily
One may learn much about oneself however by being mindful at the time when some unexpected event takes place
At that time one can spot one's reaction and the stains which are present in the mind
Later judgments are not worth very much since by that time the mind has got round to selfjustifications and other kinds of distortions of the original event
Below is given the list of the forty meditation exercises with some notes upon their practice the characters which are benefited and the types of stains combated by them
The most widely used meditation exercises are starred
 recommended for the practice of hate characters because of their pure pleasing colors
Apart from the possible exception of  no special moral stain is counteracted by these ten kasinas
As they are to be developed through the eye they will not be very suitable for anyone with weak sight
The only one of the ten kasinas which seems to be practiced much these days is that of light which some people find arises quite naturally when they begin to concentrate the mind
While Acariya Buddhaghosa's explanations in Path of Purification tend to stress the importance of using exterior supports for practice whenever the writer has heard of them being employed they are always in the nature of visions arising internally and being developed from this basis
It appears that contemplations of an exterior earth etc
kasina is unknown in Thailand
 recommended for greed characters
These and similar lists in the Satipatthana Sutta reflect the time when disposal of corpses upon charnelgrounds was common
Now however even in Buddhist lands they are difficult to find let alone in Western countries
Teachers in Thailand at the present time stress that one's own body is to be seen in these ways as a vision arising in the course of minddevelopment
As these can be fearful one should have the instruction of a skilled teacher for dealing with such visions when they can be of great advantage
It may be stressed here that there is nothing morbid in contemplating such sights interior or exterior as these
The body's decay is just something natural but normally it is not seen because people do not like to admit this
Instead of facing bodily decay and bringing it out into the open dead bodies are even made to look attractive by embalmers and cosmeticians and where this cannot be done they are stowed away in beautiful coffins with bright flowers etc
Buddhist training makes one look squarely at those aspects of life which normally are not considered nice and makes one calmly face them in respect of one's own mind and body
This group of ten has a more miscellaneous character than the previous two groups
In practicing the first three recollections one recited the lists of qualities of each one of these
Or if the mind does not become concentrated in this way one chooses one particular quality and recites that silently and continuously
Rosaries are used in some places in connection with practice of this sort
The recollections on virtue and generosity are specially good to cultivate in one's old age
One reviews all the meritorious deeds made by one in the course of life and recollecting them the mind becomes tranquil and happy and having such a mental state at the time of death one is sure to be reborn in very favorable surroundings
One cannot recollect the celestials except by hearsay unless one has seen them
This practice is suitable for those who have increased the range of their minds and so have made contact with other more subtle beings
Death may be recollected by intelligent characters since they will not be frightened at the prospects which this practice opens up
It is a great incentive to practice now when one does not know whether even one second from hence one will be alive
The twentyeighth recollection  on the body  is for greedy characters who need to develop dispassion regarding the body
This is achieved by the analysis of the body into thirtytwo unbeautiful parts and then by selecting one or more of these and examining it
However this practice comes to perfection when with insight the body is illuminated and its various components are clearly seen and their nature understood
The mindfulness of breathing is recommended for calming and clearing the mind and a person of almost any temperament may practice it with benefit though great care is needed in the subtler ranges of this exercise
The breathing is never forced but observed constantly with mindfulness the point of concentration being usually the nosetip or nostrils
However teachers vary in their practice of it
The recollection of peace says the great Acariya is only of certain benefit to those who have already experienced Nibbana such as streamenterers but others can gain some calm from contemplation of peacefulness
The peace spoken of here is really Nibbana and as one cannot recollect what one has not known if a worldling this is a practice for the Noble Ones
recommended for hate characters
These formless absorptions cannot be developed unless one has already perfected the four ordinary absorptions of form
It is said that this group of four may be explored on the basis of the fourth absorption
As few people are likely to have experienced this we pass on to
While it is essential for the bhikkhu who has to rely upon collected food lay people can also benefit from this practice which Acariya Buddhaghosa notes is for intelligent characters and is designed to lessen and lead to the destruction of greed and gluttony
These are earth water fire and air all of which characterize our physical bodies
These elements may be perceived by an analysis based upon the use of mindfulness
This practice is also said to be particularly fitted for the intelligent character
Those practices not mentioned in connection with character are suited to anyone
As all of these practices are aimed at the lessening and eventual destruction of the stains one may appreciate how important they are thought in Buddhist training
Where the stains are present there the darkness of unknowing holds sway but where they are not found there shines forth the wisdom and compassion of Enlightenment
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
In the small treatise which follows the good of both bhikkhus and of the lay Buddhist householders has been aimed at and the information presented the writer believes is available in no other book
The standards of conduct described here are those of the Vinaya wellpracticed and of the layman's discipline wellapplied
What use indeed is there in presenting other than the high standards laid down by Lord Buddha himself in the Vinaya since falling away from good conduct is all too easy and may all too easily be seen not least in Buddhist lands
For those who follow the training in Buddhist Doctrine and Discipline only the best surely is good enough
As to terminology the writer has used the Pali word añjali for what is often called placing together the palms of the hands and the fivepointrest for what is commonly called prostration
This book has greatly benefited from the corrections and additions suggested by my revered upajjhaya Ven
Chao Khun Sasana Sobhana and others
May this work be for the practical welfare of all who strive on the Path of Saddhamma
The teachings given by Lord Buddha which are preserved and practiced to the present day are known in the ancient texts as the DhammaVinaya
Although there is a great loss of meaning when translating these two terms into English they may be rendered as Doctrine and aspects of Discipline
Numerous books are given over to explaining aspects of Dhamma but perhaps because of its monastic meaning the Vinaya seems neglected and not given due prominence
It will be the task of this booklet to examine Vinaya from a particular point of view  that of the Buddhist layman and how a knowledge of some of its rules can be useful to him
This term Vinaya has not only monastic connotations
It is true that the Vinayacollection contains at great length and in detail the training rules prohibitions allowances and regulations governing a bhikkhu's life but there is at least one important instance of the term being applied to the conduct of laypeople
The subtitle of the famous discourse called the Exhortation to Sigala is Gihivinaya or the Householder's Discipline a worthy name for a masterly exposition
In a more narrow sense the layman's Vinaya is his Five Precepts since these have the same function of removing the unskillful as the much greater body of training rules in the Vinayacollection has for a bhikkhu
This is in fact what the word Vinaya means driving out abolishing destruction or removal  that is of all the overt ways of behavior which obstruct progress along the Practicepath of Dhamma
Why then were the Vinaya training rules laid down
Many times in the Vinayacollection Lord Buddha says On account of O bhikkhus I shall make known the training rule for bhikkhus founded upon these ten reasons
The great Teacher and Commentator Ven
Buddhaghosa gives the following versedefinition of the Vinaya in the Atthasalini
This verse stresses the usefulness of Vinaya in disciplining the body and speech and this again drives home the support given by Vinaya to Dhamma
To have one without the other is actually inconceivable from a Buddhist point of view
For instance a Dhamma taught without Vinaya would be a teaching in which no opening or beginning was shown of a path to be practiced
A Vinaya without Dhamma on the other hand would be an empty formalism a discipline bearing little fruit or advantage
Both parts of the Buddhist Dispensation go handinhand whether one considers the bhikkhu's or the layman's training
A good Buddhist layman is one who makes every effort to keep pure the Five Precepts and to practice at least the Dhamma taught in the Exhortation to Sigala In the same way a good bhikkhu strives to train himself without falling into offenses in the training rules of the Patimokkha which at the time of his acceptance as a bhikkhu he has undertaken to observe
It is often said that the laymen keep five while the bhikkhu's load is two hundred and twentyseven precepts but for the latter this is only part of the truth since he has besides the fundamental rules in the Patimokkha numerous others to train in these being found scattered throughout the Vinaya Collection
Here we may remark upon one difference between the precepts of a layman and those of a bhikkhu
The former are all of a moral nature such as are esteemed in all religions
For this reason they fall into the class of natural precepts
But the bhikkhu besides having precepts of this nature has many more which are special to his mode of life
These precepts are called formulated
Although they have little or no application in the life of a layman they are very important for the bhikkhu including all sorts of ways of restraint and good conduct proper for him
It should not be thought this latter sort of precept is less important to him than those in the group of natural morality for this would be to apply worldly standards of judgment to a code of discipline designed to promote an unworldly way of life
The concern among both bhikkhus and laity for keeping the precepts pure and for not falling into any offense may be called scrupulousness
Many times in the Vinaya is it mentioned that scrupulous bhikkhus would not accept some article until Lord Buddha had made it allowable
Again we find constant references to bhikkhus of few wishes who were ashamed of the unbecoming and unscrupulous behavior of other monks
Light is thrown here upon an important connection between precepts generally and the Dhamma
In being scrupulous or of few wishes a number of skillful mental factors valuable to one's training are present
Among these the pair known as shame and fear of blame are actually called by Lord Buddha the guardians of the world Shame is seen when one reproaches oneself for an evil done or about to be done and when one has an inward fear derived from thinking of the unpleasant results to be experienced from that sort of kamma
Fear of blame is rather the restraint imposed by fear of others' censure or by the thought that honorable persons whom one respects such as parents or teachers might get to know of such evil
Being of few wishes is another word for contentment a very valuable quality for a bhikkhu
The other most prominent factor in this scrupulosity and modesty is mindfulness which is indeed at the root of all Buddhist training at whatever level
When there is mindfulness however many precepts one keeps it is likely that they will be well and carefully guarded
Mindfulness makes one careful and skillful even in mental kamma not to mention those involving body and speech
It makes possible that allround restraint often described by the simile of the turtle which creature is immune from danger after having withdrawn its legs and head inside its shell
Of the bhikkhu it is said
All the various rules of the Vinaya might indeed be summed up in these verses
Further we have the famous exhortation of Lord Buddha to the bhikkhus Be perfect in virtue O bhikkhus be perfect in the Patimokkha
Dwell restrained according to the Patimokkha
Be perfect in conduct and resort seeing danger even in the slightest faults and train yourselves by undertaking rightly the rules of training It is from such exhortations as this that the scrupulousness of a good bhikkhu is born
He resolves to make effort to train himself thus I shall be perfect in virtue
I shall be perfect in the Patimokkha
I shall dwell restrained perfect in conduct and resort seeing danger even in the slightest faults Unscrupulousness if we consider it in the light of these passages will obviously indicate the presence of unrestraint and lack of mindfulness to say the least and probably the lack of shame and fear of blame
Quite often strong currents of craving possibly unrecognized may be involved pride may have a hand and false views so often allied with pride may tangle matters further by throwing out a smokescreen of reasons
However this may be the rules of training are praised by Lord Buddha in words which must prevent anyone from regarding them as mere external rules Now all these rules combine together to make up the three trainings
What three
The training in supreme morality the training in supreme collectedness and the training in supreme wisdom
Herein are combined one and all of these rules Thus O bhikkhus one who partly fulfills these observances experiences attainment partially while one fulfilling perfectly comes to experience the complete attainment
Not barren of results I declare are these rules of training
Or we have in Dhammapada verse 
Reason enough if a bhikkhu has set his heart upon Nibbana to keep the training rules strictly
Now the path of one who has gone forth from home to homelessness and who sincerely tries to train in those rules which he has undertaken is reckoned to lead directly to Nibbana
It is therefore a great evil to obstruct one who has set himself upon this course while it is great puñña to aid such a one
In the Buddhist dispensation there is mutual help given by bhikkhus to laypeople in the form of Dhamma suitable for their practice and by lay people to bhikkhus when they offer the four supports robes food shelter and medical necessities
In this way householders support the community of bhikkhus from among whom those with knowledge and experience support the laity with Dhamma
Just as no bhikkhu worthy of the robe would cause trouble among lay people but only wish to help them so devoted and knowledgeable householders think only to help bhikkhus and samaneras
In order to do this they must of course have at least some idea of what is and what is not allowable for bhikkhus as laid down by Lord Buddha in the Vinaya
It happens that bhikkhus are now traveling more widely and able to visit and live in countries where formerly it was not possible for them to go
Also many people from nonBuddhist lands now travel to and stay in those countries there where is a living tradition of Dhamma some of them becoming interested and wishing to know what should and what should not be done in respect of bhikkhus
There is consequently a need for knowledge among laysupporters and others of some points of Vinaya
In this small book the only points dealt with will be those where laypeople are somehow involved while Vinaya matters of concern to bhikkhus alone may be investigated in more comprehensive works
As the bhikkhu's life generally gives many occasions for contact with laypeople and as erring bhikkhus were not absent from the Sangha even in the days of Lord Buddha so there is quite a large body of legislation relating to just these occasions
Because of the wrong conduct of various bhikkhus Lord Buddha had cause to lay down large numbers of training rules which if infringed would become offenses for the guilty bhikkhu
It sometimes happened that a rule had to be modified and sometimes various allowances proved necessary to qualify the range of the original rule
In this way many of the training rules were tested in the light of experience until they became perfectly practical
All these rules fall into seven classes according to the seriousness of the offense involved when they are broken
Briefly these seven classes with some of their characteristics are as follows
In the more detailed considerations below we shall return to some implications of the first and last of these
We have already seen that Lord Buddha in laying down the training rules for bhikkhus was much concerned with the wellbeing of the laity
He had in mind for instance being in sympathy with householders the pleasing of those not pleased the increase of those pleased alongside more monastic considerations
In another passage of very frequent occurrence in the Vinaya collection Lord Buddha whenever he rebuked some erring bhikkhu would say It is not foolish man for the pleasing of those not pleased not for the increase of those who are pleased but foolish man it causes displeasure among those who are not pleased as well as in those who are pleased and it causes wavering in some
The very obvious effects which bad conduct by one in robes has upon laypeople is here very strongly emphasized
The converse is also true since a bhikkhu who has been welltrained under good teachers and learned thoroughly the theory and practice of Dhamma and Vinaya is indeed a great recommendation to the excellence found in the Conqueror's dispensation
A picture of such a bhikkhu is awakened in the mind's eye by Dhammapada verse
The Dhamma which all Buddhists revere as most precious and which is practiced by all who are truly followers of Lord Buddha has been preserved for the people of the present by the Sangha
This community of bhikkhus those who have specialized in Dhamma has been preserved by close adherence to the training rules laid down in the Vinaya
That this sequence is true may be seen from several instances in history when bhikkhus no longer paid heed to the Vinaya and so lost the respect and support of the laity
Not having this support they drifted towards being householders themselves and having become priests with families they could give less time to learning and practice of Dhamma
Books got lost and were not replaced and the tradition became steadily more degenerate until no teaching at all remained  only protectionceremonies and the like often performed in a language not understood even by the priest let alone by the people
The present time alas could also show some Buddhist traditions of which these words are true
This preservation of the Dhamma by Vinaya and hence by the Sangha to whom the Vinaya applies finds expression in a simile in the Vinayaintroduction where it is said Flowers loose upon a flat piece of wood not tied together by thread are scattered about destroyed by the wind
What is the cause of that
Since they were not held together by thread This is said to apply to the teachings of some former Buddhas who gave little of the Dhamma to their disciples and who did not lay down the Vinaya or make known the Patimokkha
It is a cause for rejoicing that Gotama the Buddha has explained the Dhamma in detail made known the Vinaya and pointed out the fundamental training rules of the Patimokkha
It is as if Sariputta various flowers placed on a piece of wood tied together by thread are not scattered whirled about or destroyed by the wind
What is the reason for that
They are well tied together by thread This means simply that the winds of impermanence cannot so easily destroy the various aspects of Dhamma when these are secured by the thread of the Vinaya
This brings us to appreciate the reverence which the Vinayacollection is accorded by all true bhikkhus as well as by knowledgeable laymen
This collection is given first place among the three collections of Buddha word a fact which indicates that it is the support and mainstay of the other teachings
As it is said the Vinaya is the very life of the Teaching so long as the Vinaya endures the Teaching endures therefore let us rehearse the Vinaya first
If one appreciates that the Vinaya is indeed the mainstay it will not be difficult for Buddhist laity even in nonBuddhist countries to realize that ideas of changing the Vinaya in order as it is said to suit modern conditions find no favor with the Sangha as a whole
There are many objections to such a course of action in which indeed there would be almost no advantages
In what follows the writer wishes to examine these objections and to show plainly their dangers and disadvantages
Firstly if one reads through the Vinaya while there are a number of points that apply specially to eastern countries some even being limited to conditions peculiar to ancient India none of these relate to the main principles of the bhikkhulife
The workings of the Vinaya in the life of the bhikkhu of the present day is not made difficult by obsolete training rules
Those no longer having any application are very few and are really not of great importance
All the main principles of the bhikkhudiscipline are as valid now as they were when instituted by Lord Buddha two and a half millennia past
This is indeed a marvelous proof of the wisdom of Lord Buddha who has so well formulated these rules
Nor is the structure of the Vinaya absolutely rigid and it does therefore permit necessary adaptations which are still within the spirit of the training
The use by bhikkhus of modern methods of transport might be taken as an example
This would not have been possible for them if Vinaya was taken as a completely rigid code
Secondly there are the words of Lord Buddha himself So long O bhikkhus as you appoint no new rules and abolish not the existing ones but proceed according to the training rules as laid down so long will bhikkhus be expected to prosper not to decline This statement of the Teacher is always to the fore whenever there are gatherings of senior bhikkhus meeting to determine some Vinaya questions arising out of modern conditions
Or there are such exhortations from sources outside the Pali canon as these words attributed to Lord Buddha O bhikkhus after my Parinibbana you should revere and honor the precepts of the Patimokkha
Treat them as a light which you have discovered in the dark or as a poor man would treat a treasure he had found
You should know that they are your chief guide and there should be no difference from when I yet remained in the world
Then there is a consideration based upon the events of the First Sangayana
In this great gathering of arahants Venerable Mahakassapa who was its president put forward this motion If it seems right to the Sangha the Sangha should not lay down what has not been laid down nor should it abolish what has been laid down
It should proceed in conformity with and according to the training rules which have been laid down
This is the motion
Your reverences let the Sangha listen to me
If it seems right to the Sangha the Sangha should not
It is pleasing to the Sangha therefore it is silent
Thus do I understand All those who are accepted as bhikkhus in the present day follow this tradition as laid down in the First Sangayana
This is Theravada tradition it is based upon the decision of those great elders who were ennobled with the highest nobility
Who are we indeed to go astray from their way
Although the Teacher before his Parinibbana spoke thus After my passing Ananda let the Sangha if it so desires abolish the lesser and minor rules of training no Sangha anywhere actually ventured to do this partly because of the uncertainty in defining the lesser and minor rules and partly because they were constrained out of respect to preserve that which had been instituted by the great Teacher
Acariya Nagasena explains that the Tathagata spoke thus testing the bhikkhus 'Will my disciples on being left by me adhere to the passing or will they repudiate them'
There is also the consideration that those of other sects might say While the Teacher was alive his disciples respected and honored his precepts but now that he is no more they throw off the training But principally the reason was devotion arising from the successful practice of Dhamma Vinaya
Supposing that someone proclaimed that he wished to reform the Vinaya
In doing this or in trying to do this he would depart from Theravada tradition and place himself apart from others following Theravada and would in fact only start a new sect and who is in honor of sectarianism
If he were a bhikkhu by his departure from the training laid down in the Vinaya he would only bring upon himself offenses being burdened with which and failing to confess them he would be precluded from making much progress on the practice path of Dhamma
Again who will change the Vinaya
As the Vinaya is the province of bhikkhus lay people obviously cannot do so
One bhikkhu cannot effect any changes since Vinayadecisions are arrived at after the consultation of a sangha
A sangha of young bhikkhus is not qualified to do so since decisions arrived at by them might well be swayed by preferences or be based upon both lack of learning and lack of purity of heart
A sangha of senior bhikkhus competent to decide upon Vinayaquestions will scarcely undertake such a task since their training has imbued them with a deep sense of respect for the Vinaya
Any decision arrived at by a meeting of less than all bhikkhus in the world would be sectarian in character and be the cause of Sanghaschism
Even if such a gathering could be contrived not only would respect for the traditions of the arahant elders easily triumph but also the dissident voices would be found to represent somewhat unbalanced individuals
Actually no one at all can be found who would be competent to undertake changing the Vinaya 
Another point to consider is that even if changes were agreed upon by all competent authorities and the Sangha therefore unanimous how far are such changes to go and when will this changing ever stop
This question among all other considerations here has always deterred Theravada Elders from effecting any changes
Ven
Chao Khun Sasana Sobhana writing in Siam recently says The argument of the Theravada Buddhists against the revision of the Vinaya is that while it is true that towards the end of his life the Buddha did give permission to his disciples to suspend the minor rules the First Council was not able to reach an agreement as to what 'minor rules' signified They have thus remained in the Patimokkha until the present time and have thus ensured that the standard of conduct and the direction of the training have remained the same as they were in the Buddha time
Ven
Paññavaddho in his review of the Bangkok edition of The Patimokkha has written It has been said by some people that in this modern day and age some or many of the rules are archaic restrictive or otherwise undesirable in the greatly altered circumstances of modern civilization
But it must be remembered that the Vinaya with the Patimokkha as its basis has maintained stability in the Sangha since the time of Lord Buddha
Finally there is a consideration based upon the nature of the training and the end which it has in view
From the Buddhatime down to the present it has been found that a careful application of the Vinaya's principles by a bhikkhu in his life promotes his practice and understanding of Dhamma Vinaya leads to restraint restraint to the absence of remorse absence of remorse leads to joy joy to delight delight to tranquility tranquility leads to happiness happiness to collectedness collectedness to knowledge and vision of the truly existent knowledge and vision of the truly existent to revulsion revulsion to dispassion dispassion to freedom freedom to knowledgeandvision of freedom and knowledgeofvision to freedom leads to Nibbana free from substrata 
When Vinaya has been so formulated as to guide a bhikkhu to the goal of Nibbana who shall entertain thoughts altering it
It is we who have to change by our practice of DhammaVinaya to come up to its level and not to expect it to change for us
In this connection there is a little fable
At one time there was a great and flourishing tree standing as it had stood for many many hundreds of years
It was so beautiful that men and women bringing their children would come from scores of miles about to gaze in wonder at its perfect and majestic shape
Under its mighty spread of branches multitudes could sit down enjoying its cool shade
Even animals would come and delight themselves according to their several habits some upon the grass beneath and some sporting amid the profusion of leaves flowers and fruits
And such flowers of such fragrance  no one knew where else their like might be found
And such fruits as this tree bore and in such abundance
No wonder that they are called best highest foremost and supreme among all fruits produced by other trees
So the seasons and the years rolled by and still the mighty tree stood hardly changed for where one branch died off another grew to replace it
The delight of many beings visible and invisible was in the health and long life of this ancient tree
Then in accordance with the change inherent in things fashions changed and trees in their natural vigor were no longer praised but trimmed and artificiallyshaped trees were thought more beautiful
Agitation began among some men for the tree to be shaped up according to modern taste
Eventually due to debased ideas of people by that time loppers and clippers tried their hands upon the millennial giant
Branch after branch fell loaded with flowers and bearing fruits
Never mind they said it will look much better when we have finished Before long the tree was pruned into the form of a perfect cube and this was regarded by almost everyone with satisfaction
Only a few ignorant people regretted the sawnoff limbs and bare branches with a few clusters of leaves left here and there
These illeducated persons were heard regretting the lack of any shade
How stupid of them
It is needless to say that the venerable tree flowered and bore fruit no more and due to shock died shortly afterwards leaving only its great but dead framework which then became an object for the speculative theses of numerous men of books
Thus it is that most bhikkhus generally would not talk of changing but of tampering with the Vinaya
After all when closely examined many proposals to bring about changes in the body of Vinaya are found to be based upon the roots of unskill
A simple case will illustrate this A bhikkhu experiences pangs of hunger in the evening which cause him to announce that he does not believe in strictly following Vinaya in this respect since this would be an extreme of selftorture the climate is too cold modern times demand a change I follow Mahayana  or one of a thousand such excuses
He accordingly proposes that the training rule regarding not taking food afternoon and before dawn be abolished
After all he reasons it is only a pacittiya offense  nothing much Meanwhile he has a good supper every night not only his belly but also his greed that root of unskill are thoroughly satisfied
If the former is a little distended the latter is certainly greatly increased while the spirit of renunciation has fled from his dwelling
And of course where greed is increased so automatically is aversion and dullness and so on
Anyone  whether bhikkhu or layman  who holds such a view or reasoning concerning his training rules as the imaginary bhikkhu above actually makes for himself a real stumblingblock upon his own path
The mental attitude of thinking Oh it does not matter it's only a little thing is one to watch since it appears at the gate of the wide and easy path leading downwards
Such slack ways of thinking really urged on by some hidden craving are just the reverse of the disciplined scrupulousness upon which so much stress is laid in the Vinaya
Slackness and strictness in regard to the Vinaya are not to be associated in any wholesale fashion with this yana or that vada
In Theravada as in other Buddhist traditions there are those bhikkhus who are strict as well as those who are slack
Wherever there is a good Teacher who is concerned with the practical application of the Dhamma there the Vinaya will be carefully followed
But where neither such a Teacher nor a good Vinaya tradition are found there undisciplined behavior will result with a victory for notDhamma
One important principle to remember about the Vinaya is that a life based upon its principles is very different from the ordinary life
The Vinaya guides a bhikkhu in conducting himself so as to go against the stream and his life and way of doing things is often opposed to the ways of one who enjoys the five strands of sensepleasures Take food again as an example
An ordinary person not undertaking any religious discipline may eat his mind delighted by senseimpressions of taste smell color and so forth and probably therefore overwhelmed with greed
He may chatter with others and if the food is delicious overeat
Restraint and mindfulness by contrast are the marks of a good bhikkhu taking his food which he regards as medicine to keep his body going and should greed arise he uses the meditation upon the loathsomeness of food to dissolve it
He talks but little has his senses under control and eats only moderately
The reason for this difference of attitude is not hard to see
One who is blown about by the winds of craving throughout his life not understanding kamma and its fruits and therefore not grasping the meaning of dukkha is set on no sure course and wins little advantage in his or her life as a human being
One who wishes to become a bhikkhu on the other hand has determined upon a definite course of action which is given guidance by the Vinaya and his practice of it after his acceptance
The Dhammapada emphasizes this
It may be that some of the training rules to be dealt with below will seem strange and complicated  even unnecessary
They are unnecessary for a layman but they have a definite part in the life of a bhikkhu and help him generally in developing that scrupulousness which is so essential to bhikkhulife
For this reason laypeople who are so fortunate as to be able to invite a good bhikkhu to their towns should be truly pleased to help him keep the Vinaya
Those who do this which is the doing of what is a little difficult and therefore requires effort but bears splendid fruit are themselves undertaking the training rightly
A bhikkhu such as the verses below depict is really worthy of help and support
In the following Vinaya information useful to laymen most emphasis will be upon the offenses incurred in certain situations by bhikkhus and how laypeople can help them avoid these together with remarks upon the customary conduct of laypeople in the presence of a bhikkhu
As in Buddhist countries the laypeople's code of manners and conduct is much influenced by the seventyfive trainings a group of rules kept by both bhikkhus and samaneras it seems appropriate to include this matter here
The writer has for the sake of easy reference gathered the various points some suggested through the kindness of others under five headings Greetings Livingquarters Food and Drink Travel and General Conduct
In the Conclusion are set out some observations upon the way bhikkhus are regarded by the laypeople of Siam at the present time
It is generally felt in Buddhist countries that the common western form of greeting the handshake is unsuitable when greeting bhikkhus
The point here is that a bhikkhu must avoid all body contact with women
Since if lust arose in him he could be embroiled in a heavy offense entailing formal meeting
For these reasons it is obvious that the handshake is not a suitable greeting and in the case of a bhikkhu if one has invited him knowing that he has knowledge and experience of Dhamma which is not one's own then greeting by handshake will not express one's willingness to learn as well as do the traditional gestures
In a public place a bhikkhu is traditionally welcomed and parted by action of añjali inclining the head and sometimes the body
This position of the hands is associated in theistic religions with prayer but its use and meaning in Buddhist tradition is rather different
Here given space one might elaborate a little upon relationships of mentality with materiality and the reverse
Suffice it to say that there are certain gestures and positions of the body which lead to the arising maintenance or increase of skillful and concentrated mental states
We are concerned here with two of them action of añjali and what is usually called prostration but which we prefer to call the fivepointrest or lowering the body
Of these action of añjali is commonly seen when laypeople greet bhikkhus at stations in the streets within a hall or other public place
The amount of respect thus accorded to a particular bhikkhu tends to be expressed by the height at which the hands are held and the angle at which the head and body are inclined
However any exaggerated form of añjali is disliked and not encouraged since it usually expresses some mental strain in the mind of the persons making it
What has been said here also applies to all novices and junior bhikkhus when respecting their seniors in the Sangha
It is also widely used by Buddhist lay people when greeting each other
Another point which should be mentioned and which applies both to action of añjali and fivepoint rest is that the action of respecting one who knows Dhamma by one who wishes to learn is for the benefit of the latter
Through associations with prayer which will be present on many western minds it is often assumed that these actions when performed by Buddhists are act s of propitiation or are somehow for the benefit of whoever is on the receiving end
This is indeed very far from the truth since even when Lord Buddha was teaching he said But also bhikkhus if others should speak in praise of me in praise of the Dhamma or in praise of the Sangha you should not on that account be filled with pleasure and gladness or be lifted up in mind that also would become a danger to your own selves
This is certainly true of good bhikkhus of the present who will know that to have a mind that is stuck in the desire of praise and honor which is one of the eight worldly conditions is also one of the marks of an ignorant worldly person and far from the ideal of the Noble Disciple to which he aspires
Thus a bhikkhu does not teach the advantages of the action of añjali and fivepoint rest because he wants to be honored but because these things are skillful ways of conduct and increase the puñña of those performing them
According to a famous verse this puñña increases in four ways
Just as a bhikkhu will honor the feet by the fivepoint lowering before his preceptor teacher or any elder bhikkhu or at shrines and in temples where there are Buddhaimages so do lay people lower themselves to their bhikkhuteacher of Dhamma
This they generally do in a relatively quiet and enclosed space such as temple bhikkhu's lodging or in their own houses where they may have invited bhikkhus for teaching chanting or for making puñña by giving gifts
At the time when they respect a Buddhaimage their Teacher or other bhikkhus in either of these ways they encourage their children to do likewise thus early inculcating a sense of respect which is bound to bear good fruits in the future
Happiness and peace characterize the faces of those who perform these acts of reverence with care
After all is not happiness associated with an absence of mental strains
Some laypeople however do these things carelessly so that they become unmindful of their meaning and benefits but those who really aspire to make progress on the Path never do so unmindfully however often they have cause to greet with the añjali or lower the body in the fivepoint rest
In the West where these customs are not established among Buddhists and where bhikkhus are in any case very few in number carelessness is not likely to be a hindrance although there is another one which deserves a little attention
Among some people one finds what amounts to a strong aversion to the practice of lowering the body
It may be that they hold some wrong view perhaps an unconscious trait persisting from Protestant Christianity
Perhaps it may be connected with the idea dealt with above that the other requires or expects to be worshipped or perhaps compounded with some view which is like a smokescreen put out to conceal the true cause for objection  which is pride
It is the head which contains the eyes ears nose tongue many touch organs and that agglomeration of nerve tissue called the brain a circumstance which powerfully reinforces the idea of ego
That this topmost and splendid piece of apparatus should be lowered to the ground at the feet of another will naturally cause the mental strain of pride to object and perhaps to put out a smokescreen It's not part of our culture It's only an eastern custom etc
The modern world manages most successfully to stimulate all the mental stains in man
Among them the mental stain of pride is fostered by such notions as I'm as good as any man As far as the training in DhammaVinaya is concerned such ideas do not apply and it is the humble man who goes forward not he who is stiff with pride and therefore has no chance to learn
A Tibetan work Trees and Water puts it like this Just as the branch adorned with good fruits is bent down beneath their weight so a wise man's mind adorned with all qualities is bent downwards with humility and calm and knows no pride
just as the fruitless branch of a tree has the nature to grow aloft so the head of the haughty man is always held high for his heart is not humble
The traditional position of lowering the body cannot be excelled for encouraging humility
It is known as the fivepoint lowering since in making it five points are on the ground the forehead the two forearms the two knees
It is common for bhikkhus to acknowledge respectful salutation in either of these ways by saying Sukhi hotu and in Siam often Ayu vañño sukham balam
In English May you be happy seems very suitable since all Dhamma practices undoubtedly bring happiness
What has been written here has only been set down with a view that laypeople should understand as bhikkhus and samaneras have been taught to understand what is truly beneficial
Neither Lord Buddha nor any teacher in Buddhist tradition has ever prescribed that this or that sort of greeting for bhikkhus must be made
There is actually no rigid formality about this at all and much the same course of individual conduct applies in a Buddhist country like Siam as commonly applies in the days of Lord Buddha Having approached some lowered themselves before the Lord and sat down to one side some greeted the Lord politely and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way sat down to one side some by their 'action of añjali' to the Lord sat down to one side some proclaimed their name and clan and sat down while others without saying anything just sat down likewise The commentary upon this frequently recurring passage in the Suttas makes it quite clear however that those who greeted him with humility reaped ample fruits while those who just sat down were people with minds beset by pride false views and the rest
The information gathered here and elsewhere in this book is the writer believes very difficult to come by in other works
Yet this is standard practice in the East where it never has to be explained since people are in contact with living tradition
As and when readers also make contact with a living Buddhist tradition it will also be useful for them
In a Buddhist country when a bhikkhu has cause to go to some place where there is no vihara he will probably stay in a house with laypeople
If they are reasonably wealthy a small room will have been set aside by them as a family shrine and in this the bhikkhu will be invited to stay study meditate and sleep
It is customary that only bhikkhus are invited to sleep in a shrineroom no member of the family doing so that room being reserved at other times for puja and meditation
If Buddhists in other lands are able to set aside such a room for their own special devotion and practice it may prove very useful when they are able to welcome a bhikkhu
Its position in the house must of course be decided by circumstances but relative quietness is a consideration and it is preferable to have it upon an upper floor
In houses where gardens contain a small detached outbuilding this will be even more suitable
There are some offenses into which a bhikkhus may fall regarding his place of lodging
The first is that he cannot sleep in the same room with one who is not fully ordained as a bhikkhu except for a limited period of three nights while a second training rule states should any bhikkhu sleep along with a woman this entails expiation The commentary takes this to mean under the same roof but as this will cause much inconvenience it should rather be taken that he should have a room to himself away from one in which a woman sleeps
There is here the consideration seen in many places in the Vinaya that not only should a bhikkhu be able to maintain his special mode of life with ease but also that his repute the reputation of the Sangha as a whole and of course the good name of the Dhamma should in no way suffer not even from those who might invent and spread malicious gossip
For these reasons strict bhikkhus are most circumspect in their meetings with women while wellinformed women in Buddhist lands help a bhikkhu by their modest and careful behavior to keep to his code of discipline
In the handling of certain things there are offenses for a bhikkhu these therefore need not be left about in his place of residence
In this list there are both animate and inanimate
Thus women and girls however small are included here it being an offense for him to touch one even though his mind is quite free from sensual intentions
Thus women keep their distance from the bhikkhu and avoid actions which could lead him to come into contact with them
It may be emphasized once again that this is simply for the good of the bhikkhu concerned who since arahants are not easily met with is still capable of experiencing lust
Lord Buddha's teachings as one soon sees are always realistic
Women's clothes and articles of jewelry and cosmetics also cannot be touched by him
Neither can female animals dolls or money
Regarding money there are some bhikkhus who are of the opinion that this training rule cannot be kept in the modern world they are willing to handle it for their own transport
Laypeople are also heard to criticize bhikkhus who do not agree to handle money on the grounds that this impedes the work of spreading Dhamma
On the other hand there are traditions where bhikkhus bear in mind that this is an offense of expiation with forfeiture while Lord Buddha has I do not say O bhikkhus that in any way may gold or silver be consented to may be looked about for The Second Sangayana ruled that it was inadmissible for bhikkhus to possess money and referred to the training rule in the Patimokkha
Where this rule is fully adhered to laypeople do not therefore give money to bhikkhus nor expect them to carry it
Money can be made available for the use of a bhikkhu but not given to him
Such money which is called after that which it purchases the four supports remains the property of the donor but is kept by the bhikkhu's steward or attendant to be used whenever this becomes necessary
At the time when such four supports are made available the donor may say to a bhikkhu I invite you sir with this sum of for the four supports at the same time handing that amount to the bhikkhu's steward
Or a bhikkhu may receive from the hand of a layman a slip of paper reading I invite you with the four supports equal in amount to the sum of which has already been handed to the steward
As you have need of it please request it from him Whatever is needed is then bought by the steward from that money
In this tradition a bhikkhu has no money troubles and may leave such affairs to his steward
He is thus free from thoughts on having only a little and not troubled by thoughts of what he will buy if there be much money
He can therefore concentrate on the work of Dhamma and Vinaya which he has chosen as his life
Other items which it is not allowable for a bhikkhu to touch include fruits weapons poisons nets and snares seeds and musical instruments
Generally he will have no need of radio or television either
Perhaps one of the bestknown training rules of the bhikkhu concerns his not eating between midday and dawn it is an offense for him even to touch food  let alone eat it  during this period which is called the wrongtime Laypeople keeping the eight precepts upon Uposatha days or at other times have basically the same discipline
As the sixth precept they recite I undertake the training rule refraining from eating at the wrong time A samanera has also to keep this precept every day while he commits himself to observe the ten training rules for novices
It has many advantages both for the bhikkhu and samanera as well as for laypeople
The former benefit since they have free time thoughts not concerned with food and lightness of the body which is suitable for study meditation and so on
As for the latter they are not burdened by having to prepare food for bhikkhus at night
Although not included among the heavy offenses this training rule will not be broken by the scrupulous bhikkhu since its breaking implies giving way to craving losing the spirit of renunciation encumbering the stomach and hence making minddevelopment more not less difficult
The right time for bhikkhus to eat begins when the day is light enough to see the lines on the palms of one's hand and ends at noon
During this time a bhikkhu may eat once or twice
If the former then an adequate quantity of food is needed to last for twentyfour hours while if he eats twice the second meal is usually served about quarter past eleven so as to finish well before noon
There are very few dietary restrictions and these are reasonable ruling out the consumption of certain animals' flesh and also that of human beings
Here we may briefly consider the question of meat in relation to the bhikkhu
The word bhikkhu is derived from the root bhikkh  to beg
Although a bhikkhu when he goes out to obtain almsfood does not beg since he is not allowed to ask for food still he is largely dependent upon whatever is put into his bowl
After he has returned to the vihara he may if he wishes select whatever vegetable foods he has been given and eat only that
In this respect it is proper to remember that when Devadatta requested Lord Buddha for a ruling that bhikkhus should abstain from flesh the latter did not agree to rule thus saying And the eating of flesh that is pure in three respects that is to say that the eater has not seen heard or suspected that it has been killed is allowable There is also the Discourse to Jivaka on the same subject and the oftquoted Amagandha Discourse in which the evils of illconduct in so many ways are pointed out as much more harmful than the eating of meat
We may summarize by saying that as far as his almsround is concerned a bhikkhu receives whatever is offered without discrimination
If he wishes to be a vegetarian he may choose from among the food placed in his bowl although where he receives only little this will be very difficult for him
In any case whether almsfood or that brought to the vihara by laysupporters he cannot ask for this or that kind of food unless he is ill when it is allowable to do so
In countries where the almsround is not possible a bhikkhu or a sangha of bhikkhus will be dependent upon laypeople who agree to give support
Where a number of bhikkhus are staying laypeople will organize the buying cooking and offering of food in the way most convenient to them and in accordance with the Vinaya
There is no need for food offered by them to be special but it should be nutritious
Therefore laypeople should not ask Do you like or What shall we cook for you today The bhikkhu tradition is to accept whatever laypeople wish to offer from the food they have themselves in this way being as little trouble as possible to householders of whom it is as true now as it was in Lord Buddha's days that they have a lot to do
A bhikkhu cannot go to a restaurant or shop and buy or order food
Nor can he personally store food overnight
Once food has been formally offered to him it must be consumed by him before noon or else left for laypeople to finish
Again a bhikkhu cannot cook for himself
Storing or cooking may however be done by a samanera or by a laydisciple in the vihara
The principle underlying these three training rules is that greed everready to spring up where food is concerned should of course be discouraged while the bhikkhu's dependence upon laypeople is greatly stressed
He is taught to reflect everyday 'My life is dependent upon others'  this should frequently be reflected on by one gone forth
We should now deal briefly with the formal offering of food and other items to bhikkhu
It is a slight offense for a bhikkhu intentionally to touch  let alone consume  food or drinks which have not been offered
The reason lying behind this rule is not difficult to see
A bhikkhu is always very careful to avoid any act which could even be interpreted as approaching an offense of defeat
Taking what is not given with intent to steal is a defeatoffense and even if he has not fallen completely into this he may have a grave offense to confess
Hence the importance of formal offering
This offering is done by placing into his hands every item to be consumed except these things be on a tray when this may be offered
A layman raises from the table plates and dishes bearing food with both hands or with the left hand touching the right wrist when the item concerned is a small one and gives each one into the hands of the bhikkhu
If there are a number of bhikkhus the most senior is offered food first and the others in due order afterwards
It is not necessary to offer food into the hands of samaneras as this training rule does not apply to them
Having completed the offering a layman will usually salute with añjali and then take a seat a little to one side waiting to see whether he can be of any further help
He should not after having placed the food into the hands of bhikkhus touch it again if he does so that food or drink must be reoffered Should he receive anything from the hands of a bhikkhu whether it is food or such things as paper or books etc it is again skillful training for the layman to salute with añjali before taking it
Due to the training rules above bhikkhus cannot share food from the same dishes as those being used by laypeople and it is customary to give them their food apart
In a family this could be just one end of the table while in any lay assembly where many are dining bhikkhus should have a table specially set aside for them
Samaneras since they do not have the acceptance into the Sangha as bhikkhus cannot share food with the latter and should be given separate food they traditionally eat sitting elsewhere
As honored guests in the houses of laypeople bhikkhus are offered their food before the family sits down to eat or when there is not time for this their food is first formally offered to them before the others eat
Since it is an offense for a bhikkhu to eat or drink standing he should always be offered a seat
He cannot therefore take food buffetstyle since eating is for him a serious matter a meditation and not an occasion for delight or gossip
So far we have referred to a layman offering the food but the case is different when a laywoman makes the offering
A bhikkhu does not receive anything directly from the hands of a woman but she may place whatever is to be offered upon the small receivingcloth which a bhikkhu carries
Once she has placed it upon this cloth it is considered to be offered into his hands
In formulating such ways of conduct as these the theras of the first Sangayana have been most careful to guard against physical contact between the sexes so that no possibility of slander or of infatuation might arise
One may here remember the opening suttas of Anguttara Nikaya O bhikkhus I do not perceive at all any other form which thus stands taking hold of the mind of man as does this the form of woman sound scent taste the touch of woman
O bhikkhus I do not perceive at all any other form which thus stands taking hold of the mind of woman as does this the form of man sound scent taste touch of man These words of Lord Buddha find practical expression in the Vinaya training rules for both bhikkhus and for bhikkhunis
As regards placing food into a bhikkhu's bowl which is in his hands whether he is standing as on the almsround or sitting in a layman's house there is no difference between the way it is done by a layman and a laywoman
Nor does the bowl have to be offered to him since it is in his hands
Other articles besides food and drink which should be offered to him include anything which will go inside the body such as medicines
Also his bowl robes and other requisites if they are touched by laypeople as these are then considered to be out of his possession
Upon occasions of making puñña when bhikkhus are invited the gifts which are offered to them by the laity such as flowers incense candles medicines and any other items useful for their lives may also be formally offered
If such an occasion is during the wrongtime and laypeople wish to offer food in tins or jars these things cannot be placed into his hands or accepted by him but intimation is made to the bhikkhus of its offering and it is put aside to be kept by a samanera or laydisciple
Such small points as these constitute not only a discipline for bhikkhus but also for the laity who may thereby grow in carefulness
It was emphasized above that offering whether by a layman or laywoman is made with both hands
This is not simply some sort of ritual but has a very good reason behind it
When one gives something in the ordinary way the giving is done with one hand if the object permits it
This kind of giving may as a fact become habitual in the sense that one is not aware any more of giving and from a Buddhist point of view this shows slackness of mind and lack of care
Now bhikkhus who are striving on the Path of DhammaVinaya are said to be a good field for puñña  that is the results to be expected from giving to them as they strive towards Nibbana leading a pure life are great indeed and will result in clarity and peace increasing in the hearts of the donors
Thus it becomes important when making offerings to bhikkhus whether of their daily food or upon some special occasion to make the offering consciously with a strong intention of giving
The stronger the intention which is here skillful kamma the greater the fruits of happiness reaped by the donors
So that laypeople are reminded to make this givingintention strong they are instructed to offer with both hands  an act which requires more forethought than the usual ways of giving
Respect is also expressed in this method of offering and it is also used by new bhikkhus and samaneras when presenting anything to their teachers or preceptors
The meal having been consumed a bhikkhu chants briefly verses of wellwishing for the laity
It is actually an offense of wrongdoing for him not to do so if laypeople are present
The least which is done will be for a senior bhikkhu to say a few words such as Longlife and beauty happiness and strength
Whether laypeople have also finished eating or whether they have not yet begun at least the donor will sit quietly with folded hands listening to these words or verses of wellwishing
Every word of the Pali verses may not be understood but it is more important that the mind should be concentrated upon the chanting to the exclusion of everything else
A mindful and concentrated mind is always full of skillfulness
Frequently such chants as are translated below form the core of wellwishing
At the close of the chanting it is the custom in many places to say Sadhu sadhu and then to raise the hands in añjali to the forehead to lower the body
Sadhu means it is well and is an expression of delighted approval heard everywhere in Buddhist countries when a deed of puñña has been done such as giving helping listening to Dhamma and so forth
As regards drinking a bhikkhu may not drink distilled or fermented intoxicants
Before noon any other drink may be offered to him with or without milk
After twelve o'clock noon it is not allowable for him to take milk cereals eggs etc nor any kind of soup
He may be offered any fruit juice or any of the bottled soft drinks which are now common
The five medicines allowable over a period of seven days may also be taken by him if he is indisposed
The first of these ghee is generally not available outside India but the other four are common butter vegetable oil honey molasses
If more of these is accepted by him than he can consume in one evening it may be kept by him for seven days at most
Any remaining after this time he cannot consume without falling into an offense
It is thus common for these medicines to be kept by a samanera or laydisciple to be offered as they are needed
Tea coffee and cocoa are also allowable during the afternoon and evening
With these allowable drinks and fortified in any case by having few desires and some ability to endure bhikkhus sustain themselves for study practice or teaching
Since a bhikkhu keeping strictly to the Vinaya will not handle money if he is being invited to teach or to stay it is customary in Buddhist countries for a layman to come and fetch him
Where distance prevents this train tickets may be bought and sent to him
If the journey is a long one he may be accompanied by a laydisciple who will buy tickets and the bhikkhu's food at the right time
When he is traveling alone it is usual to meet him at the station
A bhikkhu commits an offense if he makes an arrangement to go on a journey with a woman so that if he is accompanied his companion must be a man
This is another provision to prevent offenses and to stop the wagging of slanderous tongues
When the bhikkhu travels by car a woman should not sit beside him though of course a man may do so
It is preferable that he does not travel in a car with only a woman who is driving
There are also several places to which it is not proper to take bhikkhus such as the following which are called the wrong resort for bhikkhus namely crowded places or places of entertainment theaters concert halls cinemas stadiums gamesfields exhibitions fairs casinos nightclubs brothels army parades and even fields of battle
It is commonsense that bhikkhus have no need for the various sorts of sensestimulation provided by such places
In Buddhist countries such as Siam the general conduct of laypeople in the presence of bhikkhus is molded upon the discipline followed by bhikkhus and samaneras when they are in the presence of theras
Much of this code of good conduct is contained in the articles of the seventyfive Trainings found in the Patimokkha
Rather than comment upon all these we may select the most important groups of points for outline explanation
Buddhist laypeople living in Siam have a good chance to acquaint themselves with the details of this conduct since they can at any time go to a Wat where Vinaya is well observed and see for themselves how bhikkhus do things
They have another chance also not available to most Western Buddhists for the custom here is that most young men ask for temporary ordination over periods of time ranging from one to four months
While they are in the robes they learn among other things how to conduct themselves in the manner proper to those that have gone forth
Every day they receive instruction in the Vinaya which includes of course the seventyfive Trainings
Not only that for these Trainings while they constitute only small offenses when broken actually are very important since they cover events of everyday occurrence such as walking sitting wearing robes eating teaching and listening to Dhamma
When these temporarilyordained monks disrobe and return to their homes they take with them experience of a good discipline and it is this which becomes the basis for lay conduct in the presence of bhikkhus
As this training in good conduct applies to contact between laypeople and bhikkhus almost as much as it does between junior bhikkhus and theras there is a considerable basis for common understanding and hence concord
What sort of things are included in this training
First we may mention regulation of the body in the four positions the first of these being walking
When walking in company with a bhikkhu a layperson will walk somewhat behind him rather than immediately at his side and certainly not push in front always giving way to him where this is necessary
This is particularly important if the bhikkhu is talking Dhamma when it will be an offense for him to follow behind a layperson or to walk to one side of the path while doing so
The ancient Buddhist tradition from India prescribes that one should as a mark of respect keep one's right side towards one's teacher the right side of the body being symbolically that associated with conscious effort and general skillfulness in conduct
If a bhikkhu is sitting and a layman has occasion to pass in front of him it is good training in mindfulness to stoop the body and head and perhaps say something like Excuse me sir Again if a layman or woman should enter a room where a bhikkhu is sitting and perhaps talking Dhamma with others he or she usually performs the action of añjali or lowers the body according to what is suitable before sitting down
In standing one should not stand upon a higher step or level than a bhikkhu and talk to him
We have in the English the phrase to look up to implying respect and if one is learning Dhamma that is what one should do literally as well as figuratively
Standing one does not stand too near or too far but at the right distance
One's hand should be clasped in front and one's body controlled while talking to a bhikkhu
In Buddhist countries agreement or questions are accompanied by the action of añjali in the case of talking to a senior bhikkhu
All these bodily actions help one to correct the mind and ensure that it is functioning in a way proper for the reception of Dhamma
Should the bhikkhu be barefooted as is often the case in the East a lay person with shoes on will not talk to him but remove his or her shoes first
This is because it is an offense for him to talk dhamma to one who is wearing shoes when he is not though this situation is not likely to occur in the cold countries of the West
When sitting especially if Dhamma is the subject of a bhikkhu's speech one should sit attentively and not sprawling in a chair
It is also against the spirit of the Vinaya for a bhikkhu to teach Dhamma to one who is smoking
However smoking is bound to distract from listening to Dhamma and is often a sign of unmindful or tense states of mind
All such conditions are opposed to the profitable and attentive hearkening with which Dhamma should be received
Dhamma is so important so valuable that it becomes an offense for a bhikkhu to teach it to anyone who shows by his bodily position that his mind is not concentrated to receive it
The body should be controlled when sitting such that the feet are tucked in under a chair with the back reasonably erect and hands placed comfortably in the lap
In sitting down a layperson is careful to notice whether the chair he is about to sit upon has a bhikkhu's robe upon it
If so he will sit elsewhere or else remove the robe offering it to the bhikkhu
As the robe is a symbol of pure life in Dhamma it is never sat upon or leaned against by laypeople
A seat taken by a layman or woman should not be higher than that used by the bhikkhu and if several people are seated on the ground a bhikkhu should be given a separate mat to sit upon
All these sorts of things are also observed by good bhikkhus in the presence of their teachers and other theras and make for a spirit of respect and harmony
Then in lying down laymen if they do so in the same room as a bhikkhu will never point their feet at him
Nor for that matter will any Buddhist whether in robes or wearing white lie down with his feet pointing towards any respected or sacred object in a room such as Buddhaimages stupas pictures of the Buddha or of any teacher alive or dead Buddhist scriptures and so on
The head is always placed in their direction and usually before lying down a triple lowering is made to any shrine etc which happens to be in the room
On the same principles as those set out above if a bhikkhu is sitting a layperson does not talk to him standing but after lotussing or lowering the body sits down to talk while if a bhikkhu is standing a layman will stand to talk with him
It is part of the reasonableness of this training that almost none of the usual lay conduct mentioned here is performed if a layperson is ill
If one approaches a bhikkhu to give something while he is sitting one's head should not be higher than his own and better lower
This avoids leaning over him and also helps the donor to give with a humble mind which in itself will bear good fruits
Generally in talking to bhikkhu one should try to avoid unsuitable subjects of discussion
Bhikkhus were several times rebuked by Lord Buddha for engaging in animaltalk which is defined by this quite common passage in the discourses Talk about kings and robbers ministers and armies danger and war eating and drinking clothes and dwellings garlands and scents relations vehicles villages and markets towns and districts women and heroes street talk talk by the well talk about those departed in days gone by idle chatter talk upon the world and the sea and also on gain and loss
When one comes to think about it this list covers most of the subjects to be found in our newspapers
A layman may also remember that right speech the third constituent of the Eightfold path is defined as restraint from lying slander rough speech and chatter
Nor is it suitable to ask a bhikkhu what food and drink he likes unless he is ill
Again it is not proper to ask about the attainments which he has won through his Dhammapractice
It is an offense of expiation for a bhikkhu to tell a layman even the truth regarding his own attainments and an offense of Defeat should he be tempted to lie saying that he has won what has not been won by him
Also among requests which are improper as they could embroil a bhikkhu in what is notDhamma are questions upon luck signs stars and palms
All this is called animalknowledge by Lord Buddha and he has made it an offense of wrongdoing for a bhikkhu to learn or to teach it
In this section also one might mention some special provision regarding the conduct of laywomen
For instance when coming to a bhikkhu for instruction in Dhamma it is proper if a man or boy accompanies the laywoman
Where this is not possible provided that there is another bhikkhu or samanera in the room when the teaching of Dhamma takes place there will be no offense for the bhikkhu
But he should not find himself alone with a woman in a room especially one into which others cannot see
Again women desirous of Dhammainstruction should not visit a bhikkhu after dusk but do so during the day
All these provisions are to guard individual bhikkhus against their own mental stains and so help them in their training thus being for the wellbeing of the Sangha and therefore since the Sangha guards and maintains the Dhamma for the good name of Dhamma too
Laywomen when visiting a vihara are therefore very modest whenever they have cause to speak to bhikkhus
Their dress should be modest and their persons devoid of ornaments while they address themselves to bhikkhus with humility
In so doing they help both themselves and the bhikkhus themselves by following the way of Dhamma which is to realize the impermanent unsatisfactory and unbeautiful nature of the body and the bhikkhus by remembering that most of those in the yellow robe have not yet conquered the mental stains
Those laypeople who are very well practiced and who have seen for themselves the immense value of Dhamma will in the presence of their teacher or other respected bhikkhus sit keeping their hands lotussed all the time
Faith and serene clarity of mind do after all increase in proportion to one's experience of Dhamma
Laypeople having this sort of deep appreciation of Dhamma after the action of añjali and the triple lowering are also seen to recite when their teacher or other bhikkhus are departing Excuse me venerable sir for all the faults I have committed through the three doors for these please forgive me
A second time venerable sir A third time venerable sir please forgive me Only those who have had the blessing of a personal teacher and who feel great reverence for him will feel like making this openingup of faults
It has been included here just because it is a very good practice
All who are not arahants have the stain of pride and will therefore grow in the Dhamma as this is lessened and genuine humility increased
This practice can sometimes be beneficial
The conduct of Buddhist laypeople in the West towards bhikkhus who are their teachers may in these matters vary somewhat with the customs of the country which are accepted as polite
It may be stressed once again that such behavior governed by mindfulness and wisdom is for the welfare of all who practice Dhamma
Finally a word may be said upon what a bhikkhu may do in connection with lay ceremonies and what he may not
Where there are numerous bhikkhus as in Siam they are frequently invited to the house of people for teaching chanting and upon occasions of making puñña
For instance at the time when a new house is occupied as well as the various anniversaries of birth and death
Their chanting of the words of Lord Buddha to the listening laypeople who sit with action of añjali and minds concentrated upon the chanting brings in this case peace and happiness
But it should not be thought that without the effort of hearkening on the part of the laypeople that blessing automatically results
Indeed bhikkhus and their chanting are in no way a vehicle for the bestowal of sacraments or blessings
What are sometimes written about as blessings in connection with bhikkhus' chanting would accurately be called wellwishings
In other words a bhikkhu's work is not that of a priest
Bhikkhus may be invited to chant stanzas of wellwishing before or after a marriage an occasion when the engaged or married couple jointly make puñña to ensure the success of their new life
However a bhikkhu cannot marry laypeople as do priests in other faiths
Should he do so he stands in danger of falling into a heavy offense the fifth of the formal meetings where acting as a gobetween either for a man to a woman or a woman to a man quite rules out the possibility of bhikkhus marrying others
Marriage in Buddhist countries is purely a laycontract between the parties undertaking it the ceremony being conducted by a senior layman this being ratified in various ways through some government agency
It now remains only to say a little about how bhikkhus are regarded by laypeople in Siam at the present time
In this matter as in so many others one may perceive two extremes and a profitable middle course
One sort of extreme attitude which is sometimes found is that of unqualified praise of certain bhikkhus
In the eyes of those laypeople who follow him he can absolutely do no wrong
It is as though they are bewitched by the yellow robe and out of faith will hear no word against their idol and see no imperfection in him
He is arahant a bodhisattva or by whatever other name they like to glorify him
Some amongst them out of delusion imagine that all those who wear the yellow robe are automatically arahants and so lavish a bhikkhu with praise such that if his head is not turned and his heart not corrupted by such flattery it will be a great wonder
Such sweet doses of spiritual praise are very liable to cause a personalitycult rather then devotion to the Triple Gem
The other extreme which is much less common is the sort of draininspector's attitude to a bhikkhu's life
It is the very critical probing examination of a bhikkhu and his way of doing things which springs out of the root of hatred
Slander is often employed as well so that small offenses of omission and commission by a bhikkhu become magnified into mountains of iniquity
Untrue stories are eagerly chewed over and added to the unwholesomeness and perhaps the people pride themselves upon the benefits which they are bringing about by making public what they regard as hidden crimes
In Siam neither of these two extremes is prevalent
People tend to be respectful of bhikkhus and samaneras but unless particularly devoted to a teacher do not lavish devotion upon those they do not know
There are after all about a quarter of a million men and boys wearing robes in Siam the quality of bhikkhus in such a large Sangha very naturally varies considerably
On the other hand laypeople generally shut their eyes to small faults of bhikkhus and rarely criticize
This is quite proper since criticism is of no avail unless it can raise the other from unskill to skill
A teacher has much power over both his monastic and lay disciples but a layperson rarely possesses such ability
It is well to reflect about kamma and how each person is  owner of kamma heir to kamma born of kamma bound by kamma determined by kamma  for such reflection cultivates equanimity
Each person trains himself a bhikkhu according to his knowledge and ability and a layman likewise
Thus we have all bhikkhus and laity alike a great debt of gratitude to Lord Buddha who has made known the training rules for bhikkhus founded upon these ten reasons
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
These words which are the opening lines of the Dhammapada were spoken by Gotama Buddha years ago
They illustrate the central theme of Buddhist teaching the human mind
Buddhism is probably the least understood of all major religions
Indeed from an Occidental viewpoint we might well question whether it warrants the title of religion
In the West we are accustomed to thinking of theology in terms of God revelation obedience punishment and redemption
The themes of creation worship judgment and immortality have been major concerns in the Christian heritage and are virtually inseparable from our concept of religion
Against such a cultural background Western man views Buddhism and in so doing unconsciously projects his own concepts values and expectations
Erroneously he perceives ceremonies and bowing as examples of worship or even idolatry
He may extol its scientific world view or abhor and condemn its atheism The Buddha is vaguely equated with God or Jesus and meditation is suspected of being a hypnotic approach to mysticism or an escape from reality
However such erroneous notions of the Dhamma the teaching of the Buddha are not entirely the result of Western ignorance and ethnocentrism
Before his demise the Buddha predicted that within a thousand years his doctrine would fall into the hands of men of lesser understanding and would thereby become corrupted and distorted
Such has been the case throughout much if not most of the Orient
Ritual has replaced selfdiscipline faith has replaced insight and prayer has replaced understanding
If the basis of Christianity is God the basis of Buddhism is mind
From the Buddhist viewpoint mind or consciousness is the core of our existence
Pleasure and pain good and evil time and space life and death have no meaning to us apart from our awareness of them or thoughts about them
Whether God exists or does not exist whether existence is primarily spiritual or primarily material whether we live for a few decades or live forever  all these matters are in the Buddhist view secondary to the one empirical fact of which we do have certainty the existence of conscious experience as it proceeds through the course of daily living
Therefore Buddhism focuses on the mind for happiness and sorrow pleasure and pain are psychological experiences
Even such notions as purpose value virtue goodness and worth have meaning only as the results of our attitudes and feelings
Buddhism does not deny the reality of material existence nor does it ignore the very great effect that the physical world has upon us
On the contrary it refutes the mindbody dichotomy of the Brahmans and says that mind and body are interdependent
But since the fundamental reality of human existence is the everchanging sequence of thoughts feelings emotions and perceptions which comprise conscious experience then from the viewpoint of early Buddhism the primary concern of religion must be these very experiences which make up our daily lives
Most significant of these are love and hate fear and sorrow pride and passion struggle and defeat
Conversely such concepts as vicarious atonement Cosmic Consciousness Ultimate Reality Buddha Nature and redemption of sins are metaphysical and hypothetical matters of secondary importance to the realities of daily existence
Therefore in Buddhism the most significant fact of life is the first noble truth the inevitable existence of dukkha
Dukkha is a Pali word embracing all types of displeasurable experience  sorrow fear worry pain despair discord frustration agitation irritation etc
The second noble truth states that the cause of dukkha is desire or craving
In various texts this cause is further explained as being threefold  greed hatred and delusion
Again on other occasions the Buddha divided the cause of suffering into five components  sensual lust anger sloth or torpor agitation or worry and doubt
On still other occasions he listed ten causes of dukkha  belief that oneself is an unchanging entity scepticism belief in salvation through rites rules and ceremonies sensual lust hatred craving for finematerial existence craving for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignorance
The Third Noble Truth states that dukkha can be overcome and the Fourth Truth prescribes the means by which this is achieved
Thus with the Fourth Noble Truth Buddhism becomes a technique a discipline a way of life designed to free people from sorrow and improve the nature of human existence
This aspect of the Dhamma is called the Noble Eightfold Path and includes moral teachings selfdiscipline development of wisdom and understanding and improvement of one's environment on both a personal and social level
These have been dealt with in previous writings and for the sake of brevity will not be repeated here
Suffice it to remind the reader that this essay is concerned with only one aspect of Buddhism the practice of meditation
The ethical practical and logical facets of the Teaching are covered in other publications
If the cause of suffering is primarily psychological then it must follow that the cure also is psychological
Therefore we find in Buddhism a series of mental exercises or meditations designed to uncover and cure our psychic aberrations
Mistakenly Buddhist meditation is frequently confused with yogic meditation which often includes physical contortions autohypnosis quests for occult powers and an attempted union with God
None of these are concerns or practices of the Eightfold Path
There are in Buddhism no drugs or stimulants no secret teachings and no mystical formulae
Buddhist meditation deals exclusively with the everyday phenomena of human consciousness
In the words of the Venerable Nyanaponika Thera a renowned Buddhist scholar and monk
Using just the conditions of life it finds Satipatthana does not require complete seclusion or monastic life though in some who undertake the practice the desire and need for these may grow
Lest the reader suspect that some peculiarity of the Western mind precludes Occidentals from the successful practice of meditation we should note also the words of Rear Admiral EH
Shattock a British naval officer who spent three weeks of diligent meditation practice in a Theravada monastery near Rangoon
Reading about meditation is like reading about swimming only by getting into the water does the aspiring swimmer begin to progress
So it is with meditation and Buddhism in general
The Dhamma must be lived not merely thought
Study and contemplation are valuable tools but life itself is the training ground
The following passages are attempts to put into words what must be experienced within oneself
Or in the words of the Dhammapada Buddhas only point the way
Each one must work out his own salvation with diligence Meditation is a personal experience a subjective experience and consequently each of us must tread his or her own path towards the summit of Enlightenment
By words we can instruct and encourage but words are only symbols for reality
Before discussing the techniques of meditation it is important that we first define its goals
That is why does one meditate
What does one hope to achieve
The ultimate goals of meditation are the ultimate goals of Buddhism ie realization of Nibbana and the abolition of dukkha or suffering
Nibbana however is beyond the realm of conceptualization and all other forms of normal human experience
Therefore we have no certainty that it exists until we ourselves have progressed to realizing it as a direct experience transcending logic and sense perception
Nibbana can thus be defined as that which is experienced when one has achieved ultimate moral and psychological maturation
Little more can be said
Therefore the Buddha said relatively little about Nibbana and instead directed most of his teachings towards two lesser goals which are empirical realities of readily demonstrable worth
These were first the increase enhancement and cultivation of positive feelings such as love compassion equanimity mental purity and the happiness found in bringing happiness to others
Secondly he advocated the relinquishment and renunciation of greed hatred delusion conceit agitation and other negative unwholesome states
As we gain in experience and selfunderstanding and as we acquire full appreciation for the nature and quality of our own feelings we find that the positive feelings are satisfying meaningful and wholesome experiences in and of themselves
That is they have their own inherent worth and intrinsic value independent of any world view or religious dogma
Conversely greed hatred lust etc are agitating discomforting experiences which when present preclude a full realization of the happiness born of love and equanimity
Thus the realization of positive feelings and relinquishment of negative feelings are the major goals and motivations of meditation
While Nibbana and an end of suffering are the primary goals of meditation and the realization of positive feelings is a secondary goal there are also several tertiary goals which must be achieved before the higher ones can be fully realized
These are nonattachment insight and concentration
Nonattachment is freedom from craving and freedom from infatuation for sensual experience
It is not a state of chronic apathy nor a denial of sense perception existence
Rather it is psychological liberation from our enslaving passions and our addictions to sensual and emotional pleasures Thus nonattachment is akin to freedom equanimity and serenity
Insight is a word with two meanings both of which are sought in Buddhist meditation
In its classical Buddhist usage insight means full awareness of the three characteristics of existence ie impermanence suffering and impersonality
Otherwise stated this means full realization of the fact that all things in the universe are temporary and changing the human psyche is no exception and thus is not an immortal soul and as a consequence suffering is always inevitable for no state of mind pleasant or unpleasant can endure forever
The word awareness is italicized here to distinguish it from mere conceptual knowledge which is usually insufficient to have lasting effect upon one's feelings and values
In its psychiatric usage insight means gaining awareness of those feelings motives and values which have previously been unconscious
Repressed feelings of guilt fear lust and hatred may lurk in the hidden recesses of our minds and unconsciously shape our lives until such time as they are brought into awareness
And unless they are brought into awareness we cannot effectively deal with them
In Buddhism this version of insight is included under the heading of mindfulness and will be discussed later
Concentration involves the ability to keep one's attention firmly fixed on a given subject for protracted periods of time thus overcoming the mind's usual discursive habit of flitting from subject to subject
As we shall see concentration is one of the earliest goals of Buddhist meditation
The initial endeavor in Buddhist meditation is to quiet the mind and enhance detachment and objectivity
For only when the mind has stilled its perpetual ruminating and has momentarily abandoned its fascination for sensory experience can it readily become aware of the unconscious feelings and motivations which shape our thoughts speech and behavior
Furthermore only with detached objectivity and its ensuing insights can we readily confront and renounce unwholesome feelings
On the other hand we do not achieve complete calmness and detachment so long as we harbor unwholesome feelings and unconscious emotional conflicts
Thus the process is reciprocal the more we quiet the mind the more we gain insight and relinquishment of undesirable feelings
The more we relinquish such feelings and resolve emotional conflicts the more we quiet the mind and approach perfect calmness detachment and objectivity
The obscuring of unconscious feelings by preoccupation with thoughts and actions is demonstrated in a variety of neurotic symptoms
Most characteristic are obsessive compulsive reactions these occur in persons who are desperately trying to repress overpowering impulses of fear anger lust or guilt
In order to achieve this repression they divert nearly all their attention to some repetitious mental or physical activity which is conducted in a compulsive ritualistic manner
If prevented from performing their defensive rituals they often become acutely anxious and even panic as their unconscious feelings begin to come into awareness
Less severe examples of the same defensive phenomena are seen in persons who are chronically anxious and are continuously focusing their worries on minor concerns of exaggerated importance such as unpaid bills social commitments and alleged physical ills
They too rarely relax and are forever busy with petty chores
These neurotic symptoms are strikingly similar to an increasingly common way of life in Western society
Our everexpanding populations with their accompanying advertising mass entertainment socializing industrialization and emphasis upon success sensuality and popularity have produced an environment in which we are forever bombarded with an increasing number of sensory and emotional stimuli
The opportunities for solitude and introspection have diminished to the point that now solitude is often viewed as either depressing or abnormal
This is not to assert that the majority of our citizens are involved in a frantic endeavor to escape from their inner selves
Such is no doubt the case with many but there still remains a sizeable percentage of people who are involved in the same frenzy only because they have conformed to the social norm and have been lured into a habitual fascination for television jazz sports and the countless other forms of readilyavailable entertainment
Such persons are not necessarily precluded from relative happiness and emotional wellbeing
The point to be made however is that the conditions of modern living are such as to pose several obstacles to successful meditation
These are threefold psychological material and social
These same obstacles are present to a lesser degree in traditionally Buddhist cultures and must be considered before discussing meditation itself
It is virtually impossible for a busy person with manifold worldly ambitions to suddenly and voluntarily quiet his mind to the point of removing all discursive thoughts
In a matter of minutes if not seconds the meditator will find himself either planning reminiscing or daydreaming
Therefore before one begins meditation some amount of moral development and selfdiscipline should be achieved
In the words of one of the Buddha's disciples
Well said brother Bhadda well said
Pleasing is your wisdom pleasing your insight excellent is your question
Those salutary rules of morality proclaimed by the Exalted One were proclaimed by him for the sake of cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness
In every Buddhist country only a minority of devotees undertake regular practice
The decision to meditate rests with each individual
Many wait until their later years when moral development has progressed and family obligations have been fulfilled
On the other hand meditation facilitates wisdom and morality and can be of benefit to the layman as well as the monk
In addition to adjusting one's daily routine and cultivating morality and wisdom it is often profitable to take a few minutes before each meditation to put one's mind in a receptive condition
This may be done by reflecting upon the goals and advantages of meditation or by reading or reciting some chosen passage of Buddhist literature or other appropriate writing
If drowsy a brisk walk may freshen one's mind and can also allow one to think over and mentally dispense with matters which might otherwise be distracting
Also if one has some necessary chores to perform which can be executed quickly and easily doing these beforehand will reduce their interference with meditation
Much has been written in both ancient and modern literature about the physical and environmental factors conducive to successful meditation
Mostly these are matters of common sense which each person must determine for himself on the basis of his own individual needs and predispositions
In the Visuddhimagga we read
Climate a cool climate suits one a warm one another
So when he finds that by using a certain food or by living in a certain climate he is comfortable or his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind more so then that food or that climate is suitable
Any other food or climate is unsuitable
Postures Walking suits one standing or sitting or lying down another
So he should try them like the abode for three days each and that posture is suitable in which his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind more so
Any other should be understood as unsuitable
Seclusion and isolation from noise are important considerations especially for beginners
In an urban environment complete seclusion is rarely possible but even relative seclusion is of value
How this is achieved must be determined by the practitioner's individual opportunities and circumstances
The time and duration of meditation will also vary with individual situations
Ideally one should choose a time when one's mind is alert
Fifteen to fortyfive minutes is recommended for lay beginners and many persons are of the opinion that it should be at the same time each day preferably in the early morning
A good night's sleep and moderation in eating are valuable but one should avoid an excess of fasting and sleep
The preferred posture in both Asia and the West is the lotus posture or similar positions of sitting on the ground with legs folded
A cushion or other padding is desirable for comfort
These positions furnish maximum physical stability without the need of a back rest or other devices and are especially suitable if one intends to remain alert and motionless for protracted periods of time
However many Occidentals are unaccustomed to this posture and are thus unable to assume it or can do so only with discomfort
With practice this difficulty is usually overcome otherwise one can meditate seated on a chair
The eyes either can be closed or resting on some neutral object such as a blank place on the ground or a simple geometric shape at a distance of three or four feet
In Burma meditation is discussed with interest and enthusiasm
Men of national fame will take a leave of absence to further their training and a practitioner is often greeted with the words And how are you progressing in your meditation
Have you reached such and such a stage yet
The antithesis is true in America where meditation is poorly understood in fact usually it is misunderstood
First of all the relinquishment of worldly pursuits for the sake of spiritual and psychological gain is foreign to the prevailing values of both capitalist and socialist societies
Secondly Americans often equate meditation with hypnotic trance mysticism or the occult
Consequently the Occidental practitioner may conceal his practice to avoid social ridicule and religious antagonism
This problem is compounded by the existence of various quasireligious and pseudoscientific cults which often attract neurotics and social misfits with promises of occult powers lasting happiness and physical health
Such organizations often claim esoteric meditations and speak favorably of Hinduism and Buddhism
Too often Western impressions of Buddhism are gained either through these sources and their associated literature or through the unfavorable descriptions given by proChristian books magazines and newspapers
As we shall see there are a variety of different meditation practices each intended for specific individual need
In traditionally Buddhist countries novices often seek a learned monk or meditation master and ask to be assigned a specific meditation subject
In the Occident this is virtually impossible
Competent meditation masters are few and far between and those masters who do visit our shores find that linguistic and cultural barriers prevent them from adequately appraising a novice's needs
Thus the Western Buddhist must fend for himself relying on his own judgment and proceeding sometimes by trial and error
Here again we should note the words of the Visuddhimagga
Not only do meditation requirements differ from person to person they also differ for the same person at different times
In the words of the Buddha
Monks suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put dry grass on it and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire  No venerable sir  So too monks when the mind is agitated that is not the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor or the happiness enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because an agitated mind cannot well be quieted by those states
When the mind is agitated that is the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor and the equanimity enlightenment factor
Why is that
Because an agitated mind can well be quieted by those states
There is no prescribed duration for the amount of time one should spend in meditation
The popular Western notion of Buddhist monks spending a lifetime with nearly every available moment dedicated to meditative seclusion is not supported by the recorded teachings of the Buddha nor the accounts of the daily activities of the Buddha and his followers
Nor is this the case with Theravada monks today except during temporary periods of intensive training
As with all other aspects of meditation the amount of time must be varied according to individual needs and circumstances
One final point must be made before proceeding to the techniques of meditation
It is simply this Meditation requires patience persistence and effort
For one who practices less than several hours a day lasting and notable progress can only be achieved by months if not years of endeavor
There are no short cuts or magical formulae
Consequently the aspiring practitioner should not expect quick results and before starting should decide if he sincerely intends to put forth the necessary time and effort
A decision not to meditate however in no way precludes one from progressing towards the same goals of insight nonattachment concentration etc
Their full realization requires formal meditation practice but relative success may be acquired at a slower pace through cultivation of one's moral and intellectual faculties
The seventh step of the Noble Eightfold Path is termed right mindfulness also called the four foundations of mindfulness and Satipatthana
The three terms are synonymous and encompass not only the most important aspects of Theravada meditation but also one of the most unique and important features of all Buddhism
A full explanation of mindfulness or Satipatthana is given in the Satipatthana Sutta which appears twice in the Pali canon
The Buddha begins the discourse as follows
This same message he repeated frequently
This same emphasis has persisted even to the present era in some sections of the Buddhist world as described by the Venerable Nyanasatta Thera
Thus it seems a paradox that most Western texts on Buddhism merely list right mindfulness as one of the steps of the Eightfold Path and say little more except to redefine it by such terms as right contemplation and right reflection The reason is probably twofold
First Satipatthana cannot be as concisely explained as the other seven steps for it is not a single step but includes instead several distinct meditation exercises
Second to be properly understood the Satipatthana Sutta must be examined from a psychological and psychiatric viewpoint
Most scholars of comparative religion are accustomed to approaching their studies from religious ethical or philosophical frames of reference but none of these orientations apply here
If this sutta alone was to be filed on the shelves of a public library it would most aptly be placed adjacent to the archives of eclectic psychiatry and would have little in common with the classic writings of religion and philosophy
Even psychology would not be an appropriate title for the sutta is not concerned with any theoretical or conceptual interpretation of the mind
It deals only with the empirical facts of conscious experience and prescribes the techniques for mental development
It is therefore not surprising that many Occidentals who have scanned the pages of the Satipatthana Sutta have judged it confusing meaningless and sometimes morbid
In addition to the two occurrences of the Satipatthana Sutta condensed versions of the same teaching appear several times in the Sutta Pitaka
The four parts of the four foundations of mindfulness are contemplation of the body contemplation of feelings contemplation of mind and contemplation of mental objects
The body contemplation is itself divided into six parts  breathing postures clear comprehension of action repulsiveness material elements and the cemetery meditations
The initial endeavor in Buddhist meditation is to calm and quiet the mind so that it is fully alert but has temporarily diminished the quantity of daydreaming planning reminiscing and all other forms of verbal and visual thinking
This goal can only be approached gradually and therefore the beginner should start his practice by focusing his attention on some quiet readily available rhythmic process
Respiratory movements are ideal for this purpose
Thus the first exercise of the sutta begins
The practitioner endeavors to keep his mind focused only on the act of breathing itself and not to think about breathing as a subject of intellectual contemplation
In other words one attempts to give full attention to the reality of immediate experience and not become involved in speculations or contemplations about reality
The theory is quite simple but the practice most difficult
In a typical case at the beginning of his meditation the novice directs his attention solely to the process of breathing
Then after a few seconds he inadvertently begins to think So far I am doing all right
My mind hasn't strayed from its subject But at this very moment he has strayed from his subject
For now he is not concentrating but thinking about concentrating
If he does not catch himself the stream of consciousness will proceed something as follows My mind hasn't strayed from its subject
I'm doing better than yesterday
I wonder why
Maybe it's because I've finished all of my letter writing
I wonder if Marvin will answer the letter I sent him
He hasn't Oh Oh
I've gotten off the subject
I'd better get back to it
But I'm not really back I'm just thinking about it
I wonder how long it will take me And so on it goes day after day week after week until the practitioner begins to wonder if he is not seeking the impossible
Yet the fact remains that many thousands living today have achieved this degree of concentration
With little short of amazement the Western novice reads the Venerable Nyanaponika Thera's remarks concerning Burmese Satipatthana training Three to four hours of continuous mindfulness ie without unnoticed breaks are regarded as the minimum for a beginner undergoing a course of strict practice
The most widely practiced form of the breathing meditation is focusing attention at the nostrils where one feels the faint pressure of the ebb and flow of the breath
This technique is not mentioned in any of the recorded teachings of the Buddha or his disciples but has been popular at least since the time of Buddhaghosa in the fifth century AD
In the words of Buddhaghosa
And again in the simile of the saw the woodcutter's attention is focused only at the point of contact between the saw and the wood
Modifications of the breathing meditation can be applied to suit individual requirements
In the early stages of practice many persons find that mentally counting the breaths enhances concentration
In these instances one is advised not to count less than five or more than ten
Upon reaching ten the counting starts over
By going beyond ten the counting rather than the breathing is likely to become the subject of one's attention
But how long is he to go on counting
Until without counting mindfulness remains settled on the inbreaths and outbreaths as its object
For counting is simply a device for settling mindfulness on the inbreaths and outbreaths as object by cutting off the external dissipation of applied thoughts
In the initial stages of practice one merely observes the process of breathing without attempting to change its rate or depth
Later as concentration is achieved the breathing is gradually and deliberately slowed in order to further quiet the mind
There is however no attempt to stop respiration as in certain yogic practices
It was a Burmese meditation teacher Venerable U Narada who in the early part of this century stressed the application of mindfulness of breathing as a means of cultivating direct awareness
It was he who gave the first strong impetus to the revival of Satipatthana meditation in contemporary Burma
He passed away in at the age of and is said by many to have realized Nibbana
A variation of the breathing meditation was developed by another Burmese monk the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw who was a pupil of the Venerable U Narada
His technique involves focusing attention upon the respiratory movements of the abdomen instead of the sensation at the nostrils
This system has become popular in several parts of southern Asia
A revived interest in meditation has developed in that section of the world especially in Burma where numerous training centers have been established and thousands of monks and lay people have received instruction
During meditation when the practitioner finds that his mind has strayed from its subject there should be no attempt to suppress or forcibly remove the extraneous thoughts
Rather he should briefly take mental note of them and objectively label them with some appropriate term
This may be done by thinking to himself planning remembering imagining etc as the case may be
Then he should return to his original meditation subject
However if after several tries the unwanted thoughts persist he should temporarily take the thoughts themselves as the meditation subject
In so doing their intensity will diminish and he can then return to his original subject
This same technique can be used for distracting noises
It can also be used for feelings of anger or frustration which may develop as the result of unwanted thoughts or distractions
In these instances the meditator should think to himself noise or irritation
As the mind becomes quiet and verbal thinking begins to diminish other stimuli come into awareness
Among these are sensations such as itches and minor pains which are always present but go unnoticed because attention is directed elsewhere
The same may occur with emotions such as worry or fear and these we shall discuss in detail later
Pictures or visual scenes may arise and are often so vivid as to be termed visions or hallucinations
They often have the appearance of dreams or distant memories and differ from thoughts in that the meditator usually finds himself a passive spectator not knowing when such scenes will arise or what forms they will take
The meditator should first attempt to ignore these sensations feelings and pictures
This failing he should label them itching fear picture etc and lastly make them his meditation subject until they diminish
To be successful meditation should not be an unpleasant experience
Strain and tension should be minimized
Therefore if the practitioner finds himself becoming tense irritable or fatigued during meditation he may wish to terminate the practice until he acquires a better state of mind
Following mindfulness of breathing the next exercise prescribed in the Satipatthana Sutta is the development of the same clear awareness towards one's daily actions
Thus the Buddha continues
And further monks a monk in going forward and back applies clear comprehension in looking straight on and looking away he applies clear comprehension in bending and in stretching he applies clear comprehension in wearing robes and carrying the bowl he applies clear comprehension in eating drinking chewing and savoring he applies clear comprehension in attending to the calls of nature he applies clear comprehension in walking in standing in sitting in falling asleep in walking in speaking and in keeping silence he applies clear comprehension
Here we note a similarity between early Buddhism and Zen
Or as the Zen master would say In walking just walk
In sitting just sit
Above all don't wobble
Usually while dressing eating working etc we act on habit and give little attention to our physical actions
Our minds are preoccupied with a variety of other concerns
In Satipatthana however the practitioner devotes himself entirely to the situation at hand
Persons interested in meditation are often heard to complain But I don't have time to meditate However the form of mindfulness we are now discussing can be practiced at all times and in all situations regardless of one's occupation or social and religious commitments
As with breathing meditation the primary intent of this discipline is to prepare one's mind for advanced stages of psychological development
However a valuable byproduct is that it can greatly increase one's proficiency at physical skills
In Japan Zen practitioners have utilized it to achieve mastery in swordsmanship archery and judo
The Buddha himself is quoted Mindfulness I declare O monks is helpful everywhere And again
For one engaged in strict monastic training mindfulness of actions becomes a more formalized practice
Breathing and walking meditations often are alternated for periods of about thirty minutes each
In walking the monk paces slowly along a level stretch of ground and directs his attention fully to the movement of each foot thinking lift  forward  down  lift  forward  down This alternation of breathing and walking practice may last sixteen hours each day for a period of six or more weeks
The last of the body meditations are designed to overcome one's narcissistic infatuation for one's own body to abandon unrealistic desires for immortality and to destroy sensual lust
To achieve these ends two principles are employed
First is vividly and repeatedly impressing upon one's mind the temporary changing and compounded nature of the body
Secondly one establishes and persistently reinforces a series of negative associations to the usually sensual features of the body
This latter process employs the same principles as behavior therapy and Pavlovian conditioning
However Satipatthana differs from Pavlovian and behavior therapy in that the conditioning is established by the meditator himself instead of an external agent
Thus the Satipatthana Sutta continues
Just as if there were a doublemouthed provision bag full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy paddy green gram cowpeas sesamum and husked rice and a man with sound eyes having opened that bag were to take stock of the contents thus This is hill paddy this is paddy this is green gram this is cowpea this is sesamum this is husked rice Just so monks a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the head hair down thinking thus There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidney heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva nasal mucus synovial fluid urine
And further monks a monk reflects on this very body however it be placed or disposed by way of the material elements There are in this body the element of earth the element of water the element of fire the element of air
Just as if monks a clever cowbutcher or his apprentice having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions should be sitting at the junction of four high roads in the same way a monk reflects on this very body as it is placed or disposed by way of the material elements There are in this body the elements of earth water fire and air
This last paragraph is explained in the Visuddhimagga
The last of the body meditations are the nine cemetery meditations
Numbers and respectively are quoted here
The remaining five are similar and deal with intermediate stages of decomposition
And further monks as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground being eaten by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or by different kinds of worms he then applies this perception to his own body thus Verily also my own body is of the same nature such it will become and will not escape it
And further monks as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton without flesh and blood held together by the tendons
And further monks as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to bones gone rotten and become dust he then applies this perception to his own body thus Verily also my own body is of the same nature such it will become and will not escape it
Similar meditations on the digestion and decomposition of food are listed in other sections of the Pali scriptures for the purpose of freeing the practitioner from undue cravings for food
While these meditations are intended to eliminate passion and craving they carry the risk of making one morbid and depressed
Therefore the Buddha recommended
A cartoon in an American medical magazine shows four senior medical students standing together
Three are engaged in active conversation
Only the remaining one turns his head to take notice of a pretty nurse
The caption beneath the cartoon reads Guess which one has not done twelve pelvic examinations today It is doubtful that many persons outside of the medical profession will appreciate the meaning but to medical students and interns it speaks a reality
During his months of training in obstetrics and gynecology the medical trainee must spend many hours engaged in examining and handling the most repulsive aspects of female genitals
As a result he finds the female body becoming less attractive and his sexual urges diminishing
During my own years as a medical student and intern this observation was repeatedly confirmed by the comments of my coworkers both married and single
As we have seen the same principle is utilized in the sections of the Discourse on repulsiveness and the cemetery meditations
Other aspects of scientific and medical training can produce results similar to those sought in the latter three body meditations
Chemistry biochemistry and histology foster an objective way of viewing the body which is virtually identical to the contemplation of elements
Anatomy of course is similar to the contemplation of repulsiveness
And in hospital training the persistent encounter with old age debilitation and death continuously reinforces the words of the cemetery meditations Verily also my own body is of the same nature such it will become and will not escape it Similarly in order to acquire a vivid mental image of the cemetery meditations Buddhist monks occasionally visit graveyards to behold corpses in various stages of decay
However such experiences bear fruit only if one takes advantage of them and avoids the temptation to ignore and forget
Successful application of the Satipatthana meditations requires developed concentration which in turn necessitates many hours of practice
There are however a variety of discursive meditations and related practices which the lay devotee can utilize to notable advantage
Some of these are not meditations in the strict sense of the word and are commonplace in virtually all religions
A hymn a poem a passage from the Dhamma or a passage from any inspiring literature can temporarily elevate the mind and serve to cultivate wholesome feelings
Many Buddhists make a habit of setting aside a few minutes each day to reflect upon the Teaching or to either read or recite from memory some favored passage of the Dhammapada
For some similar benefits may be gained from an evening stroll a period of solitude in forest or desert or a pause for contemplative relaxation in the midst of a hurried day
These latter three serve the added advantage of allowing one to reflect upon one's values and reappraise oneself
Perhaps the most popular discursive meditation practiced by Theravadin Buddhists is the meditation on love
It is often recited in the morning in order to create a wholesome mood for the rest of the day
There are several versions one of which is as follows
My mind is pure and clean
Like a polished mirror is my stainless mind
As a clean and empty vessel is filled with pure water I now fill my clean heart and pure mind with peaceful and sublime thoughts of boundless love overflowing compassion sympathetic joy and perfect equanimity
I have now washed my mind and heart of anger ill will cruelty violence jealousy envy passion and aversion
May I be well and happy
May I be free from suffering disease grief worry and anger
May I be strong selfconfident healthy and peaceful
Now I charge every particle of my system from head to foot with thoughts of boundless love and compassion
I am the embodiment of love and compassion
My whole body is saturated with love and compassion
I am a stronghold a fortress of love and compassion
What I have gained I now give unto others
Think of all your near and dear ones at home individually or collectively and fill them with thoughts of lovingkindness and wish them peace and happiness repeating May all beings be well and happy Then think of all seen and unseen beings living near and far men women animals and all living beings in the East West North South above and below and radiate boundless lovingkindness without any enmity or obstruction towards all irrespective of class creed color or sex
Think that all are your brothers and sisters fellowbeings in the ocean of life
You identify yourself with all
You are one with all
Repeat ten times  May all be well and happy  and wish them all peace and happiness
Another useful meditation for laymen is as follows
In the mind of a devout Buddhist Gotama Buddha symbolizes the embodiment of one's highest spiritual ideals
Consequently the Buddha is often taken as a meditation subject
When a noble disciple contemplates upon the Enlightened One at that time his mind is not enwrapped by lust nor by hatred nor by delusion and at that time his mind is rightly directed towards the Tathagata
And with a rightly directed mind the noble disciple gains enthusiasm for the goal enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains the delight derived from the Dhamma
In him thus delighted joy arises to one joyfully minded body and mind become calm calmed in body and mind he feels at ease and if at ease the mind finds concentration
The hazard in meditating on the Buddha however is that the unsophisticated meditator may not be aware of the psychological reasons for this exercise
In such a case the practice is likely to become a devotional one similar to those of nonBuddhist religions
Some time ago I became acquainted with a Caucasian Buddhist who for several years had made a daily practice of meditating on love
He confided that he had chosen this meditation subject because he was prone to frequent outbreaks of anger and chronic resentment a hate problem he termed it
But despite years of meditation the hatred had not diminished the meditation had failed
Why
As our acquaintance broadened the answer became apparent
My friend had several poorlyconcealed intellectual and emotional deficiencies
He never once revealed that he acknowledged these on the contrary he displayed frequent attempts to bolster his selfimage
Such attempts were invariably doomed to frustration especially when his accomplishments and social poise were contrasted with those of others
By reacting with anger towards others he avoided the unpleasantry of looking at himself
In other words his anger was a psychological defense through which he sought to maintain an illusion of selfesteem
Thus unconsciously he did not wish to relinquish his anger
To do so would be too painful and to attack the anger by meditating on love was futile for anger was only a symptom
The real problem lay much deeper
To cure such hatred requires three things
First one must become aware of the existence of one's inadequacies and their accompanying humiliations in other words what is unconscious must become conscious
Second one must totally confront such unpleasant feelings and acknowledge them in their entirety
And finally one must relinquish the egotistical desire for selfexaltation
This last requirement is best achieved by objectively analyzing the illusion of self and gaining full appreciation for the changing and compounded nature of the personality
In other words one must acquire insight of both types discussed above under the goals of meditation
How can this be achieved
Awareness of unconscious feelings is rarely obtained through logical deductions or rational explanations
A person who harbors these feelings will either refuse to believe what he is told or will come to accept it only as so much factual information devoid of emotional significance
An excellent illustration is the case of a fortyyearold woman who sought psychiatric help for severe feelings of fear guilt and depression
On examining her case it became apparent that her problem was largely due to repressed feelings of hatred for her mother a very dominating and selfish woman
After much discussion the patient finally deduced that she indeed did hate her mother and for the next two months she spoke knowingly and learnedly about her repressed hatred and resultant symptoms
Yet she improved not one bit
Then one day she entered the office shaking with rage and cried God I hate that witch There was never a more vivid example of the difference between knowing and experiencing
Improvement quickly followed
This example is typical of many psychiatric case histories
One sees patients who speak in the most erudite manner about Freud and Jung and adeptly employ psychiatric terminology
Yet this intellectual verbiage is often a subtle defense against facing their true feelings
Conversely many unsophisticated and unlearned patients are quick to achieve insight and make rapid progress
Consequently the skillful psychiatrist makes limited use of technical jargon and theoretical concepts
He asks questions often but answers few
This same technique is employed in Burmese and Zen meditation centers
The student is discouraged from making philosophical inquiries and is told Pursue your meditation and soon you will see
In his earlier years Sigmund Freud experimented with hypnosis
He found it a useful tool in revealing unconscious feelings and conflicts to the therapist but it was of little value to the patient
The reason was that hypnotic trance precluded the patient from consciously confronting and resolving his problems
Therefore Freud abandoned hypnosis in preference to the now standard procedures of psychiatry and psychoanalysis
These same findings and conclusions have often been repeated by later researchers and clinicians
Similarly the Buddha rejected the use of trance states so common in yogic practice and developed a means by which people can acquire insight without the aid of a therapist or psychedelic drugs
Two approaches are employed
The easier approach to insight is one which both monks and laymen can use regardless of meditative development
It consists in developing the habit of reflecting on one's feelings from time to time and detecting the motives which produce seemingly spontaneous words and deeds
Why did I say that Why am I tense when I meet so and so I find myself disliking such and such a character in this novel
Why is that
Of whom does he remind me
For those who have progressed in the breathing meditation or made similar progress at quieting the mind unconscious feelings become more readily accessible
As one begins to shut out sensory distractions and halt discursive thinking more subtle sensations come into awareness
At first there may be only a vague feeling of anxiety some unexplained sense of guilt or a feeling of anger
Without recourse to verbal whys or hows and avoiding any speculative conjecture the meditator directs full attention to the feeling alone
He brings only the feeling itself into full awareness and allows no interfering thoughts though later he will benefit by reflecting on it in a contemplative manner
It is at this point that repressed memories and emotional conflicts may come into awareness
Here also meditation can be potentially dangerous for those whose personality structures are loosely constituted or who have repressed emotional problems of severe intensity
Usually however in these latter instances one's unconscious defenses will intervene and the meditator will terminate the practice because he feels anxious or can't concentrate or just quit because I felt like it
Thus the last three sections of the Satipatthana Sutta read as follows
Mindfulness of feelings  the second of the four foundations of mindfulness
Mindfulness of consciousness  the third of the four foundations of mindfulness
Mindfulness of mental objects  the fourth of the four foundations of mindfulness
When anger is present he knows There is anger in me When sloth and torpor are present When agitation and worry are present When doubt is present
Herein monks when the enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is present the monk knows The enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is in me or when the enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is absent he knows The enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is not in me and he knows how the arising of the nonarisen enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness comes to be and how the perfection in the development of the arisen enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness comes to be
This paragraph on mindfulness is then repeated in the same wording for the remaining six enlightenmentfactors ie investigation of reality energy happiness tranquillity concentration and equanimity
These seven bear the title enlightenmentfactors as they are said to be the essential states for the realization of Nibbana
Leaving the Satipatthana Sutta for a moment we note another of the Buddha's sayings
Certainly not Lord
Are these not rather ideas to be known after wisely realizing them by experience
That is so Lord
This monks is a way by which a monk without recourse to faith to cherished opinions to tradition to specious reasoning to the approval of views pondered upon may declare the Final Knowledge
Thus far we have discussed how one achieves insight as the first step towards eliminating unwholesome feelings and motivations
Following insight one must totally confront these newly discovered feelings and acknowledge them fully and impartially
One must see their true nature devoid of any emotional reactions and devoid of preconceived notions about their good or evil qualities
In other words complete attention is focused on the feeling itself in order that one may examine it objectively in its naked reality free of any cultural and personal assumptions as to its desirability
This achievement results from the Satipatthana practices described above
As an example in a typical case of anger one is cognizant of being angry yet a much greater amount of attention is directed outward
Most typically the angry mind quickly perceives and dwells upon the objectionable and offensive features of some other person
And in so doing indignation resentment and anger increase
These objectionable features of the other person may be fancied exaggerated or real but in any case were it not for the anger such preoccupations would not have arisen
The Buddhist approach is to turn attention to the real problem  the anger
One reflects I am angry I am doing this because I am angry I am having these thoughts because I am angry In so doing one avoids dwelling on alleged injustices etc and thereby does not intensify the hatred
This reflection continues This is anger It is real it is intense It is a feeling It has no reality outside of my own consciousness Like all feelings it will soon diminish I experience it but am not compelled to act on it With practice one finds that though anger still arises its effect is diminished
Its influence is no longer as strong
In the case of painful emotions such as humiliation it is advantageous to also reflect This is most painful I do not like it but I can confront it I can endure it Even though it is unpleasant I can tolerate it In instances of greed and passion it is often fruitful to consider Is this truly pleasurable Is it rewarding Am I now happy
It should be noted that this important technique can also be employed in the course of daily living without unusual powers of concentration or formal meditation practice
In the words of the Buddha
In pleasant feelings monks the inclination to greed should be given up in unpleasant feelings the inclination to aversion should be given up in neutral feelings the inclination to ignorance should be given up
If a monk has given up in pleasant feelings the inclination to greed in unpleasant feelings the inclination to aversion and in neutral feelings the inclination to ignorance then he is called one who is free of inclinations one who sees clearly
He has cut off cravings sundered the fetters and through the destruction of conceit has made an end of suffering
After getting rid of sensual cravings and after uncovering confronting and relinquishing unwholesome emotions there remains only one fetter to be resolved
This is narcissism the infatuation for one's self which results in egotism and an endless quest for social recognition and selfexaltation
Perpetuating this fetter is the illusion that one has a true or unchanging self the real me In reality there is no such entity instead there are only feelings sensations and emotions and once we gain full appreciation of this fact once it becomes a living reality to us narcissism diminishes
Among the Buddha's teachings are numerous passages like the following
Better it would be to consider the body as the ego rather than the mind
And why
Because this body may last for ten twenty thirty forty or fifty years even for a hundred years and more
But that which is called mind consciousness thinking arises continuously during day and night as one thing and as something different again it vanishes
Such statements however are merely philosophical arguments through which one may intellectually accept this fact
Only by experiencing it as a living reality and by an impartial analysis of the self do we relinquish egotism
Thus in the Satipatthana Sutta after each of the six body meditations and after each of the meditations on feeling consciousness and mental objects the following passage occurs

In the instance of anger one would reflect This is anger It is a feeling I do not identify with it It will eventually be replaced by another feeling which in turn will be replaced by still another I am a composite of various feelings a changing aggregate of attitudes values and thoughts no one of which is permanent There is no eternal I As such objectivity and detachment increases anger diminishes for no longer is there an ego to be defended and no self which can be offended
Except for a concluding section on the Four Noble Truths we have now discussed all but two portions of the Satipatthana Sutta
These remaining two are included under the section on mental objects and are primarily intended to free one from sensual craving and the illusion of self
Herein monks a monk knows the eye and visual forms and the fetter that arises dependent on both he knows how the arising of the nonarisen fetter comes to be he knows how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be
This latter passage is repeated five times with ear and sound nose and smells tongue and flavors body and tactual objects and mind and mental objects respectively substituted where eye and visual forms appears above
We have thus completed the Satipatthana Sutta
In summary it first prescribes mindfulness of breathing as a technique for quieting the mind and developing concentration
This same heightened awareness is then developed for all voluntary physical actions
Next are the meditations on repulsiveness elements and death which are intended to free one from bodily attachment and lust this is done by contemplating the temporary and changing nature of the body and by developing negative and unpleasant associations
The remaining three sections enable the practitioner to become fully aware of his thoughts feelings and emotions and to confront them impartially in their true nature
With each of these exercises one also objectively notes that each facet of his own mind and body is temporary compounded and changing and therefore there exists no immortal soul unchanging essence or true self
One important fact should be noted
Neither in the Satipatthana Sutta nor in any of the other seven steps of the Eightfold Path is advocated the denial or suppression of feelings
It is a widely spread and inaccurate belief that Theravada Buddhism attempts to destroy evil thoughts by forcing them from the mind
Suppression of undesirable thoughts is advocated in only a few parts of the Pali canon and is to be used only in special cases when other measures fail
In southern Asia it is becoming a common practice for both monks and laymen to enter a meditation center for periods of from six to twelve weeks
Here one dons the white robe of an upasaka and is removed from all social contacts and material possessions
Previous social status and identity soon come to have little meaning thus minimizing the effect of established habits and adaptations and thereby enhancing the opportunities for personality growth
The food is palatable but bland and one eats and sleeps in moderation according to a strict schedule and even eating and dressing become routine meditation practices
Virtually every waking moment is dedicated to meditation
Here progress is made at a rate impossible to achieve by setting aside an hour or two in the midst of a busy day
After his stay is over the layman returns to family life and continues his daily onehour practice
However not all meditation centers are of high quality
Many are lax a few are corrupt and a few teach unorthodox meditations which are not truly Buddhist
Thus a person seeking entry should first make inquiries and would do well to avoid centers which make an effort to recruit Westerners for the sake of publicity and prestige
Satipatthana meditation centers exist in North America and courses are given in England
The last step of the Noble Eightfold Path is termed right concentration and concerns the attainment of the four absorptions or jhanas
These states are achieved by an extreme degree of concentration and mental quietude beyond that usually sought through mindfulness of breathing
Yet unlike Satipatthana the jhanas are not a prerequisite to Enlightenment
Some teachers say one may obtain Nibbana without reaching the absorptions and they alone will not produce Nibbana
Also there is the danger of one becoming enamoured with them and not striving for further progress
However achieving the jhanas can facilitate one's progress
In these states all visual tactile auditory and other sense impressions have ceased while the mind remains alert and fully awake
The first jhana is described as having five qualities absent and five present
Absent are lust anger sloth agitation and doubt
Present are a mild degree of conceptual thought a mild degree of discursive thinking rapture happiness and concentration
With the removal of all conceptual thought and discursive thinking one enters the second jhana which has the qualities of concentration rapture and happiness
Then with the abandonment of rapture one enters the third jhana in which only equanimous happiness and concentration remain
The distinctive factors of the fourth absorption are equanimity and concentration
This last jhana is realized after giving up all joy and sorrow and is described as a state beyond pleasure and pain
The jhanas are obtained by mindfulness of breathing with a steady progressive quieting of the breath
They may also be realized through the kasina meditations and meditating on equanimity
At this point it is interesting to speculate on the phenomena of parapsychology
Despite the fraudulent and careless investigations which have been done in psychical research there still remains a sizable number of reliable and carefully controlled studies which have demonstrated that people do indeed possess the faculties of telepathy clairvoyance and precognition
In addition some researchers claim to have established the existence of psychokinesis the power of mind over matter but the evidence for psychokinesis is inconclusive and most experiments have failed to demonstrate its validity
Of those parapsychology subjects who have been tested to date even the best guess incorrectly as often as correctly and are unable to determine which of their guesses are correct
That is while being tested the ESP subject is unable to distinguish between guesses and true extrasensory information
One might wonder if the process of reducing sensory impressions and stilling discursive thoughts would enhance these psychic abilities
According to the Pali texts there are five psychical powers which can be obtained through meditation
These five include psychokinesis telepathy and clairvoyance plus two others
The additional two are the divine ear or clairaudience and the ability to recall past lives
Precognition itself is not listed among these but is mentioned in other sections of the Tipitaka
Reliable use of these powers is allegedly possessed only by those who have achieved the four jhanas either with or without Nibbana
Thus like more worldly talents Nibbana alone does not produce them
The most important consideration however is that Buddhism places very little emphasis on paranormal phenomena and regards them as byproducts of spiritual development rather than goals
In fact the novice is cautioned against experimenting with them since they distract from one's true goals and in some cases can be obstructive or even dangerous
The Satipatthana exercises are by far the most valuable and widely practiced of all the Theravada meditations
There are however a total of forty meditation subjects listed in the Visuddhimagga including those already mentioned ie Satipatthana practices and meditations on love equanimity repulsiveness of food and the Buddha
The remaining subjects are the Dhamma the Order of Monks virtue generosity devas peace compassion gladness boundless space boundless consciousness nothingness the base of neither perception nor nonperception and the ten kasinas
Each of these subjects is intended for specific individual needs and one should not attempt to undertake all forty
To do so would only dilute one's energies and retard progress
A kasina is an object which the practitioner looks at from a distance of about four feet
The eyes are alternately opened and closed until one has acquired a mental image of the object which is as vivid as the real one
The ten kasina meditations develop the jhanas and do not enhance insight
Meditation is not an exclusively Buddhist tradition
It is equally important in the Hindu religion and because the two schools employ similar techniques they are often confused
Thus a comparison is warranted
Both advocate preparatory moral discipline moderation in eating quieting the mind and abolition of selfish desires
The postures are similar and the breathing meditation is practiced by many yogis
Here however the similarities cease
Buddhism is concerned with the empirical phenomena of conscious experience and thus its meditations are psychologically oriented
Hinduism on the other hand is mystically religiously and metaphysically inclined
Yogic meditation therefore has devotional aspects often including prayer
While Buddhism emphasizes motivations and insight Hinduism speaks of Infinite Consciousness Cosmic Reality and oneness with God
To the Hindu freedom from hatred is not so much an end in itself as it is a step towards Immortality
The following typifies Hindu writings
Another important difference concerns the visions that occur during meditation
The Buddhist regards these as psychological phenomena to be dealt with in the same way as distracting thoughts
The Hindu often interprets them as psychic experiences indicative of spiritual development
In the words of Swami Sivananda
A few passages in the TaoTeChing suggest that the Chinese mystics discovered meditation independently of Buddhist and Hindu traditions
The exact nature of early Taoist meditation will probably remain unknown since later Taoism has intermingled with Mahayana Buddhism
Mahayana Buddhist meditations include all the above mentioned Theravada practices plus others
The division of Mahayana into numerous and varied sects precludes any general statement about its practices
In some forms it bears similarities to Hinduism by virtue of devotional emphasis and prayer
In other schools this similarity is seen in the Mahayana concepts of Universal Mind the Void and Buddha Nature which sometimes take precedence over the Theravada concerns of greed hatred and delusion
The curing of physical illness and the flow of spiritual forces through the body are other features of certain Mahayana practices
Of all the Mahayana schools Zen places the greatest emphasis upon meditation
Zen practice is much like Theravada
It focuses on quieting the mind and shuns conceptual thinking in preference to direct experience
The postures are also similar and the initial Zen practice usually involves attention to breathing
It does not include as wide a variety of different techniques
Zen places greater emphasis on the details of correct posture and especially in the Soto school contrasts with Theravada by preferring group meditation to individual practice
In order to cultivate a suitable state of mind Zen meditation is often followed by chanting and gongs
Perhaps the most significant difference is that as compared to Theravada Zen makes little mention of the need and means of dealing with motives feelings and emotions
It lays great emphasis upon freeing oneself from intellectualizing and conceptualizing in one's quest of the Ultimate But at the same time it offers scant advice on the means by which one overcomes unwholesome impulses or confronts mental hindrances that are emotional or motivational in origin
The Venerable Anuruddha a disciple of the Buddha once became ill with a painful disease
On that occasion several of the monks visited him and inquired
He replied
Throughout Buddhist history there have been numerous other testimonies as to the benefits of Satipatthana
Yet personal testimonies and case histories are subjective and prone to distortion
The reader may well wonder what if any scientific studies have been conducted
To date there are two areas of investigation which have given some evidence as to the benefits of meditation
The first scientific evidence does not involve meditation per se but concerns an experimental situation which has some similarities to meditation practice
This is sensory deprivation which has been actively studied since
There are two types of sensory deprivation
One reduces sensory input by placing the experimental subject in a totally dark soundproof room
His hands are encased in soft cotton the temperature is constant and mild and he lies on a soft mattress
The other type does not reduce sensory input per se but does diminish perception
In this latter case the subject wears opaque goggles so that he sees only a diffuse white with no forms or colors
A constant monotonous noise is generated and no other sounds are heard
Approximately the same results are obtained in either type of experiment
In both kinds the subject lies relatively motionless he is free to think or sleep as he pleases and may terminate the session if he so desires
Experiments have lasted from four hours to five days
The lack of practice and lack of any attempt at mental discipline makes sensory deprivation a passive procedure notably different from meditation
However both meditation and sensory deprivation involve a temporary withdrawal from external stimuli without loss of consciousness and thus a comparison is warranted
Perhaps the most characteristic feature of sensory deprivation research to date is the great discrepancies in the findings of different researchers
For example some studies have shown it to impair learning while others find that learning is enhanced
Most of the early studies reported that the great majority of experimental subjects had strong visual and sometimes auditory hallucinations beginning from twenty minutes to seventy hours after entering the experiment
Other researchers however reported very few hallucinations
Suggestion is a partial though not total explanation for this difference in frequency of hallucinations
One study found that under identical sensory deprivation conditions a group of subjects which was told that hallucinations were frequent and normal had over three times more than an identical group which was given no such information
This no doubt explains many of the psychic experiences of those yogi devotees who seek visions while meditating in isolation
Recent studies have indicated that the emotional atmosphere created by the experimenters plus the subject's attitudes knowledge and expectations may have greater effect on the results of the experiment than do the physical aspects of sensory deprivation
Regarding meditation this fact suggests the importance of moral intellectual and environmental preparation
It also suggests the importance of taking a few moments before meditation to create a wholesome frame of mind
What is most significant for the purpose of this writing however is whether or not sensory deprivation and its accompanying social isolation facilitate awareness of one's inner emotional conflicts and thereby facilitate personality growth
Several studies have indicated that such is the case
Most significant was an experiment conducted on thirty white male psychiatric patients in Richmond Virginia
The group consisted of approximately equal numbers of neurotics schizophrenics and character disorders and all were subjected to a maximum six hours of sensory deprivation
Each subject was given a battery of psychological tests the day before the experiment and the same tests were repeated the day after and again one week later
The tests rated the subjects on twenty items such as anxiety depression hostility memory deficit disorganized thinking etc
It was found that on each of the twenty items some subjects improved some worsened and some revealed no change
However the desirable changes outnumbered the undesirable ones by a ratio of two to one and one week after the experiment most of the beneficial changes were found to have persisted while the undesirable ones had mostly subsided
Some subjects showed no desirable changes on any of the twenty items others revealed as many as thirteen
The average subject improved on four of the twenty items and worsened on two
The experimenters also reported that the subjects displayed increased awareness of inner conflicts and anxieties and heightened perception of the fact that their difficulties stemmed from inner rather than outer factors A second major change observed was a less rigid utilization of repressive and inhibitory defenses
The reduction of incoming stimulation led to recall and verbalization of previously forgotten experiences in many instances
For some subjects this recall was anxietyinducing Other studies have supported this finding that short term sensory deprivation is psychologically beneficial
However other carefully conducted investigations have found no such improvements and therefore further studies are indicated before any definite conclusions can be made about the therapeutic value of sensory deprivation
In a fascinating and unique report on Zen meditation was presented by Dr
Akira Kasamatsu and Dr
Tomio Hirai of the Department of NeuroPsychiatry Tokyo University
It contained the results of a tenyear study of the brain wave or electroencephalographic tracings of Zen masters
The EEG tracings revealed that about ninety seconds after an accomplished Zen practitioner begins meditation a rhythmic slowing in the brain wave pattern known as alpha waves occurs
This slowing occurs with eyes open and progresses with meditation and after thirty minutes one finds rhythmic alpha waves of seven or eight per second
This effect persists for some minutes after meditation
What is most significant is that this EEG pattern is notably different from those of sleep normal waking consciousness and hypnotic trance and is unusual in persons who have not made considerable progress in meditation
In other words it suggests an unusual mental state though from the subjective reports of the practitioners it does not appear to be a unique or highly unusual conscious experience
It was also found that a Zen master's evaluation of the amount of progress another practitioner had made correlated directly with the latter's EEG changes
Another finding of the same study concerned what is called alpha blocking and habituation
To understand these phenomena let us imagine that a person who is reading quietly is suddenly interrupted by a loud noise
For a few seconds his attention is diverted from the reading to the noise
If the same sound is then repeated a few seconds later his attention will again be diverted only not as strongly nor for as long a time
If the sound is then repeated at regular intervals the person will continue reading and become oblivious to the sound
A normal subject with closed eyes produces alpha waves on an EEG tracing
An auditory stimulation such as a loud noise normally obliterates alpha waves for seven seconds or more this is termed alpha blocking
In a Zen master the alpha blocking produced by the first noise lasts only two seconds
If the noise is repeated at second intervals we find that in the normal subject there is virtually no alpha blocking remaining by the fifth successive noise
This diminution of alpha blocking is termed habituation and persists in normal subjects for as long as the noise continues at regular and frequent intervals
In the Zen master however no habituation is seen
His alpha blocking lasts two seconds with the first sound two seconds with the fifth sound and two seconds with the twentieth sound
This implies that the Zen master has a greater awareness of his environment as the paradoxical result of meditative concentration
One master described such a state of mind as that of noticing every person he sees on the street but of not looking back with emotional lingering
Through science technology and social organization Western man has built a civilization of unprecedented wealth and grandeur
Yet despite this mastery of his environment he has given little thought to mastery of himself
In fact his newlyacquired wealth and leisure have heightened his sensuality and weakened his selfdiscipline
It becomes increasingly apparent however that a stable and prosperous democracy can endure only so long as we have intelligent selfdisciplined and properly motivated citizens legislation and education alone will not ensure this
Buddhism presents a technique by which this can be obtained but the responsibility rests with each individual
No one can cure our neuroses and strengthen our characters except ourselves
In the Sumbha country in the town of Sedaka the Buddha once said
The preceding was written in with a few minor revisions and additions made in the latter part of
Now at the start of and after six years in Thailand it seems befitting that I review my own words
For the past years have not only added to my own experience with meditation they have also brought me into close and prolonged contact with other meditation practitioners many of whom are more dedicated more skillful and more experienced than I
One is impressed with the variety of personalities who undertake practice
Some are experimental critical and pragmatic others more devotional dedicated and idealistic
Some seem well adjusted and at peace with themselves and the world while others seem desperate to find happiness and purpose in life
Some adhere literally to every detail of the scriptures while some instead are dedicated to the interpretations and methods of their respective teachers
Still others attempt to find the ways and means alone by their own individual and unaided efforts
Likewise the techniques and methods which these people have undertaken are also highly varied and divergent
During this period of personal practice and consultation with others I have seen what I believe to be some genuine achievements and also some notable failures
The question then is What is it that succeeds and what is it that does not
And why
Or to state the matter more precisely One may succeed in one area of meditative development but not in another
In order to evaluate progress at meditation one must have some criteria or standards against which to judge
Thus we must ask ourselves what is it that short of Nibbana we expect to find in one who has made genuine progress along the Eightfold Path
Momentary periods of euphoria altered perceptions or other transient episodes of unusual states of consciousness are not what we seek
Likewise we are not in pursuit of occult powers unusual EEG patterns or control of the autonomic nervous system
With reference to the Four Noble Truths we note the Buddha's words One thing do I teach suffering and the end of suffering Thus if one has truly progressed we would expect that where previously sad and depressed one is now less so where previously selfish one is now more giving where previously defensive secretive and guarded one is now more open and selfassured
Worry and anxiety should be reduced
Objective humility should replace conceit
Instead of recurrent thoughts of anger and getting even one is more forgiving and at peace with the world
It is felt that such attainments have been observed occurring as the result of properly directed Buddhist practice
Again with reference to the Four Noble Truths it is craving or desire which causes our unhappiness and produces our mental defilements
Thus only by attacking the problems of craving wanting and desiring can progress be made
I speak now not so much of the crude and obvious desires such as hunger and sex but of the more subtle ones of egotism emotional dependency and desires for possession
One may fast for two weeks and yet never once look at the fact that the real reason for fasting is to feed one's ego  to be better more disciplined more pious than one's fellow practitioners
Or one may work diligently attempting to win the approval confidence and affection of a stern and aloof teacher and never once realize that one is attempting to compensate for the frustration and lack of love from a stern and aloof parent
To really break through these hang ups one must focus attention not on the sensation of breath at the nostrils but instead focus on the agonizing feelings of inadequacy mediocrity loneliness or rejection in one's heart
When asked What have you gained from meditation the correct answer should be nothing For meditation is not for acquiring but for giving up  a full and complete giving up of the self
Too often people put in a halfhour each day at meditation in the same way that they put in a halfhour studying French
After so many months or years one has a new attribute a new skill to add to one's already impressive repertoire of virtues achievements talents and abilities
I can speak French play the piano ski type sixty words a minute and meditate as well Such a person is either compensating for strong feelings of inadequacy or else is badly afflicted with narcissism
Another way in which meditation becomes misdirected as a result of the very motives which determined it is the quest for new sensations or experiences ie lobha
Many seek from meditation the very same thing they seek from drugs  ie an overwhelming egoimmersing experience of sensations perceptions colors emotions and transcendental states beyond words
It is not meant to belittle such experiences and say that they have no significance or no value
But as with taking LSD or seeing a good motion picture they quickly pass into memories
And once past in a very short time one's old mood changes petty jealousies conceits and irritations are back just as strong and as frequent as ever
If there has been no true and lasting personality change then Buddhist meditation has fallen short of its intended goal
At the opposite extreme are persons whose approaches to Buddhism are excessively dogmatic literal orthodox and moralistic
They strongly resist a pragmatic eclectic approach to meditation and are hyperconcerned with the nuances and fine points of Buddhist tradition and decorum
From these sources one repeatedly hears such statements as To progress at meditation there must be strict moral discipline or You cannot expect fast results but must work for years Now there is truth in both these statements
But in this context they are really symptoms of extreme rigidity and dogmatism which in principle is no different than the dogmatism of many Christian missionaries or other persons doggedly committed to a given institution
One's commitment to the tradition and to the letter of the teaching is so strong that one is incapable of truly practicing that very same teaching which advises one to have no prejudices and to see truth as universal and independent of any institution
I feel that this unfortunate phenomenon accounts for several instances of very diligent and dedicated meditation practitioners who despite years of intensive practice reveal little more than chronic mild depression mixed with plodding determination
The theme of guilt and selfpunishment is one factor which tends to perpetuate the phenomenon of diligent striving with minimal results
It usually begins with one taking a highly idealistic moralistic and sometimes devotional approach to Dhamma
One tries for onepointed concentration and complete suppression of mental defilements
One fails and tries again fails and tries again
Blaming oneself for one's failure one comes to feel guilty and tries even harder again failing
With this the austerity of one's practice comes to take on a selfpunitive nature
Angry with oneself one becomes more severe with oneself
For those who have some insight into their dilemma there may be the added problem of feeling guilty about feeling guilty or becoming irritated that one gets irritated
But insight is also the first step to resolution
The second step is to back off and relax a bit
As the Buddha said the guitar string once too slack has now been wound too tight and to produce harmony the tension must be relieved
For idealistic moralistic personalities letting go and relaxing are the very things that intensify one's guilt
Yet in principle this is much like what the Buddha did when he renounced austere asceticism and took up the middle way
The practitioner must stand back and reappraise his whole involvement in Buddhism and examine the matter fully without fearing the consequences of his decision
In evaluating progress at meditation it is important to distinguish between true Buddhist attainment and adaptation
Any human being when placed in a new situation goes through the process of adjusting adapting and growing accustomed
This is true of human life in general and it is true of a man who takes the robes of a Buddhist monk
With the passage of time he grows to accept his role to acclimatize and to learn to work the system he may become contented and happy by virtue of duration and age alone
This process of adaptation is especially relevant in the case of intensive meditation practice where one may spend weeks or months confined to a small room leaving that room only for brief meetings and instructions from the meditation master
In such situations the practitioner may get extreme feelings of peace and happiness of clarity and alertness of mind such as never before seen and also he may glimpse what appear to be transcendental states
Many who have completed such training have come away greatly impressed and highly praising this technique
However it appears that all of these impressive subjective experiences vanish as soon as one comes out of cloistered isolation and then much like a drug experience they remain only as memories
Moreover many people who have finished the course appear to manifest the same selfishness and general human shortcomings as found in human beings picked at random
In addition there is a hazard in that some graduates have revealed extreme pride relative to their attainment
From this it should not be assumed that there is nothing to be gained from such intensive training
On the contrary I have frequently suggested it to persons seeking competent meditation instruction
However I do feel that the empirical evidence shows that for many if not most people this technique alone is insufficient
And the very facts of the Eightfold Path and the Buddhist scriptures in general support this thesis
Thus it would be wise to resolve one's mundane problems of social adjustment and other emotional conflicts before attempting more specialized practices
Quite often a cloister which protects one from all forms of insults humiliation irritation and anxiety may induce a false sense of attainment and lull one into complacency
We can confront and abolish our mental defilements only when they are actively alive in our minds
We cannot do this when they are but hazy memories or intellectually created notions
Consequently many practitioners have found that their progress is enhanced by having true life situations of social interaction and frustration
On the other hand an excessive exposure to such interactions and frustrations may exceed one's ability for alert mindfulness and one thereby insidiously becomes involved with the quarrels and fascinations that breed hatred and sorrow
When living in a cloister where no problems arise one's defensive reactions and dispositions may lie dormant and thus remain hidden
But in ordinary lay life temptations sensations and problems arise so fast that much of the daily routine is little more than a repeating pattern of perceive react and solve perceive react and solve perceive react and solve and so on
Thus for many practitioners the solution lies in a middle way between these extremes that is a situation in which one still has a moderate exposure to chores annoyances and social interactions but this is interspersed with intervals of quietude and meditation
Such intervals may be a duration of hours or a duration of weeks depending on individual needs and circumstances
Thus by maintaining an optimal amount of involvement with social and sensory arousal such a one does more than just perceive react and solve
With mindfulness he is able to catch the perception and reaction as it arises
He observes it scrutinizes it and evaluates it
In so doing it may then be modified abandoned or developed as seen fit
He acts with mindfulness instead of on habit or reflex and thus new responses and solutions may be learned
If one's personality is the sum total of one's perceptions responses and reactions then in this way the growth and development of the personality is possible
The optimum proportion of time that one should spend in isolated meditation as contrasted with the time spent in more mundane pursuits will vary among different individuals
It will also vary according to the method of practice and with different times and stages of development for a given individual
I state these above conclusions not only from a theoretical position and not just because they seem to be revealed in the life pattern of the Buddha and his disciples as portrayed in the suttas
My own limited observations of persons who appear to have progressed at Buddhist practice also fits this conclusion
It is against such a background of observations and considerations that I have reviewed my own earlier writing on meditation
In essence these words still appear to be sound and there are no statements that I would see fit to repudiate
However I feel one point needs to be more strongly emphasized and that is that a regular daily practice of meditation alone will not be likely to show results unless one is willing to thoroughly scrutinize his or her entire pattern of living and be prepared to revise or abandon this lifestyle if so indicated
In the same way one who undertakes Buddhist training as either a monk or layman would do well not to set a time limit and should not commit himself too strongly to future plans
For such a one has already decided beforehand just what he will become and thereby has limited the amount of change that he will allow himself to make
Also I think I have emphasized too strongly the amount of breathing and other bodilydirected concentrations called for in beginning practice
I say this with some hesitation because it has become popular in some circles to completely disown concentration as important to Buddhist practice and I do not agree with this view
But if one focuses exclusively on breathing walking or whatever to the point of blocking all thoughts and emotions one is thereby turning his attention away from the very mental defilements and neurotic conflicts that must be confronted in order to be overcome
Thus it is probably significant that in the Noble Eightfold Path right concentration follows after right mindfulness
One meets a fair number of people who have made considerable attainment at onepointed concentration
Yet with a few notable exceptions they appear to be just as prone to selfishness and petty jealousies as any ordinary persons whom one might meet at random
Some in fact have shown themselves to be very unhappy lonely andor insecure
On the other hand persons who have made only slight progress at sustained concentration have nevertheless in the course of Buddhist practice made considerable progress at diminishing conceit resentment depression and selfishness

The same is true of the labelling technique which is especially common in some forms of Burmese intensive training
With this technique one who in meditation finds himself daydreaming will simply note this and label it imagining imagining or fantasy fantasy and then return to awareness of breathing body sensation or whatever
However daydreams and fantasies are most often an expression of our desires and emotional conflicts
If one examines the daydream in the frame of mind What does it express What desire is it attempting to satisfy What feeling does it carry then one can gain insight into his emotional needs and at the same time confront those same mental taints which meditation is supposed to overcome
The labelling technique is of course highly useful in dispensing with physical distractions such as itches pains and noises and with certain types of moods and certain kinds of memories
But it must be used judiciously for if used exclusively it can retard progress
A general rule of practice which many practitioners have used to advantage is as follows One starts practice by attempting to quiet and concentrate the mind
But after some minutes of finding that the mind repeatedly wanders from its intended object the practitioner then stands back as it were and asks Just what is my present state of mind at this instant What is it that makes my attention wander from its intended object This then is analyzed and confronted
In principle this is much like another useful technique which is One does not choose any given meditation subject but instead simply sits and takes note What is my mental state now
What gross feelings
What subtle feelings
What memories and expectations
What intentions or desires In actual practice this is done not in the form of verbal thoughts as expressed in the preceding sentences but rather as a state of watchful observation with few if any word thoughts present
Quite often at such times one finds a subtle mental defilement which must be examined and discarded
That is the idea Now I am meditating and want to have something to show for it
I want something to happen Or it may be I want to confront and overcome my anger but now that I'm looking for it it seems to have gone and with this arises a feeling of frustration
Herein one has set a goal and been thwarted
Thus the desiring of this specific goal and its resultant frustration is the very state of mind that must be dealt with
Successful meditation requires catching the immediate present
Finally a note about the attainments in meditation unless one is very advanced one does not expect or aspire to any new or unusual experience such as are known in ordinary life
Instead the attainments are negative ones and thus only seen in retrospect
For example one suddenly reflects A year ago I was chronically depressed unhappy irritable defensive
That rarely happens now
Such and such a thing used to upset me greatly
Now it happens and I hardly notice
It may be stating the case too strongly to say that in meditation one seeks to gain nothing
For there is an increase in happiness and peace of mind
But when asked What have you gained from meditation the answer would be It is not what I have gained that is important but rather what I have diminished namely greed hatred and delusion
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Is mindfulness actually a power in its own right as claimed by the title of this essay
Seen from the viewpoint of the ordinary pursuits of life it does not seem so
From that angle mindfulness or attention has a rather modest place among many other seemingly more important mental faculties serving the purpose of variegated wishfulfillment
Here mindfulness means just to watch one's steps so that one may not stumble or miss a chance in the pursuit of one's aims
Only in the case of specific tasks and skills is mindfulness sometimes cultivated more deliberately but here too it is still regarded as a subservient function and its wider scope and possibilities are not recognized
Even if one turns to the Buddha's doctrine taking only a surface view of the various classifications and lists of mental factors in which mindfulness appears one may be inclined to regard this faculty just as one among many Again one may get the impression that it has a rather subordinate place and is easily surpassed in significance by other faculties
Mindfulness in fact has if we may personify it a rather unassuming character
Compared with it mental factors such as devotion energy imagination and intelligence are certainly more colorful personalities making an immediate and strong impact on people and situations
Their conquests are sometimes rapid and vast though often insecure
Mindfulness on the other hand is of an unobtrusive nature
Its virtues shine inwardly and in ordinary life most of its merits are passed on to other mental faculties which generally receive all the credit
One must know mindfulness well and cultivate its acquaintance before one can appreciate its value and its silent penetrative influence
Mindfulness walks slowly and deliberately and its daily task is of a rather humdrum nature
Yet where it places its feet it cannot easily be dislodged and it acquires and bestows true mastery of the ground it covers
Mental faculties of such a nature like actual personalities of a similar type are often overlooked or underrated
In the case of mindfulness it required a genius like the Buddha to discover the hidden talent in the modest garb and to develop the vast inherent power of that potent seed
It is indeed the mark of a genius to perceive and to harness the power of the seemingly small
Here truly it happens that what is little becomes much A revaluation of values takes place
The standards of greatness and smallness change
Through the master mind of the Buddha mindfulness is finally revealed as the Archimedean point where the vast revolving mass of world suffering is levered out of its twofold anchorage in ignorance and craving
The Buddha spoke of the power of mindfulness in a very emphatic way
All things can be mastered by mindfulness
Further there is that solemn and weighty utterance opening and concluding the Satipatthana Sutta the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness
In ordinary life if mindfulness or attention is directed to any object it is rarely sustained long enough for the purpose of careful and factual observation
Generally it is followed immediately by emotional reaction discriminative thought reflection or purposeful action
In a life and thought governed by the Buddha's teaching too mindfulness is mostly linked with clear comprehension of the right purpose or suitability of an action and other considerations
Thus again it is not viewed in itself
But to tap the actual and potential power of mindfulness it is necessary to understand and deliberately cultivate it in its basic unalloyed form which we shall call bare attention
By bare attention we understand the clear and singleminded awareness of what actually happens to us and in us at the successive moments of perception
It is called bare because it attends to the bare facts of a perception without reacting to them by deed speech or mental comment
Ordinarily that purely receptive state of mind is as we said just a very brief phase of the thought process of which one is often scarcely aware
But in the methodical development of mindfulness aimed at the unfolding of its latent powers bare attention is sustained for as long a time as one's strength of concentration permits
Bare attention then becomes the key to the meditative practice of satipatthana opening the door to mind's mastery and final liberation
Bare attention is developed in two ways as a methodical meditative practice with selected objects as applied as far as practicable to the normal events of the day together with a general attitude of mindfulness and clear comprehension
The details of the practice have been described elsewhere and need not be repeated here
The primary purpose of this essay is to demonstrate and explain the efficacy of this method that is to show the actual power of mindfulness
Particularly in an age like ours with its superstitious worship of ceaseless external activity there will be those who ask How can such a passive attitude of mind as that of bare attention possibly lead to the great results claimed for it In reply one may be inclined to suggest to the questioner not to rely on the words of others but to put these assertions of the Buddha to the test of personal experience
But those who do not yet know the Buddha's teaching well enough to accept it as a reliable guide may hesitate to take up without good reasons a practice that just on account of its radical simplicity may appear strange to them
In the following a number of such good reasons are therefore proffered for the reader's scrutiny
They are also meant as an introduction to the general spirit of satipatthana and as pointers to its wide and significant perspectives
Furthermore it is hoped that he who has taken up the methodical training will recognize in the following observations certain features of his own practice and be encouraged to cultivate them deliberately
We shall now deal with four aspects of bare attention which are the mainsprings of the power of mindfulness
They are not the only sources of its strength but they are the principal ones to which the efficacy of this method of mental development is due
These four are
If anyone whose mind is not harmonized and controlled through methodical meditative training should take a close look at his own everyday thoughts and activities he will meet with a rather disconcerting sight
Apart from the few main channels of his purposeful thoughts and activities he will everywhere be faced with a tangled mass of perceptions thoughts feelings and casual bodily movements showing a disorderliness and confusion which he would certainly not tolerate in his livingroom
Yet this is the state of affairs that we take for granted within a considerable portion of our waking life and our normal mental activity
Let us now look at the details of that rather untidy picture
First we meet a vast number of casual senseimpressions such as sights and sounds passing constantly through our mind
Most of them remain vague and fragmentary some are even based on faulty perceptions and misjudgments
Carrying these inherent weaknesses they often form the untested basis for judgments and decisions on a higher level of consciousness
True all these casual sense impressions need not and cannot be objects of focused attention
A stone on the road that happens to meet our glance will have a claim on our attention only if it obstructs our progress or is of interest to us for some reason
Yet if we neglect these casual impressions too often we may stumble over many stones lying on our road and also overlook many gems
Besides the casual sense impressions there are those more significant and definite perceptions thoughts feelings and volitions which have a closer connection with our purposeful life
Here too we find that a very high proportion of them are in a state of utter confusion
Hundreds of crosscurrents flash through the mind and everywhere there are bits and ends of unfinished thoughts stifled emotions and passing moods
Many meet a premature death
Owing to their innately feeble nature our lack of concentration or suppression by new and stronger impressions they do not persist and develop
If we observe our own mind we shall notice how easily diverted our thoughts are how often they behave like undisciplined disputants constantly interrupting each other and refusing to listen to the other side's arguments
Again many lines of thought remain rudimentary or are left untranslated into will and action because courage is lacking to accept their practical moral or intellectual consequences
If we continue to examine more closely our average perceptions thoughts or judgments we shall have to admit that many of them are unreliable
They are just the products of habit led by prejudices of intellect or emotion by our pet preferences or aversions by laziness or selfishness by faulty or superficial observations
Such a look into longneglected quarters of the mind will come as a wholesome shock to the observer
It will convince him of the urgent need for methodical mental culture extending below the thin surface layer of the mind to those vast twilight regions of consciousness we have just visited
The observer will then become aware that the relatively small sector of the mind that stands in the intense light of purposeful will and thought is not a reliable standard of the inner strength and lucidity of consciousness in its totality
He will also see that the quality of individual consciousness cannot be judged by a few optimal results of mental activity achieved in brief intermittent periods
The decisive factor in determining the quality of consciousness is selfunderstanding and selfcontrol whether that dim awareness characteristic of our everyday mind and the uncontrolled portion of everyday activity tends to increase or decrease
It is the daily little negligence in thoughts words and deeds going on for many years of our life that is chiefly responsible for the untidiness and confusion we find in our minds
This negligence creates the trouble and allows it to continue
Thus the old Buddhist teachers have said Negligence produces a lot of dirt
As in a house so in the mind only a very little dirt collects in a day or two but if it goes on for many years it will grow into a vast heap of refuse
The dark untidy corners of the mind are the hideouts of our most dangerous enemies
From there they attack us unawares and much too often succeed in defeating us
That twilight world peopled by frustrated desires and suppressed resentments by vacillations whims and many other shadowy figures forms a background from which upsurging passions  greed and lust hatred and anger  may derive powerful support
Besides the obscure and obscuring nature of that twilight region is the very element and mothersoil of the third and strongest of the three roots of evil ignorance or delusion
Attempts at eliminating the mind's main defilements  greed hate and delusion  must fail as long as these defilements find refuge and support in the uncontrolled dim regions of the mind as long as the close and complex tissue of those halfarticulate thoughts and emotions forms the basic texture of mind into which just a few golden strands of noble and lucid thought are woven
But how are we to deal with that unwieldy tangled mass
Usually we try to ignore it and to rely on the counteracting energies of our surface mind
But the only safe remedy is to face it  with mindfulness
Nothing more difficult is needed than to acquire the habit of directing bare attention to these rudimentary thoughts as often as possible
The working principle here is the simple fact that two thoughts cannot coexist at the same time if the clear light of mindfulness is present there is no room for mental twilight
When sustained mindfulness has secured a firm foothold it will be a matter of comparatively secondary importance how the mind will then deal with those rudimentary thoughts moods and emotions
One may just dismiss them and replace them by purposeful thoughts or one may allow and even compel them to complete what they have to say
In the latter case they will often reveal how poor and weak they actually are and it will then not be difficult to dispose of them once they are forced into the open
This procedure of bare attention is very simple and effective the difficulty is only the persistence in applying it
Observing a complex thing means identifying its component parts singling out the separate strands forming that intricate tissue
If this is applied to the complex currents of mental and practical life automatically a strong regulating influence will be noticeable
As if ashamed in the presence of the calmly observing eye the course of thoughts will proceed in a less disorderly and wayward manner it will not be so easily diverted and will resemble more and more a wellregulated river
During decades of the present life and throughout millennia of previous lives traversing the round of existence there has steadily grown within each individual a closely knit system of intellectual and emotional prejudices of bodily and mental habits that are no longer questioned as to their rightful position and useful function in human life
Here again the application of bare attention loosens the hard soil of these often very ancient layers of the human mind preparing thus the ground for sowing the seed of methodical mental training
Bare attention identifies and pursues the single threads of that closely interwoven tissue of our habits
It sorts out carefully the subsequent justifications of passionate impulses and the pretended motives of our prejudices
Fearlessly it questions old habits often grown meaningless
It uncovers their roots and thus helps abolish all that is seen to be harmful
In brief bare attention lays open the minute crevices in the seemingly impenetrable structure of unquestioned mental processes
Then the sword of wisdom wielded by the strong arm of constant meditative practice will be able to penetrate these crevices and finally to break up that structure where required
If the inner connection between the single parts of a seemingly compact whole become intelligible they then cease to be inaccessible
When the facts and details of the mind's conditioned nature are uncovered by meditative practice there is an increased chance to effect fundamental changes in the mind
In that way not only those hitherto unquestioned habits of the mind its twilight regions and its normal processes as well but even those seemingly solid indisputable facts of the world of matter  all will become questionable and lose much of their selfassurance
Many people are so impressed and intimidated by that bland selfassurance of assumed solid facts that they hesitate to take up any spiritual training doubting that it can effect anything worthwhile
The application of bare attention to the task of tidying and regulating the mind will bring perceptible results  results which will dispel their doubts and encourage them to enter more fully a spiritual path
The tidying or regulating function of bare attention we should note is of fundamental importance for the purification of beings mentioned by the Buddha as the first aim of satipatthana
This phrase refers of course to the purification of their minds and here the very first step is to bring initial order into the functioning of the mental processes
We have seen how this is done by bare attention
In that sense the commentary to the Discourse on the Foundation of Mindfulness explains the words for the purification of beings as follows
We said before that bare attention tidies up or regulates the mind by sorting out and identifying the various confused strands of the mental process
That identifying function like any other mental activity is connected with a verbal formulation
In other words identifying proceeds by way of expressly naming the respective mental processes
Primitive man believed that words could exercise a magical power things that could be named had lost their secret power over man the horror of the unknown
To know the name of a force a being or an object was identical with the mastery over it That ancient belief in the magical potency of names appears also in many fairy tales and myths where the power of a demon is broken just by facing him courageously and pronouncing his name
There is an element of truth in the wordmagic of primitive man and in the practice of bare attention we will find the power of naming confirmed
The twilight demons of the mind  our passionate impulses and obscure thoughts  cannot bear the simple but clarifying questions about their names much less the knowledge of these names
Hence this is often alone sufficient to diminish their strength
The calmly observant glance of mindfulness discovers the demons in their hidingplaces
The practice of calling them by their names drives them out into the open into the daylight of consciousness
There they will feel embarrassed and obliged to justify themselves although at this stage of bare attention they have not yet even been subjected to any closer questioning except about their names their identity
If forced into the open while still in an incipient stage they will be incapable of withstanding scrutiny and will just dwindle away
Thus a first victory over them may be won even at an early stage of the practice
The appearance in the mind of undesirable and ignoble thoughts even if they are very fleeting and only halfarticulate has an unpleasant effect upon one's selfesteem
Therefore such thoughts are often shoved aside unattended to and unopposed
Often they are also camouflaged by more pleasing and respectable labels which hide their true nature
Thoughts disposed of in either of these two ways will strengthen the accumulated power of ignoble tendencies in the subconscious
Furthermore these procedures will weaken one's will to resist the arising and the dominance of mental defilements and strengthen the tendency to evade the issues
But by applying the simple method of clearly and honestly naming or registering any undesirable thoughts these two harmful devices ignorance and camouflage are excluded
Thence their detrimental consequences on the structure of the subconscious and their diversion of mental effort will be avoided
When ignoble thoughts or personal shortcomings are called by their right names the mind will develop an inner resistance and even repugnance against them
In time it may well succeed in keeping them in check and finally eliminating them
Even if these means do not bring undesirable tendencies fully under control at once they will stamp upon them the impact of repeated resistance which will weaken them whenever they reappear
To continue our personification we may say that unwholesome thoughts will no longer be the unopposed masters of the scene and this diffidence of theirs will make them considerably easier to deal with
It is the power of moral shame that has been mustered here as an ally methodically strengthened by these simple yet subtle psychological techniques
The method of naming and registering also extends of course to noble thoughts and impulses which will be encouraged and strengthened
Without being given deliberate attention such wholesome tendencies often pass unnoticed and remain barren
But when clear awareness is applied to them it will stimulate their growth
It is one of the most beneficial features of right mindfulness and particularly of bare attention that it enables us to utilize all external events and inner mental events for our progress
Even the unsalutary can be made a starting point for the salutary if through the device of naming or registering it becomes an object of detached knowledge
In several passages of the Satipatthana Sutta the function of naming or bare registering seems to be indicated by formulating the respective statements by way of direct speech
There are no less than four such instances in the discourse
He knows a lustful mind 'Mind is lustful' etc
If sense desire is present in him he knows 'Sense desire is present in me' etc
If the enlightenment factor mindfulness is present in him he knows 'The enlightenment factor mindfulness is present in me' etc
In concluding this section we briefly point out that the tidyingup and naming of mental processes is the indispensable preparation for fully understanding them in their true nature the task of insight
These functions exercised by bare attention will help dispel the illusion that the mental processes are compact
They will also help us to discern their specific nature or characteristics and to notice their momentary rise and fall
Both the world surrounding us and the world of our own minds are full of hostile and conflicting forces causing us pain and frustration
We know from our own bitter experience that we are not strong enough to meet and conquer all these antagonistic forces in open combat
In the external world we cannot have everything exactly as we want it while in the inner world of the mind our passions impulses and whims often override the demands of duty reason and our higher aspirations
We further learn that often an undesirable situation will only worsen if excessive pressure is used against it
Passionate desires may grow in intensity if one tries to silence them by sheer force of will
Disputes and quarrels will go on endlessly and grow fiercer if they are fanned again and again by angry retorts or by vain attempts to crush the other man's position
A disturbance during work rest or meditation will be felt more strongly and will have a longerlasting impact if one reacts to it by resentment and anger and attempts to suppress it
Thus again and again we meet with situations in life where we cannot force issues
But there are ways of mastering the vicissitudes of life and conflicts of mind without applications of force
Nonviolent means may often succeed where attempts at coercion internal or external fail
Such a nonviolent way of mastering life and mind is satipatthana
By the methodical application of bare attention the basic practice in the development of right mindfulness all the latent powers of a noncoercive approach will gradually unfold with the beneficial results and their wide and unexpected implications
In this context we are mainly concerned with the benefits of Satipatthana for the mastery of mind and for the progress in meditation that may result from a noncoercive procedure
But we shall also cast occasional side glances at its repercussions on everyday life
It will not be difficult for a thoughtful reader to make more detailed application to his own problems
The antagonistic forces that appear in meditation and that are liable to upset its smooth course are of three kinds
These distractions are the great stumbling blocks for a beginner in meditation who has not yet acquired sufficient dexterity to deal with them effectively
To give thought to those disturbing factors only when they actually arise at the time of meditation is insufficient
If caught unprepared in one's defence one will struggle with them in a more or less haphazard and ineffective way and with a feeling of irritation which will itself be an additional impediment
If disturbances of any kind and unskillful reactions to them occur several times during one session one may come to feel utterly frustrated and irritated and give up further attempts to meditate at least for the present occasion
In fact even meditators who are quite well informed by books or a teacher about all the details concerning their subject of meditation often lack instruction on how to deal skillfully with the disturbances they may meet
The feeling of helplessness in facing them is the most formidable difficulty for a beginning meditator
At that point many accept defeat abandoning prematurely any further effort at methodical practice
As in worldly affairs so in meditation one's way of dealing with the initial difficulties will often be decisive for success or failure
When faced by inner and outer disturbances the inexperienced or uninstructed beginner will generally react in two ways
He will first try to shove them away lightly and if he fails in that he will try to suppress them by sheer force of will
But these disturbances are like insolent flies by whisking  first lightly and then with increasing vigor and anger  one may perhaps succeed in driving them away for a while but usually they will return with an exasperating constancy and the effort and vexation of whisking will have produced only an additional disturbance of one's composure
Satipatthana through its method of bare attention offers a nonviolent alternative to those futile and even harmful attempts at suppression by force
A successful nonviolent procedure in mindcontrol has to start with the right attitude
There must be first the full cognizance and sober acceptance of the fact that those three disturbing factors are coinhabitants of the world we live in whether we like it or not
Our disapproval of them will not alter the fact
With some we shall have to come to terms and concerning the others  the mental defilements  we shall have to learn how to deal with them effectively until they are finally conquered
Since we are not the sole inhabitants of this densely populated world there are bound to be external disturbances of various kinds such as noise and interruptions by visitors
We cannot always live in splendid isolation from the noise of men and dogs untroubled or ivory towers high above the crowd
Right meditation is not escapism it is not meant to provide hidingplaces for temporary oblivion
Realistic meditation has the purpose of training the mind to face to understand and to conquer this very world in which we live
And this world inevitably includes numerous obstacles to the life of meditation
The Burmese meditation master the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw said In an unliberated worldling mental defilements are sure to arise again and again
He has to face that fact and know these defilements well in order to apply again and again the appropriate remedy of Satipatthana
Then they will grow weaker more shortlived and will finally disappear To know the occurrence and nature of defilements is therefore as important for a meditator as to know the occurrence of his noble thoughts
By facing one's own defilements one will be stirred to increase the effort to eliminate them
On the other hand if out of a false shame or pride one tries to avert one's glance when they arise one will never truly join issue with them and will always evade the final and decisive encounter
By hitting blindly at them one will only exhaust or even hurt oneself
But by observing carefully their nature and behavior when they arise in one's own mind one will be able to meet them well prepared to forestall them often and finally to banish them fully
Therefore meet your defilements with a free and open glance
Be not ashamed afraid or discouraged
The third group of intruders disturbing the meditator's mind are stray thoughts and daydreams
These may consist of various memories and images of the past recent or remote including those emerging from subconscious depths thoughts of the future  planning imagining fearing hoping and the casual senseperceptions that may occur at the very time of meditation often dragging after them a long trail of associated ideas
Whenever concentration and mindfulness slacken stray thoughts or daydreams appear and fill the vacuum
Though they seem insignificant in themselves through their frequent occurrence they form a most formidable obstacle not only for the beginner but in all cases when the mind is restless or distracted
However when these invaders can be kept at bay even long continuous periods of meditation can be achieved
As in the case of the mental defilements stray thoughts will be entirely excluded only at the stage of Arahatship when the perfect mindfulness thereby obtained keeps unfailing watch at the door of the mind
If they are to shape our attitude all these facts about the three kinds of disturbing factors must be given full weight and be fully absorbed by our mind
Then in these three disturbing factors the noble truth of suffering will manifest itself to the meditator very incisively through his own personal experience Not to obtain what one wants is suffering The three other noble truths should also be exemplified by reference to the same situation
In such a way even when dealing with impediments the meditator will be within the domain of Satipatthana
He will be engaged in the mindful awareness of the Four Noble Truths  a part of the contemplation of mental objects
It is characteristic of right mindfulness and one of its tasks to relate the actual experiences of life to the truth of the Dhamma and to use them as opportunities for its practical realization
Already at the preliminary stage devoted to the shaping of a correct and helpful attitude we have the first successful test of our peaceful weapons by understanding our adversaries better we have consolidated our position which was formerly weakened by an emotional approach and by transforming these adversaries into teachers of the truths we have won the first advantage over them
If we are mentally prepared by a realistic view of these three factors antagonistic to meditation we shall be less inclined to react at once by irritation when they actually arise
We shall be emotionally in a better position to meet them with the nonviolent weapons of which we shall now speak
There are three devices for countering disturbances that arise in meditation
The three should be applied in succession whenever the preceding device has failed to dispose of the disturbance
All three are applications of bare attention they differ in the degree and duration of attention given to the disturbance
The guiding rule here is to give no more mental emphasis to the respective disturbance than is actually required by circumstances
First one should notice the disturbance clearly but lightly that is without emphasis and without attention to details
After that brief act of noticing one should try to return to the original subject of meditation
If the disturbance was weak or one's preceding concentration fairly strong one may well succeed in resuming contemplation
At that stage by being careful not to get involved in any conversation or argument with the intruder we shall on our part not give it a reason to stay long and in a good number of cases the disturbance will soon depart like a visitor who does not receive a very warm welcome
That curt dismissal may often enable us to return to our original meditation without any serious disturbance to the composure of mind
The nonviolent device here is to apply bare attention to the disturbance but with a minimum of response to it and with a mind bent on withdrawal
This is the very way in which the Buddha himself dealt with inopportune visitors as described in the Mahasuññata Sutta with a mind bent on seclusion and withdrawn his conversation aiming at dismissing Similar was Shantideva's advice on how to deal with fools if one cannot avoid them one should treat them with the indifferent politeness of a gentleman
If however the disturbance persists one should repeat the application of bare attention again and again patiently and calmly and it may be that the disturbance will vanish when it has spent its force
Here the attitude is to meet the repeated occurrence of a disturbance by a reiterated No a determined refusal to be deflected from one's course
This is the attitude of patience and firmness
The capacity for watchful observation has to be aided here by the capacity to wait and to hold one's ground
These two devices will generally be successful with incidental stray thoughts and daydreams which are feeble by nature but the other two types of disturbances the external ones and defilements may also yield quite often
But if for some reason they do not yield one should deliberately turn one's full attention to the disturbance and make it an object of knowledge
Thus one transforms it from a disturbance to meditation into a legitimate object of meditation
One may continue with that new object until the external or internal cause for attending to it has ceased or if it proves satisfactory one may even retain it for the rest of that session
For instance when disturbed by a persistent noise we should give the noise our undivided attention but we should take care to distinguish the object itself from our reaction to it
For example if resentment arises it should be clearly recognized in its own nature whenever it arises
In doing so we shall be practicing the contemplation of mindobjects according to the following passage of the Satipatthana Sutta He knows the ear and sounds and the fetter arising through both If the noise is intermittent or of varying intensity one will easily be able to discern the rise and fall in its occurrence
In that way one will add to one's direct insight into impermanency
The attitude towards recurrent mental defilements such as thoughts of lust and restlessness should be similar
One should face them squarely but distinguish them from one's reaction to them eg connivance fear resentment irritation
In doing so one is making use of the device of naming and one will reap the benefits mentioned above
In the recurrent waves of passion or restlessness one will likewise learn to distinguish gradually phases of high and low their ups and downs and may also gain other helpful knowledge about their behavior
By that procedure one again remains entirely within the range of Satipatthana by practicing the contemplation of the state of mind and of mindobjects
This method of transforming disturbances to meditation into objects of meditation as simple as it is ingenious may be regarded as the culmination of nonviolent procedure
It is a device very characteristic of the spirit of satipatthana to make use of all experiences as aids on the path
In that way enemies are turned into friends for all these disturbances and antagonistic forces have become our teachers and teachers whoever they may be should be regarded as friends
We cannot forego to quote here a passage from a noteworthy little book The Little Locksmith by Katherine Butler Hathaway a moving human document of fortitude and practical wisdom acquired by suffering
We said before that the occurrence of the three disturbing elements cannot always be prevented
They are parts of our world and their coming and going follows its own laws irrespective of our approval or disapproval
But by applying bare attention we can avoid being swept away or dislodged by them
By taking a firm and calm stand on the secure ground of mindfulness we shall repeat in a modest degree but in an essentially identical way the historic situation under the Bodhi Tree
When Mara the Evil One at the head of his army claimed the soil on which the future Buddha sat the latter refused to budge
Trusting in the power of mindfulness we may confidently repeat the Bodhisatta's aspiration on that occasion Ma Mam thana acavi
May he not dislodge me from this place
Let the intruders come and go
Like all the other members of that vast unceasing procession of mental and physical events that passes before our observant eyes in the practice of bare attention they arise and having arisen they pass away
Our advantage here is the obvious fact that two thought moments cannot be present at the same time
Attention refers strictly speaking not to the present but to the moment that has just passed away
Thus as long as mindfulness holds sway there will be no disturbance or defiled thought This gives us the chance to hold on to that secure ground of an observer's post our own potential throne of enlightenment
By the quietening and neutralizing influence of detached observation as applied in our three devices the interruptions of meditation will increasingly lose the sting of irritation and thereby their disturbing effect
This will prove to be an act of true viraga which literally means decoloring When these experiences are stripped of the emotional tinge that excites towards lust aversion irritation and other defilements of the mind they will appear in their true nature as bare phenomena
The nonviolent procedure of bare attention endows the meditator with the light but sure touch so essential for handling the sensitive evasive and refractory nature of the mind
It also enables him to deal smoothly with the various difficult situations and obstacles met with in daily life
To illustrate the even quality of energy required for attaining to the meditative absorptions The Path of Purification describes a test which students of surgery in ancient days had to undergo as a proof of their skill
A lotus leaf was placed in a bowl of water and the pupil had to make an incision through the length of the leaf without cutting it entirely or submerging it
He who applied an excess of force either cut the leaf into two or pressed it into the water while the timid one did not even dare to scratch it
In fact something like the gentle but firm hand of the surgeon is required in mental training and this skillful wellbalanced touch will be the natural outcome of the nonviolent procedure in the practice of bare attention
For a full and unobstructed unfoldment of the mind's capacities the influence of two complementary forces is needed activating and restraining
That twofold need was recognized by the Buddha the great knower of mind
He advised that the faculties of energy and of concentration should be kept equally strong and well balanced
Furthermore he recommended three of the seven factors of enlightenment as suitable for rousing the mind and three for calming it
In both cases among the spiritual faculties and the enlightenment factors it is mindfulness that not only watches over their equilibrium but also activates those that are sluggish and restrains those that are too intense
Mindfulness though seemingly of a passive nature is in fact an activating force
It makes the mind alert and alertness is indispensable for all purposeful activity
In the present inquiry however we shall examine how it makes for disentanglement and detachment and how it positively helps in the development of the mental qualities required for the work of deliverance
In practicing bare attention we keep still at the mental and spatial place of observation amidst the loud demands of the inner and outer world
Mindfulness possesses the strength of tranquillity the capacity for deferring action and applying the brake for stopping rash interference and for suspending judgment while pausing to observe facts and to reflect upon them wisely
It also brings a wholesome slowing down in the impetuosity of thought speech and action
Keeping still and stopping pausing and slowing down  these will be our key words when speaking now of the restraining effect of bare attention
An ancient Chinese book states
In the light of the Buddha's teaching the true end of things is Nibbana which is called the stilling of formations that is their final end or cessation
It is also called the stopping
The things or formations meant here are the conditioned and impersonal phenomena rooted in craving and ignorance
The end of formations comes to be by the end of forming that is by the end of worldcreating kammic activities
It is the end of the world and of suffering which the Buddha proclaimed cannot be reached by walking migrating or transmigrating but can be found within ourselves
That end of the world is heralded by each deliberate act of keeping still stopping or pausing
Keeping still in that highest sense means stopping the accumulation of kamma abstaining from our unceasing concern with evanescent things abstaining from perpetually adding to our entanglements in samsara  the round of repeated birth and death
By following the way of mindfulness by training ourselves to keep still and pause in the attitude of bare attention we refuse to take up the world's persistent challenge to our dispositions for greed or hatred
We protect ourselves against rash and delusive judgments we refrain from blindly plunging into the whirlpool of interfering action with all its inherent dangers
 Sutta Nipata v
He who keeps still and knows where to stop will not meet danger  TaoTeChing Chapter 
The Chinese saying quoted earlier states in its second part that there is nothing more glorious in making things start than in keeping still
Explained in the Buddhist sense these things effectively started by keeping still are the things making for decrease of kammic accumulation In dealing with them we may follow the traditional division of mental training into morality concentration and wisdom
All three are decisively helped by the attitude of keeping still cultivated by bare attention
Conduct
How can we improve our conduct its moral quality and its skill in taking right decisions
If we earnestly desire such an improvement it will generally be wisest to choose the line of least resistance
If we turn too quickly against those shortcomings deeply rooted in old habits or in powerful impulses we might suffer discouraging defeat
We should pay attention first to our blemishes of action and speech and our errors of judgment caused by thoughtlessness and rashness
Of these there are many
In our lives there are numerous instances where one short moment of reflection might have prevented a false step and thereby warded off a long chain of misery or moral guilt that started with a single moment of thoughtlessness
But how can we curb our rash reactions and replace them by moments of mindfulness and reflection
To do so will depend on our capacity to stop and pause to apply brakes at the right time and this we can learn by practicing bare attention
In that practice we shall train ourselves to look and wait to suspend reactions or slow them down
We shall learn it first the easy way in situations of our own choice within the limited field of experiences met with during the periods of meditative practice
When facing again and again the incidental sense impressions feelings or stray thoughts which interrupt our concentration when curbing again and again our desire to respond to them in some way when succeeding again and again in keeping still in face of them  we shall be preparing ourselves to preserve that inner stillness in the wider and unprotected field of everyday life
We shall have acquired a presence of mind that will enable us to pause and stop even if we are taken by surprise or are suddenly provoked or tempted
Our present remarks refer to those blemishes of conduct liable to arise through thoughtlessness and rashness but which may be more or less easily checked through mindfulness
Dexterity in dealing with these will also affect those more obstinate deviations from moral conduct rooted in strong passionate impulses or in deeply ingrained bad habits
The increased tranquillity of mind achieved in keeping still for bare attention will restrain the impetuosity of passions
The acquired habit of pausing and stopping will act as a brake to the ingrained habits of indulging in unwholesome deeds
By being able to keep still for bare attention or to pause for wise reflection very often the first temptation to lust the first wave of anger the first mist of delusion will disappear without causing serious entanglement
At which point the current of unwholesome thought process is stopped will depend on the quality of mindfulness
If mindfulness is keen it will succeed at a very early point in calling a stop to a series of defiled thoughts or actions before we are carried along by them too far
Then the respective defilements will not grow beyond their initial strength less effort will be required to check them and fewer kammic entanglements or none will follow
Let us take the example of a pleasant visual object which has aroused our liking
At first that liking might not be very active and insistent
If at this point the mind is already able to keep still for detached observation or reflection the visual perception can easily be divested of its still very slight admixture of lust
The object becomes registered as just something seen that has caused a pleasant feeling or the attraction felt is sublimated into a quiet aesthetic pleasure
But if that earliest chance has been missed the liking will grow into attachment and into the desire to possess
If now a stop is called the thought of desire may gradually lose its strength it will not easily turn into an insistent craving and no actual attempts to get possession of the desired object will follow
But if the current of lust is still unchecked then the thought of desire may express itself by speech in asking for the object or even demanding it with impetuous words
That is unwholesome mental kamma is followed by unwholesome verbal kamma
A refusal will cause the original current of lust to branch out into additional streams of mental defilements either sadness or anger
But if even at that late stage one can stop for quiet reflection or bare attention accept the refusal and renounce wishfulfillment further complications will be avoided
However if clamoring words are followed by unwholesome bodily kamma and if driven by craving one tries to get possession of the desired object by stealth or force then the kammic entanglement is complete and its consequences must be experienced in their full impact
But still if even after the completion of the evil act one stops for reflection it will not be in vain
For the mindfulness that arises in the form of remorseful retrospection will preclude a hardening of character and may prevent a repetition of the same action
The Exalted One once said to his son Rahula
Also while you are performing an action by body speech or mind you should consider that action If in considering it you realize 'This action which I am performing is harmful to myself or harmful to others or harmful to both it is an unwholesome action producing suffering resulting in suffering'  then you should desist from such an action
Also after you have performed an action by body speech or mind you should consider that action If in considering it you realize 'This action which I have performed has been harmful to myself or harmful to others or harmful to both it was an unwholesome action producing suffering resulting in suffering  then you should in the future refrain from it
Tranquillity
We shall now consider how stopping for bare attention also helps one to attain and strengthen tranquillity in its double sense general peace of mind and meditative concentration
By developing the habit of pausing for bare attention it becomes increasingly easier to withdraw into one's own inner stillness when unable to escape bodily from the loud insistent noises of the outer world
It will be easier to forego useless reactions to the foolish speech or deeds of others
When the blows of fate are particularly hard and incessant a mind trained in bare attention will find a refuge in the haven of apparent passivity or watchful nonaction from which position it will be able to wait patiently until the storms have passed
There are situations in life when it is best to allow things to come to their natural end
He who is able to keep still and wait will often succeed where aggressiveness or busy activity would have been vanquished
Not only in critical situations but also in the normal course of life the experience won by observant keeping still will convince us that we need not actively respond to every impression we receive or regard every encounter with people or things as a challenge to our interfering activity
By refraining from busying ourselves unnecessarily external frictions will be reduced and the internal tensions they bring will loosen up
Greater harmony and peace will pervade the life of every day bridging the gap between normal life and the tranquillity of meditation
Then there will be fewer of those disturbing inner reverberations of everyday restlessness which in a coarse or subtle form invade the hours of meditation producing bodily and mental unrest
Consequently the hindrance of agitation a chief obstacle to concentration will appear less often and will be easier to overcome when it arises
By cultivating the attitude of bare attention as often as opportunity offers the centrifugal forces of mind making for mental distraction will peter out the centripetal tendency turning the mind inward and making for concentration will gather strength
Craving will no longer run out in pursuit of a variety of changing objects
Regular practice of sustained attention to a continuous series of events prepares the mind for sustained concentration on a single object or a limited number of objects in the strict practice of meditation
Firmness or steadiness of mind another important factor in concentration will likewise be cultivated
Thus the practice of keeping still pausing and stopping for bare attention fosters several salient components of meditative tranquillity calmness concentration firmness and reduction of the multiplicity of objects
It raises the average level of normal consciousness and brings it closer to the level of the meditative mind
This is an important point because often too wide a gap between these two mental levels repeatedly frustrates attempts at mental concentration and hinders the achievement of smooth continuity in meditative practice
In the sequence of the seven factors of enlightenment we find that the enlightenment factor of tranquillity precedes that of concentration
Expressing the same fact the Buddha says If tranquilized within the mind will become concentrated Now in the light of our previous remarks we shall better understand these statements
Insight
It has been said by the Exalted One He whose mind is concentrated sees things as they really are Therefore all those ways by which bare attention strengthens concentration also provide a supporting condition for the development of insight
But there is also a more direct and specific help which insight receives from keeping still in bare attention
Generally we are more concerned with handling and using things than with knowing them in their true nature
Thus we usually grasp in haste the very first few signals conveyed to us by a perception
Then through deeply ingrained habit those signals evoke a standard response by way of judgments such as goodbad pleasantunpleasant usefulharmful rightwrong
These judgments by which we define the objects in relation to ourselves lead to corresponding reactions by word or deed
Only rarely does attention dwell upon a common or familiar object for any longer time than is needed to receive the first few signals
So for the most part we perceive things in a fragmentary manner and thence misconceive them
Further only the very first phase of the object's lifespan or a little more comes into the focus of our attention
One may not even be consciously aware that the object is a process with an extension in time  a beginning and an end that it has many aspects and relations beyond those casually perceived in a limited situation that in brief it has a kind of evanescent individuality of its own
A world perceived in this superficial way will consist of shapeless little lumps of experiences marked by a few subjectively selected signs or symbols
The symbols chosen are determined mainly by the individual's selfinterest sometimes they are even misapplied
The shadowlike world that results includes not only the outer environment and other persons but also a good part of one's own bodily and mental processes
These too become subjected to the same superficial manner of conceptualization
The Buddha points out four basic misconceptions that result from distorted perceptions and unmethodical attention taking the impure for pure the impermanent for lasting the painful and painbringing for pleasant and the impersonal for a self or something belonging to the self
When the seal of selfreference is thus stamped again and again upon the world of everyday experience the basic misconception This belongs to me will steadily put forth roots into all the bodily and mental factors of our being
Like the hairroots of a plant these will be fine but firm and widespread  to such an extent in fact that the notions of I and mine will hardly be shaken by mere intellectual convictions about the nonexistence of self
These grave consequences issue from that fundamental perceptual situation our rush into hasty or habitual reactions after receiving the first few signals from our perceptions
But if we muster the restraining forces of mindfulness and pause for bare attention the material and mental processes that form the objects of mind at the given moment will reveal themselves to us more fully and more truly
No longer dragged at once into the whirlpool of selfreference allowed to unfold themselves before the watchful eye of mindfulness they will disclose the diversity of their aspects and the wide net of their correlations and interconnections
The connection with selfinterest so narrow and often falsifying will recede into the background dwarfed by the wider view now gained
The processes observed display in their serial occurrence and in their component parts a constant birth and death a rise and a fall
Thereby the facts of change and impermanence impress themselves on the mind with growing intensity
The same discernment of rise and fall dissolves the false conceptions of unity created under the influence of the egocentric attitude
Selfreference uncritically overrides diversity it lumps things together under the preconceptions of being a self or belonging to a self
But bare attention reveals these sham unities as impersonal and conditioned phenomena
Facing thus again and again the evanescent dependent and impersonal nature of lifeprocesses with and without we will discover their monotony and unsatisfactory nature in other words the truth of suffering
Thus by the simple device of slowing down pausing and keeping still for bare attention all three of the characteristics of existence  impermanence suffering and nonself  will open themselves to penetrative insight
An acquired or strengthened habit of pausing mindfully before acting does not exclude a wholesome spontaneity of response
On the contrary through training the practice of pausing stopping and keeping still for bare attention will itself become quite spontaneous
It will grow into a selective mechanism of the mind that with an increasing reliability and swiftness of response can prevent the upsurge of evil or unwise impulses
Without such a skill we may intellectually realise those impulses to be unwholesome but still succumb to them due to their own powerful spontaneity
The practice of pausing mindfully serves therefore to replace unwholesome spontaneity or habits by wholesome ones grounded in our better knowledge and nobler intentions
Just as certain reflex movements automatically protect the body similarly the mind needs spontaneous spiritual and moral selfprotection
The practice of bare attention will provide this vital function
A person of average moral standards instinctively shrinks from thoughts of theft or murder
With the help of the method of bare attention the range of such spontaneous moral brakes can be vastly extended and ethical sensitivity greatly heightened
In an untrained mind noble tendencies and right thoughts are often assailed by the sudden outbreak of passions and prejudices
They either succumb or assert themselves only with difficulty after an inner struggle
But if the spontaneity of the unwholesome is checked or greatly reduced as described above our good impulses and wise reflections will have greater scope to emerge and express themselves freely and spontaneously
Their natural flow will give us greater confidence in the power of the good within us it will also carry more conviction for others
That spontaneity of the good will not be erratic for it will have deep and firm roots in previous methodical training
Here appears a way by which a premeditated good thought may be transformed into a spontaneous good thought
According to the psychology of the Abhidhamma such a thought if combined with knowledge takes the first place in the scale of ethical values
In this way we shall achieve a practical understanding of a saying in The Secret of the Golden Flower If one attains intentionally to an unintentional state one has comprehension This saying invites a paraphrase in Pali terms Sasankharena asankharijam pattabbam by premeditated intentional effort spontaneity can be won
If the numerous aids to mental growth and liberation found in the Buddha's teaching are wisely utilized there is actually nothing that can finally withstand the Satipatthana method and this method starts with the simple practice of learning to pause and stop for bare attention
Against the impetuosity rashness and heedlessness of the untrained mind the practice of pausing and stopping sets up a deliberate slowingdown
The demands of modern life however make it impracticable to introduce such a slowdown of function into the routine of the average working day
But as an antidote against the harmful consequences of the hectic speed of modern life it is all the more important to cultivate that practice in one's leisure hours especially in periods of strict Satipatthana practice
Such practice will also bestow the worldly benefits of greater calm efficiency and skill in one's daily round of work
For the purpose of meditative development slowingdown serves as an effective training in heedfulness sensecontrol and concentration
But apart from that it has a more specific significance for meditative practice
In the commentary to the Satipatthana Sutta it is said that the slowing down of movements may help in regaining lost concentration on a chosen object
A monk so we read had bent his arm quickly without remembering his subject of meditation as his rule of practice demanded
On becoming aware of that omission he took his arm back to its previous position and repeated the movement mindfully
The subject of meditation referred to was probably clearly comprehending action as mentioned in the Satipatthana Sutta In bending and stretching he acts with clear comprehension
The slowingdown of certain bodily movements during strict meditative training is particularly helpful in gaining insightknowledge especially the direct awareness of change and nonself
To a great extent it is the rapidity of movement that strengthens the illusions of unity identity and substantiality in what is actually a complex evanescent process
Therefore in the strict practice of Satipatthana the slowing down of such actions as walking bending and stretching so as to discern the several phases of each movement provides a powerful aid for direct insight into the three characteristics of all phenomena
The meditator's contemplation will gain increasing force and significance if he notices clearly how each partial phase of the process observed arises and ceases by itself and nothing of it goes over or transmigrates to the next phase
Under the influence of pausing for bare attention the average rhythm of our everyday actions speech and thoughts will also become more quiet and peaceful
Slowing down the hurried rhythm of life means that thoughts feelings and perceptions will be able to complete the entire length of their natural lifetime
Full awareness will extend up to their end phase to their last vibrations and reverberations
Too often that end phase is cut off by an impatient grasping at new impressions or by hurrying on to the next stage of a line of thought before the earlier one has been clearly comprehended
This is one of the main reasons for the disorderly state of the average mind which is burdened by a vast amount of indistinct or fragmentary perceptions stunted emotions and undigested ideas
Slowingdown will prove an effective device for recovering the fullness and clarity of consciousness
A fitting simile and at the same time an actual example is the procedure called for in the practice of mindfulness of breathing mindfulness has to cover the whole extent of the breath its beginning middle and end
This is what is meant by the passage in the sutta Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in and out Similarly the entire breath or rhythm of our life will become deeper and fuller if through slowingdown we get used to sustained attention
The habit of prematurely cutting off processes of thought or slurring over them has assumed serious proportions in the man of modern urban civilization
Restlessly he clamors for ever new stimuli in increasingly quicker succession just as he demands increasing speed in his means of locomotion
This rapid bombardment of impressions has gradually blunted his sensitivity and thus he always needs new stimuli louder coarser and more variegated
Such a process if not checked can end only in disaster
Already we see at large a decline of finer aesthetic susceptibility and a growing incapacity for genuine natural joy
The place of both is taken by a hectic shortbreathed excitement incapable of giving any true aesthetic or emotional satisfaction
Shallow mental breath is to a great extent responsible for the growing superficiality of civilized man and for the frightening spread of nervous disorders in the West
It may well become the start of a general deterioration of human consciousness in its qualitative level range and strength
This danger threatens all those in the East as well as in the West who lack adequate spiritual protection from the impact of technical civilization
Satipatthana can make an important contribution to remedying this situation in the way we have briefly indicated here
Thus the method will prove beneficial from the worldly point of view as well
Here however we are chiefly concerned with the psychological aspects of mindfulness and their significance for meditative development
Sustained attention helped by slowingdown will affect the quality of consciousness mainly in three ways in intensifying consciousness in clarifying the object's characteristic features and in revealing the object's relatedness
An object of sustained attention will exert a particularly strong and longlasting impact on the mind
Its influence will be felt not only throughout the thoughtseries immediately following the particular perception but may also extend far into the future
It is that causal efficacy which is the measure of the intensity of consciousness
sustained attention leads to a fuller picture of the object in all its aspects
Generally the first impression we gain of any new senseobject or idea will be its most striking feature it is this aspect of the object which captures our attention up to the culminating point of the impact
But the object also displays other aspects or characteristics and is capable of exercising other functions than those we initially notice
These may be less obvious to us or subjectively less interesting but still they may be even more important
There will also be cases where our first impression is entirely deceptive
Only if we sustain our attention beyond that first impact will the object reveal itself more fully
In the downward course of the first perceptual wave the prejudicing force of the first impact lessens and it is only then in that end phase that the object will yield a wider range of detail a more complete picture of itself
It is therefore only by sustained attention that we can obtain a clearer understanding of an object's characteristic features
Among the characteristic features of any object physical or mental there is one class we often overlook due to hasty or superficial attention and therefore needs to be treated separately
This is the relatedness of the object
The object's relatedness extends back to its past  to its origin causes reasons and logical precedents it also extends outward to embrace the total context  its background environment and presently active influences
We can never fully understand things if we view them in artificial isolation
We have to see them as part of a wider pattern in their conditioned and conditioning nature and this can be done only with the help of sustained attention
The three ways of heightening consciousness just discussed are evidently of prime importance for the development of insight
When consciousness is intensified and its objective field clarified and discerned in its relational structure the ground is prepared for seeing things according to reality But besides its obvious direct influence this threefold process also has an indirect influence which is no less powerful and important it strengthens and sharpens the mind's subliminal faculties of subconscious organization memory and intuition
These again on their part nourish and consolidate the progress of liberating insight
The insight aided by them is like the mountain lake of the canonical simile it is fed not only by the outside rains but also by springs welling up from within its own depths
The insight nourished by these underground subliminal resources of the mind will have deep roots
The meditative results that it brings cannot be lost easily even with unliberated worldlings who are still subject to relapse
Perceptions or thoughts which have been objects of sustained attention make a stronger impact on the mind and reveal their characteristic features more distinctly than when attention is slack
Thus when they sink into the subconscious they occupy there a special position
This holds true for all three ways of enhancing the consciousness of an object
In a process of consciousness if attention is as strong in the end phase as in the earlier phases then when the process is finished and the mind lapses back into subconsciousness the latter will be more amenable to conscious control
If an impression or idea has been marked by numerous distinct characteristics then when it fades from immediate awareness it will not be so easily lost in the vague contents of the subconscious or dragged by passionate biases into false subconscious associations
The correct comprehension of the object's relatedness similarly will protect the experience from being merged with indistinct subconscious material
Perceptions or thoughts of enhanced intensity and clarity absorbed into the subconscious remain more articulate and more accessible than contents originating from hazy or stunned impressions
It will be easier to convert them into full consciousness and they will be less accountable in their hidden effects upon the mind
If through an improvement in the quality and range of mindfulness the number of such matured impressions increases the results might be a subtle change in the very structure of subconsciousness itself
It will be evident from our earlier remarks that those impressions which we have called matured or more accessible and convertible lend themselves more easily and more correctly to recollection  more easily because of their greater intensity more correctly because their clearly marked features protect them from being distorted by false associative images or ideas
Remembering them in their context and relatedness works both ways  it promotes both easier and more correct recollection
Thus sati in its meaning and function of mindfulness helps to strengthen sati in its meaning and function of memory
The influence of sustained attention on the subconscious and on memory brings a deepening and strengthening of the faculty of intuition particularly the intuitive insight which chiefly concerns us here
Intuition is not a gift from the unknown
Like any other mental faculty it arises out of specific conditions
In this case the primary conditions are latent memories of perceptions and thoughts stored in the subconscious
Obviously the memories providing the most fertile soil for the growth of intuition will be those marked by greater intensity clarity and wealth of distinctive marks for it is these that are most accessible
Here too the preserved relatedness of the impressions will contribute much
Recollections of that type will have a more organic character than memories of bare or vague isolated facts and they will fall more easily into new patterns of meaning and significance
These more articulate memory images will be a strong stimulation and aid for the intuitive faculty
Silently in the hidden depths of the subliminal mind the work of collecting and organizing the subconscious material of experience and knowledge goes on until it is ripe to emerge as an intuition
The breakthrough of that intuition is sometimes occasioned by quite ordinary happenings
However though seemingly ordinary these events may have a strong evocative power if previously they had been made objects of sustained attention
Slowingdown and pausing for bare attention will uncover the depth dimension of the simple things of everyday life and thus provide stimuli for the intuitive faculty
This applies also to the intuitive penetration of the Four Noble Truths that culminates in liberation
The scriptures record many instances of monks who could not arrive at intuitive penetration when engaged in the actual practice of insight meditation
The flash of intuition struck them on quite different occasions when stumbling against a rock or catching sight of a forest fire a mirage or a lump of froth in a river
We meet here another confirmation of that seemingly paradoxical saying that intentionally an unintentional state may be won By deliberately turning the full light of mindfulness on the smallest events and actions of everyday life eventually the liberating wisdom may arise
Sustained attention not only provides the nourishing soil for the growth of intuition it also makes possible the fuller utilization and even repetition of the intuitive moment
Men of inspiration in various fields of creative activity have often deplored their common experience the flash of intuition strikes so suddenly and vanishes so quickly that frequently the slow response of the mind hardly catches the last glimpse of it
But if the mind has been trained in observant pausing in slowingdown and sustained attention and if  as indicated above  the subconscious has been influenced then the intuitive moment too might gain that fuller slower and stronger rhythm
This being the case its impact will be strong and clear enough to allow for full use of that flash of intuitive insight
It might even be possible to lead its fading vibrations upward again to a new culmination similar to the rhythmic repetition of a melody rising again in harmonious development out of the last notes of its first appearance
The full utilization of a single moment of intuitive insight could be of decisive importance for one's progress toward full realization
If one's mental grip is too weak and one lets those elusive moments of intuitive insight slip away without having utilized them fully for the work of liberation then they might not recur until many years have passed or perhaps not at all during the present life
Skill in sustained attention however will allow one to make full use of such opportunities and slowingdown and pausing during meditative practice is an important aid in acquiring that skill
Through our treatment of pausing stopping and slowingdown one of the traditional definitions of mindfulness found in the Pali scriptures will have become more intelligible in its farreaching implications that is its function of anapilapanata meaning literally not floating away Like pumpkinpots on the surface of water add the commentators and they continue Mindfulness enters deeply into its object instead of hurrying only over its surface Therefore nonsuperficiality will be an appropriate rendering of the above Pali term and a fitting characterization of mindfulness
 GLichtenberg 
In an earlier section we spoke about the impulsive spontaneity of the unwholesome
We have seen how stopping for bare and sustained attention is able to counter or reduce our rash impulsive reactions thus allowing us to face any situation with a fresh mind with a directness of vision unprejudiced by those first spontaneous responses
By directness of vision we understand a direct view of reality without any coloring or distorting lenses without the intrusion of emotional or habitual prejudices and intellectual biases
It means coming face to face with the bare facts of actuality seeing them as vividly and freshly as if we were seeing them for the first time
Those spontaneous reactions which so often stand in the way of direct vision do not derive only from our passionate impulses
Very frequently they are the product of habit
In that form they generally have an even stronger and more tenacious hold on us  a hold which may work out either for our good or for our harm
The influence habit exercises for the good is seen in the power of repeated practice This power protects our achievements and skills  whether manual or mental worldly or spiritual  against loss or forgetfulness and converts them from casual shortlived imperfect acquisitions into the more secure possession of a quality thoroughly mastered
The detrimental effect of habitual spontaneous reactions is manifest in what is called in a derogative sense the force of habit its deadening stultifying and narrowing influence productive of compulsive behavior of various kinds
In our present context we shall be concerned only with that negative aspect of habit as impeding and obscuring the directness of vision
As remarked earlier habitual reactions generally have a stronger influence upon our behavior than impulsive ones
Our passionate impulses may disappear as suddenly as they have arisen
Though their consequences may be very grave and extend far into the future their influence is in no way as long lasting and deep reaching as that of habit
Habit spreads its vast and closely meshed net over wide areas of our life and thought trying to drag in more and more
Our passionate impulses too might be caught in that net and thus be transformed from passing outbursts into lasting traits of character
A momentary impulse an occasional indulgence a passing whim may by repetition become a habit we find difficult to uproot a desire hard to control and finally an automatic function we no longer question
Repeated gratification turns a desire into a habit and habit left unchecked grows into compulsion
It sometimes happens that at an early time we regard a particular activity or mental attitude as without any special personal importance
The activity or attitude may be morally indifferent and inconsequential
At the start we might find it easy to abandon it or even to exchange it for its opposite since neither our emotions nor reason bias us towards either alternative
But by repetition we come to regard the chosen course of action or thought as pleasant desirable and correct even as righteous and thus we finally identify it with our character or personality
Consequently we feel any break in this routine to be unpleasant or wrong
Any outside interference with it we greatly resent even regarding such interference as a threat to our vital interests and principles In fact at all times primitive minds whether civilized or not have looked at a stranger with his strange customs as an enemy and have felt his mere unagressive presence as a challenge or threat
At the beginning when no great importance was ascribed to the specific habit the attachment that gradually formed was directed not so much to the action proper as to the pleasure we derive from the undisturbed routine
The strength of that attachment to routine derives partly from the force of physical and mental inertia so powerful a motive in man
We shall presently refer to another cause for attachment to routine
By force of habit the particular concern  whether a material object an activity or a way of thinking  comes to be invested with such an increase of emotional emphasis that the attachment to quite unimportant or banal things may become as tenacious as that to our more fundamental needs
Thus the lack of conscious control can turn even the smallest habits into the uncontested masters of our lives
It bestows upon them the dangerous power to limit and rigidify our character and to narrow our freedom of movement  environmental intellectual and spiritual
Through our subservience to habit we forge new fetters for ourselves and make ourselves vulnerable to new attachments aversions prejudices and predilections that is to new suffering
The danger for spiritual development posed by the dominating influence of habit is perhaps more serious today than ever before for the expansion of habit is particularly noticeable in our present age when specialization and standardization reach into so many varied spheres of life and thought
Therefore when considering the Satipatthana Sutta's words on the formation of fetters we should also think of the important part played by habit
In Buddhist terms it is preeminently the hindrance of sloth and torpor which is strengthened by the force of habit and it is the mental faculties such as agility and pliancy of mind that are weakened
This tendency of habits to extend their range is anchored in the very nature of consciousness
It stems not only from the aforementioned passive force of inertia but in many cases from an active will to dominate and conquer
Certain active types of consciousness possessing a fair degree of intensity tend to repeat themselves
Each one struggles to gain ascendancy to become a center around which other weaker mental and physical states revolve adapting themselves to and serving that central disposition
This tendency is never quite undisputed but still it prevails and even peripheral or subordinate types of consciousness exhibit the same urge for ascendancy
This is a striking parallel to the selfassertion and domineering tendency of an egocentric individual in his contact with society
Among biological analogies we may mention the tendency toward expansion shown by cancer and other pathological growths the tendency toward repetition we meet in the freak mutations which loom as a grave danger at the horizon of our atomic age
Due to that will to dominate inherent in many types of consciousness a passing whim may grow into a relatively constant trait of character
If still not satisfied with its position it may break away entirely from the present combination of life forces until finally in the process of rebirths it becomes the very center of a new personality
There are within us countless seeds for new lives for innumerable potential beings all of whom we should vow to liberate from the wheel of samsara as the Sixth Zen Patriarch expressed it
Detrimental physical or mental habits may grow strong not only if fostered deliberately but also if left unnoticed or unopposed
Much of what has now strong roots in our nature has grown from minute seeds planted in a longforgotten past
This growth of morally bad or otherwise detrimental habits can be effectively checked by gradually developing another habit that of attending to them mindfully
If we now do deliberately what had become a mechanical performance and if prior to doing it we pause a while for bare attention and reflection  this will give us a chance to scrutinize the habit and clearly comprehend its purpose and suitability
It will allow us to make a fresh assessment of the situation to see it directly unobscured by the mental haze that surrounds a habitual activity with the false assurance It is right because it was done before Even if a detrimental habit cannot be broken quickly the reflective pause will counter its unquestioned spontaneity of occurrence
It will stamp it with the seal of repeated scrutiny and resistance so that on its recurrence it will be weaker and will prove more amenable to our attempts to change or abolish it
It need hardly be mentioned that habit which has been rightly called the wetnurse of man cannot and should not disappear from our life
Let us only remember what a relief it is particularly in the crowded day and complex life of a citydweller to be able to do a great number of things fairly mechanically with as it were only halfpowered attention Habit brings considerable simplification to our life
It would be an unbearable strain if all our little humdrum activities had to be done with deliberate effort and close attention
In fact many operations of manual labor much of the technique in art and even standard procedure in complex intellectual work generally bring better and more even results through skilled routine performance
Yet that evenness of habitual performance will also reach its end point
Unless enlivened by the creation of new interest it will show symptoms of fatigue and start to decline
Of course it would be absurd to advocate that all our little habits be abolished for many are innocuous and even useful
But we should regularly ask ourselves whether we still have control over them whether we can give them up or alter them at will
We can answer this question for ourselves in two ways by attending to our habitual actions mindfully for a certain period of time and second by actually giving them up temporarily in cases where this will not have any harmful or disturbing effects upon ourselves or others
If we turn on them the light of direct vision looking at them or performing them as if for the first time these little routine activities and the habitual sights around us will assume a new glow of interest and stimulation
This also holds good for our professional occupation and its environment and for our close human relationships if they should have become stale by habit
The relationship to one's marriage partner to friends to colleagues may thus receive a great rejuvenation
A fresh and direct vision will also reveal that one can relate to people or do things in a different and more beneficial way than one did before by force of habit
An acquired capacity to give up minor habits will prove its worth in the fight against more dangerous proclivities
It will also come to our aid at times when we are faced with serious changes in our life which forcefully deprive us of fundamental habits
Loosening the hardened soil of our routine behavior and thoughts will have an enlivening effect on our vital energy our mental vigor and our power of imagination
But what is most important into that loosened soil we shall be able to plant the seeds of vigorous spiritual progress
Mental Habituation to standard reactions to sequences of activity to judgments of people or things proceeds by way of associative thinking
From the objects ideas situations and people that we encounter we select certain distinctive marks and associate these marks with our own response to them
If these encounters recur they are associated first with those marks selected earlier and then with our original or strongest response
Thus these marks become a signal for releasing a standard reaction which may consist of a long sequence of connected acts or thoughts familiar through repeated practice or experience
This way of functioning makes it unnecessary for us to apply new effort and painstaking scrutiny to each single step in such a sequence
The result is a great simplification of life permitting us to release energy for other tasks
In fact in the evolution of the human mind associative thinking was a progressive step of decisive importance
It enabled us to learn from experience and thus led up to the discovery and application of causal laws
Yet along with these benefits associative thinking can also bring many grave dangers if it is applied faultily or thoughtlessly and not carefully controlled
Let us draw up a partial list of these danger points
Incomplete observations and restricted viewpoints in judgment sufficient to deal with one particular situation may prove quite inadequate and entail grave consequences if mechanically applied to changed circumstances
Due to misdirected associative thinking a strong instinctive dislike may be felt for things places or persons which in some way are merely reminiscent of unpleasant experiences but actually have no connection with them
These brieflystated instances show how vital it is for us to scrutinize from time to time the mental grooves of our associative thoughts and to review the various habits and stereotype reactions deriving from them
In other words we must step out of our ruts regain a direct vision of things and make a fresh appraisal of our habits in the light of that vision
If we look once again over the list of potential dangers deriving from uncontrolled associative thinking we shall better understand the Buddha's insistence upon getting to the bedrock of experience
In the profound and terse stanzas called The Cave included in the Sutta Nipata the Buddha says that the full penetration of sense impression will make one free from greed and that by understanding perception one will be able to cross the flood of samsara
By placing mindfulness as a guard at the very first gate through which thoughts enter the mind we shall be able to control the incomers much more easily and shut out unwanted intruders
Thus the purity of luminous consciousness can be maintained against adventitious defilements
The Satipatthana Sutta provides a systematic training for inducing direct fresh and undistorted vision
The training covers the entire personality in its physical and mental aspects and includes the whole world of experience
The methodical application of the several exercises to oneself to others and alternatingly to both will help uncover erroneous conceptions due to misdirected associative thinking and misapplied analogies
The principal types of false associative thinking are covered in the terminology of the Dhamma by the four kinds of misapprehension or perverted views which wrongly take what is impermanent for permanent what is painful or conducive to pain for happiness what has no self and is unsubstantial for a self or an abiding substance and what is impure for beautiful
These perverted views arise through a false apprehension of the characteristic marks of things
Under the influence of our passions and false theories we perceive things selectively in a onesided or erroneous way and then associate them wrongly with other ideas
By applying bare attention to our perceptions and impressions gradually we can free them from these misapprehensions progressing steadily towards the direct vision of things as they really are
One who has clear and direct vision stirred to a sense of urgency by things which are deeply moving will experience a release of energy and courage enabling him to break through his timid hesitations and his rigid routine of life and thought
If that sense of urgency is kept alive it will bestow the earnestness and persistence required for the work of liberation
Thus said the teachers of old
Our closest surroundings are full of stirring things
If we generally do not perceive them as such that is because habit has made our vision dull and our heart insensitive
The same thing happens to us even with the Buddha's teaching
When we first encounter the teaching we receive a powerful intellectual and emotional stimulation but gradually the impetus tends to lose its original freshness and impelling force
The remedy is to constantly renew it by turning to the fullness of life around us which illustrates the Four Noble Truths in ever new variations
A direct vision will impart new lifeblood even to the most common experiences of every day so that their true nature appears through the dim haze of habit and speaks to us with a fresh voice
It may well be just the long accustomed sight of the beggar at the street corner or a weeping child or the illness of a friend which startles us afresh makes us think and stirs our sense of urgency in treading resolutely the path that leads to the cessation of suffering
We know the beautiful account of how Prince Siddhattha first came face to face with old age illness and death while driving his chariot through the royal city after a long period of isolation in a makebelieve world
This ancient story may well be historical fact for we know that in the lives of many great men common events often gain a symbolic significance and lead to major consequences far beyond their ordinary appearance
Great minds find significance in the seemingly commonplace and invest the fleeting moment with farreaching efficacy
But without contesting the inner truth of that old story we may reasonably believe that the young prince had actually seen before with his fleshly eyes old people sick people and those who had succumbed to death
However on all these earlier occasions he would not have been touched very deeply by these sights  as is the case with most of us most of the time
That earlier lack of sensitivity may have been due to the carefully protected artificial seclusion of his petty though princely happiness the hereditary routine of his life into which his father had placed him
Only when he broke through the golden cage of easygoing habits could the facts of suffering strike him as forcibly as if he had seen them for the first time
Then only was he stirred by them to a sense of urgency that led him out of the home life and set his feet firmly on the road to enlightenment
The more clearly and deeply our minds and hearts respond to the truth of suffering manifest in the very common facts of our existence the less often shall we need a repetition of the lesson and the shorter will be our migration through samsara
The clarity of perception evoking our response will come from an undeflected directness of vision bestowed by bare attention and the depth of experience will come from wise reflection or clear comprehension
Directness of vision is also a chief characteristic of the methodical practice of insight meditation
There it is identified with the direct or experiential knowledge bestowed by meditation as distinguished from the inferential knowledge obtained by study and reflection
In the meditative development of insight one's own physical and mental processes are directly viewed without the interference of abstract concepts or the filtering screens of emotional evaluation
For in this context these only obscure or camouflage the naked facts detracting from the strong immediate impact of reality
Conceptual generalizations from experience are very useful in their place but if they interrupt the meditative practice of bare attention they tend to shove aside or dispose of the particular fact by saying as it were It is nothing else but this Generalizing thought inclines to become impatient with a recurrent type and after having it classified soon finds it boring
Bare attention however being the key instrument of methodological insight keeps to the particular
It follows keenly the rise and fall of successive physical and mental processes
Though all phenomena of a given series may be true to type bare attention regards each of them as distinct and conscientiously registers its separate birth and death
If mindfulness remains alert these repetitions of type will by their multiplication exert not a reduced but an intensified impact on the mind
The three characteristics  impermanence suffering and voidness of selfinherent in the process observed will stand out more and more clearly
They will appear in the light shed by the phenomena themselves not in a borrowed light not even a light borrowed from the Buddha the peerless and indispensable guide to these experiences
These physical and mental phenomena in their selfluminosity will then convey a growing sense of urgency to the meditator revulsion dissatisfaction awareness of danger followed by detachment  though certainly joy happiness and calm too will not be absent throughout the practice
Then if all other conditions of inner maturity are fulfilled the first direct vision of final liberation will dawn with the streamwinner's indubitable knowledge Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of vanishing
Thus in the unfoldment of the power of mindfulness Satipatthana will prove itself as the true embodiment of the Dhamma of which it was said
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The Suttanipata or Discoursecollection from which this selection has been compiled contains some of the oldest and most profound discourses of the Buddha
The complete text has been translated at least three times into English the most recent being by EM
Hare under the title Woven Cadences
The Pali original consists mainly of verse interspersed with some prose passages and Hare has followed this arrangement by translating it into English blank verse
However in the selection appearing below the aim has been to keep as near as possible to the original and no attempt has been made to versify it
The first discourse shows the distinction between the mode of conduct of the bhikkhu and the layman both regarded as virtuous or good
For as it is said elsewhere
 Snp
vv

The layfollower is given the five precepts of abstaining from killing stealing and so forth and then the eight precepts are observed on special occasions
Also perhaps it is appropriate to commence with Dhammika's praising the Buddha for these two moral discipline and faith in the Buddha are the basic requisites for making further progress on the Buddhist path
The next two discourses deal with wrong and right conduct pointing out the results both courses lead to
One of the essentials for the practice of the Buddha's teaching is having good friends and the avoidance of those who hinder one's progress
The best friend is He from whom one learns the Dhamma and as such the Buddha is known as the Good Friend to all beings
The next two give the practical training and the direction one should tend towards
Continuous effort is needed to practice the Dhamma and to inspire one there is no better example than the Buddha's own struggle
Then there are two contemplations on the transience of life and the futility of sorrowing over the natural course of events in this world
Two important discourses follow dealing with the misconception that purity can come from outside without putting forth any effort and with wrongly holding to views and opinions leading to contention and suffering
These two together with the rest of what follows are regarded as some of the oldest discourses of the Suttanipata and contain much that is difficult to understand
In the Parayanavagga the last chapter of the Suttanipata sixteen brahmanas  famous throughout the world meditators delighting in meditation and wise  come to the Buddha and ask Him various questions
Five of them are included here
No
may be compared with the Sakkapanha Suttanta which contains a closely parallel series of questions and answers
No
consists of the concluding verses of a fairly long discourse and indicates the disparity existing between the realization of the Ariya the Buddhas and their disciples and the way of thinking usual to the ordinary people of this world
A note ought to be included on the term Dhamma an important and frequent word in Buddhist literature and which has in most cases been left untranslated below for the reason that there is no equivalent word in English to cover all its various shades of meaning
It could be rendered by Law Norm Teaching Doctrine Scripture Truth Nature practice method conduct causality etc for these are all meanings of the term 'Dhamma' But they all tend to fall short of a true definition
The Dhamma is the heart of the Buddha's teaching and without it Buddhism would be something quite dead and yet it is not the exclusive possession of the historical religion
In addition it has another set of meanings and is practically always used in this sense in the plural as mental objects ideas things phenomena elements forces states
etc
In this latter sense however it has not been left untranslated below
In conclusion I wish to acknowledge the valuable assistance given by the Ven
Nyanaponika Mahathera in correcting several errors in the translation of this short anthology and in supplying much advice and commentarial literature used in formulating the notes
Thus have I heard
At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Grove at Anathapindika's monastery
Now the layfollower Dhammika with five hundred other layfollowers approached the Lord
Having drawn near and having saluted the Lord respectfully he sat down at one side
Sitting there the layfollower Dhammika addressed the Lord as follows
I ask Gotama of extensive wisdom this How acting is a disciple virtuous  both the disciple who has gone from home to the homeless state and the followers who are householders
For you clearly understand the behavior of the world with the devas and the final release
There is none equal to you who are skilled in seeing what is profound
You are an illustrious Awakened One
Having investigated all knowledge and being compassionate towards beings you have announced the Dhamma a revealer of what is hidden of comprehensive vision stainless you illuminate all the worlds
This Dhamma subtle and pleasing and taught so clearly by you Lord it is this we all wish to hear
Having been questioned foremost Awakened One tell us
All these bhikkhus and also the layfollowers who have come to hear the truth let them listen to the Dhamma awakened to by the Stainless One as the devas listen to the wellspoken words of Vasava
Listen to me bhikkhus I will teach you the ascetic practice the mode of living suitable for those who have gone forth
Do you all bear it in mind
One who is intent upon what is good and who is thoughtful should practice it
A bhikkhu should not wander about at the wrong time but should walk the village for food at the right time as one who goes about at the wrong time is obsessed by attachment therefore Awakened Ones do not walk at the wrong time
Sights sounds tastes scents and bodily contacts overwhelm beings
Being rid of desire for these sense objects at the right time one may enter for the morning meal
Having duly obtained food going back alone and sitting down in a secluded place being inwardly thoughtful and not letting the mind go out to external objects a bhikkhu should develop selfcontrol
If he should speak with a laydisciple with someone else or with another bhikkhu he should speak on the subtle Dhamma not slandering others nor gossiping
Some set themselves up as disputants in opposition to others those of little wisdom we do not praise attachments bind them and they are carried away by their emotions
Having heard the Dhamma taught by the Sugata and considered it a disciple of Him of excellent wisdom should wisely make use of food a dwelling a bed a seat and water for washing the robe
But a bhikkhu should not be soiled by these things as a lotus is not wetted by a drop of water
Now I will tell you the layman's duty
Following it a laydisciple would be virtuous for it is not possible for one occupied with the household life to realize the complete bhikkhu practice
He should not kill a living being nor cause it to be killed nor should he incite another to kill
Do not injure any being either strong or weak in the world
A disciple should avoid taking anything from anywhere knowing it
He should not steal nor incite another to steal
He should completely avoid theft
A wise man should avoid unchastity as a pit of glowing charcoal
If unable to lead a celibate life he should not go to another's wife
Having entered a royal court or a company of people he should not speak lies
He should not speak lies nor incite others to do so
He should completely avoid falsehood
A layman who has chosen to practice this Dhamma should not indulge in the drinking of intoxicants
He should not drink them nor encourage others to do so realizing that it leads to madness
Through intoxication foolish people perform evil deeds and cause other heedless people to do likewise
He should avoid intoxication this occasion for demerit which stupefies the mind and is the pleasure of foolish people
This is called the eightfactored observance made known by the Awakened One who has reached the end of suffering
With a gladdened mind observe the observance day complete with its eight factors on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth days of the fortnight and also the special holiday of the half month
In the morning with a pure heart and a joyful mind a wise man after observing the uposatha should distribute suitable food and drink to the community of bhikkhus
He should support his mother and father as his duty and engage in lawful trading
A layman who carries this out diligently goes to the devas called Selfradiant
 vv
 
The practice of Dhamma the practice of continence mastery of this is said to be best if a person has gone forth from home to the homeless life
But if he is garrulous and like a brute delights in hurting others his life is evil and his impurity increases
A quarrelsome bhikkhu shrouded by delusion does not comprehend the Dhamma taught by the Awakened One when it is revealed
Annoying those practiced in meditation being led by ignorance he is not aware that his defiled path leads to Nirayahell
Falling headlong passing from womb to womb from darkness to darkness such a bhikkhu undergoes suffering hereafter for certain
As a cesspool filled over a number of years is difficult to clean similarly whoever is full of impurity is difficult to make pure
Whoever you know to be such bhikkhus bent on worldliness having wrong desires wrong thoughts wrong behavior and resort being completely united avoid him sweep him out like dirt remove him like rubbish
Winnow like chaff the nonrecluses
Having ejected those of wrong desires of wrong behavior and resort be pure and mindful dwelling with those who are pure
Being united and prudent you will make an end to suffering
By developing what habit what conduct what actions may man be correctly established in and arrive at the highest goal
He should respect his elders and not be envious of them
He should know the right time for seeing his teacher
If a talk on Dhamma has started he should know the value of the opportunity and should listen carefully to the wellspoken words
When the time is right let him go to his teacher's presence unassuming putting aside stubbornness
Let him keep in mind and practice the meaning and the text selfcontrol and the Holy Life
Delighting in the Dhamma devoted to the Dhamma established in the Dhamma skilled in investigating the Dhamma let him not indulge in talk harmful to the Dhamma
Let him be guided by wellspoken truths
Abandoning the uttering of laughter and lamentations giving up anger fraud hypocrisy longing conceit violence harshness moral taints and infatuation let him live without pride self controlled
Understanding is essential to a wellspoken word
Learning and understanding are essential to meditation but a man who is hasty and heedless does not increase his wisdom and learning
Those who are devoted to the Dhamma made known by the Noble Ones are unsurpassed in speech thought and action
They are established in peace gentleness and concentration and have reached the essence of learning and wisdom
One who overstepping and despising a sense of shame says 'I am your friend' but does not take upon himself any tasks he is capable of doing is to be recognized as no friend
One who speaks amiably to his companions but whose actions do not conform to it him the wise know for certain as a talker not a doer
He is no friend who anticipating conflict is always alert in looking out for weaknesses
But he on whom one can rely like a child sleeping on its mother's breast is truly a friend who cannot be parted from one by others
One who bears the human burden of responsibility with its fruits and blessings in mind he cultivates a cause of joy and happiness worthy of praise
Having tasted the flavor of solitude and peace one is free from fear and wrongdoings imbibing the rapture of Dhamma
He from whom a person learns the Dhamma should be venerated as the devas venerate Inda their Lord
He of great learning thus venerated will explain the Dhamma being welldisposed towards one
Having paid attention and considered it a wise man practicing according to Dhamma becomes learned intelligent and accomplished by associating himself diligently with such a teacher
But by following an inferior and foolish teacher who has not gained understanding of the Dhamma and is envious of others one will approach death without comprehending the Dhamma and unrelieved of doubt
If a man going down into a river swollen and swiftly flowing is carried away by the current  how can he help others across
Even so he who has not comprehended the Dhamma has not paid attention to the meaning as expounded by the learned being himself without knowledge and unrelieved of doubt  how can he make others understand
But if knows the method and is skilled and wise by boarding a strong boat equipped with oars and a rudder he can with its help set others across
Even so he who is experienced and has a welltrained mind who is learned and dependable clearly knowing he can help others to understand who are willing to listen and ready to receive
Surely therefore one should associate with a good man who is wise and learned
By understanding the meaning of what one has learned and practicing accordingly one who has Dhammaexperience attains happiness
Renouncing the five pleasures of sense that entrance and delight the mind and in faith departing from home become one who makes an end of suffering
Associate with good friends and choose a remote lodging secluded with little noise
Be moderate in eating
Robes almsfood remedies and a dwelling  do not have craving for these things do not be one who returns to the world
Practice restraint according to the Discipline and control the five sensefaculties
Practice mindfulness of the body and continually develop dispassion
Avoid the sign of the beautiful connected with passion by meditating on the foul cultivate a mind that is concentrated and collected
Meditate on the Signless and get rid of the tendency to conceit
By thoroughly understanding and destroying conceit you will live in the peace
In this manner the Lord repeatedly exhorted the Venerable Rahula
Violence breeds misery look at people quarreling
I will relate the emotion agitating me
Having seen people struggling and contending with each other like fish in a small amount of water fear entered me
The world is everywhere insecure every direction is in turmoil desiring an abode for myself I did not find one uninhabited
When I saw contention as the sole outcome aversion increased in me but then I saw an arrow here difficult to see set in the heart
Pierced by it once runs in every direction but having pulled it out one does not run nor does one sink
Here follows the training
Whatever are worldly fetters may you not be bound by them
Completely break down sensual desires and practice so as to realize Nibbana for yourself
A sage should be truthful not arrogant not deceitful not given to slandering others and should be without anger
He should remove the evil of attachment and wrongly directed longing he should conquer drowsiness lassitude and sloth and not dwell in indolence
A man whose mind is set on Nibbana should not be arrogant
He should not lapse into untruth nor generate love for sense objects
He should thoroughly understand conceit and abstain from violence
He should not delight in what is past nor be fond of what is new nor sorrow for what is disappearing nor crave for the attractive
Greed I say is a great flood it is a whirlpool sucking one down a constant yearning seeking a hold continually in movement difficult to cross is the morass of sensual desire
A sage does not deviate from truth a brahmana stands on firm ground renouncing all he is truly called 'calmed'
Having actually experienced and understood the Dhamma he has realized the highest knowledge and is independent
He comports himself correctly in the world and does not envy anyone here
He who has left behind sensual pleasures an attachment difficult to leave behind does not grieve nor have any longing has cut across the stream and is unfettered
Dry out that which is past let there be nothing for you in the future
If you do not grasp at anything in the present you will go about at peace
One who in regard to this entire mindbody complex has no cherishing of it as 'mine' and who does not grieve for what is nonexistent truly suffers no loss in the world
For him there is no thought of anything as 'this is mine' or 'this is another's' not finding any state of ownership and realizing 'nothing is mine' he does not grieve
To be not callous not greedy at rest and unruffled by circumstances  that is the profitable result I proclaim when asked about one who does not waver
For one who does not crave who has understanding there is no production
Refraining from initiating he sees security everywhere
A sage does not speak in terms of being equal lower or higher
Calmed and without selfishness he neither grasps nor rejects
Rouse yourself
Sit up
What good is there in sleeping
For those afflicted by disease struck by the arrow what sleep is there
Rouse yourself
Sit up
Resolutely train yourself to attain peace
Do not let the king of death seeing you are careless lead you astray and dominate you
Go beyond this clinging to which devas and men are attached and they seek
Do not waste your opportunity
When the opportunity has passed they sorrow when consigned to Nirayahell
Negligence is a taint and so is the negligence growing from it
By earnestness and understanding withdraw the arrow
When near the river Nerañjara I exerted myself in meditation for attaining to security from bondage there came Namuci speaking words of compassion
'You are emaciated and illlooking you are near to death
A thousand parts of you belong to death and only a fraction of you is alive
Live good Sir
It is better to live
Living you may perform meritorious deeds
From practicing celibacy and tending the sacrificial fire much merit is made but what is obtained from striving
It is difficult to enter the path of exertion it is difficult to do difficult to maintain' Mara spoke these words whilst standing in the presence of the Awakened One
To Mara speaking thus the Lord replied
You who are the friend of the negligent O Evil One for what reason have you come here
Those who still have use for merit Mara may consider worthwhile addressing
I have faith and energy and wisdom
Being thus bent on striving why do you ask me to live
This wind will wither the currents of the rivers why should not my exertion dry up even the blood
When the blood dries up the bile and phlegm wither
On the wasting away of the flesh the mind becomes more and more serene and my mindfulness wisdom and concentration are established more firmly
In me who abides enduring such an extreme experience the mind does not long for sensual pleasures
See the purity of a being
Sensual desire is your first army the second is called discontent the third is hunger and thirst the fourth craving the fifth sluggishness and laziness the sixth fear the seventh indecision and the eighth disparagement of others and stubbornness gain fame honor prestige wrongly acquired and whoever praises himself and despises others  these Namuci are your armies the Dark One's striking forces
A lazy cowardly person cannot overcome them but by conquering them one gains bliss
I wear muñjagrass
Shame on life here in this world
It is better for me to die in battle than to live defeated
Some recluses and brahmanas are not seen here so immersed are they
They are not aware of that path by which those of perfect conduct walk
Seeing the surrounding army ready and Mara mounted I am going out to fight so that he may not shift me from my position
This army of yours which the world together with the devas is unable to subdue that I will destroy with wisdom like an unbaked claybowl with a stone
Having mastered the mind and firmly established mindfulness I shall wander from country to country guiding many disciples
And they will be diligent and energetic in practicing my teaching the teaching of one without sensual desire and they will go where having gone one does not grieve
Mara For seven years I followed the Lord step by step but did not find an opportunity to defeat that mindful Awakened One
A crow flew around a stone having the color of fat 'Can we find even here something tender
May it be something to eat'
Not finding anything edible the crow left that place
As with the crow and the stone we leave Gotama having approached and become disheartened
Overcome by sorrow his lute fell from his arm and thereupon the unhappy spirit disappeared from that place
Short indeed is this life this side of a hundred years one dies whoever lives long even he dies from old age
People grieve for things they are attached to yet there exist no permanent possessions but just a state of separation
Seeing this one should no longer live the household life
That which a man imagines to be his will disappear at death
Knowing this a wise man will have no attachment
As a man awakened from sleep no longer sees what happened in his dream similarly one does not see a loved one who is dead
Those people who were seen and heard and called by their names as such and such only their names remain when they have passed away
Those greedy for objects of attachment do not abandon sorrow grief and avarice but sages having got rid of possessions live perceiving security
For a bhikkhu with a detached mind living in a secluded dwelling it is right they say that he no longer shows himself in the abodes
A sage who is completely independent does not make close friends or enemies
In him sorrow and selfishness do not stay like water on a lotus leaf
As a lotus is not wetted by water so a sage is not affected by what is seen or heard nor by what is perceived by the other senses
A wise man is not deluded by what is perceived by the senses
He does not expect purity by any other way
He is neither pleased nor is he repelled
Unindicated and unknown is the length of life of those subject to death
Life is difficult and brief and bound up with suffering
There is no means by which those who are born will not die
Having reached old age there is death
This is the natural course for a living being
With ripe fruits there is the constant danger that they will fall
In the same way for those born and subject to death there is always the fear of dying
Just as the pots made by a potter all end by being broken so death is of life
The young and old the foolish and the wise all are stopped short by the power of death all finally end in death
Of those overcome by death and passing to another world a father cannot hold back his son nor relatives a relation
See
While the relatives are looking on and weeping one by one each mortal is led away like an ox to slaughter
In this manner the world is afflicted by death and decay
But the wise do not grieve having realized the nature of the world
You do not know the path by which they came or departed
Not seeing either end you lament in vain
If any benefit is gained by lamenting the wise would do it
Only a fool would harm himself
Yet through weeping and sorrowing the mind does not become calm but still more suffering is produced the body is harmed and one becomes lean and pale one merely hurts oneself
One cannot protect a departed one by that means
To grieve is in vain
By not abandoning sorrow a being simply undergoes more suffering
Bewailing the dead he comes under the sway of sorrow
See other men faring according to their deeds
Hence beings tremble here with fear when they come into the power of death
Whatever they imagine it quite different from that
This is the sort of disappointment that exists
Look at the nature of the world
If a man lives for a hundred years or even more finally he is separated from his circle of relatives and gives up his life in the end
Therefore having listened to the arahant one should give up lamenting
Seeing a dead body one should know He will not be met by me again As the fire in a burning house is extinguished with water so a wise discriminating learned and sensible man should quickly drive away the sorrow that arises as the wind a piece of cotton
He who seeks happiness should withdraw the arrow his own lamentations longings and grief
With the arrow withdrawn unattached he would attain to peace of mind and when all sorrow has been transcended he is sorrowfree and has realized Nibbana
'Here I see one who is pure entirely free of sickness
By seeing him a man may attain to purity'
Convinced of that and thinking it 'the highest' he believes it to be knowledge when he contemplates 'the pure one' But if by sights man can gain purification or if through such knowledge he could leave suffering behind then one who still has attachments could be purified by another
However this is merely the opinion of those who so assert
The brahmana has said one is not purified by another nor by what is seen heard or perceived nor by the performance of ritual observances
He is not defiled by merit or demerit
Having given up what he had grasped at he no longer engages in producing
Having left a former they attach themselves to another dominated by craving they do not go beyond attachment
They reject and seize like a monkey letting go of a branch to take hold of another
A person having undertaken a ritual act goes this way and that fettered by his senses
But one with a wide wisdom having understood and gone into the Dhamma with his experience does not go this way and that
For a person indifferent towards all conditions whatever is seen heard or cognized he is one who sees it as it really is and lives with clarity
With what could he be identified in the world
They do not speculate nor pursue they do not claim perfect purity
Loosening the knot with which they are bound they do not have longing anywhere in the world
The brahmana who has gone beyond limitations having understood and seen there is no longer any assumption for him he is neither disturbed by lust nor agitated by revulsion
For him there is nothing upheld as 'the highest'  vv

A person who associates himself with certain views considering them as best and making them supreme in the world he says because of that that all other views are inferior therefore he is not free from contention
In what is seen heard cognized and in ritual observances performed he sees a profit for himself
Just by laying hold of that view he regards every other view as worthless
Those skilled say that a bond if relying on it one regards everything else as inferior
Therefore a bhikkhu should not depend on what is seen heard or cognized nor upon ritual observances
He should not present himself as equal to nor imagine himself to be inferior nor better than another
Abandoning he had held and not taking up he does not seek a support even in knowledge
Among those who dispute he is certainly not one to take sides
He does not recourse to a view at all
In whom there is no inclination to either extreme for becoming or nonbecoming here or in another existence for him there does not exist a fixed viewpoint on investigating the doctrines assumed
Concerning the seen the heard and the cognized he does not form the least notion
That brahmana who does not grasp at a view with what could he be identified in the world
They do not speculate nor pursue doctrines are not accepted by them
A brahmana is beyond does not fall back on views
 vv

The Venerable Ajita By what is the world enveloped
Because of what is it not known
With what do you say it is soiled
What is its great fear
The Lord The world is enveloped by ignorance Ajita
Because of wrongly directed desire and heedlessness it is not known
It is soiled by longings and its great fear is suffering
Ajita Everywhere flow the streams
What is the obstruction for the streams tell me the restricting of them by what are they cut off
The Lord Whatever streams are in the world it is mindfulness that obstructs them and restricts them and by wisdom they are cut off
Ajita It is just wisdom and mindfulness
Now mindandbody sir explain this where does it cease
The Lord This question you have asked Ajita I will answer for you where mindandbody completely cease
By the cessation of consciousness they cease
Ajita Those who have fully understood the Dhamma those who are training and the other individuals here explain their conduct
The Lord Not craving for sensual pleasures and with a mind that is pure and tranquil a bhikkhu should mindfully go forth skillful in all situations
 vv

The Venerable Punnaka To him who is free from craving who has seen the root I have come with a question for what reason did sages warriors brahmanas and other men prepare here in this world various sacrificial gifts for the gods
I ask the Lord this let him tell me the answer
The Lord Whatever sages warriors brahmanas and other men Punnaka prepared various sacrificial gifts for the gods they did so in the hope of this or that existence being induced by old age and decay
Punnaka By preparing various sacrificial gifts for the gods being zealous in sacrificing do they cross beyond birth and decay Lord
The Lord They hope and extol pray and sacrifice for things of the senses Punnaka
For the sake of such reward they pray
These devotees of sacrifice infatuated by their passion for existence do not cross beyond birth and decay I say
Punnaka If these devotees of sacrifice do not cross beyond birth and decay through sacrifice Sir then by what practice does one cross beyond birth and decay in this world of gods and men
The Lord He who has comprehended in the world the here and the beyond in whom there is no perturbation by anything in the world who is calm free from the smoldering fires untroubled and desireless  he has crossed beyond birth and decay I say
 vv

The Venerable Mettagu I ask the Lord this question may he tell me the answer to it
I know him to be a master of knowledge and a perfected being
From whence have arisen these many sufferings evident in the world
The Lord You have asked me the source of suffering
Mettagu I will tell it to you as it has been discerned by me
These many sufferings evident in the world have arisen from worldly attachments
Whoever ignorantly creates an attachment that stupid person comes upon suffering again and again
Therefore a man of understanding should not create attachment seeing it is the source of suffering
Mettagu What I did ask you have explained now I ask another question
Come tell me this how do the wise cross the flood birth and old age sorrow and grief
Explain it thoroughly to me O sage for this Dhamma has been understood by you
The Lord I will set forth the Dhamma Mettagu a teaching to be directly perceived not something based on hearsay by experiencing which and living mindfully one may pass beyond the entanglements of the world
Mettagu I rejoice in the thought of that highest Dhamma great sage by experiencing which and living mindfully one may pass beyond the entanglements of the world
The Lord Whatever you clearly comprehend Mettagu above below across and in between get rid of delight in it
Rid yourself of habitual attitudes and consciousness
Do not continue in existence
Living thus mindful and vigilant a bhikkhu who has forsaken selfish attachments may by understanding abandon suffering birth and old age sorrow and grief even here in this life
Mettagu I rejoice in the words of the great sage
Well explained O Gotama is the state of nonattachment
The Lord has surely abandoned suffering as this Dhamma has been realized by him
They will certainly abandon suffering who are constantly admonished by you O Sage
Having understood I venerate it Noble One
May the Lord constantly admonish me also
The Lord Whom you know as a true brahmana a master of knowledge owning nothing not attached to sensual existence he has certainly crossed this flood
Having crossed beyond he is untainted and freed from doubt
One who has discarded this clinging to renewal of existence is a man who has realized the highest knowledge
Free from craving undistressed desireless he has crossed beyond birth and old age I say
 vv

From what arise contentions and disputes lamentations and sorrows along with selfishness and conceit and arrogance along with slander
From where do these various things arise
Come tell me this
From being too endeared arise contentions and disputes lamentations and sorrows along with avarice selfishness and conceit arrogance and slander
Contentions and disputes are linked with selfishness and slander is born of contention
What are the sources of becoming endeared in the world
What are the sources of whatever passions prevail in the world of longings and fulfillments that are man's goal
Desires are the source of becoming endeared in the world also of whatever passions prevail
These are the sources of longings and fulfillments that are man's goal
Now what is the source of desire in the world
What is the cause of judgments that arise of anger untruth doubts and whatever other states that have been spoken of by the Recluse
It is pleasant it is unpleasant so people speak in the world and based upon that arises desire
Having seen the appearing and disappearing of material things a man makes his judgments in the world
Anger untruth and doubts these states arise merely because of the existence of this duality
Let a doubter train himself by way of insight to understand these states as taught by the Recluse
What is the source of thinking things as pleasant or unpleasant
When what is absent are these states not present
What is the meaning of appearing and disappearing
Explain the source of it to me
The pleasant and the unpleasant have their source in senseimpression
When this senseimpression is absent these states are not present
The idea of appearing and disappearing is produced from this I say
What is the source of senseimpression
From what arises so much grasping
By the absence of what is there no selfish attachment
By the disappearance of what is senseimpression not experienced
Senseimpression is dependent upon the mental and the material
Grasping has its source in wanting
What not being present there is no selfish attachment
By the disappearance of material objects senseimpression is not experienced
For whom does materiality disappear
How do pleasure and discomfort cease to be
Tell me how it ceases so that I may be satisfied in my mind that I have understood it
His perception is not the ordinary kind nor is his perception abnormal he is not without perception nor is his perception suspended
 to such an one immateriality ceases
Perception is indeed the source of the world of multiplicity
What we asked you have explained
We now ask another question
Tell us the answer to it
Do not some of the learned declare purification of the spirit as the highest state to be attained
And do not others speak of something else as the highest
Some of the learned do declare purification of the spirit as the highest
But contrary to them some teach a doctrine of annihilation
Those clever ones declare this to be without basis of life's fuel remaining
Knowing that these rely on a sage investigates that upon which they rely
Having understood and being free he will not dispute with anyone
The wise do not enter into any existence
The Venerable Mogharaja Twice have I asked Sakka but the Seeing One has not answered me
I have heard a divine sage replies when asked a third time
I do not know the view of the greatly famous Gotama concerning this world the next world and the Brahmaworld with its deities
To him of supreme vision I have come with a question how should one regard the world so that one is not seen by the King of Death
The Lord Look upon the world as empty Mogharaja ever mindful uprooting the view of self you may thus be one who overcomes death
So regarding the world one is not seen by the King of Death
The world here and elsewhere is not to be understood in the way we usually think of it but is defined as the five aggregates of material form feeling perception activities and consciousness or as the eye and visible objects the ear and sounds etc that is to say the whole of our subjective and objective experience
The Venerable Pingiya I am old and feeble the comeliness of youth has vanished
My sight is weak and I am hard of hearing
I do not wish to perish whilst still confused
Teach me the Dhamma by understanding which I may abandon birth and decay
The Lord Seeing heedless people afflicted and suffering through their bodies Pingiya you should be heedful and renounce body so as to not come again to birth
Pingiya In the ten directions  the four quarters four between and those above and below  there is nothing in the world not seen heard sensed or understood by you
Teach me the Dhamma by understanding which I may abandon birth and decay
The Lord Seeing men caught in craving Pingiya tormented and afflicted by old age you should be heedful and renounce craving so as to not come again to birth
See how the world together with the devas has selfconceit for what is notself
Enclosed by mindandbody it imagines 'This is real' Whatever they imagine it to be it is quite different from that
It is unreal of a false nature and perishable
Nibbana not false in nature that the Noble Ones know as true
Indeed by the penetration of the true they are completely stilled and realize final deliverance
Forms sounds tastes scents bodily contacts and ideas which are agreeable pleasant and charming all these while they last are deemed to be happiness by the world with its devas
But when they cease that is agreed by all to be unsatisfactory
By the Noble Ones the cessation of the existing body is seen as happiness
This is the reverse of the outlook of the whole world
What others call happiness that the Noble Ones declare to be suffering
What others call suffering that the Noble Ones have found to be happiness
See how difficult it is to understand the Dhamma
Herein those without insight have completely gone astray
For those under the veil it is obscured for those who cannot see it is utter darkness
But for the good and the wise it is as obvious as the light for those who can see
Even though close to it the witless who do not know the Dhamma do not comprehend it
By those overcome by attachment to existence those who drift with the stream of existence those in the realm of Mara this Dhamma is not properly understood
Who other than the Noble Ones are fit to fully understand that state by perfect knowledge of which they realize final deliverance free from defilements
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The following Thai words are used in this booklet
Crot an umbrella with an attachable mosquito net
Nain a novice of under years old undertaking to observe Precepts
A few Pali words are used occasionally
Sangha the community or order of bhikkhus open to people of all races who desire to lead the holy life in the Dispensation of the Buddha
Vihara The Buddhist equivalent of a 'monastery' but this English word conjures up so many misleading ideas that the Buddhist term 'vihara' has been preferred throughout
Puja veneration worship
In Buddhist practice this is done with the idea of increasing the skillful qualities in one's own mind
Propitiation of forces outside oneself is quite foreign to Buddhadhamma
Kamma intentional action or willed volitional action

In ruth for all his bosom friends
Poise amity ruth and release

The Triple Gem or the Three Precious Ones are the highest ideals of the Buddhadhamma
To the Lord Buddha to the Holy Dhamma and to the Noble Sangha are given veneration by all Buddhists since they aspire to mould their lives according to the qualities represented by these three ideals
In the English language there are now a number of books describing the life of the last Buddha Gotama also many explaining what is meant by the ideal of Buddhahood
Likewise we have an evergrowing flood of literature translations commentaries and so forth to help us understand what is Dhamma
Much less information however is to be found on the Sangha especially upon the bhikkhulife of the present day
Of course those living in the Buddhist countries where the Sangha is established will know more about it than will those who follow the Buddha's Path in other lands
It is to give the latter a picture of bhikkhulife that this book is written besides keeping before the eyes of those living in Buddhists lands the best traditions of the Sangha
While Buddhadhamma is a way for everyone bhikkhu or layfollower naturally the bhikkhus since they have fully devoted themselves to its practice have more opportunity to penetrate to the heart of the Teaching
To do this they must as indeed anyone who wishes to do so obtain experience in its three trainings Learning Practice and Penetration
These lead on one from the other thus making both of the first two necessary
Without Learning one's Practice is liable to stray away from Correct Understanding
Without Practice learning is just barren as far as the fruits of Penetration are concerned
Commentaries written later upon the ancient Buddhaword give new names to Learning and Practice calling the former Bookwork and the latter Insightwork
It may have been already in early times that a tendency appeared to concentrate upon either one or the other as though they were alternative ways rather than complementary steps
This tendency which has persisted into the present seems to be an expression of human frailty for it is much easier to study the scriptures and become learned while largely setting aside the practice especially meditation than it is to get down and practice all that has been learned
This separation is however far from absolute since many bhikkhus gain a groundwork of Learning and then leave the city temples where they have studied for a Meditation Teacher's forest dwelling there to take up the Practice which will lead in due course to Penetration of the Dhamma
Although one may gather something of the life of the Insightwork bhikkhus from ancient sources nothing seems to have been written regarding them in the present day
Hence this short account which attempts to outline their life as found in Thailand
A bhikkhu undertaking Insightwork bases his life upon the three great foundations
These are strict observance of the Rules of Training which he has undertaken to keep at the time of his Acceptance
He is one who takes the earnest exhortation of Lord Buddha to heart
Secondly he follows his Meditation Teacher in the application of the Austere Practices being guided by him as to how and to what extent he should practice them
The first foundation above ensures purification and the removal of obstacles while the second gives rise to strong renunciation and to contentment with little
Thus both become good indeed necessary bases for the third foundation of his life the actual Meditation Practice
Something should now be said about these Austere Practices
Lord Buddha refused to allow extreme asceticism with which he had experimented before his Enlightenment
However he did recognize that a certain degree of austerity would be useful in the training of bhikkhus
For instance we find that in the Four Nissaya recited to a bhikkhu upon the occasion of his ordination he is to wear rag robes eat almsfood dwell at the foot of a tree have fermented cow's urine for medicine
Further we see from the lives of many bhikkhus in the time of Lord Buddha that the Dhutangas were widely practiced for the early Sangha was a community in which the wandering meditative life was the normal one
As examples we have the greatly venerated MahaKassapa who was acclaimed by Lord Buddha as the foremost among those who lead austere lives while the first of his disciples to gain insight into the Dhamma Añña Kondañña dwelt secluded throughout his life in the depths of the forest
With the establishment of permanent viharas which began even in the Lord Buddha's days together with the necessity of preserving the Buddhaword memorizing and learning came to have increased importance
Not all learned bhikkhus practiced and thus Dhutangas were left for those who wished to practice meditation
It was also stressed that for a person whose character was strongly rooted in hatred these Austere Practices would not be appropriate being liable to increase selfhatred
On the other hand with characters rooted in greed faith and mixedrooted characters the dhutangas could help greatly in the cultivation of renunciation and contentment
The differences between a thudong bhikkhu and one who practices severe asceticism are worth noting
The latter start with some species of view that there is a permanent spiritual entity enclosed in or even imprisoned by the fleshly body begotten of and begetting further the socalled 'lusts of the flesh' Holding to such a view the body becomes something despicable and then hateful as it seems to thwart one's search for the spiritual
Then follows 'mortification of the flesh' to quell the evil arising from the possession of such a body related in William James' Varieties of Religious Experience
Such attempts to 'control' desires are really only extreme examples of repression effected by means of selfinflicted torture
To begin to do this one must hold a view which hates the body and the outcome of such asceticism will be greatly increased bodyhatred
Masochistic tendencies where present will also be gratified
All this can hardly be said to indicate a healthy psychological state and Lord Buddha has many times criticized these ways as unskillful
His words found in the Dhammapada show the insufficiency of 'exterior' asceticism which must fail to accomplish salvation
In Buddhist Teaching the interdependence of mindbody is emphasized
Moreover it is the mind which has charge at the helm while materiality is a passenger
As the Dhammapada stresses in its first and second verses Mind precedes all states and is their chief they are all mindwrought A Buddhist knows that he has acquired his present body through his own craving and that it is in the mind that one must look to find the source of all unskill including all types of greed and all hatred whether for self or other
The Dhutangas are therefore a mainly physical discipline with a psychological basis and are invaluable as a complement to the greater part of the Dhamma which is a psychological discipline based on materiality
The thudong bhikkhu thus makes use of these practices in so far as they help him to discipline himself in the promotion of skillful mental states like renunciation and contentment
These thirteen Austere Practices allowed by Lord Buddha have been characterized as a moderate and sane ascesis they are as follows
Triplerobewearer's Practice  Having and wearing only three robes and not having additional allowable robes
Almsfoodeater's Practice  eating only food collected on pindapata or the almsround while not accepting food in the vihara or offered by invitation in a layman's house
Housetohouseseeker's Practice  not omitting any house while going for alms not choosing only to go to rich households or those selected for some other reason as relations etc
Onesessioner's practice  eating one meal a day and refusing other food offered before midday

Bowlfoodeater's Practice  eating food from his bowl in which it is mixed together rather than from plates and dishes
Laterfoodrefuser's Practice  not taking any more food after one has shown that one is satisfied even though laypeople wish to offer more
Forestdweller's Practice  not dwelling in a town or village but living secluded away from all kinds of distractions
Treerootdweller's Practice  living under a tree without the shelter of a roof
Openairdweller's Practice  refusing a roof and a treeroot the practice may be undertaken sheltered by a tent of robes
Charnelgrounddweller's Practice  living in or nearby a charnelfield graveyard or cremation ground
Anybeduser's Practice  being satisfied with any dwelling allotted as a sleeping place
Sitter's Practice  living in the three postures of walking standing and sitting and never lying down
It will be noticed that the dhutangas help a bhikkhu to find contentment with the first three of his Four Requisites Robes Almsfood and Shelter the fourth of his Requisites not covered here is Medicine
As regards their present practice in Thailand III V VI and VII are most commonly found amongst thudong bhikkhus
Having and wearing only three robes is also widely practiced
Individual thudong bhikkhus may gather rags stitch them together dye and then wear them although madeup robes are so plentiful that this not so common
The fourth practice is the normal kind of almsround in many Thai villages where every house gives a spoonful or so of rice to every bhikkhu
In the towns IV is not practiced it being more usual for bhikkhus to have a few houses where he is invited to call each day
All thudong viharas comply with The next two are practiced subject to the conditions of the weather for fierce sun or torrential rain make them both impossible
The eleventh may be recommended by a teacher for the practice of some of his disciples according to character while XII is a special aspect of that contentment which all bhikkhus must cultivate
The last Dhutanga has been mentioned below as a communal practice in some viharas upon Uposathaday
When a bhikkhu practices this individually he will usually only do so after consulting his teacher and lest conceit arise he will take care that others do not know that he practices in this way
It is likewise true of all these practices that they are to be undertaken in seclusion and a real thudong bhikkhu always shuns the public gaze
The Buddhist Dictionary says quoting the Puggalapaññatti These exercises are however properly observed if they are taken up only for the sake of frugality of contentment of purity etc
The Thai word 'thudong' however has a rather wider connotation than that of these practices themselves
It is applied to anything connected with them and thus we have thudongvihara thudongbowl thudonglife and so on
As the Dhutangas may be practiced either strictly middlingly or mildly according to the standards laid down in the Visuddhimagga so there are many variations in thudong practice and different teachers place different emphases and therefore different viharas have different conditions
For years and more this thudong life has been lived by bhikkhus in many different lands
Not much can be found to record their life since those who take the thudong way are not usually writers and carry out their practice in seclusion
In Thailand many of the ancient records religious and secular were destroyed in the conflagration of the capital Ayuthaya in CE
Still we know that there were before that time many Araññika bhikkhus
Probably our oldest records now are the temple wall paintings from the early reigns of the present dynasty
They illustrate thudong bhikkhus undertaking the thirteen practices according to the three grades of strictness
At the present time there are a good number of viharas where this way of life with its three foundations is taught by experienced teachers
Most of them prefer to be well away from the commotion of city life the distractions and luxuries of which are far removed from the thudong ideal
Finally it is interesting to record that a large stupa with thirteen white pinnacles piercing the blue sky is now being completed in a large thudong vihara named after that great Indian monarch who helped in widely disseminating the Buddha's Teaching the Emperor Asoka
In the topmost cetiya will be enshrined relics of Lord Buddha whose life was this very thudong way while below will be placed the ashes of a famous meditation teacher who had followed his Great Master's way with devotion until his recent death
The bhikkhu who abides in the Dhamma who delights in the Dhamma meditates on the Dhamma and who bears the Dhamma well in mind does not fall away from the sublime Dhamma
It is rather difficult to write about the thudong bhikkhu's daily life as the conditions in which they live are so different
However there are certain features of this life which are general and these may be taken as a basis for this outline
The material which is presented in this and succeeding sections is composite in origin some of it being experience heard from others and more again being stories told of others
Therefore we shall speak of 'the bhikkhu' or 'our thudong bhikkhu' and present all these varied sources under this anonymous label
While doing this it should be borne in mind that much of what will be said is quite common experience for those following the thudong life
Wherever the thudong bhikkhu is whether in a cave in the forest or in some other solitary place his day begins early and with stirredup vigour he rises
All is quiet except for the nightsounds of some insects and perhaps the swishings of bats  and at such a time long before dawn say two or three o'clock conditions are excellent for the practice of meditation
Of course our bhikkhu unless he is very skilled will have to shake off Mara in the guise of slothandtorpor for this aspect of the Evil One would urge him to loll abed until daybreak
Instead he rises and after refreshing himself fixes his mind upon his meditation subject which he had put down the night before upon going to sleep
Making the triple prostration to the Three Jewels quietly intoning Namo tassa and perhaps the Three Refuges the bhikkhu his mind rightly directed and guarded settles into his meditation
The extent to which he is able to fix his mind upon his subject to prevent the arising of the five hindrances and make it more and more onepointed will depend of course upon his own progress and ability
The two greatest obstacles which he will encounter will be the slothandtorpor already mentioned above and distraction and between these two his mind is liable to vacillate as Odysseus' boat dodging between Scylla and Charybdis
Being wrecked upon one or the other will be a common experience for him in the beginning
When he finds his mind to be like a fountain bubbling up ideas phantasies memories anticipations and so forth he sits firmly upon his seat unmoving employing mindfulness until the mind becomes quiet
But when sleepiness creeps into his mind and interferes with his bodily posture then he gets up and practices his meditation while walking up and down
If he is settled for some time in a cave or in the forest he will have made his walking place even and neither too long nor too short
Pacing steadily up and down sleepiness leaves both the mind and body and after some time with the mind made onepointed he may try standing practice
After bringing the mind to a fully quiet and onepointed condition in this position he may return to fruitful practice sittingdown
His practice will be concluded when the cockerels birds or alarmclock inform him that daybreak is at hand
Then if he has them he will offer a candle and a few sticks of incense and having reverently prostrated our bhikkhu will intone his morning puja to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
The standard formulas for this found so many times in the Pali canon gain deeper and deeper meanings which become clear to him as his devotion deepens and as his practice makes progress
Indeed when our bhikkhu's calm is well established the slowly chanted phrases do not disturb at all and they may even be the basis for insight
He may supplement these standard chants with others selected according to individual preference or tradition among the latter will be the meditation chant upon the Parts of the Body the Pali of each repulsive part being followed by a translation into his own language just to make their significance quite clear
This may well be balanced by the meditation chants of lovingkindness first filling himself with this spirit to get rid of inward conflict and then spreading out his loving kindness to other beings
It is also usual to chant the Recollectionbeforeuse of the Four Requisites of a bhikkhu The reason for doing this is that the true purposes of the Requisites then readily come to mind during the day when he is actually using them
Finally our bhikkhu chants a sincere wish that the merits which have accrued through this chanting be made over for the good of all beings
Perhaps being in Thailand he may use the beautiful Ya devata santi viharavasini even more excellent when intoned in the rising and falling 'sarabhañña' style of chanting
This chant is now beloved in Thailand since apart from the merit of its meaning and the euphony of style it was composed by the greatly respected and deeply religious king Phra Chom Klao known to the West as King Mongkut
Now is the time for our bhikkhu to prepare himself to obtain that medicine which will allay but not cure the greatest disease  hunger
He will see that his bowl is in order clean and tightly bound in its sling
Then rolling his two upper robes together he is ready to set out
A few remaining possessions may be secured by him in his bag and hung up in some safe place to await his return however his three robes should go with him since in ancient days cloth was not always easy to obtain and even now the double outer 'cloak' is expensive to make and must thus be guarded carefully
Many things may happen on his almsround the subject of another booklet in this series
His almsround is not only to collect food for himself since it serves two other important aspects in Buddhist life
On the one hand he gives laypeople a chance to make merit by their acts of giving while on the other he trains himself in many good qualities at this time for as he goes his way collecting food so he cultivates humility lovingkindness and compassion mindfulness and perhaps his meditation subject
Having taken sufficient food to last the day and knowing at the same time moderation in quantity the bowl has then to be washed and dried carefully so that it will not rust returned to its sling and tied to its stand being then ready to be taken anywhere
If the bhikkhu is temporarily resident in one place he will then engage in some walking up and down
This is in accordance with one of the discourses of Lord Buddha which recommends this form of meditation exercise to ward off sleepiness after having taken what is usually a substantial meal
Having thus established himself once again in mindfulness he may take up any work which has to be done
It is difficult to list all the possible jobs that he may do at this time but readers should realize that he tries to be as selfsufficient as is practicable
Even though he has but few things these have to be kept in good repair
For instance it is important for him to keep his robes mended
Going through jungles thorns catch and tear and there is always ordinary wear and tear in fact the thudong bhikkhu is well aware of the household truth  'A stitch in time saves nine' A thudong bhikkhu's robes are usually wellpatched and look as though they have seen long service
Or he may make certain things from bamboo or wood and many a thudong bhikkhu is very skillful at such manufacture
A bowlstand is needed or the bamboo shafts of his crot must be replaced or he may make quantities of toothbrushandpicks out of bitter wood to give to other bhikkhus
Our bhikkhu may be conversant with the medicinal properties of the herbs trees and climbers which grow all about him and compound from these with honey milk red peppers and fruits medicines for many diseases
Then again he may manufacture out of tins wire and fine white cloth a collapsible candlelamp which no wind can blow out or perhaps he is gifted in the ability to carve and if so he may fashion small pieces of hardwood or ivory into images of Lord Buddha
He may if he lives in a cave like to adorn the mighty walls of his residence with drawings of the Buddha all executed in simple colors from the earth round about
If there were many thudong bhikkhus in this world they would truly be the bane of modern commerce which insists that man's happiness depends on having many things and that he buys them in particular and new brands from others
Quite contrary to all this is the thudong bhikkhu whose ways are directly set against the worldly stream where it is not a multitude of things impermanent which bring happiness  but contentment with little
Thus lightened of the clutter of things he goes more swiftly towards his goal of Enlightenment
Or if his pindapata has been long and his food got with difficulty he may feel bodily tiredness and lie down mindfully
This is usually done by lying on the right side placing a supporting roll of robes under the upper half of the body the head being supported in the palm of the right hand while the elbow of that arm rests on the ground
This was the lying posture recommended by Lord Buddha and balanced thus it is not possible to go to sleep while mindfulness will be maintained
Whenever he feels that his body is light all tiredness gone we should picture our bhikkhu sitting down crosslegged upon his sittingcloth and arousing mindfulness and all the other salutary factors of meditation and then striving to succeed or perhaps succeeding in his subject of meditation
He may sit for many hours at a stretch especially if he is skilled or he may vary his sitting with more walking and even if his back becomes tired with lying down
The latter posture can only be practiced during the day as sleep is liable to overcome him if he lies down during the hours of darkness
He may also find it helpful in moments of mental stress or when he is experiencing too much of the monkeymind
His meditation time will take him round to early evening when the heat of the day over it is the usual time to do the sweeping
If he lives in a meditationvihara there may be large areas to sweep
If in a hut in the forest then only his hut and its surroundings
But this work is quite unnecessary for one who is living under his crot wherever he has pitched it and he will probably not have a broom anyway
General mindfulness at this time is accompanied by the 'sweeping reflection' Just as this broom is sweeping away dust so may this meditation practice sweep away the defilements
There are some other excellencies to sweeping for instance it is a chance to test the strength of the calm which has been developed mostly in the sitting posture
Also it is good exercise for the body after sitting still most of the day
Our bhikkhu does his sweeping rhythmically and silently
Next comes the time for bathing perhaps in a forest pool or river
Taking his bathingcloth our bhikkhu goes  not with the worldly idea of enjoying the water but bearing in mind an aspect of his body's repulsiveness which makes it necessary to bathe
He reflects having got this body through craving one has daily to wipe off the sweat which oozes out of it and the dirt which sticks to it otherwise if would quickly become evilsmelling and unbearable both to oneself and to others
This also applies to his robes which require washing frequently while at this time he may occasionally have to dye his robes
Returning still bearing his meditationsubject in mind if he is able there may be some allowable drink awaiting him at his abode to refresh him further
Nains are expert at preparing these from jungle fruits adding sugar or honey while if hunger disturbs him much one of the bitter fruits allowed in the Vinaya may be taken with salt sugar and perhaps some chili
Before he takes these he will reflect carefully upon the real reason for doing so according to the passage repeated in his morning puja
If we were watching him we should soon notice the care that he takes so that no small creatures come to destruction
Before he pours out his drink he inspects the glass to see whether ants or other insects are inside
If there are he removes them very gently to a safe place
In lifting the glass and putting it down he takes the same care and even when a mosquito alights on his body it is not squashed but blown away for even the smallest creatures must not come to death either through his intention or through negligence
Harmlessness has for him many practical applications
The time has come now for his evening meditation and taking his seat refreshed in body he makes further endeavors in governing the mind
Perhaps before he begins Lord Buddha's oftrepeated exhortation comes to mind What a master can do for his disciples wishing them well out of compassion and sympathy that I have done for you
Here O bhikkhus are the roots of trees and secluded places
Practice meditation O bhikkhus
Be not negligent lest you regret it later
This is my exhortation to you And so we may imagine him sitting long into the night as long in fact as he can keep off sleepiness
When this becomes too pressing he lights a candle and some incense and begins his night chanting
If he knows much Pali this may continue for a long while softly and steadily proceeding with that euphony peculiar to this ancient language
It is recorded in commentarial stories that the gods came to listen to the Pali chanting of those bhikkhus living in wild places who had pure hearts
At last finishing after again making over all merits for beings' happiness he lies down mindfully bearing in mind his meditationsubject and the necessity of arising early to proceed with his practice
Living in sylvan solitudes is not always alas ideal for dukkha must show its fangs from time to time to remind our bhikkhu if indeed he needs reminding that it is in a world subject to birth and death that he lives
Having got himself into the condition of being born he and all other beings will surely die
This lesson he learned from close acquaintance for he recently lost a good companion
He was an intelligent young man recently ordained as a nain one who would have been well capable of understanding the Dhamma
He was able to live the thudong life and to enjoy it to his profit  a not inconsiderable combination of factors
His life ended suddenly when he was about twenty years old for he fell over a fortyfoot cliff and dashed his brains upon the rocks below
Our bhikkhu was the first person to reach the nain after having raced down a circuitous path
Little enough could he do
Telling another nain to run into the nearest village for a stretcher he knelt beside his only other companion on the rocky hill where they lived
The nain's breathing still functioned but in great irregular gasps
Blood already clotted oozed from the sundered skull and trickled from many other cuts and bruises upon the body arms and legs
Death was near at hand
Taking a rosary from his bag the bhikkhu opened one of the nain's hands and placed it there
It would thus act as a skillful object of touch if the nain's touchconsciousness still functioned
After sprinkling him with cooling water he began to intone the suttas for protection
This he did so that there would be a skillful soundobject upon which the nain's deathconsciousness could be concentrated
Though he tried to chant steadily and evenly to give confidence to the dying nain  if indeed he heard him his voice was not without trembling
The minutes drew on and after the opening salutation of Namo tassa the Karaniya Metta Sutta the Mahamangala Sutta and the Ratana Sutta followed each other
As the closing words of the last sutta Sangham namassama suvatti hotu   as these words were softly chanted upon the shimmering air a last breath arose and gaspingly fell  and the body was still
His good companion had passed on according to his kamma and as the bhikkhu earnestly vowed May it truly be to a better state of affairs than this
After that if only to relieve his own mind  and who knows perhaps his erstwhile friend could still hear him in his new condition  he intoned further the Buddha Jayamangala stanzas with their refrain of By the power of this may you be endowed with victory and blessings
It is widely believed in Buddhist lands that merits are transferable providing that one has a compassion deep enough with others and a wisdom grown great
For the wellfaring of the dead nain his friend made over to him all and any merits which he might have accumulated including those gathered by the recitation of these hallowed scriptures
We take up the story again three days later when bhikkhus have gathered for reciting the traditional chants for the dead
The father of the dead nain has also arrived
The chanting is solemn indeed and rolls on sonorously through the tropic night spreading its peaceful sound far beyond the range of the pressure lamps which light up but a small circle in the bamboo forest
Seated upon mats covering the ground laypeople listen reverently with joined palms while the chanting proceeds
Our bhikkhu seated with others upon some more mats concentrates all his attention upon the chanting making it proceed not from the throat but deep down from the heart
At its conclusion there is some informal talk upon Dhamma especially regarding death and kamma and then more general conversation opens concerning what arrangements should be made
A westerner might notice if one had been present that although this ceremony roughly corresponded to a funeral service no one was weeping or even looking particularly sad  and certainly not the father of the late nain
Whatever tears there had been over his death they were long since over and quickly stopped by such Buddhist recollections as the fact that rebirth takes place according to kamma and that nothing of this can be changed by weeping
And again the injunction to live in the present without attachment to the past which is irreclaimably gone
And the reflection that rebirth may already be accomplished and be superior in happiness to this state would it not be strange to be miserable because someone else was now more happy than he was in this life
Putting aside all selfpity which makes for most of the tears at death a good Buddhist concentrates upon the situation now and sees what can best be accomplished in the present
The conversation has turned to the customary presentation in this case by the father of robes upon the death of a relative
Sometimes readymade robes are laid upon the coffin and received by bhikkhus as pamsukula at other times white cloth is similarly given to be made up into robes
The strictest practice and one which is followed by a few thudong bhikkhus is to take cloth which has been used as a corpsewrapping and make this into robes  this is a practice from the time of the Lord Buddha and such robes may truly be called 'ragrobes' Our bhikkhu wishes to benefit from the present circumstances so as to obtain such a robe
The father of the dead nain has already bought about twenty yards of white cloth for pamsukula robes
This has then to be inserted into the coffin and then to be extracted at the time of burning
Later our bhikkhu will cut it up and sew it to make traditional patchwork pattern and the robes that he makes from this cloth will ever remind him of death by stains and smell for some time and for longer by the memory of how they were obtained
The next day food being finished our bhikkhu turns his attention to the large coffin which rests under some trees
Candles and incense the Buddhist symbols respectively of Enlightenment and of the perfume of strict morality are burning round about
As he approaches the coffin the smell grows stronger  the peculiarly repulsive smell of a human body's decay which spreads its sweetly sickening odors for many yards about
It is not without some apprehension of what he will see upon raising the lid that he proceeds for he has read the descriptions of bodily decay as used for meditation purposes but reading does not satisfy him the bhikkhu wishes to see for himself
Lifting the lid he gazes within and is immediately and deeply impressed that these descriptions as found for instance in the Satipatthana Sutta are but poor substitutes for beholding the real thing
His companion in life was a handsome young man even with his hair shaved off this body which lay before him was quite as hideous as temple wallpaintings sometimes show and emphasized for him that words are quite inadequate for portraying such sights
So the young nain with unblemished body and pleasing face died but three days before and now what does our bhikkhu perceive
His companion is certainly not there
This puffed distorted oozing mass blueish in color is not the man he knew
Nothing resembles him
Three days have sufficed to change everything
Gaining this insight and the perception of impurity in even living bodies  what to speak of dead ones  he continues with the work he has set out to do
The body is already covered by the stained robes of the late nain and the white cloth is laid over this
Having completed his work he reseals the coffin to await the time of cremation
As the lid is replaced so the stench grows less but the whole experience has burned itself deep into his mind and will not lessen
Indeed he may develop it into a fruitful meditation when he sees with inward sight his own body not only as liable to such a condition but actually experiences the body as being in such a state
Climbing back to his dwelling high above the forest he muses Where such a terrible sight as this can be found so soon originating from apparently pleasing conditions  where such and worse can be found what sort of world is this
Who will waste their lives after such a perception
Who will longer be deluded by the sugarcoating of the world's senseattractions after seeing thus
Will they not rather sense the bitter pill beneath
Is this not the time to turn away from those conditions giving rise to the bitterness
Is it not the time to devote oneself to that Dhamma which is lovely at its beginning lovely in its middle course and lovely at its ending
Some such thoughts as these our bhikkhu thinks
For those who can do more this is the time to join those millions who have gone forth like our bhikkhu with robes and bowl rejecting all that the world values and seeking to reject both ignorance and craving those twin conditions for bitterness to win in the Dispensation of the Conqueror that Enlightenment which he also won
So urges the Enlightened One
Our bhikkhu will live anywhere that is conducive to his practice of meditation and to winning insight but certain types of abode are generally more suitable for him than others
From ancient times a favorite dwellingplace of the thudong bhikkhu has been a cave indeed this is really the best environment providing that a suitable one can be found
Not all are good for meditation and our bhikkhu upon arriving at a cave new to him would inspect it with the following points in mind
People are very fond of making caves into shrines  and some of these are very beautiful with hundreds or thousands of Buddhafigures of different sizes ranged about the cave sitting on blocks of stone and stalagmite near to the floor and gazing down compassionately from apparently inaccessible niches near the lofty roof
Such caves and others more rustic acquire fame as places of pilgrimage in proportion to their beauty and ease of approach
Now if our bhikkhu were to make his sitting place in some such cave he would surely be disturbed by the people visiting the shrine
Apart from the noise that they make some would certainly approach him perhaps trying to engage him in ordinary conversation or coming to ask for charms or blessings since popular ideas of 'holiness' are rather less exacting or more vague than the freedom from the fetters which mark a Noble One according to the Pali canon
Therefore if he does not wish to instruct in Dhamma much less to engage in worldly matters he will avoid all such caves
Apart from people bats are also fond of caves in the dark depths of which they live in their thousands
They also make their noises cheeping and swishing about but their noises are much less objectionable than is the smell of their dung
This is very good for growing plants but less agreeable to a meditator's nose
Usually they will not live near to the cave entrance especially if the sun comes in and so other conditions being favorable our bhikkhu may live there
Other conditions include sound and heat
In this noisy age rackety iron boxes of various shapes travel over land water and through the air and their sound is surprisingly hard to escape from
It is understandable therefore that caves adjacent to airfields motorways or railways will also be avoided
The great advantage of a cave in a tropical country is its equable temperature
Cool even on the hottest days of the hot season and warm in the coldest nights of the cold weather it is very favorable for a meditating bhikkhu
Caves which have wide openings to the south or west are therefore less suitable for the hot weather
Other inconveniences to consider are the danger of falling rocks and the presence of carbon dioxide
Also it sometimes happens that earth godlings take up their residence in caves and not all of them will welcome a bhikkhu staying there as this will interfere with their pleasures
Indeed there are stories of bhikkhus being evicted by spirits but there is at least one instance of an experienced bhikkhu who sat night after night in a cave defeating all the efforts of godlings to oust him
Our bhikkhu if he is wise seeks for the protection of any gods there abiding when he first arrives at a cave
With gods giving their blessing to his efforts meditation certainly becomes easier while if the opposite should occur it may be impossible
Finally a consideration of great importance its distance from the nearest village
As most thudong bhikkhus go to collect alms every day and as bhikkhus are not allowed to store food so a village must be within walking distance
How far this is depends upon the vigour and age of our bhikkhu
Half a mile or a mile's distance is desirable in any case being thus beyond village noises but it does happen that a cave otherwise ideal may be too far from the village for the bhikkhu to walk there and back
In this case the villagers will help the bhikkhu by taking their food out halfway
He may find that living in a cave is a little eerie at first and should any fear trembling or hairraising take place no doubt he will at least remember the Metta Sutta
Also wellfitted for recitation at such a time is the Discourse on the Flags where the medicines recommended for fear are the Recollections of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
If our bhikkhu is still better read in the Pali canon he will remember the Discourse on Fear and Dread where Lord Buddha describes the way in which he trained himself to be mindful of fear while he was yet a Bodhisatta
What sort of picture do we get of our bhikkhu in his cave
If he is staying long he will probably have built himself a bamboo or wooden pallet above which will hang his crot
To one side somewhere hang his bag and candlelamp
Near to him will be a waterflask and if it is dark possibly a torch
His bowl is placed securely on a flat rock while any robes which he is not using are folded up neatly upon his pallet
He is sitting quietly facing the direction of his head when laying down
If one were to watch intently it would be difficult to detect even breath movements in his body swathed as it is in rather shabby patched robes of folded ochre
Above him the roof vaults in great arches and mysterious hollows halflit by the dim light
Steady and distant is the dripping of water which makes through long ages great columns slowly joining roof and floor
Sunlight filters through a leafy screen for a few minutes and is gone and perhaps a bee drones in but finding little of interest soon finds its way out
All is very still very silent
Caves are by far the best abode but they especially ideal ones are rare so that we should go on to describe something of the more common 'home' of thudong bhikkhus  the forest
The advantages of dwelling in the forest are several
First there is much of it in many Buddhist countries
Then as it is the sort of place where most men do not like to live the thudong bhikkhu is not likely to be disturbed not at any rate by his fellowmen
Like other thudong abodes it conduces to contentment with little also it makes very necessary the development of metta or lovingkindness
Besides advantages there are quite a number of possible hindrances to practice while forestdwelling
For instance metta is made rather essential by the presence of all sorts of potentially antipathetic creatures the most dangerous of which are snakes
This is certainly emphasized in the Pali canon by the presence of a special chant the Khanda Paritta in which the person chanting stresses that he has metta towards and does no harm to all creatures including four species of snakes
There is a little story to illustrate this
An old Buddhist nun was living in a small hut close to the jungle
Her hut had one doorway and she usually sat on the bamboo floor for meditation against the opposite wall
She was quite accustomed to see the tails of large lizards appear out of the thatch overhead where they lived
Occasionally they fell out but being quite harmless they would scamper away quickly
One day hearing such a bump on her floor she opened her eyes but instead of seeing a lizard there was an angry snake of the poisonous species coiling and uncoiling itself
Instantly recollecting the meditation on metta she pervaded herself and the whole hut with this spirit
The snake which lay between her and the door and had been threatening to strike her now quietly coiled up and after a few minutes slithered out of the doorway
This anecdote illustrates quite a common occurrence for one dwelling in the jungle how a meditator can be brought into close proximity with the untamed animal world
Is it necessary to stress further the value of metta in such surroundings
While the power of Lord Buddha's metta was so great that he could calm the rutting wild elephant Nalagiri there have been many thudong bhikkhus up to modern times who have lived continuously in the forest developing the Brahmaviharas and with whom forest animals become friends
For the man who has love  and no fear because no hatred  of other creatures those creatures will not fear him
In this connection there are a number of Jataka stories which tell of the Bodhisatta's life in the forest when living in a hermitage all manner of animals became his companions
Still there do seem to be some creatures which do not respond so well to metta and therefore returning to the case of our thudong bhikkhu he will be wise not to spread his sitting cloth over the entrance to an ants' nest nor to pitch his crot near places where stagnant water lies
Regarding the latter he would be courting the attentions of vast numbers of hungry mosquitoes
The crot is an effective protection against but it can be hot inside while cooler air blows without
So if a place can be found fairly free of mosquitoes at least during the day our bhikkhu will abide more happily
As to ants they come in all shapes and colors and a good range of sizes and mill about everywhere and our bhikkhu knows that it is safe to assume that all bite so it is well to stay away from their roads tunnels and doorways
A few drops of paraffin sprinkled round his sittingcloth will ensure that he is fairly secure against invasion
Unless the forest is really ancient with dense shade our bhikkhu will experience extremes of heat and cold unknown to the cavedweller
In the hot season the sun blazes down from out of the cloudless sky overhead and the small shade of his crot will be insufficient
Even under a tree at least in open forest hot winds are liable to blow and make life less pleasant
The conditions in denselyshaded rain forest rather resemble cavedwelling but there is an increase of biting life to reckon with as well as the rainfall
Forestdwelling is only possible for the thudong bhikkhu all the year round if he has a small hut to supplement the protection of his crot
During the three months of the Rains Retreat he must in any case dwell with a roof over his head
It is quite common for thudong bhikkhus to have a small wood and bamboo hut built by a supporter in some favorable place in the forest and to dwell there either alone or with a nain or boy to assist him
Forest life is very far from silent for quite apart from the occasional noises of the larger animals smaller ones especially insects keep up an almost continuous racket
Cicadas and grasshoppery creatures although small manage to produce incredible volumes of sound sometimes resembling that of railway trains
The only times when they are silent is when presumably they are sleeping
This is during the heat of midday and afternoon and during the middle watch of the night
Unfortunately this quietness coincides with the times when human beings also are most inclined to sleep
However forest conditions vary very much and our bhikkhu will not find all the unfavorable conditions together but since this world is one level of samsara there are bound to be one or more flies in the ointment
We may think of him on a moonlit night in the hot weather
A cooling wind blows stirring the trees many of which are leafless while filling the air with the fragrance of some tree's blossoms
A little bamboo hut stands raised upon wooden legs and upon its open platform a boy sleeps
The bhikkhu paces up and down his walk which is some thirty feet long and made under tall trees
The dark end of it is lit by his candlelamp hanging from a tree while the moon lights up the rest
Light is necessary since thick tubular millipedes have their homes on either side of his walk and also like to wander upon its smooth and freshly swept surface
Our bhikkhu finishes his walking and contemplatively returns to his hut
Mounting the bamboo ladder to the platform he stops before the door to his tiny room
Over the door is fixed a polished wooden board upon which the following words are cut and colored
These are the last recorded words of Lord Buddha his final exhortation to the thudong bhikkhus of those days
For our thudong bhikkhu now they not only have the significance of being the last instructions since his own practice  and perhaps realization  accord well with them
Let him admonish instruct and shield one from evil a dear one is he to the good detestable to the wicked'
The greatest teachers of the thudong tradition have very often wandered all their lives never settling down long in any one place except for the annual Rains Retreat or when extreme old age forced them to do so
Some have never founded viharas leaving this to those of their disciples who had an aptitude for such work
Our bhikkhu however especially if he still requires guidance may live in a thudong vihara
This will be rather different from the ordinary run of viharas where bhikkhus usually live two or three together in large huts or even if they live singly their residences will be crowded closely together being built about an open hall
A thudong vihara is distinguished by having the huts set so that from one another cannot be seen
This is not difficult as wood bamboo and thatch blend easily into the jungle
In each hut one bhikkhu lives and orders his time according to his practice and ability
Our bhikkhu will not often meet others resident there once or twice a day at most
The first time is when all gather in the hall to prepare themselves for pindapata while the second may be in the evening when some fruit drink is served
At this time also the venerable teacher of meditation may give some instruction as he sees fit
General instructions for instance on matters of Vinaya will be given to the community of resident bhikkhus every Holy Day after the recitation of the Patimokkha
If our bhikkhu wishes for individual instruction in some matter he will approach his teacher after the evening instruction has been given and after saluting him with the triple prostration he will question him respectfully
If we were present in the hall pillared with roughly shaped tree trunks and lit by candles burning before the gilded and painted shrine of Lord Buddha we should notice the great respect which he pays to his teacher
He sits in a respectful position never pointing his feet towards the teacher and he always raises his joined palms when speaking to the teacher while when the latter speaks to him he places them clasped together in his lap and listens attentively
Our bhikkhu's teacher is for him one who has experienced some degree of the Dhamma in his own heart and not merely read about it out of books
Such teachers are therefore accorded great veneration and anyone going to such a teacher yet not making the usual salutations would probably be regarded as being difficult to teach  because of the presence of strong conceit
In some thudong viharas usually those inclined to less strict observance there is communal meditation and puja in the morning before pindapata and again in the evening
Some teachers favor this while others prefer their disciples to lead a more solitary life
Both may be valuable to our bhikkhu according to his character and progress
Upon uposathanights it is also a feature in some thudong viharas to chant Lord Buddha's discourses all through the night the bhikkhus not sleeping
This may be interspersed with some instructions from the meditation master and perhaps by the individual practice of walking
Where practice already goes deep this chanting slow and rhythmic may well be an aid to attainment in meditation
Regarding this there was once a twelve year old boy who sat down one evening with other pious laypeople who were practicing meditation while the bhikkhus chanted
He knew nothing about how to practice nor had he ever sat in meditation posture before
But a very great meditationmaster lived there at that time and was leading the bhikkhus in chanting
These factors all combining led that boy through successive stages of mental concentration until he reached complete meditation
He was still sitting rapt in stillness when the bhikkhus prepared to go collecting pindapata
The meditationmaster upon seeing him decided not unnaturally that the boy would make a good disciple
After rousing him and giving him the precepts the boy lived in that vihara learning the way from his master
One bhikkhu wellpracticed in meditation was famous for the easy control he had over his body
Sitting down in the temple at eight o'clock upon uposathanights he would not find it necessary to change his posture until six o'clock the next morning
He never got up from his seat his gaze never wandered anywhere he just concentrated upon chanting from the heart being completely absorbed in this
Our bhikkhu will be encouraged by his teacher to live with him until such times as the latter feels that he has sufficient knowledge of the Dhamma and strong enough meditation to go off on his own to practice in a cave or forest
There are disciples who like to stay with their teachers until death parts them
There are others who want to go off quickly and practice alone
It sometime happens that the latter experience one of the ecstatic absorptions and conclude from this since they lack sufficient Dhammaknowledge and the guidance of their teacher that they have won a noble attainment
Sometimes such bhikkhus proclaim this out of ignorance and gain quite a following however their fame soon dwindles for one cannot pretend intentionally or otherwise to be an arahant or even to have reached one of the lower stages of ariyan attainment
A famous teacher once had a pupil who esteemed himself to be an arahant but the former knew that he was not so but that his mind was really overcome by the perversions
Now this teacher had another pupil who although he could neither read nor write had such experience of Dhamma that many consider that he was really an arahant
He lived alone in a cave and seldom spoke and when he did so he uttered only words of Dhamma never mere pleasantries
The famous teacher was in the habit of sending any of his pupils who became deluded to this great pupil of whom he thought very highly
So he sent his deluded disciple to him
The first and only words which the great pupil spoke to the deluded one were Sit here The former gave the latter no instruction he only sat in meditation with him day and night only rarely breaking off for the barest necessities
After two weeks of this rigorous treatment the deluded one at least gained the insight that he was not after all an arahant and then returned to live with his teacher
In this way he was cured of this manifestation of the perverted mind
Living in a vihara at least for some time will enable the thudong bhikkhu to make his meditation practice grow strongly and that fear trembling and hairraising which he might easily experience in other more remote surroundings are less likely to arise there
He has the guidance of the Good Friend and the companionship of the good that is of fellowbhikkhus and nains who are likewise striving to accomplish the goal of complete liberation of the mind
In this way he has the best possible environment for progress in his meditation and may stay with his teacher for many years
This is particularly true if the pupil finds just the right teacher who can instruct him in the right way to go
For just as pupils vary as to the proportions of differing defilements in their characters so teachers vary with regard to different attainments and ability
What can we say of other bhikkhu abodes
Generally the thudong bhikkhu looks with disfavor upon living on a mountain  unless that is there happens to be a village near and at approximately the same altitude
Our bhikkhu knows that his bowlful of rice is quite heavy enough especially after a long walk without having to haul it up a mountain path
Whenever bhikkhus ceased to rely on pindapata as for instance in China they were able to live upon mountain heights in peace and solitude
Among abodes recommended in the Path of Purification is the charnelfield or boneyard
This is said to be an excellent abode for greed characters
It appears to have been a common custom in ancient India to take corpses to a special part of the forest and to leave them there to go to their dissolution
Thus a thudong bhikkhu lighting upon such a place might be able to see all the various stages of decay of the body  as they are described in detail in the above work
Such was of course an unforgettable lesson upon the fate of his own body
Nowadays in this country boneyards like this cannot be found for burning the body sooner or later has taken the place of the natural process of its return to the component elements
Therefore it is now almost impossible to live in this environment and the best that can be done is to dwell near a burning ground
Usually there will not be much of bones remaining only piles of ashes still there is for many the fear of spirits to overcome
It is commonly assumed that such a birth follows a human one and that the hungry ghost or spirit lurks about near its former body sometimes with evil intent while others are supposed to be more kindly disposed
This may sometimes happen when petabirth actually follows the human one because of petalike kamma but popular belief assumes that this is invariable
However this may be a certain amount of caution is required before dwelling in such a place
If our bhikkhu is of imaginative disposition he must have his imagination well under control before dwelling in a burningground
An uncontrolled imagination coupled with loneliness the natural noises of the night and the dimly lighted surroundings can result in an unbalanced mind
A good many years ago now there was a nain recently ordained and fifteen years of age
His meditation master sent him to dwell overnight in the local burninggroundcumgraveyard which was well out of the village in the jungle
Not knowing that it is proper to inspect such a place in full daylight first noting how all the rocks trees tombs etc
are placed  he arrived there only at dusk
After laying a cloth to sit upon and hanging up his crot he began to look around
Finding a suitable place to walk up and down he decided to begin his meditations in this way
As he was turning round at one end out of the corner of his eye he saw a great black phantom looming up its jagged arms outstretched the clawlike fingers ready to seize him
In fear and trembling he continued his walking and so great was his terror of the unknown 'thing' that he did not sit or lie down all that night but walked and stood meditating
When dawn came the 'thing' became less black and menacing slowly resolving itself into a stricken treetrunk
As custom has changed so much that the boneyard is no longer to be found there was in this country many years ago a senior bhikkhu who decided to remedy this lack
This teacher dwelt in a little vihara in a patch of woodland outside a small town and near the old capital of Ayuthia
Very few bhikkhus stayed in this vihara for after they had seen what they came to see he sent them away to practice on their own
And what did they see
This teacher had constructed a flower garden and all round it he had built a high wall pierced by only one door and that was padlocked
The flowers that grew in this garden were very special ones special bhikkhu flowers
The flowers of laymen are of gorgeous colors entrancing shapes and subtle perfumes but these flowers for bhikkhus although they had their colors shapes and perfumes were rather different
Inside the garden there were constructed a number of open troughs covered by glass frames from one end of which rose a long pipe
When a man died in the town the teacher would go and personally carry away the body slinging it over his shoulder
Taking it to his garden he would lay it in a trough and cover it with a frame
When a bhikkhu desiring a subject of meditation came to him he would be told by the teacher that he only instructed in the Cemetery Contemplations
At first the teacher would go with him into the garden during daylight and let him select a suitable 'flower' for his meditations
Then he let the bhikkhu go in there alone to fix the subject in his mind
Finally he was permitted to go in at night and spend the hours of darkness meditating upon his 'flower' Then having settled the meditation subject firmly in his mind the teacher would tell the bhikkhu to go and to meditate alone
Before he went he would receive instructions upon a further aspect of the meditation which emphasized that it was not a body 'out there' which was to be seen even in the mind
It was his own body which had to be seen with insight as bloated festering or just dry bones according to the stage of the decay selected
Thus were bhikkhus of that time enabled to free themselves from the deluded identification of this body as being 'myself' or as 'mine'  by the special exertions of this teacher
Every teacher as we have mentioned before has his own characteristic ways both of instruction and of conduct
If our bhikkhu went to a certain teacher a disciple of a yet more famous master he would have to put forth energy if he wished to live with him
This teacher lived in a little ramshackle hut  he would not let laypeople build him anything else in a small jungle vihara  and was about eightyfive years old
It was his practice to begin his working day at five o'clock when he would vigorously start to sweep the vihara grounds
Then when it was light he went out to collect food
Returning he ate a single meal of small quantity and for the rest of the day drank only water
Besides the two normal pujas he made a third one in the middle of the night
To do this he slept from ten o'clock until midnight  and never used a mosquitonet  and then got up for puja after which he slept again for another two hours
Arising vigorous he would sit in meditation until the sweepingtime
His appearance was hale and it appeared that he might very well carry on with his way of life for another twenty years at least
Stories about teachers are endless and this short account could never contain a tithe of them
So we must let these few suffice as examples and close this section on thudong abodes
Today when it is possible to go quickly everywhere by some conveyance or other why wander
What is the purpose of the thudong bhikkhu who alone or with one or two companions prefers to go his way on foot
There are quite a lot of reasons why wandering in this manner is preferred
For example the wanderer goes quietly and at whatever speed he wishes
He is not brought into contact with others who might disturb his contemplative way and he may stay at a place just as long as it pleases him  and leave it when he wishes
Also he is uninvolved with other people no arrangements has he to make for them while he gives trouble to none
In fact his is the way of freedom
Then again he reflects that this way of travel was used by his great Master in the fortyfive years of his teaching in India and has been that of countless other bhikkhus seeking Enlightenment
The modern ways of traveling are good for getting to places quickly but not so good for gaining Enlightenment
There is distraction enough in the mind without churning it up still further  some such thoughts he thinks
Reasons for wandering are also rather various and we are only concerned with those motivated by the search for Enlightenment
The real purposes are threefold to be able to dwell in solitary places for meditation to visit meditationmasters who often stay far into the country or forest or to go on pilgrimage to some famous shrine
While the first and second have already been touched upon the third needs a few more words
By pilgrimage to a shrine is meant the desire that arises in some bhikkhu who has taken to thudong life to visit and make his puja at a great stupa where are enshrined some remains of Lord Buddha or the arahants
Or perhaps to go to some famous temple where an exceptionally beautiful image of the Enlightened One is enshrined
All this he does with the idea that merit is gained from such actions and indeed if our thudong bhikkhu or anyone else goes on such pilgrimages singlemindedly and in deep devotion the results for his own development in the Dhamma are bound to be fruitful
If he wanders every day especially if the weather is hot the way rough or both his power of meditation must be very strong indeed or it will suffer from the impact of these external conditions
Tiredness of the body after walking only four or five hours can be a great obstacle in the way of peaceful practice
Therefore either he will walk one day and then finding a suitable place stop there for three or four days or if he wishes to reach a definite place by a certain time then he puts by his practice of mental calm and takes up the full time application of mindfulness in its various aspects
Besides the necessity of strong samadhi it is quite sure that he must have a strong body able to endure blazing sun heat sweat rough ways insects and cuts and bruises
These latter together with blisters are not infrequent in thudong life and can make his way very difficult
If he goes without sandals rocks will cut and thorns pierce his feet or going with them the feet must be very hard or they will surely be chapped
Strength of body is required so that he can carry comfortably his few essentials
What does a wandering thudong bhikkhu carry
First of all there are his eight essentials which are a bhikkhu's only possessions
They are three robes a waistband to secure the waistcloth a needle and thread razor and lastly a waterstrainer
These items he must take with him or if he loses any of them at any time they should be made good as soon as possible
In the thudong life all these things have their relevance  including the water strainer which is a very important piece of equipment
Besides these there will be certain other things which he is sure to have a waterflask or kettle his crot a sitting cloth and one for bathing and probably a bhikkhubag containing a few additional articles
Among these may be a candlelamp one or two medicines toothpickcumbrushes perhaps a small folding clock and a penknife
He may also carry a copy of the Patimokkha in Pali with a translation into his own language and some small book on the teaching such as the Dhammapada
All these together make up a good weight and generally he will only want to carry them before the sun gets too high and the late afternoon or evening when it is setting
How then should we picture our bhikkhu as he makes his way by footpaths and stony tracks through deep forest or open ricefields
He wears two of his robes the doublethick one being usually wrapped and stowed inside his bowl unless it is very cold
His bowl is secured in its sling and tied tight to its stand while the strap of the sling passes over one shoulder
His sitting cloth and a few other things may also be put inside while the bathingcloth forms an additional outer protection for the bowl
His bag the crot in its sling and the waterflask hang from the other shoulder
A thudong bhikkhu does not wear his robes long but hitches them rather high and so passes more easily through streams and over mountains
If he is in open country and the sun is shining he may place any handy piece of cloth on his head although this is always removed in accordance with the Vinaya's injunctions when passing by houses or through villages
The sandals on his feet are stout ones  they have to be to take all the knocks that his feet would otherwise suffer
In this way he goes mindful of and joyful in the Dhamma
He may go alone or with a nain or small boy following or he may be with one or two other bhikkhus
Probably they will not be walking very close together but prefer to be rather wellspaced so that mindfulness does not suffer nor conversation tend to break up their silence
Every so often at least in forests one of the bhikkhus will spot some refreshing fruit tree and then they may turn in that direction and after gathering the wild fruits  providing that it is not yet twelve o'clock  sit eating them while taking a wellearned rest
Certain bitter fruits such as the emblic myrobalan may be taken after midday as they have medicinal properties and our bhikkhu will be glad of these to help quench his thirst in the heat of the afternoon
A few thudong bhikkhus en marche in some ways resemble a small detachment of soldiers
They both have uniforms they both carry all their needs along with them and in both cases the senior leads and the juniors follow but here the resemblance ends
The former wear the robe of peace of harmlessness towards all living beings and all their possessions speak of a pacific way of life
No guns do they carry but crots no grenades but almsbowls
The wandering bhikkhu has conquered eastern Asia by these means without dissension without resort to violence without wars but with lovingkindness and compassion
And those mighty empires which ambitious and victorious men have raised one after the other by the use of force shattering opponents by wars innumerable  all this might and glory has passed away has crumbled to defaced stones and timesmoothed coins found in distant jungles
But the Dispensation of the Conqueror who practiced and preached a morality based upon nonviolence this empire of peace has endured
What is the message here for the empiremakers political or economic of the present day
What has this Dhamma to say to those who think of their lives as a fight against others
Upon this matter the Dhammapada has the following verse
Our wandering bhikkhu may decide at the end of his day whether he will stay the night in the forest or cave or other suitable place or whether the country proving unfavorable he will go to the nearest village
If he elects in favor of the latter it may well be that in approaching the village in the evening light some villagers will see him
Then some pious laymen will approach him and saluting him respectfully relieve his shoulders of bowl and crot and invite him to stay for the night in the village vihara or where there is no established residence for bhikkhus in the 'hall'
Word will soon get round the village that a venerable thudong bhikkhu has arrived and people will then come to the hall bringing with them things for his comfort  a pillow mat and of course tea
In Thailand at any rate this means 'watertea' or as westerners would say Chinese tea
He may also be offered honey or sugar to refresh himself and while he does this people will sit upon a lower level of the hall and respectfully enquire where he has come from whereto he will be going how long has he been a bhikkhu  and so forth
If our bhikkhu wishes or has the gift of teaching the general conversation may well be turned towards Dhamma and the laypeople will sit listening intently and perhaps putting a question now and then upon some point which they do not understand
Whenever there is time during the informal gathering or when people have departed our bhikkhu will have to see about patching up his skin bag which is so liable to become punctured even though he takes great care
Villagers will give him more medicines often of their own manufacture if those he carries do not suffice
His various wounds usually very small matters may nevertheless give him plenty of room for reflection upon the nature of the body
A small pimple soon grows into a large sore and an insignificant cut quickly pulsates with oozing pus and he remembers that each day he chants There are in this body  kesa  hair of the head loma  hair of the body and so forth to taco  skin mamsam  flesh pubbo  pus lohitam  blood
His cuts and blisters are reminders for him that the bag of skin holds much which although usually hidden from ordinary sight is liable to erupt and compel attention
The thudong bhikkhu gives attention here willingly whereas the worldly attitude is to turn away from and try not to consider such nasty things
Our bhikkhu however knows that the seeing of all these parts of the body traditionally thirtytwo in number as they really are that is as a danger as repulsive and as liable to decay leads him towards freedom from the 'own bodyview' and towards that state where the body is viewed quite impersonally and as a collection of processes acting and reacting
At best it will be seen after insight into its nature has been experienced as an instrument of the Dhamma
Towards such insight and mature understanding our bhikkhu strives and he will if he has still energy enough sit in meditation after the last villager has departed and attaining calm shift his attention to these thirtytwo messy parts or some one or two of them endeavoring to develop insight
Perhaps he may vow before taking his rest Oh may this body be devoted to the Dhamma may it become a Dhammainstrument And his night will be spent peacefully no dreams will disturb him and he will awake refreshed the body ready for active service in the Dhamma when he takes up his meditationsubject again in the cool of the morning
When it is fully light many villagers will come to the hall to make merit which means that our bhikkhu will not have to go out for pindapata
Every house will send a bowl of rice and some other food to accompany it and perhaps he may get sweets and fruits as well
One person from each house will place one or two spoons of rice into his bowl as it stands upon the raised platformfloor
When they have finished the other food together with his bowl will be reverently given into his hands  for a bhikkhu should not take any food which has not actually been offered in this way
The senior layman may well ask him for the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts and the giving of these being completed our bhikkhu will intone a chant whereby the merits made by the laity are formally dedicated to the happiness and comfort of the hungry ghosts
Before he begins his meal he remembers that this food is one of the four requisites and the proper reason why he will eat it
His meal over and his bowl washed he sets out again upon his way
Generally however the serious wanderer will prefer wherever conditions permit to spend his nights in the forest where his own quiet of mind will be better company for him than many people
Of course he will not get good tea nor honey  nor the other comforts of the village hall but if he has practiced diligently he will have comforts enough and far superior to those who have not sat in meditation
He will be able to sit as long as he can in the cool of the night without interruption if he has chosen a site far enough removed from the village
So our bhikkhu stays out of sight and hearing until he appears the next morning in the village upon his round for pindapata
Of course there will be no special food for him as there would be if he had stayed in the hall
He will just get the ordinary fare
As he has cultivated contentment he will not care whether it is finest culinary art or plainest village rice  it is all the same to him
He will find a considerable difference in the villages along his way some will be prosperous while others are poor some tidy and others uncared for and so on
And he will not always be welcome and though this will be very unusual it does happen especially where villagers are for some reason without bhikkhus to guide their lives
When he chances upon such a village if he is an ordinary bhikkhu he will have a good opportunity to test the strength of his patience
While if he is a teacher he may stop there for some time and using all his skill teach the people what is wrong with the way that they are going and what is the right way to fare through life
Turning now to another matter we should mention here the custom among thudong bhikkhus of making certain vows
It may be that the vow is made to observe a definite practice among the thirteen ascetic modes such as refraining from lying down for a certain number of days weeks or months
A wandering bhikkhu may vow never to stay in a hall such as we have described or to go on some pilgrimage by foot all the way not accepting proffered transport  and so forth
Regarding this last vow there is a story
A few years ago a Thai bhikkhu of about fifty years of age made a vow to walk from Bangkok to the holiest place for Buddhists the 'Diamond Throne' at Buddha Gaya in India
So he set off with bowl and robes and a few other things such as we have described
He took no money upon his pilgrimage neither did he worry about such modern encumbrances as passports and visas
Falling in with a party of Mon bhikkhus going to make their puja at the Shwe Dagon Pagoda in Rangoon he went with them and from there made his slow progress up the length of Burma
Two rains retreats he spent upon the way and still he had not reached India
Finally he crossed the IndoBurmese border in the wild hills of Nagaland and there some Nagas who had probably never seen a bhikkhu before and took him for a spy severely beat him taking away even his robes and bowl
Fortunately he was able to recover these although his few other things were gone and so limping he made his way down the Assamese plain
Knowing not a word of any Indian language and having to rely on pindapata which is not so easily got in India his first concern was to get someone to write on a piece of paper in Hindi and Bengali I am a Buddhist bhikkhu
I collect cooked food which is to be placed in this bowl
May you be well and happy This piece of paper he showed everywhere he went so that people would understand what he required
Luckily he was a vegetarian and not troubled regarding food
After many months of walking he came to Buddha Gaya
His vow was fulfilled after two and a half years he had wandered to good purpose
There is wandering in this way with some profitable end in view and there is also an aimless wandering
The thudong bhikkhu wanders in order to put an end to wandering
He wanders purposefully in the Dhammafaring so as to come to an end of the infinitely long wandering in birthanddeath
He has taken up this way of life that of a homeless one because he sees the dangers which beset all who drift in the currents of samsara
Birth and death aging and disease afflict all beings who are like so many pieces of driftwood dashed about by the ocean waves first this way and then that  but never getting anywhere and forever at the mercy of wind and water
As driftwood so beings do not know why they are here and instead of trying to probe this matter they invent all sorts of fanciful explanations
Our bhikkhu sees if only to some extent and for part of the time that beings are overcome by the poisons of the three roots of unskill and that these blind them and make them the prey of all the worldly conditions which they experience
And so they go pulled this way and that by the results of their own actions leaping from birth to birth
He knows that beings do not always spiritually evolve but that devolution is always possible  into states where darkness is complete the black night of ignorance where the lamp of the Dhamma is no longer discernible
Why wander blindly in this round of woes thinks our bhikkhu
Why wander on and on to such states as will be difficult to escape from
Perhaps he calls to mind a picture painted by a master of old which shows a long long track a winding from the distance into the foreground and from thence out of our ken
This track so tortuous passes through an unbeautiful landscape of shattered spiky rocks smitten stormstruck trees fireblackened grass and earth and here and there lying about are bones  a skull bone here a leg bone there
Along this dreadful track there comes a man his clothes all in tatters a widebrimmed pilgrim's hat upon his head and a staff held skewwise in one hand
His face bears all the marks of foolishness from his eyes which are wandering and not fixed upon his way before him to his mouth set in the most imbecile smile imaginable
He has wandered all down that long way grinning foolishly at the bones which would warn him if only he would heed them
He has wandered long infinitely long and he will wander longer  uncomprehending
He sees no other way to go but the dreary track in front of him
Our bhikkhu is one who is determined no longer to wander aimlessly but to be one who marches along the high road to freedom that glorious blissbestowing Way the Noble Eightfold Path
A good deal has already been written upon companionship while leading the holy life and this need not be repeated
The point that is really important is whether one makes progress best in the Dhammacompany of others or whether one's mentality and progress are sufficiently strong and mature to fare lonely as rhinoceros
One who has the company of others has many chances to learn from them
Not only from his teacher but from other bhikkhus and not only from them from nains in fact from everyone with whom he has contact
Every person is one's teacher if only there is the facility and humility to learn from them and in all situations
From the wise our thudong bhikkhu upon his Dhammapilgrimage learns wisdom
But also from those lacking in good qualities he learns how not to behave he learns through their mistakes and reflects upon himself 'Now is this unskillful way of speech or bodily action to be found in me or not'
He also learns more humility from this mindfulness of others' action for while perceiving some fault of others he does not make this an opportunity for the arising of pride
When noting greed in someone else besides the above reflection upon his own behavior perhaps he can add the thought 'But he has a very strong devotion' In other words he learns through his contact with fellow Dhammafarers to see their good qualities also and to strive to bring those excellencies to perfection in his own personality
Through the effort that he makes we should note certain qualities which being present to the extent that his training has been successful mark him out as one who has indeed taken the following to heart
Good is restraint in action good is restraint in speech good is restraint in thought restraint everywhere is good
The bhikkhu restrained in every way is freed from all suffering
We should notice that all his actions were marked by this moderation
If we saw him in company he would be one who laughed but little for he will have to some extent perceived the truth in the following
But we should not from this gain the impression of a gloomy saintliness or that his face would be forbiddingly harsh for our bhikkhu has made lovingkindness and compassion grow and will upon occasion smile gently
Likewise his speech is marked by a softness of expression and lack of rough words
He would be inclined to speak to others upon the Dhamma and be little attracted to other subjects except where they touched upon what for him is allimportant the Way to Enlightenment
Besides contact with teachers and other bhikkhus he may have a nain as his companion or perhaps a boy who wishes to train for ordination later
If a suitable boy can be found and is given the goingforth to become nain then he will be of great help to the thudong bhikkhu
'Suitable' here means that he feels a genuine urge to live not only the holy life but also to live it in the sort of places where thudong bhikkhus live
he must also be devoted to the bhikkhu with whom he lives looking upon him as his teacher
Suitability includes as well the ability of the nain or boy to practice meditation for living in the wilds with few or no books and out of range of the sensedistractions of the towns such boys must be able to employ themselves through at least part of the day without disturbing the bhikkhus
There are in Buddhist countries particularly numbers of boys who one supposes have practiced meditation in past lives and who take to it in this one as ducklings to water
The nain or boy helps in so many ways that it would not be possible to list them all
He is eversolicitous for the wellbeing of bhikkhus and never loses an opportunity for doing them some service
In particular this applies to the teacher of the nain and to any other bhikkhus whom he particularly respects  for their wisdom patience gentleness learning energetic striving or whichever other fine qualities are manifest in them
In the training of the nain helpfulness towards others and humility to learn from them are prime qualities
Whenever our thudong bhikkhu finds the occasion proper to instruct or correct he will find if he has a really good nain that he will listen with ears open wide to the former while accepting the correction humbly and with a good heart
It does happen even with the best of nains that he will make some mistake particularly regarding carelessness
Then the bhikkhu will quietly admonish the nain and perhaps prescribe some punishmentwork for him to do  and the nain gently smiling accepts his work which is often sweeping and sets about it with a right good will
Such a novice keen for the training is positively avid for Dhamma and listens particularly to stories with great attention
As there is no lack in Buddhist literature of stories to illustrate points of training nains soon come to have a fund of such material both of the Buddhatime and from later Buddhist history
Thus begins the Dhammaeducation of what will probably be a good thudong bhikkhu
What then of one who chooses to live alone
Two points stand out Positively his character must be deep and resourceful enough to surmount all the obstacles he may encounter while on the negative side his defilements must be sufficiently held in check by his culture of mindfulness and meditation
It is no good living in the wilds boorishly unrestrained as in the case of venerable Gulissani
On the contrary our bhikkhu knows that the greatest restraint is needed as there is no longer any companion to upbraid or advise him whenever this is necessary
He has then to be his own instructor and this is plainly impossible unless such excellent qualities as mindfulness shame and fear of blame are welldeveloped
Our bhikkhu who wishes to taste solitude must also be sure that he does so for the right reasons
There are those people who like to live by themselves simply because they cannot bear their fellowmen
Their solitary life is thus based upon the root of hatred
Far different must be the thudong bhikkhu's reason for desiring loneliness
He wishes to course deep in the Dhamma and have no drags no ties whatever which might prevent his increasing perception of its truth
His whole life revolves around the Dhamma and he has or wishes to develop the central thought of Dhamma that is of the Three Signata of Existence
To do this his emotional nature must be mature and this in Buddhist practice means the development of the Divine Abidings each one of which replaces a certain aspect of emotional instability
Thus hatred is replaced by lovingkindness indifference to others' sufferings is remedied by compassion envy by sympathetic joy with other's happiness while involvement with and attachment to others is in maturity replaced by equanimity
Even if our bhikkhu cannot yet reach to the heights of equanimity at least his gentleness and compassion must have grown to some degree
He has almost placed himself outside the world of men and he is sure therefore to have greater contact with animals than do most men and he may especially if in him purification is well advanced have visions of the gods
Many are the stories of old told about both sorts of contact
From the context of stories in which the gods appear to bhikkhus it is apparent that they do so because the latter's spiritual development has approached or surpassed that of those gods
It is these Divine Abidings which make possible this meeting of worlds
Stories of extraordinary affection between thudong bhikkhus and animals are also frequent
In this country at the end of the Ayuthia period there were numbers of forestdwelling bhikkhus who like the sages of old would dwell hermitlike surrounded by animals and birds
Deer in particular came to love the companionship of these hermits who could only attract animals thus because of the lovingkindness which they had made grow in their hearts and the consequent absence of hatred and fear
Two other qualities are necessary for the solitary dweller patience and energy
He will hardly be a thudong bhikkhu at all if he has not the former
Livingconditions for him are many and not all of them are perfect all the time
Although he has backed out of the rough waters of attachments to persons places and things he still lives in this world imperfect and must patiently cope with whatever trials he encounters
With patience he trains his mind so difficult to bring under control and with patience he notes the gradual relaxation of the defilements
He comes to know that his Dispensation is as Lord Buddha instructed
He has patience in seeing that his efforts are gradually rewarded
'Efforts' means energy rather necessary for many aspects of strenuous thudong life as our bhikkhu knows
If he did not make any effort in his chosen way of life then a speedy decline would follow in which the defilements for the weakening and ultimate breaking of which he was leading this life would reassert themselves and once more close their stranglehold upon him
The thudong bhikkhu makes efforts too to maintain his observance of the Vinaya and in particular of the Fundamental Precepts pure and unbroken
Even more diligent must be the observance of the solitary bhikkhu who can ill afford to let slide any of the precepts
If he does so he will find that his meditation is disturbed by thoughts of the broken precepts and to mend matters he must go and obtain purification of his fault through confession of it to another bhikkhu
He has to stir up energy to maintain and develop further his meditative practice
Without effort instead of going from strength to strength in meditative calm and insight he would be liable to slip backwards practicing less and less every day
With patience to hold in check agitation and energy to ensure that slothfulness does not lay on its benumbing touch our solitary thudong bhikkhu has a good chance of making balanced progress along the way
Pali Scriptures mention another kind of solitariness and after his practice of bodily seclusion together with the mental withdrawal experienced in deep meditation he may come to possess this lasting solitude
The man with craving present is said to be accompanied by a second one whereas one in whom craving is absent having been totally eradicated through insight is an arahant who abides in the ultimate solitude from all substrates producing continued existence
Our thudong bhikkhu strives to use his solitude in forest or cave in order to be rid of his companion in all samsaric wandering  craving and being without this second one to know the true solitude of Dhammatruth
When he has achieved this then indeed he may abide anywhere and whether forest or city it will make no difference to him
This was the pattern in Lord Buddha's life first the long meditative seclusion followed by his carrying of the torch of Enlightenment for all to see
Sometimes in those long years of teaching the Enlightened One would betake himself to the forests for a time
Then he would return to the viharas quite near to the important towns of those days or wander among the villages meeting kings and 'outcastes' priests and princes and discoursing to all without exception for the potential of Enlightenment lay within all men having no regard whether he was estranged from society and labelled an 'outcaste' or esteemed by people as a priest of 'pure' lineage
Thus in following the thudong life our bhikkhu is making his efforts however small to follow in the Way his Master trod
To him the life of the Enlightened One is not something remote for it is illuminated to some extent by his own experience and is always a great source of precious inspiration and guidance
It shows him what can be achieved and gives him the courage to face all dangers and go forth to make the attempt for this highest achievement
As Lord Buddha assures all people
As much as can easily be written of the thudong bhikkhu's life is contained in these sketches
Just as the flavor of soup is not to be told even in one thousand pages so the real flavor of this Ancient Way cannot be conveyed by words
Soup is to be tasted the thudong life is to be lived
If it sounds hard one must remember that its rewards are great and in the field of Dhammaendeavor nothing is gained without effort
The world wants everything quickandeasy but the fruits of the holy life are thus only for those who have already put forth their energy already striven hard for the goal
Truly Lord Buddha promises in the Discourse on Mindfulness that the noble attainment of the arahant may be experienced within seven days
There is also the phrase found Instructed in the morning he attains in the evening Such promise and statements depend upon individual capacities and whether the practice of mindfulness is strong and complete enough and moreover they only apply providing that there is the ability to renounce this world completely
Nibbana the supreme goal is not to be got at while anything even the most subtle dhamma is still clung to
Behold says the Exalted One
The thudong bhikkhu makes efforts to be among the wise who have cast aside all embroilments with things people and the three periods of time
He has few things among which he can flounder and he tries vigorously to cut off all that might tie him to people
He strives also to win for his own his Master's realization regarding the three times
All bonds however arising he tries to shatter
He is inspired by the Enlightened One's exhortations that a mortal disease requires a drastic remedy
he has gone forth from home and family from all the dear decorations of life to don the ancient yellow robe of patches to have little and want less to pursue the sublime Way shown by the Buddha with every energy he possesses
While unenlightened he wants only one 'thing'  Enlightenment
When he wishes to take the step of Goingforth he thrice utters these words Give leave Venerable Sir and having given me these robes out of compassion let me go forth for the extinction of suffering and the realization of Nibbana
If he is serious in his quest he tries even amid life's diffusion not to forget these words not to forget the reason why he is wearing the three robes
They are a great reminder that Enlightenment is his aim and that the wellbeing of others is best upheld by penetration of Enlightenment by oneself
This thudong way although it seems to be devoted only to the good of the bhikkhu undertaking it actually stands at the beginning of his progress along the way
Lord Buddha emphasized Who stuck in the mud can pull out another stuck in the mud Later when some mastery is gained in the Dhamma then is the time to aid others and only then can one actually help them effectively
It is this straightforward attitude to the Dhamma among members of the Sangha and devoted laypeople which has been responsible for the spread of the Dhamma in Eastern Asia from Sri Lanka to Siberia from Afghanistan to Japan
And to spread the Dhamma outwardly it must first be spread inwardly in one's own heart
The Sangha unencumbered by worldly lumber has just this work
It is the Sangha in fact which has everywhere in the past been the backbone of the Buddhist religion
It is the mainstay of knowledge of the Dhamma and it is the spearhead of applying that Dhamma to the living of the holy life
Efforts made to spread Buddhism in the present must therefore take account of these two factors the necessity of having those who have experienced Dhamma for themselves as guides as meditation masters also the importance of the Third Jewel the Sangha which must be made to grow strongly since it provides the opportunity for devoted effort to win the Dhamma and the subsequent teaching of others which may follow
Such effort is made particularly by the thudong bhikkhu as we have tried to show
This is not to say that others having practices different from those outlined here do not make efforts toward Enlightenment
Of course they do but here we have only been concerned with this particular aspect of bhikkhu life
Still from the high esteem in which the genuine thudong bhikkhu has always been held in Buddhist lands and the fact that his life most nearly approaches that of the original Sangha it would not seem a mistake to regard the thudong way as being first among other modes of bhikkhu life
Among the bhikkhus it is those who have realized for themselves the truth of the Dhamma and who are therefore qualified to teach others it is they who are the elect
Of course they do no write books and are often difficult to find but certainly they are the heartwood
Where they are to be found in whatever Buddhist land or anywhere else there the Buddhadhamma truly lives for the light of that Dhamma burns brightly in their hearts
Wherever they are there Dhamma not only lives but can also grow
For the Dhamma does not grow by the numbers of its adherents according to governments' statistics nor by the number of its temples not yet even by the quantities of yellow robes worn no it grows heartwise from teacher to pupil through the former's instructions and the latter's application
The thudong life is one way to this growth
The Dhamma is not secret for it is open to all who have ears to hear and the Sangha exists for all those who would devote their lives to Dhamma
The Way is there the Way is always there  but who will tread it
 Venerable Nagasena's reply to King Menander in Milinda's Questions  p translated by IB
Horner
There follows a translation which is based on the Pali text Woodwards' translation in Gradual Sayings II and the Thai translation of the Anguttara Nikaya
In this retranslation great help has been given by Ven
Nagasena Bhikkhu of Wat Benchamabopitr in Bangkok
This sutta which we call the Discourse on the Noble Lineages has a very celebrated history
It will be immediately obvious that its content is an inspiration for the thudong bhikkhu and for those who are neither thudong nor bhikkhu it has as its message that of contentment with a sufficiency of this world's goods while warning any who cultivate this attitude to guard against pride arising
The Commentary states that under the first three of the Noble Lineages all of the Vinaya Collection may be expounded
Under the fourth heading which concerns mental development by way of meditation and the subsequently arising desire to relinquish all states connected with the unskillful factors under this Lineage may be explained all the Discourses and Buddhist psychology
That such expositions actually took place is attested by many references in the history of Ceylon
It seems that such was the fame of this Discourse that thousands would flock from near and far to hear skilled bhikkhus expound it
As the reader will see it is a short sutta but evidently during its preaching practically all topics in the vast range of the Pali canon could be brought under the headings which it gives
Such preaching sometimes continued for many days and was a popular subject for exposition during the rains retreat
Some traces of this tradition are still to be found in Sri Lanka

Long before the days of the Commentaries there is another possible reference to this sutta
It occurs in the list of seven Dhamma passages recommended for study by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis upasakas and upasikas by the Emperor Asoka in his Bhabru Edict
There it is called the 'Aliyavasani' which many scholars equate with the Ariyavamsa Sutta
That the great Emperor should have singled out this text for the study of those who follow the Buddha Way is indeed fitting and it is as appropriate for their study now as it was over two thousand years ago
In Thailand at the present time it is one of a selection of Discourses and other chants which come up regularly each month for chanting in temples after the evening puja
Needless to say it is highly esteemed by thudong bhikkhus many of whom know it by heart
In the translation following passages in brackets are explanations drawn from the Commentary or from the Thai translation which somewhat enlarges upon the Pali text
It is hoped that this most ancient teaching upon the thudong life will be of some interest after the preceding account of the Noble Lineages in the present time
Thus have I heard At one time the Lord was dwelling near Savatthi at the Jeta Wood in Anathapindika's Park
Then the Lord addressed the bhikkhus saying O bhikkhus
Yes Lord responded those bhikkhus
Then the Lord said 
Here O bhikkhus are these Four Lineages of the Noble Ones  foremost days of old traditional time immemorial neither separated from them now nor were they separated in the past neither stained now nor shall they be reckoned impure in the future and never are they despised by wise recluses and brahmans
Here O bhikkhus a bhikkhu is content with this or that robe and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of robe
He does not search for robes in an unbecoming way and if he does not obtain them he is not cast down
When he has got them he is not attached to them is not fascinated by them nor has he any desire for them
Seeing the peril and skilled in avoiding this he just makes use of them
Yet he does not exalt himself because of his contentment with any kind of robes nor does he look down upon others 
O bhikkhus whatever bhikkhu is skilled in this who is not lazy who clearly comprehends and is mindful then he is indeed well established in this foremost Noble Lineage as handed down from time immemorial
Then again O bhikkhus a bhikkhu is content with this or that almsfood and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of almsfood
He does not search for almsfood in an unbecoming way and if he does not obtain it he is not cast down
When he has got it he is not attached to it is not fascinated by it nor has he any desire for it
Seeing the peril and skilled in avoiding this he just makes use of it
Yet he does not exalt himself because of his contentment with any kind of almsfood nor does he look down upon others
O bhikkhus whatever bhikkhu is skilled in this who is not lazy who clearly comprehends and is mindful then indeed he is well established in this foremost Noble Lineage as handed down from time immemorial
Then again O bhikkhus a bhikkhu is content with this or that shelter and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of shelter
He does not search for shelters in an unbecoming way and if he does not obtain it he is not cast down
When he has got it he is not attached to it is not fascinated by it nor has he any desire for it
Seeing the peril and skilled in avoiding this he just makes use of it
Yet he does not exalt himself because of his contentment with any kind of shelter nor does he look down upon others
O bhikkhus whatever bhikkhu is skilled in this who is not lazy who clearly comprehends and is mindful then he is indeed well established in this foremost Noble Lineage as handed down from time immemorial
Then again O bhikkhus a bhikkhu has development as a source of happiness and he delights in it he has abandoning as a source of happiness and he delights in it
By having the happiness from development and by the delight thereof by having the happiness from abandoning and the delight thereof he does not exalt himself nor does he look down upon others
O bhikkhus whatever bhikkhu is skilled in this who is not lazy who clearly comprehends and is mindful then he is indeed well established in this foremost Noble Lineage as handed down from time immemorial
These O bhikkhus are the Four Lineages of the Noble Ones they are foremost practiced from days of old traditional handed down from time immemorial neither separated from the life of Noble Ones now nor in the past neither stained now nor shall they be reckoned impure in future and are never despised by wise recluses and brahmans
Moreover bhikkhus possessing these Four Lineages of the Noble Ones a bhikkhu may dwell in the East or in the West in the North or in the South and in whatever place he dwells accidie cannot overpower him but he will overcome accidie
Why so
O bhikkhus such a one is a steadfast sage who has overcome both accidie and delight
Thus spoke the Lord
The Welfarer the Teacher then said further
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds

Monks I know not of any other single thing so intractable as the untamed mind
The untamed mind is indeed a thing untractable
Monks I know not of any other thing so tractable as the tamed mind
The tamed mind is indeed a thing tractable
Monks I know not of any other single thing so conducive to great loss as the untamed mind
The untamed mind indeed conduces to great loss
Monks I know not of any other single thing so conducive to great profit as the tamed mind
The tamed mind indeed conduces to great profit
Monks I know not of any other single thing that brings such woe as the mind that is untamed uncontrolled unguarded and unrestrained
Such a mind indeed brings great woe
Monks I know not of any other single thing that brings such bliss as the mind that is tamed controlled guarded and restrained
Such a mind indeed brings great bliss
 Gradual Sayings The Book of the Ones Ch
IV Translated by F
Woodward
Thus I have heard At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the palace of Migara's mother in the Eastern Monastery
Then the brahman GanakaMoggallana approached the Lord having approached he exchanged greetings with the Lord having conversed in a friendly and courteous way he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance GanakaMoggallana the brahman spoke thus to the Lord Just as good Gotama in this palace of Migara's mother there can be seen a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say as far as the last flight of stairs so too good Gotama for these brahmans there can be seen a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say in the study so too good Gotama for these archers there can be seen a gradual practice that is to say in archery so too good Gotama for us whose livelihood is calculation there can be seen a gradual training a gradual practice that is to say in accountancy
For when we get a pupil good Gotama we first of all make him calculate 'One one two twos three threes four fours five fives six sixes seven sevens eight eights nine nines ten tens' and we good Gotama also make him calculate a hundred
Is it not possible good Gotama to lay down a similar gradual training gradual doing gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline
It is possible brahman to lay down a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline Brahman even a skilled trainer of horses having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred first of all gets it used to the training in respect of wearing the bit
Then he gets it used to further training  even so brahman the Tathagata having taken on a man to be tamed first of all disciplines him thus
'Come you monk be of moral habit live controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them train yourself in the rules of training' As soon brahman as the monk is of moral habit controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training the Tathagata disciplines him further saying
'Come you monk be guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans having seen a material shape with the eye do not be entranced with the general appearance do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow in
So fare along controlling it guard the organ of sight achieve control over the organ of sight
Having heard a sound with the ear Having smelt a smell with the nose Having savored a taste with the tongue Having felt a touch with the body Having cognized a mental state with the mind do not be entranced with the detail
For if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow in
So fare along controlling it guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of mind'
As soon brahman as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be moderate in eating you should take food reflecting carefully not for fun or indulgence or personal charm or beautification but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it going for keeping it unharmed for furthering the Brahmafaring with the thought Thus will I crush out an old feeling and I will not allow a new feeling to arise and then there will be for me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in comfort'
As soon brahman as a monk is moderate in eating the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk dwell intent on vigilance during the day while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states during the middle watch of the night lie down on the right side in the lion posture foot resting on foot mindful clearly conscious reflecting on the thought of getting up again during the last watch of the night when you have arisen while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states'
As soon brahman as a monk is intent on vigilance the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or departing acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking round acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the outer cloak the bowl or robe acting with clear consciousness whether you are eating drinking munching savoring acting with clear consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature acting with clear consciousness whether you are walking standing sitting asleep awake talking or being silent'
As soon brahman as he is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a glen a hill cave a cemetery a woodland grove in the open or on a heap of straw' On returning from almsgathering after the meal the monk sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of him
He getting rid of covetousness for the world dwells with a mind devoid of covetousness he cleanses the mind of covetousness
Getting rid of the taint of illwill he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate and merciful towards all creatures and beings he cleanses the mind of illwill
Getting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells without sloth or torpor perceiving the light mindful and clearly conscious he cleanses the mind of sloth and torpor
Getting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind inward tranquil he cleanses the mind of restlessness and worry
Getting rid of doubt he dwells doubtcrossed unperplexed as to the states that are skilled he cleanses his mind of doubt
He by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and deleterious to intuitive wisdom aloof from pleasures of the senses aloof from unskilled states of mind enters and abides in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought is born of aloofness and is rapturous and joyful
By allaying initial thought and discursive thought his mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point he enters and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful
By the fading out of rapture he dwells with equanimity attentive and clearly conscious and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful' and he enters and abides in the third meditation
By getting rid of anguish by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness
Brahman such is my instruction for those monks who are learners who perfection being not yet attained dwell longing for the incomparable security from the bonds
But as for those monks who are perfected ones the cankers destroyed who have lived the life done what was to be done shed the burden attained to their own goal the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed and who are freed by perfect profound knowledge  these things conduce both to their abiding in ease here and now as well as to their mindfulness and clear consciousness
When this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the Lord
Now on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama do all the good Gotama's disciples attain the unchanging goal  nibbana or do some not attain it
Some of my disciples brahman on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain it
What is the cause good Gotama what the reason that since nibbana does exist since the way leading to nibbana exists since the good Gotama exists as adviser some of the good Gotama's disciples on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama attain the unchanging goal  nibbana but some do not attain it
Well then brahman I will question you on this point in reply
As it is pleasing to you so you may answer me
What do you think about this brahman
Are you skilled in the way leading to Rajagaha
Yes sir skilled am I in the way leading to Rajagaha
What do you think about this
A man might come along here wanting to go to Rajagaha
Having approached you he might speak thus 'I want to go to Rajagaha sir show me the way to this Rajagaha' You might speak thus to him Yes my good man this road goes to Rajagaha go along it for a while
When you have gone along it for a while you will see a village go along for a while when you have gone along for a while you will see a market town go for a while
When you have gone along for a while you will see Rajagaha with its delightful parks delightful forests delightful fields delightful ponds
But although he has been exhorted and instructed thus by you he might take the wrong road and go westwards
Then a second man might come along wanting to go to Rajagaha you will see Rajagaha with its delightful ponds' Exhorted and instructed thus by you he might get to Rajagaha safely
What is the cause brahman what the reason that since Rajagaha does exist since the way leading to Rajagaha exists since you exist as adviser the one man although being exhorted and instructed thus by you may take the wrong road and go westwards while the other may get to Rajagaha safely
What can I good Gotama do in this matter
A shower of the way good Gotama am I
Even so brahman nibbana does exist the way leading to nibbana exists and I exist as adviser
But some of my disciples on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain it
What can I brahman do in this matter
A shower of the way brahman is a Tathagata
When this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the Lord
Good Gotama as for those persons who in want of a way of living having gone forth from home into homelessness without faith who are crafty fraudulent deceitful who are unbalanced and puffed up who are shifty scurrilous and of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are not guarded who do not know moderation in eating who are not intent on vigilance indifferent to recluseship not of keen respect for the training who are ones for abundance lax taking the lead in backsliding shirking the burden of seclusion who are indolent of feeble energy of confused mindfulness not clearly conscious not concentrated but of wandering minds who are weak in wisdom drivelers  the good Gotama is not in communion with them
But as for those young men of respectable families who have gone forth from home into homelessness from faith who are not crafty fraudulent or deceitful who are not unbalanced or puffed up who are not shifty scurrilous or of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are guarded who know moderation in eating who are intent on vigilance longing for recluseship of keen respect for the training who are not ones for abundance not lax shirking backsliding taking the lead in seclusion who are of stirred up energy selfresolute with mindfulness aroused clearly conscious concentrated their minds onepointed who have wisdom are not drivelers  the good Gotama is in communion with them
As good Gotama black gum is pointed to as chief of rootscents as red sandalwood is pointed to as chief of the pithscents as jasmine is pointed to as chief of the flower scents  even so is the exhortation of the good Gotama highest among the teachings of today
Excellent good Gotama excellent good Gotama
As good Gotama one might set upright what had been upset or disclose what had been covered or show the way to one who had gone astray or bring an oillamp into the darkness so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so in many a figure is dhamma made clear by the good Gotama
I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks May the good Gotama accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from today forth for as long as life lasts
I shall fasten you mind like an elephant at a small gate
I shall not incite you to evil you net of sensual pleasure bodyborn

When fastened you will not go like an elephant not finding the gate open
Witchmind you will not wander again and again using force delighting in evil

As the strong hookholder makes an untamed elephant newly taken turn against its will so shall I make you turn

As the excellent charioteer skilled in the taming of excellent horses tames a thoroughbred so shall I standing firm in the five powers tame you

I shall bind you with mindfulness with purified self shall cleanse
Restrained by the yoke of energy you will not go far from here mind

 Theragatha vv
 Vijitasena's verses Translated KR
Norman The Elders' Verses I PTS
'
Thus have I heard At one time the Lord was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place
Now at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in the Forest Hut
Then prince Jayasena who was always pacing up and down always roaming about on foot approached the novice Aciravata having approached he exchanged greetings with the novice Aciravata having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy he sat down at a respectful distance
While he was sitting down at a respectful distance Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the novice Aciravata
I have heard good Aggivessana that if a monk is abiding here diligent ardent selfresolute he may attain onepointedness of mind
That is so prince that is so prince
A monk abiding here diligent ardent selfresolute may attain onepointedness of mind
It were good if the reverend Aggivessana were to teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered it
I prince am not able to teach you dhamma as I have heard it as I have mastered it
Now if I were to teach you dhamma as I have heard it as I have mastered it and if you could not understand the meaning of what I said that would be weariness to me that would be a vexation to me
Let the reverend Aggivessana teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered it
Perhaps I could understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana says
If I were to teach you dhamma prince as I have heard it as I have mastered it and if you were to understand the meaning of what I say that would be good if you should not understand the meaning of what I say you must remain as you are you must not question me further on the matter
Let the reverend Aggivessana teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered it
If I understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana says that will be good if I do not understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana says I will remain as I am I will not question the reverend Aggivessana further on this matter
Then the novice Aciravata taught dhamma to Prince Jayasena as he had heard it as he had mastered it
When this had been said Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the novice Aciravata
This is impossible good Aggivessana it cannot come to pass that a monk abiding diligent ardent selfresolute should attain onepointedness of mind Then Prince Jayasena having declared to the novice Aciravata that this was impossible and could not come to pass rising from his seat departed
And soon after Prince Jayasena had departed the novice Aciravata approached the Lord having approached and greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the novice Aciravata told the Lord the whole of the conversation he had with Prince Jayasena as far as it had gone
When this had been said the Lord spoke thus to the novice Aciravata
What is the good of that Aggivessana
That Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures enjoying sensepleasures being consumed by thoughts of sensepleasures burning with the fever of sensepleasures eager in the search for sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known by renunciation seen by renunciation attained by renunciation realized by renunciation  such a situation does not exist
It is as if Aggivessana among elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed two elephants two horses or two oxen are well tamed well trained and two are not tamed not trained
What do you think about this Aggivessana
Would these two elephants or horses or oxen that were to be tamed and that were well tamed well trained  would these on being tamed reach tamed capacity would they being tamed attain a tamed stage
Yes revered sir
But those two elephants or horses or oxen that were to be tamed but that were neither tamed nor trained  would these not being tamed attain a tamed stage as do the two elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed that were well tamed well trained
No revered sir
Even so Aggivessana that Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known and realized by renunciation  such a situation does not exist
It is as if Aggivessana there were a great mountain slope near a village or a markettown which two friends coming hand in hand from that village or markettown might approach having approached the mountain slope one friend might remain at the foot while the other might climb to the top
Then the friend standing at the foot of the mountain slope might speak thus to the one standing on the top 'My dear what do you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope' He might reply 'As I stand on the top of the mountain slope I my dear see delightful parks delightful woods delightful stretches of level ground delightful ponds' But the other might speak thus 'This is impossible it cannot come to pass my dear that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful ponds' Then the friend who had been standing on top of the mountain slope having come down to the foot and taken his friend by the arm making him climb to the top of the mountain slope and giving him a moment in which to regain his breath might speak to him thus 'Now my dear what is it that you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope' He might speak thus 'I my dear as I stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds' He might speak thus 'Just now my dear we understood you to say This is impossible it cannot come to pass that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful ponds
But now we understand you to say 'I my dear as I stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds' He might speak thus 'That was because I my dear hemmed in by this great mountain slope could not see what was to be seen'
Even so but to a still greater degree Aggivessana is Prince Jayasena hemmed in blocked obstructed enveloped by this mass of ignorance
Indeed that Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures enjoying sensepleasures being consumed by thoughts of sensepleasures eager in the search for sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known seen attained realized by renunciation  such a situation does not exist
Had these two similes occurred to you Aggivessana for Prince Jayasena Prince Jayasena naturally would have acted in the manner of one having trust in you
But how could these two similes for Prince Jayasena have occurred to me revered sir seeing that they are spontaneous that is to say to the Lord and have never been heard before
As Aggivessana a noble anointed king addresses an elephant hunter saying 'You good elephant hunter mount the king's elephant and go into an elephant forest
When you see a forest elephant tie him to the neck of the king's elephant' And Aggivessana the elephant hunter having answered 'Yes sire' in assent to the noble anointed king mounts the king's elephant and goes into an elephant forest
Seeing a forest elephant he ties him to the neck of the king's elephant
So the king's elephant brings him out into the open
But Aggivessana the forest elephant has this longing that is to say for the elephant forest
But in regard to him the elephant hunter tells the noble anointed king that the forest elephant has got out into the open
The noble anointed king then addresses an elephant tamer saying 'Come you good elephant tamer tame the forest elephant by subduing his forest ways by subduing his forest memories and aspirations and by subduing his distress his fretting and fever for the forest by making him pleased with the villages and by accustoming him to human ways'
And Aggivessana the elephant tamer having answered 'Yes sire' in assent to the noble anointed king driving a great post into the ground ties the forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways and accustom him to human ways
Then the elephant tamer addresses him with such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear affectionate going to the heart urbane pleasant to the manyfolk liked by the manyfolk
And Aggivessana the forest elephant on being addressed with words that are gentle liked by the manyfolk listens lends ear and bends his mind to learning
Next the elephant tamer supplies him with grassfodder and water
When Aggivessana the forest elephant has accepted the grassfodder and water from the elephant tamer it occurs to the elephant tamer 'The king's elephant will now live' Then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying 'Take up put down' When Aggivessana the king's elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to take up and put down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying 'Get up sit down' When Aggivessana the king's elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to get up and sit down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task known as 'standing your ground' he ties a shield to the great beast's trunk a man holding a lance is sitting on his neck and men holding lances are standing surrounding him on all sides and the elephant tamer holding a lance with a long shaft is standing in front
While he is doing the task of 'standing your ground' he does not move a foreleg nor does he move a hindleg nor does he move the forepart of his body nor does he move the hindpart of his body nor does he move his head nor does he move an ear nor does he move a tusk nor does he move his tail nor does he move his trunk
A king's elephant is one who endures blows of sword axe arrow hatchet and the resounding din of drum and kettledrum conch and tamtam he is purified gold purged of all its dross and impurities fit for a king a royal possession and reckoned as a kingly attribute
Even so Aggivessana does a Tathagata arise here in the world a perfected one fully SelfAwakened One endowed with right knowledge and conduct wellfarer knower of the worlds the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed the Awakened One the Lord
He makes known this world with the devas with Mara with Brahma the creation with its recluses and brahmans its devas and men having realized them by his own superknowledge
He teaches dhamma which is lovely at the beginning lovely in the middle lovely at the ending with the spirit and the letters he proclaims the Brahmafaring wholly fulfilled quite purified
A householder or a householder's son or one born in another family hears that dhamma
Having heard that dhamma he gains faith in the Tathagata
Endowed with this faith that he has acquired he reflects in this way 'The household life is confined and dusty going forth is in the open it is not easy for one who lives in a house to fare the Brahmafaring wholly fulfilled wholly pure polished like a conchshell
Suppose now that I having cut off hair and beard having put on saffron robes should go forth from home into homelessness' After a time getting rid of his wealth be it small or great getting rid of his circle of relations be it small or great having cut off his hair and beard having put on saffron robes he goes forth from home into homelessness
To this extent Aggivessana the ariyan disciple gets out into the open
But Aggivessana devas and mankind have this longing that is to say for the five strands of sensepleasures
The Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be moral live controlled by the control of the Obligations possessed of behavior and posture seeing danger in the slightest faults undertaking them train yourself in the rules of training'
And when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moral lives controlled by the control undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans
Having seen a material shape with the eye
Having cognized a mental state with the mind be not entranced by the general appearance be not entranced by the detail
For if you dwell with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind might flow in
So fare along with its control guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of the mind'
And when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be moderate in eating abiding in comfort'
When Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moderate in eating the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk abide intent on vigilance you should cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states
And when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is intent on vigilance then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness
Be one who acts with clear consciousness talking silent'
And when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a wilderness in a hillcave a cemetery a forest haunt in the open or on a heap of straw' He chooses a remote lodging in the forest or on a heap of straw
Returning from almsgathering after the meal he sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of him he by getting rid of coveting for the world dwells with a mind devoid of coveting he purifies the mind of coveting
By getting rid of the taint of illwill he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings he purifies the mind of the taint of illwill
By getting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells devoid of sloth and torpor perceiving the light mindful clearly conscious he purifies the mind of sloth and torpor
By getting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind subjectively tranquilized he purifies the mind of restlessness and worry
By getting rid of doubt he dwells doubtcrossed unperplexed as to the states that are skillful he purifies the mind of doubt
He by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly conscious mindful so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world
He fares along contemplating the feelings the mind the mental states in mental states ardent clearly conscious mindful so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world
As Aggivessana an elephant tamer driving a great post into the ground ties a forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways so as to subdue his forest aspirations and so as to subdue his distress his fretting and fever for the forest so as to make him pleased with villages and accustom him to human ways  even so Aggivessana these four applications of mindfulness are ties of the mind so as to subdue the ways of householders and to subdue the aspirations of householders and to subdue the distress the fretting and fever of householders they are for leading to the right path for realizing nibbana
The Tathagata then disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk fare along contemplating the body in the body but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with the body fare along contemplating the feelings in the feelings the mind in the mind mental states in mental states but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with mental states'
He by allaying initial thought and discursive thought with the mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful
By the fading out of rapture he dwells with equanimity attentive and clearly conscious and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful' and he enters and abides in the third meditation
By getting rid of joy by getting rid of anguish by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness
Then with the mind composed thus quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge and recollection of former habitation he remembers a variety of former habitations thus one birth two births three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births and many an eon of integration and many an eon of disintegration and many an eon of integrationdisintegration 'Such a one was I by name having such a clan such and such a color so was I nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life end
Passing from this I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name having such and such a clan such and such a color so was I nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life end
Passing from this I arose here' Thus he remembers divers former habitations in all their modes and details
Then with the mind composed quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing hence and the arising of beings
With the purified devavision surpassing that of men he sees beings as they pass hence or come to be he comprehends that beings are mean excellent comely ugly wellgoing illgoing according to the consequence of their deeds the he thinks Indeed these worthy beings who were possessed of wrong conduct in body who were possessed of wrong conduct in speech who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought scoffers at the ariyans holding a wrong view incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a sorrowful state a bad bourn the abyss Niraya hell
But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body who were possessed of good conduct in speech who were possessed of good conduct in thought who did not scoff at the ariyans holding a right view incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a good bourn a heaven world
Then with the mind composed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers
He understands as it really is This is anguish this is the arising of anguish this is the stopping of anguish this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish
He understands as it really is These are the cankers this is the arising of the cankers this is the stopping of the cankers this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers
Knowing thus seeing thus his mind is freed from the canker of sense pleasures is freed from the canker of becoming freed from the canker of ignorance
In freedom the knowledge came to be I am freed and he comprehends Destroyed is birth brought to a close is the Brahmafaring done is what was to be done there is no more of being such or such
That monk is able to endure head cold hunger thirst the touch of mosquitoes gadflies wind sun and creeping things abusive language and unwelcome modes of speech he has grown to bear bodily feelings which as they arise are painful acute sharp severe wretched miserable deadly
Purged of all the dross and impurities of attachment aversion and confusion he is worthy of oblations offerings respect and homage an unsurpassed field of merit in the world
If Aggivessana a king's elephant dies in old age untamed untrained the king's old elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed And so Aggivessana of a king's elephant that is middleaged
And too Aggivessana if a king's elephant dies young untamed untrained the king's young elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed
Even so Aggivessana if a monk who is an elder dies with the cankers not destroyed the monk who is an elder that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed
And so of a monk of middle standing
And too Aggivessana if a newly ordained monk dies with the cankers not destroyed the newly ordained monk that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed
If Aggivessana a king's elephant dies in old age well tamed well trained the king's old elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed
And so Aggivessana of a king's elephant that is middleaged
And too Aggivessana if a king's elephant dies young well tamed well trained the king's young elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed
Even so Aggivessana if a monk who is an elder dies with the cankers destroyed the monk who is an elder that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed
And so Aggivessana of a monk of middle standing
And too Aggivessana if a newly ordained monk dies with cankers destroyed the newly ordained monk that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed
Thus spoke the Lord
Delighted the novice Aciravata rejoiced in what the Lord had said
 Verses of the Nun Dantika Psalms of the Sisters Translated by CAF
Rhys Davids
Monks these four goodly thoroughbred steeds are found existing in the world
What four
In this case monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which at the very sight of the shadow of the goadstick is stirred feels agitation 'What task I wonder will the trainer set me today
What return can I make him' Here monks we may have such a steed and this is the first sort of goodly thoroughbred steed found existing in the world
Then again monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which is not stirred at the mere sight of the goadstick's shadow feels no agitation but when his coat is pricked with the goad he is stirred feels agitation 'What task I wonder' This is the second sort
Then again monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which is not stirred at the sight of the goadstick's shade nor yet when his coat is pricked with the goad but when his flesh is pierced he is stirred he feels agitated 'What task I wonder' This is the third sort
Once more monks we may have a goodly thoroughbred steed which is stirred neither at the sight of the goadstick's shade nor when his coat is pricked nor yet when his flesh is pierced by the goadstick but when he is pierced to the very bone he is stirred feels agitation 'What task I wonder will the trainer set me today
What return can I make him' Here we have such a goodly thoroughbred steed This is the fourth sort
Thus monks there four goodly thoroughbred steeds are found existing in the world
Just in the same way monks these four goodly thoroughbred men are found existing in the world
What four
In this case monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred man who hears is said that in such and such a village or township is a woman or man afflicted or dead
Thereat he is stirred he feels agitation
Thus agitated he strictly applied himself
Thus applied he both realized in his own person the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom
Just as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on seeing the shadow of the goadstick is stirred feels agitation even so using this figure do I speak of this goodly thoroughbred man
Such in this case is the goodly thoroughbred man
This is the first sort
Again monks here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who does not hear it said that in such a village or township is a woman or a man afflicted or dead but with his own eyes beholds such
Thereupon he is stirred he feels agitation Just as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on having his coat pricked with the goad stirred even so using this figure do I speak of this goodly thoroughbred man Such in this case is This is the second sort
Then again monks here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who does not hear it said nor yet with his own eyes beholds a woman or a man afflicted or dead but his own kinsman or bloodrelation is afflicted or dead
Thereupon he is stirred just as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on having his flesh pierced is stirred even so using this figure do I speak of this goodly thoroughbred man Such in this case This is the third sort
Once more monks here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who neither hears it said nor yet with his own eyes beholds nor is his own kinsman or bloodrelation afflicted or dead but he himself is stricken with painful bodily feelings grievous sharp racking distracting discomforting that drain the life away
Thereat he is stirred he feels agitation
Being so stirred he strictly applied himself
Thus applied he both realizes in his own person the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom
Just as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on being pierced to the very bone is stirred feels agitation even so using this figure do I speak of this goodly thoroughbred man
Of such a sort monks is the goodly thoroughbred man in this case
This is the fourth sort
These monks are the four sorts of thoroughbreds among men found existing in the world
 From Gradual Sayings The Book of the Fours Translated by FWoodward

Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow so does the wise man straighten his mind which is fickle and unsteady and difficult to guard and difficult to restrain

Just as a fish taken out of its watery abode and cast on the land quivers and throbs so does the mind
should the realm of Passions be shunned

It is good to restrain the mind which is difficult to subdue and is swiftmoving and which seizes whatever it desires
A mind thus tamed brings happiness

Difficult to grasp and extremely subtle is the mind seizing on whatever it desires let the wise guard it
A guarded mind brings happiness

This mind wanders afar is solitary formless and rests in the cave
Those who subdue it are freed from the bonds of Mara

He whose mind is not steadfast and who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers the wisdom of such a man never becomes perfect

He whose mind remains untouched by lust and unaffected by hatred and who has discarded both good and evil for such a vigilant one there is no fear

Knowing this body to be as fragile as a clay pot and fortifying this mind like a wellfortified city let a man fight Mara with the sword of wisdom and let him guard his conquest and remain unattached

Ere long alas
will this body lie upon the earth unheeded and lifeless even as a useless log

Whatever an enemy may do to an enemy or a hater to a hater an illdirected mind would do one a greater injury

Neither mother nor father nor any other relative can do a person greater good than what his welldirected mind can do

 Dhammapada Citta Vagga 
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
After listening to the Buddha's Discourse called Fear and Dread the Brahman Jaanussoni becomes a lay follower of the Buddha by taking the Threefold Refuge
The words used by him differ slightly from the usual formula in so far as in the latter the words the Lord Gotama are replaced by the Buddha Buddhaghosa's comment here slightly abridged runs as follows
I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama
This means The Lord Gotama is my refuge and my guiding ideal
I am going for refuge to the Lord Gotama
I resort to him follow and honor him in the sense of his being the Destroyer of Affliction and the Provider of Weal
Or I know and understand him to be of such a nature
This last explanation is based upon the fact that in the Pali language the verbal roots denoting going may also have the meaning of knowing
Therefore the words I go for refuge to the Buddha may also be taken to express the idea I know and understand him to be the refuge
I go for refuge to the Dhamma The word dhamma ie the Doctrine or the Law is derived from the verb dhareti to keep or to bear
In accordance with that derivation the Dhamma may be regarded as refuge because it keeps upholds and supports the beings by way of preventing their fall into the states of woe by way of enabling a life according to instruction by way of attainment of the Path and by realization of the extinction
Accordingly the Dhamma is the Noble Path as well as Nibbana
Besides it is the attainment of the noble fruitions and also the Dhamma of Learning
I go for refuge to the Sangha The Sangha is the community of monks which is united by the communion of right view and virtue
That is to say the Sangha is the group of the eight noble beings the path of streamentry  the fruition thereof etc
In order to gain proficiency with regard to this subject of refuge one should be acquainted with the following method of exposition dealing with  the word sarana  the going for refuge  Who is going for refuge  the divisions  the results  the defilements  the breach
The going for refuge has two main divisions it may be mundane or supramundane
The supramundane refuge is taken by those who have a vision of the Noble Truth
In the pathmoment the supramundane refuge succeeds in exterminating any blemish that may still attach to the going for refuge
It has Nibbana as its object and in its function it comprises the entire Triple Gem
The mundane refuge is taken by worldlings
It succeeds in effecting a temporary repression of the blemishes attaching to their going for refuge
Its objects are the noble qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
It consists in the acquisition of faith in these three objects
It is this faith in the Triple Gem that is referred to when among the ten meritorious acts the straightening of views is defined as Right Understanding rooted in faith
This mundane refuge is of four kinds the surrender of self acceptance as one's guiding ideal acceptance of discipleship homage by prostration
The surrender of self is expressed as follows
From today onward I surrender myself to the Buddha to the Dhamma to the Sangha
Ajja aadim katvaa aham attaanam Buddhassa niyyaatemi Dhammassa Sanghassa'ti
This is the giving over of one's self to the Triple Gem
It may also be done in this way
To the Exalted One I am giving my self to the Dhamma I am giving my self to the Sangha I am giving my self
I am giving them my life
Given is my self given my life
Until my life ends I am taking refuge in the Buddha
The Buddha is my refuge my shelter and my protection
Bhagavato attaanam pariccajaami
Dhammassa Sanghassa attaanam pariccajaami jiivitañca pariccajaami
Pariccatto yeva me attaa pariccattam yeva me jiivitam
Jiivita pariyantikam Buddham saranam gacchaami
Buddho me saranam lenam taanan'ti
The acceptance of the guiding ideal
From today onward the Buddha is my Guiding Ideal the Dhamma and the Sangha
Thus may you know me
Ajja aadim katvaa aham Buddhaparaayano Dhammaparaayano Sanghaparaayano
Iti mam dhaaretha
It is illustrated by the following verse spoken by Alavaka
From village to village from town to town I'll wend my way lauding the Enlightened One and the perfection of His Law
Thus the acceptance of the guiding ideal by Alavaka and others has to be understood as equaling their going for refuge
The acceptance of discipleship
From today onward I am the Disciple of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
Thus may you know me
Ajja aadim katvaa aham Buddhassa antevaasiko Dhamassa Sanghassa
Iti mam dhaaretha
This is illustrated by the following passage expressing Kassapa's acceptance of discipleship that has to be understood as equaling his going for refuge
Fain would I see the Master The Exalted One him I would wish to see
Fain would I see the Blessed One
The Exalted One him would I wish to see
Fain would I see the Enlightened One
The Exalted One him I would wish to see
Then I prostrated myself before the Exalted One and addressed him thus The Exalted One O Lord is my Master and I am his disciple
Homage by prostration
From today onward I shall give respectful greeting devoted attendance the añjalisalutation and homage only to those three the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
Thus may you know me
Ajja aadim katvaa aham abhivaadanapaccutthaanaañjalikammasaamiicikammam Buddhaadiinam yeva tinnam vatthuunam karomi
Itii mam dhaaretha
This way of going for refuge consists in showing deep humility towards the Buddha Dhamma and the Sangha

Homage by prostration may be of four kinds being paid towards relatives out of fear towards one's teacher and towards those deserving highest veneration
Only the latter case  ie the prostration before those worthy of highest veneration  is to be regarded as going for refuge the three other cases do not count as such
Only if referring to the highest refuge is taken or broken respectively
Therefore if a member of the Sakya or Koliya clan worships the Buddha thinking He is our relative no refuge is taken in that case
Or one may think The recluse Gotama is honored by kings and has great influence
If he is not worshipped he might do me harm If thinking thus one worships out of fear no refuge is taken in that case
Furthermore a person remembers to have learned something from the Blessed One while he was a Bodhisatta an aspirant to Buddhahood or after his attaining Buddhahood one has received from the Master advice relating to worldly knowledge
If for these reasons one regards the Buddha as one's teacher and worships him no refuge is taken in that case too
But if one pays worship to the Buddha in the conviction This is the most venerable being in the world only by such a one is refuge taken
On the other hand the going for refuge remains unbroken in the following situations
A male or female lay devotee who has taken refuge in the Triple Gem worships a relative thinking He is my kinsman Even if that relative is a recluse of another faith the refuge in the Triple Gem is unbroken still less can it be said to be broken if it is not a recluse or a priest
When prostrating before a king out of fear If he who is honored by the whole country is not worshipped he will do me harm  in that case too the refuge is unbroken
If one has learned any science art or craft even from a nonBuddhist and one worships him in his capacity as one's teacher in that case too the refuge remains unbroken
Results
The fruit of the supramundane refuge in the sense of being its karmic result is the four fruitions of monkhood viz
the fruition of streamentry etc
The fruit in the sense of advantage or blessing is the destruction of suffering further the blessings mentioned in the following scriptural passage
It is impossible O monks that a person endowed with insight should regard any conditioned thing as permanent enjoyable or an ego that he should take the life of his mother his father or a saint that with a thought of hate he should shed the blood of the Blessed One that he should cause a split in the community of monks that he should choose another teacher
There is no possibility of that
But the fruit of the mundane refuge is only the attainment of favorable rebirth and the attainment of property and enjoyment
Defilements
In three cases the mundane refuge is defiled and without great brightness and radiating influence if connected with ignorance doubt and wrong views
The supramundane refuge is free from any defilements
A breach of the mundane refuge might be blameable or blameless
It is blameable when occurring as a going for refuge by selfsurrender etc to other religious masters in that case the breach will have undesirable results
The breach is blameless at the time of death as it will not cause any karmic result
The supramundane refuge is without breach
Even in another existence a holy disciple will not turn to another master
In all Buddhist lands the followers of the Enlightened One profess their allegiance to him and his liberating doctrine by the ancient simple and yet so touching formula of taking refuge or more literal and more expressive by going for refuge to the Triple Gem
The going for refuge as this figurative expression itself suggests should be a conscious act not the mere profession of a theoretical belief still less the habitual rite of traditional piety
The protecting refuge exists but we have to go to it by our own effort
It will not come to us by itself while we stay put
The Buddha as He repeatedly declared is only the teacher pointing out the Way
Therefore the going for refuge expressive of Buddhist faith is in the first place a conscious act of will and determination directed towards the goal of liberation
Hereby the conception of faith as a mere passive waiting for saving grace is rejected
In the Commentary translated above there is the remarkable statement that the expression going for refuge is meant to convey in addition the idea of knowing and understanding This points to the second aspect of going for refuge namely as a conscious act of understanding
Hereby unthinking credulity and blind faith based on external authority are rejected
The commentator emphasizes this aspect by describing the going for refuge as a state of mind not relying on others
On many occasions the Master warned his disciples not to accept his teachings out of mere trust in him but only after personal experience practice and reflection
Here it may suffice to remember the famous Sermon to the Kalamas
Do not go by hearsay nor by tradition nor by people's tales nor by the authority of Scriptures
Do not go by reasoning nor by logic and methodical investigations nor by approval of speculative views nor moved by reverence nor by the thought 'The Recluse is my teacher'
It is a threefold knowledge that is or should be implied in the act of going for refuge
It is a knowledge answering the following questions Is this world of ours really such a place of danger and misery that there is a need for taking refuge
Does such a refuge actually exist
And what is its nature
There are many who do not see any need for a refuge
Being well pleased with themselves and with the petty momentary happiness of their life they are fully convinced that all is well with the world They do not wish or are not able to look beyond their narrow horizon
For them neither the Buddha nor any other great religious teacher has yet appeared
But the majority of men know very well by their own bitter experience the hard and cruel face of the world which is only temporarily hidden by a friendly mask
There are some others who sufficiently aware of a fellow being's actual existence add to that personal experience by observation of other lives
And there is a still smaller number of people who are able to reflect wisely on both experience and observation
Particularly to those latter ones whose eyes are less covered by dust life will appear as a vast ocean of suffering of unfathomable depth on the surface of which beings swim about for a little while or navigate in their fragile nutshells of which they are very proud
True there are spells of calm on the waters when it is pleasant to float upon a smooth sea or to prove and to enjoy the strength of one's body by a long swim
But those with open eyes and minds are not deceived by these short moments of respite they know the overpowering fierceness of a stormswept sea they know the dangerous currents and whirlpools in it and the demons and monsters of the deep
They know that even under the most favorable conditions the feeble strength of man will soon be exhausted by the impact of life's elemental forces
The vicissitudes of life give no chance of maintaining permanently during the unlimited sequence of transformations even the lowest degree of happiness even the lowest standard of moral worth
There is nothing to gain by traversing ever anew the infinite expanse of life's ocean in any of its regions
There is only the same senseless repetition of the ups and downs of ebb and tide
Faced by the everpresent perils of life and by its essential monotony there will be only the one cry for refuge in a heart and mind that has truly grasped its situation within the world
A refuge is the one great need of all life and going to it the one sane act demanded by that situation
But granting its necessity does a refuge from the world's ills actually exist
The Buddhist affirms it and proves by that affirmation to be anything but a pessimist
The refuge to which he turns his steps is the triad of the Buddha his Doctrine and the Fraternity of holy disciples
Being what is most precious and most pure it has been called The Triple Gem But the fact that it provides the final refuge and not only a temporary shelter cannot otherwise be proved than through the actual attainment of that refuge by those who are going to it
The Triple Gem has objective existence as an impersonal idea or ideal as long as it is known and cherished
In so far it is doubtlessly a still persisting and active source of energy for the world
But it is transformed from an impersonal idea to a personal refuge only to the extent of its being realized in one's own mind and manifested in one's own life
Therefore the existence of the Triple Gem in its characteristic nature as a refuge cannot be proven to others than those who find this refuge in themselves by their own efforts
The refuge becomes and grows by the process of going to it
The refuge exists for us only in so far as something within ourselves responds and corresponds to it
Therefore the Sixth Zen Patriarch said
Let each of us take refuge to the Triple Gems within our mind
With regard to the first refuge in the Buddha the Master himself said shortly after His Enlightenment
 MN Ariyapariyesanasutta
Concerning the second refuge in the Dhamma the Buddha said shortly before his decease
Be ye islands unto yourselves be ye a refuge unto yourselves
Take no other refuge
The Dhamma be your island the Dhamma be your refuge Take no other refuge
 DN Mahaparinibbanasutta
In the commentarial literature it is said
The Dhamma is called self because in the case of a wise one the Dhamma is not different from himself and because it pertains to his personal existence
 Tika to MahaSatipatthanaSutta
The third refuge the Sangha being the community of holy disciples is the great and inspiring model for emulation
The actual foundation of that refuge is the capacity inherent in all beings to become one of the eight noble beings who form the Sangha of the refuge
We turn now to the third subject of the knowledge implied in taking refuge ie to the ultimate nature of the threefold refuge
We have seen that the refuge becomes attainable and even perceptible only by way of the living roots by the actual foundations it has within the average mind
Like the lotus it arises within the waters of worldly existence there it develops and from there it takes its nourishment
But what is still immersed in the ocean of worldliness and suffering cannot be the ultimate refuge the place of safety and bliss
It must not only assuage but finally transcend the world of danger fear and ill like the lotus that rises above the surface of the water and remains unsullied by it
Therefore the consummate refuge meant in the traditional formula is of supramundane nature  lokuttara ie worldtranscending
Consequently the first refuge is not the recluse Gotama but the Buddha as the personification of worldtranscending enlightenment
In the Vimamsaka Sutta it is said of the Noble Disciple He believes in the Enlightenment of the Exalted One
The Dhamma of the second refuge is not the faint fragmentary or even distorted picture of the Doctrine as mirrored in the mind of an unliberated worldling
It is the supramundane Eightfold Path and its consummation in Nibbana
The commentator underlines the supramundane nature of the second refuge by saying that the Dhamma as an object of learning is only in so far included in the refuge as it arises in the Holy Disciple together with the fruition of streamentry etc ie only in so far as it is a formulation of that consummate knowledge acquired on the four stages of sanctity
The Sangha of the third refuge is not the allinclusive congregation of monks having all the weaknesses of its single members and sharing in the shortcomings attaching to any human institution
It is rather the fraternity of holy disciples not necessarily monks who are united by the invisible tie of common attainment to the four stages of sanctity
In other words it is likewise of supramundane nature
It is the assurance of possible progress to the worldtranscending heights of a mind made holy and pure
By this threefold knowledge about the need existence and nature of the refuge the Going to that refuge becomes a conscious act of understanding
This knowledge and understanding forms the firm basis of the third the emotional aspect of taking refuge having as it were three facets confidence devotion and love
The knowledge of the existence of a refuge provides the basis for a firm and justified confidence for the calmness of inner assurance and the strength of conviction
The knowledge of the need for a refuge instills unswerving devotion to it and the understanding of its sublime nature fills the heart with love towards the highest that can be conceived
Confidence is the firmness in faith devotion is the patient endurance in loyal service and effort and love adds the element of ardor warmth and joy
In the sense of these three constituents the going for refuge is also a conscious act of wise faith
We may now define the going for refuge as a conscious act of will directed towards liberation based upon knowledge and inspired by faith or briefly a conscious act of determination understanding and devotion
These three aspects of taking refuge have their counterparts in the volitional rational and emotional sides of the human mind
Therefore for a harmonious development of character the cultivation of all three is required
Will understanding and faith support each other in their common task will transformed into purposive action frees faith from the barrenness and dangers of emotional selfindulgence it prevents intellectual understanding from stopping short at mere theoretical appreciation
Will harnesses the energies of both emotion and intellect to actual application
Understanding gives direction and method to will it provides a check to the exuberance of faith and gives to it its true contents
Faith keeps will from slackening and is the vitalizing and purposive factor in intellectual understanding
The presence of these three aspects is the distinguishing feature of true Buddhist faith
In the conception of faith as found in all other world religions only the emotional aspect is stressed
The two other aspects will and understanding are absent or in an undeveloped state being impeded by the dictates of the creed
The element of selfresponsible will is supplanted by the postulate of obedience by authoritarian guidance and by submission to the will of a God
Understanding is replaced by dogmatic belief demanding or implying a sacrifice of intellect
Against such a onesided emphasis on emotional faith Buddhism moves from the very beginning of its spiritual training towards wholeness and completeness ie towards a harmonious development of mental faculties
Therefore the act of going for refuge in its true sense is accomplished only if there is connected with it at least a minimal degree of purposeful will and genuine understanding
Only in that case faith will have the quality of a seed attributed to it by the Buddha ie of a seed productive of further growth
The element of will in that seed of faith will grow until maturing into the irrepressible desire for liberation which is one of the advanced stages of Insight
The element of initial understanding in true faith will grow into penetrative wisdom that will finally transform the assurance of faith into the inner certitude conferred by realization
Taking refuge by way of thoughtless recital of the formula is a degradation of that venerable ancient practice
It deprives it of its true significance and of its efficacy
Going for refuge should be the expression of a genuine inner urge in the same way as in ordinary life one may be urged by the awareness of a great danger to seek without delay the refuge of a place of safety
When taking refuge one should always keep in mind the implications of this act as outlined above
This will be at the same time a beneficial training in right mindfulness
One should always ask oneself how the presently undertaken act of going for refuge could be translated into terms of will and understanding
Seeing that the house of our life is ablaze it will not do merely to worship the safety and freedom that beckons outside without making an actual move to reach it
The first step in that direction of safety and freedom is taking refuge in the right way ie as a conscious act of determination understanding and devotion
In the commentarial passage translated above a precious document of ancient Buddhist practice is preserved showing the thoughtful and discriminating way in which the devotees of old took refuge in the Triple Gem
Four different formulas are mentioned given in what seems to be a descending order beginning from the highest form the complete selfsurrender and ending with the lowest the homage by prostration
It is greatly to be regretted that the information we can derive from the commentarial passage in which these formulas are embedded is rather scanty
Many questions that come to mind are left unanswered as for instance Have these four formulas been used instead of the traditional one or in addition to it
By whom and on which occasions have the three lower kinds been used
Have they been administered to the devotees in a similar fashion as it is done today in the case of the traditional formula
Those three lower kinds namely have in common the last sentence being a call to witness Thus may you know me
Does the plural form used in the Pali sentence refer to an assembly of devotees that witnessed the act or what seems to be more probable was it merely a respectful way of addressing the spiritual teacher or the monk who may have administered that special formula of refuge perhaps as a kind of initiation
In any case the concluding call to witness gives to those utterances a strong emphasis and the solemnity of a vow distinguishing it from the general formula of refuge
The commencing words too are stressing that character of a definite and personal dedication as distinguished from an impersonal ritual
They mark the day of the first utterance as initiating a new period in the life of the devotee
Both the beginning and the end of these three modes of refuge are an echo of the earliest formulas of conversion reported in the Suttas I take refuge in the Lord Gotama the doctrine and the community of monks
May the Lord Gotama know of me as an upasaka
From today as long as life lasts I have taken refuge 
The commentator explains the three lower modes of refuge merely by reference to scriptural passages which do not enlighten us very much
From this fact we may conclude that in Buddhaghosa's time and environment those modes of refuge were no longer a living practice but only a reminiscence for which explanation had to be sought in literature
Otherwise the commentator would certainly have dealt with them in greater detail and probably illustrated them by some stories which he is usually so fond of relating
The fourth and highest mode of refuge has obviously been more familiar at that time and was probably still in use by those undergoing strenuous meditative practice as evinced by a passage in the Visuddhimagga which we shall quote later
But despite the lack of authentic information the following facts become sufficiently clear from the formulae themselves
The ancient devotees who coined and used them have been obviously very sensitive as to the deep significance of that act of going for refuge perceiving it as a most momentous step decisive for life
By making a fourfold distinction demanding a definite and personal choice they made provision for saving the performance of that act from becoming a soulless habit
The ancient devotees knew well the implication of that apparently simple act and have been aware of the sacred responsibilities resulting from it
They knew that taking refuge is actually consummated only by a complete selfsurrender to the Triple Gem without any reservations
In the lesser modes of the act there is still something of the presumed self that is kept back it is a going for refuge with reservations
Nevertheless these lesser modes too are definite steps towards the Highest and should be consciously cultivated
As in any harmonious mental development here too the higher level will not exclude the lower one but absorb it into its wider compass
In trying to obtain a clearer picture of those four modes we shall therefore start not from the highest but from the lowest level
Homage is the mental attitude and the bodily and verbal expression of reverence resulting from the recognition and appreciation of something higher than oneself
It breaks through the first and hardest shell of pride and selfcontented ignorance that knows of nothing better than one's own petty self
When encountering something higher animals and undeveloped men  primitive or civilized  will mostly react by distrust fear flight attack resentment hostility persecution etc because they can view that higher form of life only as something different alien and therefore suspect
It is the sign of a truly developed human mind that it meets the higher with due respect with admiration and the wish to emulate
Recognition and appreciation of something higher is therefore the preliminary condition of spiritual growth and true respect resulting from it forms the basis of moral education too
Kungfutse names respect as the first of qualities of human heartedness
Therefore in man's relation to the Highest ie the Triple Gem true homage comes first
As a way of taking refuge homage is the spontaneous expression of the deep emotion felt when becoming aware of the existence and significance of the supreme refuge
It is the emotional reaction in gratitude veneration and joy when feeling the full weight of the tremendous fact that there is actually a refuge from this universe of suffering
Therefore the commentator's illustration of this mode of taking refuge is not the habitual act of worship by confirmed devotees but the highly emotional conversion of an aged brahman who deeply stirred prostrates himself before the Exalted One embracing and kissing his feet
Homage represents the emotional side of taking refuge being its aspect as a conscious act of faith
Through its singleheartedness and humility the act of doing homage by body speech and mind prepares the disciple emotionally for complete selfsurrender
It is an indispensable step to it but being deficient with regard to understanding and determination it requires the supplementation by the following two stages
While homage is still a distant and onesided relationship to the Supreme the devotee still being in the outer court of the sanctuary the acceptance of discipleship is a direct approach to it
Through the process of learning a mutual relationship is established or we may even say a gradual and partial identification of teacher teaching and pupil takes place
Here the mind of the disciple goes for refuge to supreme wisdom and becomes gradually permeated by it
Through respect and humility acquired by true homage the disciple has earned for himself the right of entry into the sanctuary of wisdom
Only if approached in that attitude of respect and humility the guru the spiritual teacher of the East will impart his knowledge as these qualities are the first indication that the disciple is ready to receive
If refuge is taken in the sense of discipleship life becomes a constant act of learning ie of adapting the mind to the standards set by the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
It is the character of the wise man that he is always willing and anxious to learn
The acceptance of discipleship represents the rational side of taking refuge which is here a conscious act of understanding
It supplies the full and satisfying reasons for the act of homage and adds in that way to the strength and loyalty of devotion
But man is not always devotee or learner
There remains much in life that cannot be mastered easily by faith and understanding alone
It requires a strong will and determination as well as the skill of long experience to change the course of the manifold habitual activities of life into the direction of the refuge
This task of making the refuge gradually the center of one's life is performed by the third mode of taking refuge
In accepting the Triple Gem as his guiding ideal the disciple pledges himself to subordinate gradually all the essential activities of his life to the ideals embodied in the Triple Gem
He vows to give all his strength to the task of impressing this sacred threefold seal upon his personal life and upon his environment too as far as he is able to overcome its resistance
The threefold refuge in its aspect as the guiding ideal or as the determining factor of life calls for complete dedication in the sphere of external activities
This at least is what we tentatively suggest as the meaning of this third variety of taking refuge called in Pali tapparayanata
In putting forward this suggestion we followed the trend of our previous thoughts about the three constituents of Buddhist faith and we took up in addition the hint given in the illustrative passage quoted by the commentary in this connection
The canonical text to which that quotation belongs tells of two deities who after their conversion vow to go through the world as divine missionaries of the Dhamma
This example given by the commentary may be taken as representative of the general task of establishing the sovereignty if the Triple Gem in one's own and in others' hearts
But this dedication to the service of the Triple Gem is still not the highest form of taking refuge to which the disciple should aspire
Still there exists in the disciple's mind a difference between the noble objective and the person working for it
The delusive ego has been retained it rejoices at the success of the work and grieves when it fails
In a subtle way the work instead of the Triple Gem becomes the refuge
If identification of self and work is not complete the ego as it were hides in the work and evades the call for full surrender to the true refuge
Progress beyond this step is possible only if the service of the guiding ideal is done in a highly detached way without looking for any reward
This detached attitude towards work will be one of the many fruits of complete selfsurrender to the Triple Gem
This last and highest form of refuge taken by the worldling is without reservations
If true understanding has told us before that nothing can be gained in samsara then consequently nothing can be lost by the surrender of self
Though this surrender of self is only the surrender of a delusion it is a very hard sacrifice as all of us know
But if ever we wish to be free of the bonds of samsara this selfsurrender has to be done at one time or another and therefore it may as well be done today as tomorrow
The highest prize is won only by the highest stake by the sacrifice of that illusive self that has assumed so much power that it requires the highest effort to break it
In taking refuge by way of selfsurrender the disciple in his modest way will follow the example of the Exalted One who in his last great struggle before Enlightenment addressed his inner opponent personified as Mara with the following words It's Muñja grass I wear
Shame be on life
Fain in the battle I would die than to live further as a vanquished one
The Muñja grass was the crest of those ancient Indian warriors who entered battle with the vow to do or to die It should be the symbol of the spiritual warrior too
If any reservations regrets or reluctances are retained there will be merely a halfhearted attempt instead of a singleminded effort which alone can bring victory
If the grave step of taking refuge by selfsurrender has once been taken a feeling of lightness unconcernedness and fearlessness will enter the heart of the disciple
A self that has been renounced cannot and need not have any fear for a life that has been surrendered and that is kept now only on trust for the definite purpose of being used for the highest realization
Therefore in the early days of the Dhamma those of determined mind who entered the field of spiritual action  ie who took up a subject of meditation to be cultivated up to sainthood  they used to start their work by taking the vow of selfsurrender as advised by the following passage of the Visuddhi Magga
Having approached his noble friend the meditator should first surrender himself to the Buddha the Exalted One or to his teacher and then possessed of a strong desire and a high resolve he should ask for the subject of meditation
His surrender of self to the Buddha should be as follows 'This personal existence of mine I offer to thee O Exalted One'
Because one who without such a surrender of self lives in lonely places will be unable to stand firm against fearful objects that approach him
He might return to the village and associated with lay folk might take up a search that is wrongful and come to distress
But to one who has surrendered his self no fear arises even when approached by fearful objects
Only gladness will arise in him when he reflects 'Hast thou not O wise man on that earlier day surrendered thyself to the Buddha'
And again in surrendering himself to his teacher he should say 'This personal existence of mine reverend sir I offer to thee' Because without such a surrender of self he will be unruly stubborn unwilling to accept advice he will go about at his own will without asking the teacher's leave
And the teacher will favor him neither with material nor with spiritual help and will not instruct him in difficult books
Not receiving this twofold favor he will become unvirtuous or return to lay life
This way of taking refuge by selfsurrender is of course still far from the complete abolishing of egotism and selfdelusion but it is a powerful means to that end
It may mark the transition from the worldly or mundane refuge to which it still belongs to the supramundane refuge at which it aims
The formulae of selfsurrender as given in our commentarial text differ even in their external form from the three lesser modes of refuge in so far as they lack that concluding call to witness characteristic of the other modes
From that we may conclude that this gravest of all vows was to be taken in the secrecy of one's heart as befits the sacredness of that resolve
Here the presence of a witness as a kind of moral support for keeping the vow should no more be required such a requirement would only prove that it is premature to take this step
Any publicity to it would only detract from the supreme dignity of the vow and would render its observance more difficult by making the disciple too selfconscious or even proud
Needless to say a deliberate parading of the vow would defeat its very purpose by reinstating the self that was to be surrendered
The longer formula of selfsurrender enlarging upon the short sentence in the Visuddhimagga has been rendered here into a Western language for the first time and also its Pali original seems to have evoked little attention in our day
If we reproduce that formula here we do it in the hope that it will be received with the reverence due to that precious document of ancient devotion hallowed by the efforts and achievements of those who may have practiced in accordance with it
We add the earnest request not to make use of it lightly for the purpose of ordinary devotion and not to take the vow rashly on the spur of a moment's enthusiasm
This solemn pledge should be taken only after having tested one's strength and perseverance for a long time by minor observances and renunciations
We should beware of making those highest things of the spirit cheap and common by approaching them in too facile a way by talking too glibly about them or by taking them into our hands and dropping them again when interest fades or our feeble fingers get tired
Therefore if we are not sure of our strength we should not take upon ourselves the severe demands of Selfsurrender but take our refuge by way of those lesser modes
For these will likewise prove to be powerful helpers to high spiritual achievements
In making an actual and intelligent use of that fourfold devotional Road of the Ancients we shall preserve the most popular religious practice in the Buddhist world the going for refuge from becoming stale and ineffective
We shall be able to turn it into a strong lifegiving current of devotion that will carry us one day to the Isle of Final Peace to Nibbana where the refugee and refuge are merged into one
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose

Unshakable deliverance of the mind is the highest goal in the Buddha's doctrine
Here deliverance means the freeing of the mind from all limitations fetters and bonds that tie it to the Wheel of Suffering to the Circle of Rebirth
It means the cleansing of the mind of all defilements that mar its purity the removing of all obstacles that bar its progress from the mundane to the supramundane consciousness that is to Arahatship
Many are the obstacles which block the road to spiritual progress but there are five in particular which under the name of hindrances are often mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures
They are called hindrances because they hinder and envelop the mind in many ways obstructing its development
According to the Buddhist teachings spiritual development is twofold through tranquillity and through insight
Tranquillity is gained by complete concentration of the mind during the meditative absorptions
For achieving these absorptions the overcoming of the five hindrances at least temporarily is a preliminary condition
It is especially in the context of achieving the absorptions that the Buddha often mentions the five hindrances in his discourses
There are five mental constituents which are chiefly representative of the first meditative absorption and are therefore called the factors of absorption
For each of these there is according to Buddhist commentarial tradition one of the five hindrances that is specifically harmful for it and excludes its higher development and refinement to the degree required for jhana and on the other hand the cultivation of these five factors beyond their average level will be an antidote against the hindrances preparing the road to jhana
The relationship between these two groups of five is indicated in this anthology under the heading of the respective hindrance
Not only the meditative absorptions but also lesser degrees of mental concentration are impeded by these five hindrances
So is the neighborhood concentration being the preliminary stage for the fully absorbed concentration reached in jhana
Likewise excluded by the presence of the hindrances is the momentary concentration which has the strength of neighborhood concentration and is required for mature insight
But apart from these higher stages of mental development any earnest attempt at clear thinking and pure living will be seriously affected by the presence of these five hindrances
This widespread harmful influence of the five hindrances shows the urgent necessity of breaking down their power by constant effort
One should not believe it sufficient to turn one's attention to the hindrances only at the moment when one sits down for meditation
Such lastminute effort in suppressing the hindrances will rarely be successful unless helped by previous endeavor during one's ordinary life
One who earnestly aspires to the unshakable deliverance of the mind should therefore select a definite workingground of a direct and practical import a kammatthana in its widest sense on which the structure of his entire life should be based
Holding fast to that workingground never losing sight of it for long even this alone will be a considerable and encouraging progress in the control and development of the mind because in that way the directive and purposive energies of mind will be strengthened considerably
One who has chosen the conquest of the five hindrances for a workingground should examine which of the five are strongest in one's personal case
Then one should carefully observe how and on which occasions they usually appear
One should further know the positive forces within one's own mind by which each of these hindrances can best be countered and finally conquered and one should also examine one's life for any opportunity of developing these qualities which in the following pages have been indicated under the headings of the spiritual faculties the factors of absorption and the factors of enlightenment
In some cases subjects of meditation have been added which will be helpful in overcoming the respective hindrances
By the worldling however only a temporary suspension and partial weakening of the hindrances can be attained
Their final and complete eradication takes place on the stages of sanctity
Hence the reward of the fight against the hindrances is not only the limited one of making possible a shorter or longer spell of meditation but every step in weakening these hindrances takes us nearer to the stages of sanctity where deliverance from these hindrances is unshakable
Though most of the following texts translated from the Discourses of the Buddha and the commentaries are addressed to monks they are likewise valid for those living the worldly life
As the Old Masters say The monk is mentioned here as an example of those dedicated to the practice of the Teaching
Whosoever undertakes that practice is here included in the term 'monk' 
There are five impediments and hindrances overgrowths of the mind that stultify insight
What five
Sensual desire is an impediment and hindrance an overgrowth of the mind that stultifies insight
Illwill Sloth and torpor Restlessness and remorse Sceptical doubt are impediments and hindrances overgrowths of the mind that stultify insight
Without having overcome these five it is impossible for a monk whose insight thus lacks strength and power to know his own true good the good of others and the good of both nor will he be capable of realizing that superhuman state of distinctive achievement the knowledge and vision enabling the attainment of sanctity
But if a monk has overcome these five impediments and hindrances these overgrowths of the mind that stultify insight then it is possible that with his strong insight he can know his own true good the good of others and the good of both and he will be capable of realizing that superhuman state of distinctive achievement the knowledge and vision enabling the attainment of sanctity
One whose heart is overwhelmed by unrestrained covetousness will do what he should not do and neglect what he ought to do
And through that his good name and his happiness will come to ruin
One whose heart is overwhelmed by illwill by sloth and torpor by restlessness and remorse by sceptical doubt will do what he should not do and neglect what he ought to do
And through that his good name and his happiness will come to ruin
But if a noble disciple has seen these five as defilements of the mind he will give them up
And doing so he is regarded as one of great wisdom of abundant wisdom clearvisioned well endowed with wisdom
This is called endowment with wisdom
There are five impurities of gold impaired by which it is not pliant and wieldy lacks radiance is brittle and cannot be wrought well
What are these five impurities
Iron copper tin lead and silver
But if the gold has been freed from these five impurities then it will be plaint and wieldy radiant and firm and can be wrought well
Whatever ornaments one wishes to make from it be it a diadem earrings a necklace or a golden chain it will serve that purpose
Similarly there are five impurities of the mind impaired by which the mind is not pliant and wieldy lacks radiant lucidity and firmness and cannot concentrate well upon the eradication of the taints
What are these five impurities
They are sensual desire illwill sloth and torpor restlessness and remorse and sceptical doubt
But if the mind is freed of these five impurities it will be pliant and wieldy will have radiant lucidity and firmness and will concentrate well upon the eradication of the taints
Whatever state realizable by the higher mental faculties one may direct the mind to one will in each case acquire the capacity of realization if the conditions are fulfilled
How does a monk practice mindobject contemplation on the mental objects of the five hindrances
Herein monks when sensual desire is present in him the monk knows There is sensual desire in me or when sensual desire is absent he knows There is no sensual desire in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen sensual desire comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen sensual desire comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected sensual desire comes to be
When illwill is present in him the monk knows There is illwill in me or when illwill is absent he knows There is no illwill in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen illwill comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen illwill comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected illwill comes to be
When sloth and torpor are present in him the monk knows There is sloth and torpor in me or when sloth and torpor are absent he knows There is no sloth and torpor in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen sloth and torpor comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen sloth and torpor comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected sloth and torpor comes to be
When restlessness and remorse are present in him the monk knows There are restlessness and remorse in me or when agitation and remorse are absent he knows There are no restlessness and remorse in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen restlessness and remorse comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen restlessness and remorse comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected restlessness and remorse comes to be
When sceptical doubt is present in him the monk knows There is sceptical doubt in me or when sceptical doubt is absent he knows There is no sceptical doubt in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen sceptical doubt comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen sceptical doubt comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected sceptical doubt comes to be
To note mindfully and immediately the arising of one of the hindrances as recommended in the preceding text is a simple but very effective method of countering these and any other defilements of the mind
By doing so a brake is applied against the uninhibited continuance of unwholesome thoughts and the watchfulness of mind against their recurrence is strengthened
This method is based on a simple psychological fact which is expressed by the commentators as follows A good and an evil thought cannot occur in combination
Therefore at the time of knowing the sense desire that sense desire no longer exists
Just as monks this body lives on nourishment lives dependent on nourishment does not live without nourishment  in the same way monks the five hindrances live on nourishment depend on nourishment do not live without nourishment
There are beautiful objects frequently giving unwise attention to them  this is the nourishment for the arising of sensual desire that has not arisen and the nourishment for the increase and strengthening of sensual desire that has already arisen
There are impure objects frequently giving wise attention to them  this is the denourishing of the arising of sensual desire that has not yet arisen and the denourishing of the increase and strengthening of sensual desire that has already arisen
Six things are conducive to the abandonment of sensual desire
 Commentary to the Satipatthana Sutta
In him who is devoted to the meditation about impure objects repulsion towards beautiful objects is firmly established
This is the result
Impure object refers in particular to the cemetery meditations as given in the Satipatthana Sutta and explained in the Visuddhimagga but it refers also to the repulsive aspects of sense objects in general
Herein monks a monk reflects on just this body confined within the skin and full of manifold impurities from the soles upward and from the top of the hair down There is in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines bowels stomach excrement bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears lymph saliva mucus fluid of the joints urine
 Sutta Nipata v
Sense objects give little enjoyment but much pain and much despair the danger in them prevails
The unpleasant overwhelms a thoughtless man in the guise of the pleasant the disagreeable overwhelms him in the guise of the agreeable the painful in the guise of pleasure
How does one guard the sense doors
Herein a monk having seen a form does not seize upon its appearance as a whole nor on its details
If his sense of sight were uncontrolled covetousness grief and other evil unwholesome states would flow into him
Therefore he practices for the sake of its control he watches over the sense of sight he enters upon its control
Having heard a sound smelt an odor tasted a taste felt a touch cognized a mental object he does not seize upon its appearance as a whole he enters upon its control
There are forms perceptible by the eye which are desirable lovely pleasing agreeable associated with desire arousing lust
If the monk does not delight in them is not attached to them does not welcome them then in him thus not delighting in them not being attached to them and not welcoming them delight ceases if delight is absent there is no bondage
There are sounds perceptible by the ear odors perceptible by the mind if delight is absent there is no bondage
How is he moderate in eating
Herein a monk takes his food after wise consideration not for the purpose of enjoyment of pride of beautifying the body or adorning it but only for the sake of maintaining and sustaining this body to avoid harm and to support the holy life thinking Thus I shall destroy the old painful feeling and shall not let a new one rise
Long life will be mine blamelessness and wellbeing

Reference is here in particular to such friends who have experience and can be a model and help in overcoming sensual desire especially in meditating on impurity
But it applies also to noble friendship in general
The same twofold explanation holds true also for the other hindrances with due alterations
The entire holy life Ananda is noble friendship noble companionship noble association
Of a monk Ananda who has a noble friend a noble companion a noble associate it is to be expected that he will cultivate and practice the Noble Eightfold Path
Reference is here in particular to conversation about the overcoming of sensual desire especially about meditating on impurity
But it applies also to every conversation which is suitable to advance one's progress on the path
With due alterations this explanation holds true also for the other hindrances
If the mind of a monk is bent on speaking he Talk which is low coarse worldly not noble not salutary not leading to detachment not to freedom from passion not to cessation not to tranquillity not to higher knowledge not to enlightenment not to Nibbana namely talk about kings robbers and ministers talk about armies dangers and war about food and drink clothes couches garlands perfumes relatives cars villages towns cities and provinces about women and wine gossip of the street and of the well talk about the ancestors about various trifles tales about the origin of the world and the ocean talk about what happened and what did not happen  such and similar talk I shall not entertain Thus he is clearly conscious about it
But talk about austere life talk suitable for the unfolding of the mind talk which is conducive to complete detachment to freedom from passion to cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment and to Nibbana namely talk about a life of frugality about contentedness solitude aloofness from society about rousing one's energy talk about virtue concentration wisdom deliverance about the vision and knowledge of deliverance  such talk I shall entertain Thus he is clearly conscious about it
These things too are helpful in conquering sensual desire
If there is water in a pot mixed with red yellow blue or orange color a man with a normal faculty of sight looking into it could not properly recognize and see the image of his own face
In the same way when one's mind is possessed by sensual desire overpowered by sensual desire one cannot properly see the escape from sensual desire which has arisen then one does not properly understand and see one's own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into one's mind not to speak of those not memorized
There are objects causing aversion frequently giving unwise attention to them  this is the nourishment for the arising of illwill that has not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of illwill that has already arisen
There is the liberation of the heart by lovingkindness frequently giving wise attention to it  this is the denourishing of the arising of illwill that has not yet arisen and the decrease and weakening of illwill that has already arisen
Cultivate the meditation on lovingkindness
For by cultivating the meditation on lovingkindness illwill disappears
Cultivate the meditation on compassion
For by cultivating the meditation on compassion cruelty disappears
Cultivate the meditation on sympathetic joy
For by cultivating the meditation on sympathetic joy listlessness disappears
Cultivate the meditation on equanimity
For by cultivating the meditation on equanimity anger disappears
Six things are helpful in conquering illwill
Thus one should consider Being angry with another person what can you do to him
Can you destroy his virtue and his other good qualities
Have you not come to your present state by your own actions and will also go hence according to your own actions
Anger towards another is just as if someone wishing to hit another person takes hold of glowing coals or a heated ironrod or of excrement
And in the same way if the other person is angry with you what can he do to you
Can he destroy your virtue and your other good qualities
He too has come to his present state by his own actions and will go hence according to his own actions
Like an unaccepted gift or like a handful of dirt thrown against the wind his anger will fall back on his own head
 Commentary to Satipatthana Sutta
These things too are helpful in conquering illwill
If there is a pot of water heated on the fire the water seething and boiling a man with a normal faculty of sight looking into it could not properly recognize and see the image of his own face
In the same way when one's mind is possessed by illwill overpowered by illwill one cannot properly see the escape from the illwill which has arisen then one does not properly understand and see one's own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into one's mind not to speak of those not memorized
There arises listlessness lassitude lazy stretching of the body drowsiness after meals mental sluggishness frequently giving unwise attention to it  this is the nourishment for the arising of sloth and torpor that have not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of sloth and torpor that have already arisen
There is the element of rousing one's energy the element of exertion the element of continuous exertion frequently giving wise attention to it  this is the denourishing of the arising of sloth and torpor that have not yet arisen and of the increase and strengthening of sloth and torpor that have already arisen
May nothing remain but skin and sinews and bones may flesh and blood dry up in the body
Not before having achieved what can be achieved by manly strength manly energy manly exertion shall my energy subside
Six things are conducive to the abandonment of sloth and torpor
These things too are helpful in conquering sloth and torpor
The recollection of Death
Perceiving the suffering in impermanence
In a monk who is accustomed to see the suffering in impermanence and who is frequently engaged in this contemplation there will be established in him such a keen sense of the danger of laziness idleness lassitude indolence and thoughtlessness as if he were threatened by a murderer with drawn sword
Sympathetic joy
Cultivate the meditation on sympathetic joy
For by cultivating it listlessness will disappear
Contemplation of the spiritual journey
I have to tread that path which the Buddhas the Paccekabuddhas and the Great Disciples have gone but by an indolent person that path cannot be trodden

Contemplation of the Master's greatness
Full application of energy was praised by my Master and he is unsurpassed in his injunctions and a great help to us
He is honored by practicing his Dhamma not otherwise
Contemplation on the greatness of the Heritage
I have to take possession of the Great Heritage called the Good Dhamma
But one who is indolent cannot take possession of it
How to stimulate the mind
How does one stimulate the mind at a time when it needs stimulation
If due to slowness in the application of wisdom or due to nonattainment of the happiness of tranquillity one's mind is dull then one should rouse it through reflecting on the eight stirring objects
These eight are birth decay disease and death the suffering in the worlds of misery the suffering of the past rooted in the round of existence the suffering of the future rooted in the round of existence the suffering of the present rooted in the search for food

How to overcome sleepiness
Once the Exalted One spoke to the Venerable MahaMoggallana thus Are you drowsy Moggallana
Are you drowsy Moggallana  Yes venerable sir
Well then Moggallana at whatever thought torpor has befallen you to that thought you should not give attention you should not dwell on it frequently
Then it is possible that by so doing torpor will disappear
But if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should think and reflect within your mind about the Dhamma as you have heard and learned it and you should mentally review it
Then it is possible that by so doing torpor will disappear
But if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should learn by heart the Dhamma in its fullness as you have heard and learned it
Then it is possible
But if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should shake your ears and rub your limbs with the palm of your hand
Then it is possible
But if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should get up from your seat and after washing your eyes with water you should look around in all directions and look upwards to the stars in the sky
Then it is possible
But if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should firmly establish the perception of light as it is by day so also by night as it is by night so also by day
Thus with a mind clear and unobstructed you should develop a consciousness which is full of brightness
Then it is possible
But if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should conscious of that which is before and behind walk up and down with your senses turned inwards with your mind not going outwards
Then it is possible
But if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you may lie down on your right side taking up the lion's posture covering foot with foot  mindful clearly conscious keeping in mind the thought of rising
Having awakened again you should quickly rise thinking 'I won't indulge in the enjoyment of lying down and reclining in the enjoyment of sleep'
Thus Moggallana you should train yourself
The five threatening dangers
If monks a monk perceives these five threatening dangers it is enough for him to live heedful zealous with a heart resolute to achieve the unachieved to attain the unattained to realize the unrealized
Which are these five dangers
Here monks a monk reflects thus I am now young a youth young in age blackhaired in the prime of youth in the first phase of life
But a time will come when this body will be in the grip of old age
But one who is overpowered by old age cannot easily contemplate on the Teachings of the Buddha it is not easy for him to live in the wilderness or a forest or jungle or in secluded dwellings
Before this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in old age
And further monks a monk reflects thus I am now free from sickness free from disease my digestive power functions smoothly my constitution is not too cool and not too hot it is balanced and fit for making effort
But a time will come when this body will be in the grip of sickness
And one who is sick cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the Buddha it is not easy for him to live in the wilderness or a forest or jungle or in secluded dwellings
Before this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in sickness
And further monks a monk reflects thus Now there is an abundance of food good harvests easily obtainable is a meal of alms it is easy to live on collected food and offerings
But a time will come when there will be a famine a bad harvest difficult to obtain will be a meal of alms it will be difficult to live on collected food and offerings
And in a famine people migrate to places where food is ample and there habitations will be thronged and crowded
But in habitations thronged and crowded one cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the Buddha
Before this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in a famine
And further monks a monk reflects thus Now people live in concord and amity in friendly fellowship as mingled milk and water and look at each other with friendly eyes
But there will come a time of danger of unrest among the jungle tribes when the country people mount their carts and drive away and fearstricken people move to a place of safety and there habitations will be thronged and crowded
But in habitations thronged and crowded one cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the Buddha
Before this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in time of danger
And further monks a monk reflects thus Now the Congregation of Monks lives in concord and amity without quarrel lives happily under one teaching
But a time will come when there will be a split in the Congregation
And when the Congregation is split one cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the Buddha it is not easy to live in the wilderness or a forest or jungle or in secluded dwellings
Before this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even when the Congregation is split
These things too are helpful in conquering sloth and torpor
When the mind is sluggish it is not the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment tranquillity concentration and equanimity because a sluggish mind can hardly be aroused by them
When the mind is sluggish it is the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment investigation of reality energy and rapture because a sluggish mind can easily be aroused by them
If there is a pot of water covered with moss and water plants then a man with a normal faculty of sight looking into it could not properly recognize and see the image of his own face
In the same way when one's mind is possessed by sloth and torpor overpowered by sloth and torpor one cannot properly see the escape from sloth and torpor that have arisen then one does not properly understand one's own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into one's mind not to speak of those not memorized
There is unrest of mind frequently giving unwise attention to it  that is the nourishment for the arising of restlessness and remorse that have not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of restlessness and remorse that have already arisen
There is quietude of mind frequently giving wise attention to it  that is the denourishing of the arising of restlessness and remorse that have not yet arisen and of the increase and strengthening of restlessness and remorse that have already arisen
Six things are conducive to the abandonment of restlessness and remorse
Knowledge of the Buddhist scriptures
Asking questions about them
Familiarity with the Vinaya
Association with those mature in age and experience who possess dignity restraint and calm
Noble friendship
Suitable conversation
These things too are helpful in conquering restlessness and remorse
When the mind is restless it is not the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment investigation of the doctrine energy and rapture because an agitated mind can hardly be quietened by them
When the mind is restless it is the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment tranquillity concentration and equanimity because an agitated mind can easily be quietened by them
If there is water in a pot stirred by the wind agitated swaying and producing waves a man with a normal faculty of sight could not properly recognize and see the image of his own face
In the same way when one's mind is possessed by restlessness and remorse overpowered by restlessness and remorse one cannot properly see the escape from restlessness and remorse that have arisen then one does not properly understand one's own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into one's mind not to speak of those not memorized
There are things causing doubt frequently giving unwise attention to them  that is the nourishment for the arising of doubt that has not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of doubt that has already arisen
There are things which are wholesome or unwholesome blameless or blameworthy noble or low and contrasts of dark and bright frequently giving wise attention to them  that is the denourishing of the arising of doubt that has not yet arisen and of the increase and strengthening of doubt that has already arisen
Of the six things conducive to the abandonment of doubt the first three and the last two are identical with those given for restlessness and remorse
The fourth is as follows
Firm conviction concerning the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
In addition the following are helpful in conquering Doubt
Reflection of the factors of absorption
If there is a pot of water which is turbid stirred up and muddy and this pot is put into a dark place then a man with a normal faculty of sight could not properly recognize and see the image of his own face
In the same way when one's mind is possessed by doubt overpowered by doubt then one cannot properly see the escape from doubt which has arisen then one does not properly understand one's own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into one's mind not to speak of those not memorized
Being endowed with noble mindfulness and clear comprehension and endowed with noble contentedness the monk resorts to a lonely place to a forest the foot of a tree a mountain a cleft a rock cave a cemetery a jungle an open space a heap of straw
After the meal having returned from the almsround he sits down crosslegged keeping his body erect and his mindfulness alert
Having given up covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with a heart free of covetousness he cleanses his mind from covetousness
Having given up the blemish of illwill he dwells without illwill friendly and compassionate towards all living beings he cleanses his mind from the blemish of illwill
Having given up sloth and torpor he dwells free from sloth and torpor in the perception of light mindful and clearly comprehending he cleanses his mind from sloth and torpor
Having given up restlessness and remorse he dwells without restlessness his mind being calmed within he cleanses it from restlessness and remorse
Having given up sceptical doubt he dwells as one who has passed beyond doubt being free from uncertainty about salutary things he cleanses his mind from sceptical doubt
Just as when a man taking a loan engages in a trade and his trade succeeds he now not only disposes of his old debt but he has also beyond that a surplus for maintaining a wife
And at that he rejoices is glad at heart
Just as when a man is sick and in pain suffering from a grave disease his food does not agree with him and he has no strength left in his body
But some time later he recovers from that sickness he can again digest his food and he regains his strength
And at that he rejoices is glad at heart
Just as when a man has been thrown into prison but some time later he is released from prison he is safe and without fears and he did not suffer any loss of property
And at that he rejoices is glad at heart
Just as when a man is a slave not independent but dependent on others unable to go where he likes but some time later he is set free from slavery is now independent no longer dependent on others a freeman who can go where he wants
And at that he rejoices is glad at heart
Just as when a man rich and prosperous travels through a wilderness where there is no food and much danger but some time later he has crossed the desert and gradually reaches safely the vicinity of a village a place of safety free from danger
And at that he rejoices is glad at heart
Similarly so long as these five hindrances are not abandoned in him a monk considers himself as indebted as ailing as imprisoned as enslaved as traveling in a wilderness
But when these five hindrances are abandoned he considers himself as free from debt rid of illness emancipated from the prison's bondage as a free man and as one arrived at a place of safety
And when he sees himself free of these five hindrances joy arises in him who is joyful rapture arises in him whose mind is enraptured the body is stilled the body being stilled he feels happiness and a happy mind finds concentration
Then detached from sensual desires detached from unwholesome states he enters into and dwells in the first absorption which is accompanied by applied thought and reflection born of detachment and filled with joy and rapture
He enters into and dwells in the second third fourth absorption
The text of the discourse says Similarly so long as these five hindrances are not abandoned in him a monk considers himself as indebted as ailing as imprisoned as enslaved as traveling in a wilderness
Hereby the Blessed One shows the unabandoned hindrance of sensual desire as similar to being in debt and the other hindrances as similar to being ill and so on
These similes should be understood as follows
There is a man who has incurred a debt but has become ruined
Now if his creditors when telling him to pay back the debt speak roughly to him or harass and beat him he is unable to retaliate but has to bear it all
It is his debt that causes this forbearance
In the same way if a man is filled with sensual desire for a certain person he will full of craving for that object of his desire be attached to it
Even if spoken to roughly by that person or harassed or beaten he will bear it all
It is his sensual desire that causes this forbearance
In that way sensual desire is like being in debt
If a man suffers from a bilious disease and receives even honey and sugar he will not enjoy its flavor owing to his bile sickness he will just vomit it complaining It is bitter bitter
In the same way if one of angry temperament is admonished even slightly by his teacher or preceptor who wishes his best he does not accept their advice
Saying You harass me too much he will leave the Order or go away and roam about
Just as the bilious person does not enjoy the flavor of honey and sugar so one who has the disease of anger will not enjoy the taste of the Buddha's Dispensation consisting in the happiness of the meditative absorptions etc
In that way illwill resembles illness
A person has been kept in jail during a festival day and so could see neither the beginning nor the middle nor the end of the festivities
If he is released on the following day and hears people saying Oh how delightful was yesterday's festival
Oh those dances and songs he will not give any reply
And why not
Because he did not enjoy the festival himself
Similarly even if a very eloquent sermon on the Dhamma is going on a monk overcome by sloth and torpor will not know the beginning middle or end
If after the sermon he hears it praised How pleasant was it to listen to the Dhamma
How interesting was the topic and how good the similes he will not be able to say a word
And why not
Because owing to his sloth and torpor he did not enjoy the sermon
In that way sloth and torpor are comparable to imprisonment
A slave who wants to enjoy himself at a festival is told by his master Go quickly to such and such a place
There is urgent work to do
If you don't go I shall have your hands and feet cut off or your ears and nose Hearing that the slave will quickly go as ordered and will not be able to enjoy any part of the festival
This is because of his dependence on others
Similarly it is with a monk not well versed in the Vinaya who has gone to the forest for the sake of solitude
If in any matter down to the question of permissible meat he gets the idea that it was not permissible he has to interrupt his solitude and to purify his conduct has to go to one skilled in the Vinaya
Thus he will not be able to enjoy the happiness of solitude because of his being overcome by restlessness and remorse
In that way restlessness and remorse are like slavery
A man traveling through a desert aware that travelers may be plundered or killed by robbers will at the mere sound of a twig or a bird become anxious and fearful thinking The robbers have come He will go a few steps and then out of fear he will stop and continue in such a manner all the way or he may even turn back
Stopping more frequently than walking only with toil and difficulty will he reach a place of safety or he may not even reach it
It is similar with one in whom doubt has arisen in regard to one of the eight objects of doubt
Doubting whether the Master is an Enlightened One or not he cannot accept it in confidence as a matter of trust
Unable to do so he does not attain to the paths and fruits of sanctity
Thus as the traveler in the desert is uncertain whether robbers are there or not he produces in his mind again and again a state of wavering and vacillation a lack of decision a state of anxiety and thus he creates in himself an obstacle for reaching the safe ground of sanctity
In that way sceptical doubt is like traveling in a desert
The text of the Discourse says But when these five hindrances are abandoned the monk considers himself as free from debt rid of illness emancipated from the prison's bondage as a free man and as one arrived at a place of safety
A man having taken a loan uses it for his business and comes to prosperity
He thinks This debt is a cause of vexation He returns the loan together with the interest and has the promissory note torn up
After that he neither sends a messenger nor a letter to his creditors and even if he meets them it depends on his wish whether he will get up from his seat to greet them or not
And why
He is no longer in debt to them or dependent of them
Similarly a monk thinks Sensual desire is a cause of obstruction He then cultivates the six things leading to its abandonment and removes the hindrance of sensual desire
Just as one who has freed himself of debt no longer feels fear or anxiety when meeting his former creditors so one who has given up sensual desire is no longer attached and bound to the object of his desire even if he sees divine forms passions will not assail him
Therefore the Blessed One compared the abandonment of sensual desire to freedom from debt
Just as a person suffering from a bilious disease having been cured by taking medicine will regain his taste for honey and sugar similarly a monk thinking This illwill causes much harm develops the six things leading to its abandonment and removes the hindrance of illwill
Just as the cured patient partaking of honey and sugar appreciates the taste so also this monk receives with reverence the rules of training and observes them with appreciation
Therefore the Blessed One compared the abandonment of illwill to the recovery of health
There is a person that once had been in jail on a festival day
But when freed and celebrating the festival on a later occasion he will think Formerly through the fault of my heedlessness I was in prison on that day and could not enjoy this festival
Now I shall be heedful And he remains heedful of his conduct so that nothing detrimental finds entry into his mind
Having enjoyed the festival he exclaims Oh what a beautiful festival it was
Similarly a monk perceiving that sloth and torpor do great harm develops the six things opposed to them and so removes the hindrance of sloth and torpor
Just as the man freed from prison enjoys the whole length of the festival even for seven days so this monk who has given up sloth and torpor is capable of enjoying the beginning the middle and the consummation of the Festival of the Dhamma and finally attains to Arahatship together with the fourfold discriminating knowledge 
Therefore the Blessed One spoke of the abandonment of sloth and torpor as being comparable to release from imprisonment
There is a slave who with the help of a friend pays money to his master becomes a free man and is henceforth able to do what he likes
Similarly a monk perceiving the great obstruction caused by restlessness and remorse cultivates the six things opposed to them and thus gives up restlessness and remorse
And having given them up he is like a truly free man able to do as he wishes
Just as no one can forcibly stop a free man from doing what he likes so can restlessness and remorse no longer stop that monk from walking the happy path of renunciation
Therefore the Blessed One declared the abandonment of restlessness and remorse as being similar to winning freedom from slavery
There is a strong man who with his luggage in hand and well armed travels through a wilderness in company
If robbers see him even from afar they will take flight
Crossing safely the wilderness and reaching a place of safety he will rejoice in his safe arrival
Similarly a monk seeing that sceptical doubt is a cause of great harm cultivates the six things that are its antidote and gives up doubt
Just as that strong man armed and in company taking as little account of the robbers as of the grass on the ground will safely come out of the wilderness to a safe place similarly a monk having crossed the wilderness of evil conduct will finally reach the state of highest security the deathless realm of Nibbana
Therefore the Blessed One compared the abandonment of sceptical doubt to reaching a place of safety

These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
In many temples of Sri Lanka you will find on either side of the Buddha image the statues of two monks
Their robes are draped over one shoulder and they stand in the attitude of reverence with joined palms
Quite often there are a few flowers at their feet laid there by some pious devotee
If you ask who they are you will be told that they are the Enlightened One's two Chief Disciples the Arahats Sariputta and Maha Moggallana
They stand in the positions they occupied in life
Sariputta on the Buddha's right Maha Moggallana on his left
When the great stupa at Sanchi was opened up in the middle of the last century the relic chamber was found to contain two stone receptacles the one to the north held the body relics of Maha Moggallana while that on the south enclosed those of Sariputta
Thus they had lain while the centuries rolled past and the history of two thousand years and more played out the drama of impermanence in human life
The Roman Empire rose and fell the glories of ancient Greece became a distant memory new religions wrote their names often with blood and fire on the changing face of the earth only to mingle at last with legends of Thebes and Babylon and gradually the tides of commerce shifted the great centers of civilization from East to West while generations that had never heard the Teaching of the Buddha arose and passed away
But all the time that the ashes of the saints lay undisturbed forgotten in the land that gave them birth their memory was held dear wherever the Buddha's message spread and the record of their lives was passed down from one generation to another first by word of mouth then in the written pages of the Buddhist Tripitaka the most voluminous and detailed scripture of any religion
next to the Enlightened One himself it is these two disciples of his who stand highest in the veneration of Buddhists in the Theravada lands
Their names are as inseparable from the annals of Buddhism as that of the Buddha himself
If it has come about that in the course of time many legends have been woven into the tradition of their lives this is but the natural outcome of the devotion that has always been felt for them
And that high esteem was fully justified
Few religious teachers have been so well served by their immediate disciples as was the Buddha
This you will see as you read these pages for they tell the story of one of the two greatest of them Sariputta who was second only to the Buddha in the depth and range of his understanding and his ability to teach the Doctrine of Deliverance
In the Tripitaka there is no connected account of his life but it can be pieced together from the various incidents scattered throughout the canonical texts and commentaries in which he figures
Some of them are more than incidents for his life so closely interwoven with the life and ministry of the Buddha that he plays an essential part in it and on a number of occasions it is the Sariputta himself who takes the leading role  as skilled preceptor and exemplar as kind and considerate friend as guardian of the welfare of the bhikkhus under his charge as faithful repository of his Master's doctrine the function which earned him the title of Dhammasenapati Marshal of the Dhamma and always as himself a man unique in his patience and steadfastness modest and upright in thought word and deed a man to whom one act of kindness was a thing to be remembered with gratitude so long as life endured
Even among the Arahats saints freed from all defilements of passion and delusion he shone like the full moon in a starry sky
This then is the man of profound intellect and sublime nature a true disciple of the Great Teacher whose story we have set down to the best of our ability in the pages that follow
If you the reader can gather from this imperfect record something of the qualities of man perfected of man fully liberated and raised to the highest level of his being of how such a man acts and speaks and comports himself towards his fellows and if the reading of it gives you strength and faith in the assurance of what man may become then our work has been worthwhile and is fully rewarded
The story begins at two brahmanical villages in India called Upatissa and Kolita which lay not far from the city Rajagaha
Before our Buddha had appeared in the world a brahman lady named Sari living in Upatissa village conceived and also on the same day at Kolita village did another brahman lady whose name was Moggalli
The two families were closely connected having been friends with one another for seven generations
From the first day of their pregnancy the families gave due care to the motherstobe and after ten months both women gave birth to boys on the same day
On the namegiving day the child of the brahman lady Sari received the name Upatissa as he was a son of the foremost family of that village and for the same reason Moggalli's son was named Kolita
When the boys grew up they were educated and acquired mastery of all the sciences
Each of them had a following of five hundred brahman youths and when they went to the river or park for sport and recreation Upatissa used to go with five hundred palanquins and Kolita with five hundred carriages
Now at Rajagaha there was an annual event called the Hilltop Festival
Seats were arranged for both youths and they sat together to witness the celebrations
When there was occasion for laughter they laughed when the spectacles were exciting they became excited and they paid their fees for the extra shows
In this manner they enjoyed the festival for a second day but on the third day their understanding was awakened and they could no longer laugh or get excited nor did they feel inclined to pay for extra shows as they had done on the first days
Each of them had the same thought What is there to look at here
Before these people have reached a hundred years they will all have come to death
What we ought to do is to seek for a teaching of deliverance
It was with such thoughts in mind that they took their seats at the festival
Then Kolita said to Upatissa How is this my dear Upatissa
You are not as happy and joyous as you were on the other days
You seem now to be in a discontented mood What is on your mind
My dear Kolita to look at these things here is of no benefit at all
it is utterly worthless
I ought to seek a teaching of deliverance for myself
That my Kolita is what I was thinking seated here
But you Kolita seem to be discontented too
And Kolita replied Just as you have said I also feel When he knew that his friend had the same inclinations Upatissa said That was a good thought of ours
But for those who seek a teaching of deliverance there is only one thing to do to leave home and become ascetics
But under whom shall we live the ascetic life
At that time there lived at Rajagaha an ascetic of the sect of the Wanderers called Sañjaya who had a great following of pupils
Deciding to get ordination under him Upatissa and Kolita went there each with his own following of five hundred Brahman youths and all of them received ordination from Sañjaya
And from the time of their ordination under him Sañjaya's reputation and support increased abundantly
Within a short time the two friends had learned Sañjaya's entire doctrine and they asked him Master does your doctrine go so far only or is there something beyond
Sañjaya replied So far only it goes
You know all
Hearing this they thought to themselves If that is the case it is useless to continue the Holy Life under him
We have gone forth from home to seek a teaching of deliverance
Under him we cannot find it
But India is vast if we wander through villages towns and cities we shall certainly find a master who can show us the teaching of deliverance And after that whenever they heard that there were wise ascetics or brahmans at this or that place they went and discussed with them
But there was none who was able to answer their questions while they were able to reply to those who questioned them
Having thus traveled through the whole of India they turned back and arriving at their old place they agreed between them that he who should attain to the Deathless State first should inform the other
It was a pact of brotherhood born of the deep friendship between the two young men
Some time after they had made that agreement the Blessed One the Buddha came to Rajagaha
It was when he had delivered the Fire Sermon at Gaya Peak that he remembered his promise given before his Enlightenment to King Bimbisara that he would come to Rajagaha again when he had attained his goal
So in stages the Blessed One journeyed from Gaya to Rajagaha and having received from King Bimbisara the Bamboo Grove Monastery he resided there
Among the sixtyone Arahats whom the Master had sent forth to proclaim to the world the virtues of the Triple Gem there was the Elder Assaji who belonged to the group of five ascetics the Buddha's erstwhile companions before his Enlightenment and afterwards his first disciples
The Elder Assaji had returned to Rajagaha from his wanderings and when one morning he was going for alms in the city he was seen by Upatissa who was on his way to the Paribbajaka ascetic's monastery
Struck by Assaji's dignified and serene appearance Upatissa thought Never before have I seen such a monk
He must be one of those who are Arahats or on the way to Arahatship
Should I not approach him and ask 'Under whom have you been ordained
Who is your teacher and whose teaching do you profess' But then he thought It is not the proper time now for putting questions to this monk as he is going for alms through the streets
I had better follow behind him after the manner of supplicants And he did so
Then when the Elder had gathered his almsfood and Upatissa saw him going to another place intending to sit down and take his meal he prepared for him his own ascetic's seat that he carried with him and offered it to the Elder
The Elder Assaji took his meal after which Upatissa served him with water from his own watercontainer and in that way performed towards Assaji the duties of a pupil to a teacher
After they had exchanged the usual courteous greetings
Upatissa said Serene are your features friend
Pure and bright is your complexion
Under whom friend have you gone forth as an ascetic
Who is your teacher and whose doctrine do you profess
Assaji replied There is O friend the Great Recluse the scion of the Sakyas who has gone forth from the Sakya clan
Under that Blessed One I have gone forth
That Blessed One is my teacher and it is his Dhamma that I profess
What does the venerable one's master teach what does he proclaim
Questioned thus the Elder Assaji thought to himself These wandering ascetics are opposed to the Buddha's dispensation
I shall show him how profound this dispensation is So he said I am but new to the training friend
It is not long since I went forth from home and I came but recently to this teaching and discipline
I cannot explain the Dhamma in detail to you
The wanderer replied I am called Upatissa friend
Please tell me according to your ability be it much or little
It will be my task to penetrate its meaning by way of a hundred or a thousand methods And he added
In response the Elder Assaji uttered this stanza
Upon hearing the first two lines Upatissa became established in the Path of streamentry and to the ending of the last two lines he already listened as a streamwinner
When he become a streamwinner and before he had achieved the higher attainments he thought Here will the means of deliverance be found and he said to the Elder Do not enlarge upon this exposition of the Dhamma venerable sir
This will suffice
But where does our Master live
In the Bamboo Grove Monastery wanderer
Then please go on ahead venerable sir
I have a friend with whom I agreed that he who should reach the Deathless State first should tell the other
I shall inform him and together we shall follow on the road you went and shall come into the Master's presence Upatissa then prostrated himself at the Elder's feet saluted him and taking the Elder's leave went back to the park of the Wandering Ascetics
Kolita saw him approaching and thought Today my friend's appearance is quite changed
Surely he must have found the Deathless State
And when he asked him about it Upatissa replied Yes friend the Deathless State has been found and he recited to him the stanza he had heard
At the end of the verse Kolita was established in the Fruition of streamentry and he asked Where my dear does the Master live
I learned from our teacher the Elder Assaji that he lives at the Bamboo Grove Monastery
Then let us go Upatissa and see the Master said Kolita
But Sariputta was one who always respected his teacher and therefore he said to his friend First my dear we shall go to our teacher the Wanderer Sañjaya and tell him that we have found the Deathless
If he can grasp it he will penetrate to the Truth
And even if he does not he may out of confidence in us come with us to see the Master and hearing the Buddha's teaching he will attain to the penetration of the Path and Fruition
So both of them went to Sañjaya and said Oh our teacher
What are you doing
A Buddha has appeared in the world
Well proclaimed is his Teaching and in right conduct lives his community of monks
Let us go and see the Master of the Ten Powers
What are you saying my dear Sañjaya exclaimed
And refusing to go with them he spoke to them of the gain and fame they would enjoy if they would share his the teacher's place
But they said Oh we should not mind always remaining in the state of pupils
But you O teacher you must know whether to go or not
Then Sañjaya thought If they know so much they will not listen to what I say And realizing that he replied You may go then but I cannot
Why not O teacher
I am a teacher of many
If I were to revert to the state of a disciple it would be as if a huge water tank were to change into a small pitcher
I cannot live the life of a pupil now
Do not think like that O teacher they urged
Let it be my dear
You may go but I cannot
Oh teacher
When a Buddha has appeared in the world people flock to him in large crowds and pay homage to him carrying incense and flowers
We too shall go there
And then what will happen to you
To which Sañjaya replied What do you think my pupils are there more fools in this world or more wise people
Fools there are many O teacher and the wise are few
If that is so my friends then the wise ones will go to the wise recluse Gotama and the fools will come to me the fool
You may go now but I shall not
So the two friends left saying You will come to understand your mistake O teacher And after they had gone there was a split among Sañjaya's pupils and his monastery became almost empty
Seeing his place empty Sañjaya vomited hot blood
Five hundred of his disciples had left along with Upatissa and Kolita out of whom two hundred and fifty returned to Sañjaya
With the remaining two hundred and fifty and their own following the two friends arrived at the Bamboo Grove Monastery
There the Master seated among the fourfold assembly was preaching the Dhamma and when the Blessed One saw the two coming he addressed the monks These two friends Upatissa and Kolita who are now coming will be two excellent disciples to me a blessed pair
Having approached the friends saluted the Blessed One reverentially and sat down at one side
When they were seated they spoke to the Blessed One saying May we obtain O Lord the ordination of the Going Forth under the Blessed One may we obtain the Higher Ordination
And the Blessed One said Come O bhikkhus
Well proclaimed is the Dhamma
Now live the Life of Purity to make an end of suffering This alone served as the ordination of these venerable ones
Then the master continued his sermon taking the individual temperaments of the listeners into consideration and with the exception of the two chief disciples all of them attained to Arahatship
But the two chief disciples had not yet completed the task of attaining to the three higher paths of sanctity
The reason for this was the greatness of the knowledge pertaining to the perfection of a disciple which they had still to reach
Upatissa received the name of Sariputta on becoming a disciple of the Buddha while Kolita became known as Maha Moggallana
Now the Venerable Maha Moggallana went to live at a village in Magadha called Kallavala on which he depended for almsfood
On the seventh day after his ordination when he was doing the recluse's work fatigue and torpor fell upon him
But spurred on by the Master he dispelled his fatigue and while listening to the Master expounding to him the meditation subject of the elements he completed the task of winning to the three higher paths and reached the acme of a disciple's perfections
But the Venerable Sariputta continued to stay near the Master at a cave called the Boar's Shelter depending on Rajagaha for his almsfood
Half a month after his ordination the Blessed One gave a discourse on the comprehension of feelings to the Venerable Sariputta's nephew the wandering ascetic Dighanakha
The Venerable Sariputta was standing behind the Master fanning him
While following with his thoughts the progress of the discourse as though sharing the food prepared for another the Venerable Sariputta on that occasion reached the acme of knowledge pertaining to a disciple's perfection and attained to Arahatship together with the fourfold analytical knowledge And his nephew at the end of the sermon was established in the Fruition of streamentry
Now it may be asked Did not the Venerable Sariputta possess great wisdom and if so why did he attain to the disciple's perfections later than the Venerable Maha Moggallana
The answer is because of the greatness of the preparations necessary for it
When poor people want to go anywhere they take to the road at once but in the case of kings larger preparations are required as for instance to get ready the elephants and chariots and so on
Thus it was in this case
On that same day when the evening shadows had lengthened the Master caused his disciples to assemble and bestowed upon the two Elders the rank of Chief Disciples
At this some monks were displeased and said among themselves The Master should have given the rank of Chief Disciples to those who were ordained first that is the Group of Five disciples
If not to them then either to the group of two hundred and fifty bhikkhus headed by Yasa or to the thirty of the Auspicious Group or else to the three Kassapa brothers
But passing over all these Great Elders he has given it to those whose ordination was the very last of all
The Master inquired about the subject of their talk
When he was told he said I do not show preference but give to each what he has aspired to
When for instance Kondaññathe Knower in a previous life gave almsfood nine times during a single harvest he did not aspire to Chief Discipleship his aspiration was to be the very first to penetrate to the highest state Arahatship
And so it came about
But when Sariputta and Maha Moggallana many aeons ago at the time of the Buddha Anomadassi were born as the brahman youth Sarada and landowner Sirivaddhaka they made the aspiration for Chief Discipleship
This O bhikkhus was the aspiration for these my sons at that time
Hence I have given them just what they aspired to and did not do it out of preference
This account of the beginning of the Venerable Sariputta's career is taken from the Commentary to the Anguttara Nikaya Etadagga section with some passages from the parallel version in the Dhammapada Commentary
From it some of the principal traits of the Venerable Sariputta's character are already discernible
His capacity for deep and constant friendship showed itself while he was still a worldling a youth nurtured in luxury and pleasure and it persisted after he had abandoned the household life
On receiving his first insight into the Dhamma and before proceeding any further his first thought was for his friend Kolita and the vow they had sworn together
His penetrating intellect is revealed in the promptness with which he grasped the essence of the Buddha's teaching from a few simple words
And most rare of all he combined that intellectual power with a modesty and sweetness of nature that expressed itself in gratitude and reverence for anyone even the misguided Sañjaya who had taught him things of value
It was no wonder therefore that throughout his life he continued to show respect for the Venerable Assaji from whom he had gained his introduction to the Buddha's Teaching
We are told in the Commentary to the Nava Sutta and also in the Commentary to v
of the Dhammapada that whenever the Venerable Sariputta lived in the same monastery as the Elder Assaji he always went to pay obeisance to him immediately after having done so to the Blessed One
This he did out of reverence thinking This venerable one was my first teacher
It was through him that I came to know the Buddha's Dispensation And when the Elder Assaji lived in another monastery the Venerable Sariputta used to face the direction in which the Elder Assaji was living and to pay homage to him by touching the ground at five places and saluting with joined palms
But this led to misunderstanding for when other monks saw it they said After becoming a Chief Disciple Sariputta still worships the heavenly quarters
Even today he cannot give up his brahmanical views Hearing these remarks the Blessed One said It is not so bhikkhus
Sariputta does not worship the heavenly quarters
He salutes him through whom he came to know the Dhamma
It is him he salutes worships and reveres as his teacher
Sariputta is one who gives devout respect to his teacher It was then that the Master preached to the monks assembled there the Nava Sutta which starts with the words
Another example of the Venerable Sariputta's gratitude is given in the story of Radha Thera
The Commentary to verse of the Dhammapada relates that there was living at Savatthi a poor brahman who stayed in the monastery
There he performed little services such as weeding sweeping and the like and the monks supported him with food
They did not however want to ordain him
One day the Blessed One in his mental survey of the world saw that this brahman was mature for Arahatship
he inquired about him from the assembled monks and asked whether any one of them remembered to have received some help from the poor brahman
The Venerable Sariputta said that he remembered that once when he was going for alms in Rajagaha this poor brahman had given him a ladle full of almsfood that he had begged for himself
The Master asked Sariputta to ordain the man and he was given the name Radha
The Venerable Sariputta then advised him time and again as to what things should be done and always Radha received his admonitions gladly without resentment
And so living according to the Elder's advice he attained Arahatship in a short time
This time the bhikkhus remarked on Sariputta's sense of gratitude and said that he who himself willingly accepts advice obtains pupils who do the same
Commenting on this the Buddha said that not only then but also formerly Sariputta had showed gratitude and remembered any good deed done to him
And in that connection the Master told the Alinacitta Jataka the story of a grateful elephant
If Sariputta was notable for his lasting sense of gratitude he was no less so for his capacity for friendship
With Maha Moggallana the friend and companion of his youth he maintained a close intimacy and many were the conversations they held on the Dhamma
One of these which is of special interest as throwing light on the process of Venerable Sariputta's attainment is recorded in the Anguttara Nikaya Catukkanipata No
It relates that once the Venerable Maha Moggallana went to see the Elder and said to him
There are four ways of progress brother Sariputta
By which of these four ways of progress brother was your mind freed from the cankers without remnants of clinging To which the Venerable Sariputta replied By that of those four ways of progress brother which is easy and has swift directknowledge
The explanation of this passage is that if the suppression of the defilements preparatory to absorption or insight takes place without great difficulty progress is called easy in the reverse case it is difficult or painful
If after the suppression of the defilements the manifestation of the Path the goal of insight is quickly effected the directknowledge is called swift in the reverse case it is sluggish
In this discourse the Venerable Sariputta's statement refers to his attainment of arahantship
His attainment of the first three Paths however was according to the commentary to the above text connected with easy progress and sluggish directknowledge
In such ways as this did the two friends exchange information about their experience and understanding of the Dhamma
They were also frequently associated in attending to affairs of the Sangha
One such occasion was when they combined in winning back certain monks who had been led astray by Devadatta
There is an interesting passage in this connection which shows that the Venerable Sariputta's generous praise of Devadatta's achievements before the latter brought about a schism in the Sangha was the cause of a slight embarrassment
It relates that when the Buddha asked Sariputta to proclaim in Rajagaha that Devadatta's deeds and words should no longer be regarded as connected with the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha the Venerable Sariputta said Formerly I spoke at Rajagaha in praise of Devadatta's magical powers Yes Lord the elder replied
So you will now speak truthfully also Sariputta when you make this proclamation about Devadatta So after receiving the formal approval of the Sangha the Venerable Sariputta together with many monks went to Rajagaha and made the declaration about Devadatta
When Devadatta had formally split the Sangha by declaring that he would conduct Sanghaacts separately he went to Vultures' Peak with five hundred young monks who through ignorance had become his followers
To win them back the Buddha sent Sariputta and Maha Moggallana to the Vultures' Peak and while Devadatta was resting the two Chief Disciples preached to the monks who attained to streamentry and went back to the Master
Another time when the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Maha Moggallana worked together to restore order in the Sangha was when a group of monks led by Assaji and Punnabbassu living at Kitagiri were misbehaving
In spite of repeated admonitions these monks would not mend their ways so the two Chief Disciples were sent to pronounce the penalty of pabbajaniyakamma on those who would not submit to the discipline
Venerable Sariputta's devotion to his friend was fully reciprocated we are told of two occasions when Sariputta was ill and Maha Moggallana attended to him and brought him medicine
Yet there was nothing exclusive about the Venerable Sariputta's friendships for according to the commentary to the MahaGosinga Sutta there was also a bond of mutual affection between him and the Elder Ananda
On the part of Sariputta it was because he thought He is attending on the Master  a duty which should have been performed by me and Ananda's affection was due to the fact that Sariputta had been declared by the Buddha as his foremost disciple
When Ananda gave Novice Ordination to young pupils he used to take them to Sariputta to obtain Higher ordination under him
The Venerable Sariputta did the same in regard to Ananda and in that way they had five hundred pupils in common
Whenever the Venerable Ananda received choice robes or other requisites he would offer them to Sariputta and in the same way Sariputta passed on to Ananda any special offerings that were made to him
Once Ananda received from a certain brahman a very valuable robe and with the Master's permission he kept it for ten days awaiting Sariputta's return
The subcommentary says that later teachers commented on this There may be those who say 'We can well understand that Ananda who had not yet attained to Arahatship felt such affection
But how is it in the case of Sariputta who was a cankerfree arahant To this we answer 'Sariputta's affection was not one of worldly attachment but a love for Ananda's virtues' The Buddha once asked the Venerable Ananda Do you too approve of Sariputta And Ananda replied Who O Lord would not approve of Sariputta unless he were childish corrupt stupid or of perverted mind
Learned O Lord is the Venerable Sariputta of great wisdom O Lord is the Venerable Sariputta of broad bright quick keen and penetrative wisdom is the Venerable Sariputta of few wants and contented inclined to seclusion not fond of company energetic eloquent willing to listen an exhorter who censures what is evil
In the Theragatha we find the Venerable Ananda describing his emotion at the time of Sariputta's death
When the Noble Friend had gone he declares the world was plunged in darkness for me But he adds that after the companion had left him behind and also the Master had passed away there was no other friend like mindfulness directed on the body
Ananda's sorrow on learning of the Venerable Sariputta's death is also described very movingly in the Cunda Sutta
Sariputta was a true friend in the fullest sense of the word
He well understood how to bring out the best in others and in doing so did not hesitate sometimes to speak straightforwardly and critically like the ideal friend described by the Buddha who points out his friend's faults
It was in this way that he helped the venerable Anuruddha in his final breakthrough to Arahatship as recorded in the Anguttara Nikaya
Friend Anuruddha said the Venerable Sariputta that you think thus of your divine eye this is conceit in you
That you think thus of your firm energy your alert mindfulness your unperturbed body and your concentrated mind this is restlessness in you
That you think of your mind not being freed from the cankers this is worrying in you
It will be good indeed if the Venerable Anuruddha abandoning these three states of mind and paying no attention to them will direct the mind to the Deathless Element
And the Venerable Anuruddha later on gave up these three states of mind paid no attention to them and directed his mind to the Deathless Element
And the Venerable Anuruddha living then alone secluded heedful ardent with determined mind before long reached in this very life understanding and experiencing it by himself that highest goal of the Holy Life for the sake of which noble sons go forth entirely from home into homelessness
And he knew Exhausted is rebirth lived is the holy life the work is done nothing further remains after this Thus the Venerable Anuruddha became one of the Arahats
Sariputta must have been stimulating company and sought after by many
What attracted men of quite different temperament to him and his conversation can be well understood from the incident described in the MahaGosinga Sutta
One evening the Elders Maha Moggallana Maha Kassapa Anuruddha Revata and Ananda went to Sariputta to listen to the Dhamma
The Venerable Sariputta welcomed them saying Delightful is this Gosinga Forest of Sala trees there is moonlight tonight all the Sala trees are in full bloom and it seems that heavenly perfume drifts around
What kind of monk do you think Ananda will lend more luster to this Gosinga Sala Forest
The same question was put to the others as well and each answered according to his individual nature
Finally Sariputta gave his own answer which was as follows
They then went to the Buddha who approved of all their answers and added his own
We see from this episode that Sariputta with all his powerful intellect and his status in the Sangha was far from being a domineering type who tried to impose his views on others
How well did he understand how to stimulate selfexpression in his companions in a natural and charming way conveying to them the pensive mood evoked by the enchanting scenery
His own sensitive nature responded to it and drew a similar response from his friends
There are many such conversations recorded between Sariputta and other monks not only the Venerables Maha Moggallana Ananda and Anuruddha but also Maha Kotthita Upavana Samiddhi Savittha Bhumija and many more
It seems that the Buddha himself liked to talk to Sariputta for he often did so and many of his discourses were addressed to his Marshal of the Law to use the title he gave him
Once Sariputta repeated some words the Master had spoken to Ananda on another occasion
This is the whole of the Life of Purity namely noble friendship noble companionship noble association
There could be no better exemplification of that teaching than the life of the Chief Disciple himself
Among the bhikkhus Sariputta was outstanding as one who helped others
We find a reference to this in the Devadaha Sutta
Some visiting monks about to return to their own places took formal leave of the Buddha
He then advised them to see the Venerable Sariputta and take leave of him also telling them Sariputta O bhikkhus is wise and a helper of his fellow monks
The Commentary in explanation of these words says Sariputta was a helper in two ways by giving material help and the help of the Dhamma
The Elder it is said did not go on almsround in the early morning hours as the other bhikkhus did
Instead when they had all gone he walked around the entire monastery grounds and wherever he saw an unswept place he swept it wherever refuse had not been removed he threw it away where furniture such as beds chairs etc or earthenware had not been properly arranged he put them in order
He did that lest other nonBuddhist ascetics visiting the monastery might see some disorderliness and speak in contempt of the bhikkhus
Then he used to go to the hall for the sick and having spoken consoling words to the patients he would ask them about their needs
To procure their requirements he took with him young novices and went in search of medicine either by way of the customary almsround or to some appropriate place
When the medicine was obtained he would give it to the novices saying Caring for the sick has been praised by the Master
Go now good people and be heedful After sending them back to the monastery sick room he would go on the almsround or take his meal at a supporter's house
This was his habit when staying for some time at a monastery
But when going on a journey on foot with the Blessed One he did not go with the very first of the monks shod with sandals and umbrella in hand as one who thinks I am the Chief Disciple But letting the young novices take his bowl and robes sending them with the others he himself would first attend to those who were old very young or unwell making them apply oil to any sores they might have on their bodies
Then either later on the same day or on the next day he would leave together with them
Once when for that reason the Elder Sariputta had arrived particularly late at the place where the others were resting he did not get proper quarters for the night and seated himself under a tent made from robes
The Master saw this and next day he caused the monks to assemble and told them the story of the elephant the monkey and the partridge who after deciding which was the eldest of them lived together showing respect for the seniormost
He then laid down the rule that lodgings should be allocated according to seniority
In this way the Venerable Sariputta was a helper by giving material help
Sometimes he would give material help and the help of the Dhamma together as when he visited Samitigutta who suffered from leprosy in the infirmary
The Theragatha Commentary tells us that he said to Samitigutta Friend so long as the aggregates continue all feeling is just suffering
Only when the aggregates are no more is there no more suffering Having thus given him the contemplation of feelings as subject of meditation Sariputta went away
Samitigutta following the Elder's instruction developed insight and realised the six supernormal powers as an arahant
Again when Anathapindika was lying on his deathbed Sariputta visited him accompanied by Ananda
Sariputta preached to the dying man on nonattachment and Anathapindika was greatly moved by the profound discourse
Another sickbed sermon given by the Elder to Anathapindika is preserved in the SotapattiSamyutta
In this discourse Anathapindika is reminded that those things which lead to rebirth in states of woe are no longer in him but that he possesses the four basic qualities of streamentry and the eight path factors in considering this his pains would subside
As the result his pains did subside
Once the Elder Channa was lying ill and in great pain
The Venerable Sariputta paid him a visit in company with the Elder Maha Cunda
Seeing the sick monk's agonies Sariputta at once offered to go in search of medicines and suitable food for him
But Channa told them he had decided to take his life and after they had left he did so
Afterwards the Buddha explained that the Elder Channa's act was without demerit and blameless since he had attained Arahatship while dying
This story is found in the Channovada Sutta
It is said that whenever Sariputta gave advice he showed infinite patience he would admonish and instruct up to a hundred or a thousand times until his pupil was established in the Fruition of streamentry
Only then did he discharge him and give his advice to others
Very great was the number of those who after receiving his instruction and following it faithfully attained to Arahatship
In the Saccavibhanga Sutta the Buddha says Sariputta is like a mother who brings forth while Moggallana is like a nurse of that which has been brought forth
Sariputta trains to the Fruit of streamentry and Moggallana trains to the highest goal
Explaining this passage the Commentary says When Sariputta accepted pupils for training whether they were ordained by him or by others he favored them with his material and spiritual help looked after them in sickness gave them a subject of meditation and at last when he knew that they had become streamwinners and had risen above the dangers of the lower worlds he dismissed them in the confident knowledge that 'Now they can by their own manly strength produce the higher stages of Saintship' Having thus become free from concern about their future he instructed new groups of pupils
But Maha Moggallana when training pupils in the same way did not give up concern for them until they had attained Arahatship
This was because he felt as was said by the Master 'As even a little excrement is of evil smell I do not praise even the shortest spell of existence be it no longer than a snap of the fingers' But although the Majjhima Commentary says that Sariputta used to lead his regular pupils only up to streamentry in individual cases he helped monks to attain the higher stages
The Udana Commentary for example says that at that time bhikkhus in higher training often used to approach the Venerable Sariputta for a subject of meditation that could help them to attain the three higher Paths It was after taking instruction from Sariputta that the Elder Lakuntika Bhaddiya attained Arahatship having been a streamwinner at the time
There is also the case of the Venerable Anuruddha referred to on p
It was in this manner that the Venerable Sariputta gave the help of the Dhamma
He was a great leader of men and an outstanding spiritual adviser
To the latter task he brought not only a keen and perceptive understanding of the human mind but also a warm human interest in others which must have been a great encouragement to those under his spiritual guidance
We have already seen how ready he was to give generous praise where it was due he was also keen at all times to meet noble monks particularly those whom the Master had commended
One such was the Elder Punna Mantaniputta when Sariputta learned that he had come on a visit he went to meet him
Without telling him who he was he listened to Punna's great discourse the Stage Coach simile and when it was ended gave it high praise
Administering to the physical as well as the spiritual needs of the monks under his charge restraining them with kindly admonitions and encouraging them with the praise their efforts deserved guiding them on the path showing in all he did that vital sympathetic interest which draws forth the best from a pupil Sariputta combined the qualities of a perfect teacher with those of a perfect friend
He was ready to help in every way in small things as in great
Filled with the virtue of the Holy Life himself he was quick to see virtue in others expert in developing it in those in whom it was latent and among the first to extol it where it was in full flower
His was no cold aloof perfection but the richest intermingling of spiritual exaltation with the qualities that are finest and most endearing in a human being
Two stanzas in the Theragatha relate in words ascribed to the Venerable Sariputta himself the way in which he attained Arahatship
There he tells us
In the next two verses the Elder declares that he felt no inclination to develop the five supernormal powers
However the IddhividhaKatha of the Patisambhida Magga credits him with possessing the intensive degree of meditative concentration called the power of intervention by concentration which is capable of intervening in certain normal physiological processes or other natural events
This is illustrated by the anecdote in the Visuddhimagga Ch
XII which records that once when the Venerable Sariputta was living with the Elder Maha Moggallana at Kapotakandara he was sitting meditating in the open with his hair freshly shaved when he was given a malicious blow on the head by a mischievous spirit
The blow was a very severe one but at the time it was given the Elder was absorbed in meditative attainment consequently he suffered no harm The source of this story is the Udana which continues the account as follows
I am comfortable brother Moggallana said the Venerable Sariputta
I am doing well brother Moggallana
Only my head troubles me a little
Whereupon the Venerable Maha Moggallana said O wonderful is it brother Sariputta
O marvelous is it brother Sariputta
How great is the psychic power and how great is the might of the Venerable Sariputta
For just now brother Sariputta a certain demon gave you a blow on the head
And a mighty blow it was
With such a blow one might fell an elephant seven or seven and a half cubits high or one might split a mountain peak
But the Venerable Sariputta says only this 'I am comfortable brother Moggallana
I am doing well brother Moggallana
Only my head troubles me a little' Then the Venerable Sariputta replied O wonderful is it brother Moggallana
O marvelous is it brother Moggallana
How great is the psychic power and how great is the might of the Venerable Moggallana that he should see any demon at all
As for me I have not seen so much as a mudsprite
The Anupada Sutta contains a description of Sariputta's attainments given by the Buddha himself
In it the Blessed One declares that the Venerable Sariputta had mastered the nine meditative attainments that is the four finematerial and four immaterial jhanas and the cessation of perception and feeling
And in the Sariputta Samyutta the Venerable Elder mentions the fact himself in speaking to Ananda adding that in all the stages he was free of any selfreference I had no such thoughts as 'I am entering the jhana I have entered it I am rising from it' And on another occasion he describes to Ananda how he attained to such developed concentration of mind that with regard to the earth element he was without perception of earth and so also in regard to the other three elements the four immaterial states and everything else pertaining to this world or even the world beyond
Yet it seems that he was not entirely without perception of another kind his only perception being that Nibbana is ceasing of comingtobe
This detached attitude to the jhanic attainments may have been due to the meditative abiding in voidness which the Venerable Sariputta cultivated
We read in the Pindapataparisuddhi Sutta that the Buddha once remarked on the Venerable Sariputta's radiant features and asked him by which state of mind this radiance had been caused
The Venerable Sariputta replied that he frequently practiced the abiding in voidness upon which the Buddha said that this was the abode of great men and proceeded to describe it in detail
The Udana records that on three occasions the Master saw the Venerable Sariputta seated in meditation outside the monastery and uttered verses in praise of a firm and calm mind
We may perhaps imagine the Venerable Sariputta seated in meditation in a bower such as that mentioned in the Devadaha Sutta where it is said Once the Blessed One lived in the Sakya country at Devadaha a market town of the Sakyas At that time the Venerable Sariputta was seated not far from the Blessed One under an Elagala bush The Commentary to the text tells us At Devadaha there was a bower under an Elagala bush
This bush grows where there is a constant supply of flowing water
People had made a bower with four posts over which they let the bush grow forming a roof
Under it they made a seat by placing bricks there and strewing it with sand
It was a cool place for the daytime with a fresh breeze blowing from the water It may well have been in some such rustic shelter as this that the Buddha saw Sariputta deep in meditation on those occasions when he extolled his disciple's tranquillity and detachment
Concerning his attainment to analytical knowledge the Venerable Sariputta speaks of it in the Anguttara Nikaya where he says
From all of this it is evident that the Venerable Sariputta was a master of all the stages of attainment up to and including the highest insightknowledge
What could be more aptly said of him than this in the Buddha's own words
If one could ever say rightly of one that he is the Blessed One's true son born of his speech born of the Dhamma formed of the Dhamma heir to the Dhamma not heir to worldly benefit it is Sariputta that one could thus rightly declare
After me O monks Sariputta rightly turns the supreme Wheel of Dhamma even as I have turned it
 Majjh Anupada Sutta
The discourses of Sariputta and the books attributed to him form a comprehensive body of teaching that for scope and variety of exposition can stand beside that of the Master himself
Sariputta understood in a unique way how to organize and present the rich material of the Dhamma lucidly in a manner that was intellectually stimulating and also an inspiration to practical effort
We find this exemplified in two classic discourses of the Majjhima Nikaya the Sammaditthi Sutta and the Greater Sutta on the Elephant Footprint Simile
The Greater Discourse on the Elephant Footprint Simile is a masterpiece of methodical treatment
It begins with the statement that the Four Noble Truths comprise everything that is salutary then singles out the Truth of Suffering as being identifiable with the five aggregates of personality
From these the aggregate of corporeality is chosen for detailed investigation it is shown to consist of the four great elements each of which is said to be internal and external
The bodily parts and functions belonging to the internal element are stated in detail and it is said of both the internal and external elements that they neither belong to a self nor constitute a self
This insight leads to disgust and detachment regarding the elements
The discourse then goes on to show the impermanence of the mighty external elements when they are involved in great upheavals of nature and against that background it is stressed that this tiny body the product of craving can never be regarded as I or mine or considered in the sense of I am And when a monk who has this firm and deeply rooted insight meets with abuse blame and hostility on the part of others he is able to analyze the situation soberly and so remain master of it
He recognizes that the painful feeling that has arisen in him is produced by earcontact which is in itself no more than a conditioned phenomenon and of all the constituent parts of the situation he knows that they are impermanent
This he discerns with reference to contact feeling perception formations and consciousness
At this point of the discourse we see that the other four aggregates the mental components of personality are introduced in an organic context together with the already mentioned factor of contact
The discourse then continues Then his mind just by taking only the elements as its object becomes elated gladdened firm and intent and even if he is beaten and injured he will think 'This body is of such a nature that is liable to such injuries' Thereupon he recollects the Master's Simile of the Saw and will resolve to follow the Buddha's injunction to suffer all injuries in patience whatever may happen to him
But the sermon continues if when thus remembering the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha the monk's equanimity does not endure he will be stirred by a sense of urgency and feel ashamed that in spite of that recollection of the Triple Gem he could not remain constant
On the other hand if his endurance persists he will experience happiness
Even to this extent much has been achieved by that monk says the sutta
Here all the four elements are treated identically
The concluding section starts by comparing the body and its constituent parts with a house which is made up of its various components
After that follows an exposition of the conditioned arising of the sixfold perceptual consciousness
In mentioning the five senseorgans and senseobjects as the basic conditions for the arising of fivesense consciousness derived corporeality is here introduced by means of a prominent part of it thus completing the treatment of the corporeal aggregate
With the state of consciousness having thus arisen all five aggregates are given and in that way their conjunction can be understood as well as their dependent origination
And in this connection Sariputta quotes the Master He who understands dependent origination understands the Dhamma and he who understands the Dhamma understands dependent origination Desire inclination and attachment in regard to the five aggregates is the origin of suffering
Removal of that desire inclination and attachment is the cessation of suffering
And of the monk who has understood this it is said Even to this extent much has been achieved by that monk Thus the exposition is rounded off with the Four Noble Truths
This discourse is indeed like an intricate and beautifully constructed piece of music ending on a solemn and majestic chord
Another model exposition of the Venerable Sariputta's is the Sammaditthi Sutta
This is a masterpiece of teaching which also provides a framework for further elaboration such as given in the extensive commentary to it
The Commentary says In the Buddha Word as collected in the five great Nikayas there is no discourse other than the Discourse on Right Understanding wherein the Four Noble Truths are stated thirtytwo times and thirtytwo times the state of Arahatship The same discourse also gives us an original exposition of dependent origination with slight but very instructive variations
Each factor of dependent origination is used as are also the additional sections to illustrate the right understanding of the Four Noble Truths the comprehension of which is thus greatly enhanced broadened and deepened
This discourse has been widely used for instructional purposes throughout the centuries down to the present day
Another of the Venerable Sariputta's discourses is the Samacitta Sutta which was listened to by the devas of tranquil mind It is concerned with the first three stages of sanctitude the streamwinner the oncereturner and the nonreturner
Its purpose is to clarify the question of their residuum of rebirths in the fivesense world or in the finematerial and nonmaterial worlds which depends upon their mode of practice and on the fetters of existence still remaining
It is a very short discourse but had a singular impact on the huge assembly of devas who according to tradition assembled to hear it
It is said that a very large number of them attained Arahatship and innumerable were those who reached streamentry
This discourse of the Venerable Sariputta is in fact counted among the few which had unusually farreaching results among beings of the higher worlds and although it is a very brief text rather cryptic without the commentarial explanation it had a high reputation in succeeding centuries
It is the sermon that was preached by the arahant Mahinda on the evening of his arrival in Ceylon and the Mahavamsa Ceylon's famous chronicle relates that on this occasion also numerous devas listened and achieved penetration of the Dhamma
The high regard in which the discourse is held and the strong impact ascribed to it may be attributed to the fact that it helps those on the Path to define their position as to the kind of rebirths still to be expected by them
Devas on higher levels of development are sometimes inclined to regard their heavenly status as final and do not expect to be reborn in the fivesense world as may sometimes be the case
The Great Elder's discourse gave them a criterion by which to judge their position
For worldlings still outside the Paths as well it must have offered valuable orientation for the direction of their efforts
The Sangiti Sutta and Dasuttara Sutta two more of the Venerable Sariputta's sermons are the last two texts of the Digha Nikaya the Collection of Long Discourses
Both these texts are compilations of doctrinal terms in which a large number of topics are classified as falling into groups of from one to ten members
The reason for bringing the compilation only up to ten may have been that there are only very few groups of doctrinal terms extending beyond ten members and these could be supposed to be well known and easily remembered
The Sangiti Sutta was preached in the presence of the Buddha and at its conclusion received his express approval
While in the Sangiti Sutta the doctrinal terms are arranged solely in numerical groups of one to ten in the Dasuttara Sutta each of these ten groups has tenfold subdivision which serves to bring out the practical significance of these groups for example
These texts must have been compiled at a fairly late period of the Buddha's and the Venerable Sariputta's life when there was already in existence a large body of doctrine and carefully transmitted discourses which required organizing for ready use and also anthologies of salient features of the Dhamma became a useful aid in a comprehensive study of the Teaching
The Sangiti Sutta was delivered at the time of Nigantha Nataputta's death on the date of which however scholars differ
It was in fact this event that occasioned the preaching of the sutta for it speaks of the dissensions schisms and doctrinal disagreements that arose among the Jains immediately after the death of their Master Nigantha Nataputta otherwise Mahavira
This was taken as a warning example by the Venerable Sariputta who in his discourse stresses that this text should be recited by all in concord and without dissension so that the Holy Life should last long for the welfare and happiness of gods and men The commentators say that the Sangiti Sutta is meant to convey the flavor of concord in the Teaching which is strengthened by doctrinal proficiency
The practical purpose of the Dasuttara Sutta is indicated in the Venerable Sariputta's introductory verses
Dasuttaram pavakkhami dhammam nibbanappattiya dukkhas' antakiriyaya sabbaganthapamocanam
It seems likely that these two suttas served as a kind of index to selected teachings
They may have been useful also to those monks who did not memorize a great many texts to them they may have been helpful in presenting numerous aspects of the Teaching in a form that was easily memorized and assimilated
Both of these discourses admirably illustrate the Venerable Sariputta's concern with the preservation of the Dhamma and his systematic way of ensuring that it was transmitted intact in all its details
It was for that purpose that he provided study aids such as these and other discourses together with works like the Niddesa
A summary of other discourses given by the Venerable Sariputta is included at the end of this book
We shall now turn to a consideration of larger canonical works attributed to him
The first is the Niddesa which belongs to the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka
it is the only work of an exclusively commentarial character included in the Pali Tipitaka
Of its two parts the Maha Niddesa is a commentary to the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipata while the Cula Niddesa comments on the Parayanavagga and the Khaggavisana Sutta likewise of the Sutta Nipata
The Atthakavagga and the Parayanavagga are the last two books of the Sutta Nipata and doubtlessly belong to the oldest parts not only of that work but of the entire Sutta Pitaka
They were highly appreciated even in the earlier days of the Sangha and of the Buddhist laity as well as is testified by the fact that the Udana records a recital of the Atthakavagga by Sona Thera and the Anguttara Nikaya a recital of the Parayanavagga by the female lay disciple Nandamata
On at least five occasions the Buddha himself has given explanations of verses contained in these two parts of the Sutta Nipata
Apart from the high esteem in which they were evidently held the fact that these two verse collections contain numerous archaic words and terse aphoristic sayings makes it understandable that in very early days a commentary on them was composed which was later included in the canonical scriptures
The traditional attribution of it to the Venerable Sariputta must be regarded as highly plausible
It is quite in character with the great Elder's concern with the methodical instruction of bhikkhus that the Niddesa contains not only word explanations clarifications of the context and supporting quotations from the Buddha Word but also material obviously meant for linguistic instruction such as the addition of many synonyms of the word explained
On this subject Prof
EJ
Thomas writes as follows
The Venerable Sariputta states that he attained to the four kinds of analytical knowledge two weeks after his ordination that is on attaining Arahatship
This fact and the extensive application of niruttipatisambhida grammatical analysis in the Niddesa make it quite probable that he was actually the author of both the Niddesa and the Patisambhida Magga
The Maha Niddesa contains also the commentary on the Sariputta Sutta which forms the last text of the Atthakavagga
The first part of this text with verses in praise of the Master and questions put to him is ascribed to Sariputta
The Maha Niddesa explains the opening stanza as referring to the Buddha's return from Tavatimsa heaven after he had preached the Abhidhamma there
Apart from that it contains only his questions the essential part of the text being the Buddha's replies
The Patisambhida Magga has the appearance of a manual of higher Buddhist studies and its range is as broad as that of the mind of its reputed author
At the beginning it presents treatises on types of knowledge and on the types of wrong speculative views both of which show the methodical and penetrative mind of the Venerable Sariputta
In the Treatise on Knowledge as well as in other chapters of the work there are found a large number of doctrinal terms appearing for the first time and only in the Patisambhida Magga
It also contains elaborations of terms and teachings that are mentioned only briefly in other and older parts of the Sutta Pitaka
In addition to this it contains material on meditation of great practical value as for example on mindfulness of breathing mettabhavana and numerous insightexercises
There is also to give variety to the subject matter a passage of hymnic character and great beauty on the Great Compassion of the Tathagata
Mahanama Thera of Ceylon who wrote the Saddhammappakasini the commentary to the work confidently ascribes it to the Venerable Sariputta and in the introductory stanzas gives eloquent praise of the great Elder
In the Patisambhida Magga itself Sariputta is mentioned twice once as being one who possesses samadhivippharaiddhi and again in the Mahapaññakatha Solasapaññaniddesa where it is said Those whose wisdom is equal to that of Sariputta they partake to some extent of the Buddhaknowledge
We come now to one of the most important contributions made by the Venerable Sariputta to Buddhist teaching
According to tradition the Buddha preached the Abhidhamma in the Tavatimsa heaven to his mother Queen Maya who had been reborn as deva in that world
He did this for three months and when returning daily to earth for his meals he gave to the Venerable Sariputta the method of that portion of Abhidhamma he had preached
The Atthasalini says Thus the giving of the method was to the Chief Disciple who was endowed with analytical knowledge as though the Buddha stood on the edge of the shore and pointed out the ocean with his open hand
To the Elder the doctrine taught by the Blessed One in hundreds and thousands of methods became very clear Thereafter the Elder passed on what he had learned to his five hundred disciples
Further it is said The textual order of the Abhidhamma originated with Sariputta the numerical series in the Great Book was also determined by him
In this way the Elder without spoiling the unique doctrine laid down the numerical series in order to make it easy to learn remember study and teach the Law
The Atthasalini the Commentary to the Dhammasangani also ascribes to Sariputta the following contributions to the canonical Abhidhamma
