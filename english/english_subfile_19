Yet our desire impels us not to see this though impermanence stares us in the face from every single thing aroundAnd it confronts us when we look within  mind and body arising and passing awaySo dont turn on the TV go to the pictures read a book seize some food or a hundred other distractions just to avoid seeing thisThis is the one thing really worth seeing for one who fully sees it in himself is Free The Jewel Forest MonasterySakhon Nakorn SiamThe Buddhist doctrine of anicca the transitoriness of all phenomena finds classical expression in the oftrecurrent formula Sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa and in the more popular statement Aniccaa vata sankhaaraaBoth these formulas amount to saying that all conditioned things or phenomenal processes mental as well as material that go to make up the samsaaric plane of existence are transient or impermanentThis law of impermanence is not the result of any kind of metaphysical inquiry or of any mystical intuitionIt is a straightforward judgment arrived at by investigation and analysis and as such its basis is entirely empiricalIt is in fact for the purpose of showing the insubstantiality and impermanence of the world of experience that Buddhism analyzes it into a multiplicity of basic factorsThe earliest attempts at explaining this situation are represented in the analysis into five khandas twelve aayatanas and eighteen dhaatusIn the Abhidhamma we get the most detailed analysis into eighty one basic elements which are introduced by the technical term dhammaaThese are the basic factors into which the empiric individuality in relation to the external world is ultimately analyzedThey purport to show that there does not exist a unity substance atta or jiiva In the ultimate analysis the socalled unity is a complex of factors one is really many This applies to both mind and matter equallyIn the case of living beings there is no soul or self which is immortal while in the case of things in general there is no essence which is everperduringThese basic factors according to Buddhism do not imply an absolute unityThey are not fractions of a whole but a number of coordinate ultimatesAlthough real they are not permanentNor are they mutually unconnectedAs such they do not imply a theory of absolute separateness eitherA good example of this kind of worldview is that of Pakudha Kaccaayana who seeks to explain the composition of the world with reference to seven eternally existing and mutually unconnected substancesThis reduces the world to a concatenation of separate and discrete entities with no interconnection with no interdependenceThe Buddhist view of existence does not amount to such an extreme for according to Buddhism the basic factors are interconnected with laws of causation and conditionalityThus the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is based both on analysis and synthesisIt is through analysis that the empirical world is reduced to a multiplicity of basic factors and it is through causality that they are again synthesizedThat existence does not consist of an eternal substance mental or material but is composed of a variety of constantly changing factors is the conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis into khandhas aayatanas dhaatus and dhammasOn the impermanence of the five khandhas that make up the empiric individuality we find this statement in the Samyuttanikaaya There is no materiality whatever O monks no feeling no perception no formations no consciousness whatever that is permanent everlasting eternal changeless identically abiding for ever Then the Blessed One took a bit of cowdung in his hand and he spoke to the monks Monks if even that much of permanent everlasting eternal changeless individual selfhood identically abiding for ever could be found then this living of a life of purity for the complete eradication of Ill would not be feasibleWhat is revolutionary about the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is that it is extended to include everything including consciousness which is usually taken to be permanent as the soul or as one of its qualitiesThe Majjhima Nikaaya records how Bhikkhu Saati misunderstood Buddhas teaching to mean that consciousness is a permanent entity which passes from one existence to another like the niraasraya vinnaana of the UpanisadsThis led the Buddha to formulate the wellknown principle Annatra paccayaa natthi vinnaanassa sambhavo  There is no arising of consciousness without reference to a conditionThis is further explained to mean that consciousness comes into being in dependence on a dualityWhat is that dualityIt is eye which is impermanent changing becomingother and visible objects which are impermanent changing and becomingother such is the transient fugitive duality which is impermanent changing and becomingotherEyeconsciousness too is impermanentFor how could eyeconsciousness arisen by depending on an impermanent condition be permanentThe coincidence concurrence and confluence of these three factors which is called contact and those other mental phenomena arising as a result are also impermanentIt is in view of the impermanence and insubstantiality of consciousness that Buddha has declaredBetter were it bhikkhus that the uneducated manyfolk should conceive this fourelementmade body rather than citta to be soulAnd whyThe body is seen to persist for a year for two three four five ten or twenty years for a generation even for a hundred years or even for longer while that which is called consciousness that is mind that is intelligence arises as one thing ceases as another both by day and nightBecause of its acceptance of this law of universal impermanence Buddhism stands in direct opposition to sassatavaada or eternalism which usually goes hand in hand with aatmavaada ie belief in some kind of immortal soulThe Brahmajaala Sutta of the Diighanikaaya alone refers to more than ten varieties of eternalism only to refute them as misconceptions of the true nature of the empirical worldBut this refutation of eternalism does not lead to the acceptance on the part of Buddhism of the other extreme namely ucchedavaada or annihilationism which usually goes hand in hand with materialismThe Buddhist refutation of both these extremes finds classical expression in the following words of the BuddhaThis world O Kaccaayana generally proceeds on a duality of the it is and the it is not But O Kaccaayana whoever perceives in truth and wisdom how things originate in the world for him there is no it is not in this worldWhoever Kaccaayana perceives in truth and wisdom how things pass away in the world for him there is no it is in this worldThis statement of the Buddha refers to the duality of existence and nonexistenceThese are the two theories of eternalism and annihilationism which find expression in many forms in various types of religion and philosophyThe former implies belief in a permanent and changeless substance or entity whether it is conceived as a plurality of individual souls as in Jainism or as a monistic worldsoul as in Vedaanta or as a deity of some kind as in most of the theistic religionsThe latter on the other hand implies a belief in the temporary existence of separate souls or personalities which are entirely destroyed or dissolved after deathA good example of this kind of philosophy is the one advocated by Ajita Kesakambali which finds mention in the Saamannaphala SuttaIn contrast according to Buddhism everything is the product of antecedent causes and therefore of dependent originationThese causes themselves are not everlasting and static but simply antecedent aspects of the same ceaseless becomingEvery event is the result of a concatenation of dynamic processesNeither Being nor nonBeing is the truthThere is only Becoming happening by way of cause continuity without identity persistence without a persistent substanceHe who discerns origin by way of cause he discerns the Dhamma he who discerns the Dhamma he discerns origin by way of causeThus by accepting the theory of causation and conditionality Buddhism avoids the two extremes of sabbam atthi and sabbam natthi and advocates sabbam bhavati everything becomes ie happens by way of cause and effectIt is also because of this theory that Buddhism could avoid the two extremes of niyativaada and ahetuappaccayavaadaAccording to the former everything is absolutely predetermined according to the latter everything happens without reference to any cause or conditionAccording to both there is no room for free will and as such moral responsibility gets completely ruled outBy its theory of causation Buddhism avoids both extremes and establishes free will and moral responsibilityThe second basic characteristic of the world of experience namely dukkha is but a logical corollary arising from this law of universal impermanenceFor the impermanent nature of everything can but lead to one inescapable conclusion As everything is impermanent they cannot be made the basis of permanent happinessWhatever is transient is by that very fact unsatisfactory  yad aniccam tam dukkhamSince every form of samsaaric existence is impermanent it is also characterized by unsatisfactorinessThus the premise sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa leads to the conclusion sabbe sankhaaraa dukkhaaAs indicative of a general characteristic of phenomena the term dukkha should not be understood in a narrower sense to mean only pain suffering misery or sorrowAs a philosophical term it has a wider connotation as wide as that of the term aniccaIn this wider sense it includes deeper ideas such as imperfection unrest conflict in short unsatisfactorinessThis is precisely why even the states of jhaana resulting from the practice of higher meditation and which free from suffering as ordinarily understood are also included in dukkhaThis is also why the characterization dukkha is extended even to matterThe Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa recognizes these wider implications of the term when it explains it as threefold namely dukkhadukkha viparinaamadukkha and sankhaaradukkhaAs a direct and necessary corollary of this fact of dukkha we come to the third basic characteristic of all phenomena namely anatta which finds expression in the wellknown statement Sabbe dhammaa anattaaFor the unsatisfactory nature of everything should lead to this important conclusion If everything is characterized by unsatisfactoriness nothing can be identified as the self or as a permanent soulWhat is dukkha is also anattaWhat is not the self cannot be considered as I am as mine or as I am thatAccording to Buddhism the idea of self or soul is not only a false and imaginary belief with no corresponding objective reality but is also harmful from an ethical point of viewFor it produces such harmful thoughts of I me and mine selfish desires attachments and all other unwholesome states of mindIt could also be a misery in disguise to one who accepts it as trueDo you see O bhikkhus such a soultheory in the acceptance of which there would not arise grief lamentation suffering distress and tribulationCertainly not SirGood O bhikkhus I too O bhikkhus do not see a soultheory in the acceptance of which there would not arise grief lamentation suffering distress and tribulationThis brings into relief the close connection between the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence and Buddhist ethics If the world of experience is impermanent by that very fact it cannot be made the basis of permanent happinessWhat is not permanent and therefore what is characterized by unsatisfactoriness cannot be considered as the selfAnd what is not the self cannot be considered as ones own or as a haven of securityFor the things that one gets attached to are constantly changingHence attachment to them would only lead to unrest and sorrowBut when one knows things as they truly are ie as anicca dukkha and anatta one ceases to get agitated by them one ceases to take refuge in themJust as attachment to things is to get fettered by them even so detachment from them is to get freed from themThus in the context of Buddhist ethics the perception of impermanence is only a preliminary step to the eradication of all cravings which in turn has the attainment of Nibbaana as its final goalIt will thus be seen that the Buddhist doctrine of anicca on which is also based the doctrine of dukkha and anatta can rightly be called the very foundation of the whole edifice of Buddhist philosophy and ethicsThis explains why the Buddha has declared that the very perception of this fact namely that whatever comes into existence is also subject to dissolution is indeed the very arising of the stainless Eye of the DoctrineThe Buddhist doctrine of impermanence as explained in the canonical texts does really amount to a theory of momentariness in the sense that everything is in a state of constant fluxThis becomes clear from a passage in the Anguttara Nikaaya where the three sankhatalakkhanas are explainedHere it is said that that which is sankhata has three fundamental characteristics namely uppaada vaya andthitassa annathattaFrom this it follows that the Buddhist doctrine of change should not be understood in the ordinary sense that something arises exists for some time in a more or less static form and dissolvesOn the contrary the third characteristic iethitassa annathatta shows that between its arising and cessation a thing is all the time changing with no static phase in betweenThus the Buddhist doctrine of change does really amount to a theory of universal fluxAs far as the application of this theory of change is concerned there is nothing to suggest that early Buddhism had made any distinction between mind and matterHowever some schools of Buddhism notably the Mahaasaanghikas Vaatsiiputriyas and Sammitiiyas while recognizing the momentary duration of mental elements assigned a relative permanence to matterOthers such as the Sarvaastivaadins Mahiisaasakas and Sautraantikas objected to introducing any such distinction and declared that all elements of existence mental as well as material are of momentary duration of instantaneous beingIn the various schools of Buddhism the early Buddhist doctrine of change came to be explained on the basis of a formulated theory of momentsThis theory is based on the three sankhatalakkhanas which we referred to earlierIt is in fact on the interpretation of the third sankhatalakkhana namelythitassa annathatta that the different schools of Buddhism differ widely as if to justify the very meaning conveyed by these two wordsThe Vaibhaasika School of Buddhism interpret sthityanyathaatva as jarataa postulate another characteristic called sthiti and thus increase the number of sankhatalakkhanas to four jaati sthitii jarataa anityataaAll elements mental as well as material characterised by them are samskrtaOnly aakaasa and Nirvaana escape from their inexorable swayAt every moment all mental and material elements are affected by themA moment is defined as the time during which the four characteristics accomplish their operationThe Vaibhaasikas also maintain that these characteristics are not only distinct from but also as real as the things which they characterize  showing thereby a strong predilection to naive realismAnd in keeping with this theory it is also claimed that they are in turn characterized by secondary characteristicsThe Sautraantika School of Buddhism does not agree with this interpretation of the VaibhaasikasIn their view the four characteristics apply not to one but to a series of momentary elements The series itself is called sthiti its origin is called jaati its cessation is vyaya and the difference in its preceding and succeeding moments is called sthityanyathaatvaA momentary element so they argue cannot have a phase called sthiti or jarataa for whatever that originates has no time to subsist or decay but to perishThey also point out that these four characteristics are mere designations with no objective realityThey criticize the recognition of secondary characteristics on the ground that this would lead to the fallacy of infinite regressFor if the four characteristics require a set of secondary characteristics to account for their origination etc then these secondary characteristics will in turn require another set of secondary characteristics to account for their origination etc and in this manner the process could be stretched indefinitelyThis problem does not arise  so runs the argument  if the characteristics are not recognized as real as the things they characterizeHow the Theravaadins developed the doctrine of impermanence and how they interpreted the sankhatalakkhanas could be understood clearly when the subject is unfolded against this backgroundThe most striking feature of the Theravada theory is that the fact of momentariness is explained in quite a different way Each dhamma has three moments namely uppaadakkhana the moment of originationthitikkhana the moment of subsistence and bhangakkhana the moment of cessationThese three moments do not correspond to three different dhammasOn the contrary they represent three phases  the nascent the static and cessant  of one momentary dhammaHence the statement that dhammas are momentary means that a given dhamma has three momentary phases or stagesIt arises in the first moment subsists in the second moment and perishes in the third momentLike the Sautraantikas the Theravaadins too accept the fact that a momentary dhamma has no phase called jarataa or decayAccording to the argument of both schools the attribution of jarataa which implies some kind of change or transformation to a momentary dhamma is to accept parinaamavaada according to which the essence the substance remains the same while its modes undergo changeChange as it came to be finally defined in the schools of Buddhist logic is not the transformation of one and the same dhamma from one stage to another but the replacement of one momentary dhamma by anotherThe following argument in the Abhidharmakosa which is directed against the Vaibhaasikas who admit jarataa of one momentary dhamma clarifies this situation But how can you speak of jarataa or change in respect of one momentary dhammaWhat is called jarataa or change is the transformation or dissimilarity between two stagesIs it possible to say that a dharma becomes different from itselfIf it remains unchanged it cannot be anotherIf it is transformed it is not the sameTherefore the transformation of one dhamma is not possibleHence the Sautraantikas and the Theravaadins apply the characteristic of jarataa only to a series of momentary dhammasIn their opinion what is called jarataa is the difference between the preceding and the succeeding moments of a seriesThere is however this difference to be noted Unlike the Sautraantikas the Theravaadins do not deny the static phase of a momentary dhammaThe Theravada argument in support of their accepting the static phase is as follows It is true that a dhamma that originates should also cease to existBut before it could cease to exist there should be at least a moment when it turns towards its own cessationIt is this moment when a dhamma is facing its own cessation that we call the static phaseThe logic of this argument is that a dhamma that arises cannot cease to exist at the same time for otherwise existence and nonexistence would become coexistentOne logical development of this theory of moments is the denial of motionFor if all the elements of existence are of momentary duration they have no time to moveIn the case of momentary elements wherever appearance takes place there itself takes place disappearanceIn keeping with this theory motion is given a new definitionAccording to this definition motion has to be understood not as the movement of one material element from one locus in space to another but as the appearance of momentary elements in adjacent locations creating a false picture of movementThe best example given in this case is the light of the lampThe socalled light of the lamp it is argued is nothing but a common designation given to an uninterrupted production of a series of flashing pointsWhen the production changes place one says that the light has changedBut in reality other flames have appeared in another placeAccording to the Theravada anicca is the first of what are often called in Buddhist literature the Three Characteristics or the General CharacteristicsAnicca is usually treated as the basis for the other two though anattaa the third is sometimes founded on dukkha aloneThe normal English equivalent for anicca is impermanentThe adjective anicca is derived in modern etymology from the negative prefix a plus niccaThe Paramatthamanjuusaa and also the PoraanaTiikaa agree that Because it denies everlastingness it is not permanent thus it is impermanentThe VibhaaviniiTikaa and Sankhepavannanaa prefer a derivation from the negative prefix an plus root i to go Cannot be gone to is unapproachable as a permanent everlasting state thus it is impermanentPrincipal definitions given in the Sutta Pitaka are as followsImpermanent impermanent it is said LordWhat is impermanent  Materiality is impermanent Raadha and so are feeling and perception and formations and consciousness This statement is summarized by a Canonical commentary thus What is impermanentThe five categories are impermanentIn what sense impermanentImpermanent in the sense of rise and fall Again All is impermanentAnd what is the all that is impermanentThe eye is impermanent visual objects eyeconsciousness eye contact whatever is felt as pleasant or unpleasant or neitherunpleasantnorpleasant born of eyecontact is impermanent or quite succinctly All formations are impermanent and Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation The Canonical commentary adds Materiality is impermanent in the sense of exhaustion For reasons given below impermanence in strict Abhidhamma treatment appears along with continuity etc only as one of the secondary constituents of the materiality category of which the commentary says Impermanence of materiality has the characteristic of complete breakupIts nature is to make instances of materiality subsideIt is manifested as their exhaustion and fallIts footing is materiality that is completely breaking upA section of the Vibhanga however which does not follow the strict Abhidhamma method extends impermanence to the highest kinds of heavenly existence beyond those with finemateriality to the immaterial where there is perception only of infinity of space infinity of consciousness nothingness or reduced perception of nothingnessThe commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa elaborate the Sutta definitions further distinguishing between the impermanent and the characteristic of impermanenceThe five categories are the impermanentWhyBecause their essence is to rise and fall and change and because after having been they are notBut the characteristic of impermanence is their state of rise and fall and alternation or it is their modetransformation called nonbeing after having been again The eye can be known as impermanent in the sense of its nonbeing after having been and it is impermanent for four reasons as well because it has rise and fall because it changes because it is temporary and because it denies permanence and Since its destiny is nonbeing and since it abandons its natural essence because of the transmission to a new state of being it is subject to change which is simply synonymous with its impermanenceHaving dealt with derivations and definitions we can now turn to the Suttas and commentaries again in order to see how this subject is handled there for in this article we shall be mainly concerned with quotations leaving discussion to other articlesBut at this point it is convenient to approach the doctrine of impermanence first from the point of view of it as a description of what actually is leaving till later the point of view of it as a basis for evaluation and judgment which is the reason and justification for the descriptionImpermanence is observable empirically and is objectively and publicly evident always if looked for and from time to time forcing itself upon our noticeExternally it is found in the inconstancy of things which extends even to the periodical description of worldsystems and in one self it can be observed for instance in the bodys inadequacy because it ages is prone to sickness dies and gradually decays after death life is shortBut it would be better for an untaught ordinary man to treat as self this body which is constructed upon the four great entities then cognizanceWhyBecause this body can last one year two years even a hundred years but what is called cognizance and mind and consciousness rises and ceases differently through night and day just as a monkey ranging through a forest seizes a branch and letting that go seizes anotherNevertheless observance of empirical impermanence might not alone suffice for the radical position accorded by the Buddha to this characteristicThis is established however by discovery through reasoned attention of a regular structure in the subjectiveobjective process of its occurrence This body is impermanent it is formed and it is dependentlyarisen Here in fact three aspects are distinguished three necessary and interlocking constituents of impermanence namely change formation and a recognizable pattern in a changing process which pattern is set out in the formula of dependent originationWe shall take these three aspects in orderThere is no single treatise on the characteristic of impermanence either in the Tipitaka or its commentaries and so we shall have to bring together passages from a number of sourcesWe may also bear in mind that the Buddha does not confine descriptions of a general nature such as this to the observed alone but extends them to include the observer regarded as actively committed in the world he observes and acting on it as it acts on him so long as craving and ignorance remain unabolishedThat in the world by which one perceives the world and conceives concepts about the world is called the world in the Ariyass DisciplineAnd what is it in the world with which one does thatIt is with the eye ear nose tongue body and mindThat same world is being worn away that is why it is called world That impermanence is not only appropriate to all of any arisen situation but also to the totality of all arisen situationsBhikkhu there is no materiality whatever feeling perception formations consciousness whatever that is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change that will last as long as eternityThen the Blessed One took a small piece of cowdung in his hand he told the bhikkhu Bhikkhu if even that much of permanent everlasting eternal individual selfhood not subject to change could be found then this living of a life of purity could not be described as for the complete exhaustion of suffering SNvoliii Bhikkhus I do not dispute with the world the world disputes with me no one who proclaims the True Idea disputes with anyone in the worldWhat wise men in the world say there is not that I too say there is not and what wise men in the world say there is that I too say there is Wise men in the world say there is no permanent everlasting eternal materiality not subject to change and I too say there is noneWise men in the world say that there is impermanent materiality that is unpleasant and the subject to change and I too say there is that SNvoliii Impermanence it is pointed out in the commentaries is not always evident unless looked forThe characteristic of impermanence does not become apparent because when rise and fall are not given attention it is concealed by continuity However when continuity is disrupted by discerning rise and fall the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent in its true nature VisChxxipWhen continuity is disrupted means when continuity is exposed by observation of the perpetual alteration of dhammas as they go on occurring in successionFor it is not through dhammas connectedness that the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent to one who rightly observes rise and fall but rather the characteristic becomes properly evident through their disconnectedness as if they were iron darts VisAThis leads us to the second of the three aspects that of the formation mentioned above for to be impermanent is to have a beginning and an end to have rise and fallBhikkhus there are three formed characteristics of the formed arising is evident and fall is evident and the alteration of what is present is evidentAnd one who possesses the Five Factors of Endeavor has understanding possesses understanding extending to rise and disappearanceAcariya Buddhaghosa makes use of the empirically observable in order to arrive at the radical concept of rise and fallA cup gets broken the asoka trees shoot can be seen to change in the course of a few days from pale to dark red and then through brown to green leaves which eventually turn yellow wither and fall to the groundThe illustration of a lighted lamp is also used where it goes to when its oil and wick are used up no one knows But that is crudely put for the flame in each third portion of the wick as it gradually burns away ceases there without reaching the other parts That is crudely put too for the flame in each inch in each halfinch in each thread in each strand will cease without reaching the other strands but no flame can appear without a strandBy regarding seeming stability in ever shorter periods and minuter detail a momentary view is arrived atAnything whatever first analyzed into a fivecategory situation is then regarded as arising anew in each moment and immediately dissolving like sesamum seeds crackling when put into a hot panThis is further developed in the commentary to the VisuddhimaggaFormed dhammas arising by means of cause and condition their coming to be after not being their acquisition of individuality is their riseTheir instantaneous cessation and exhaustion when arisen is their fallTheir other state through aging is their alterationFor just as when the occasion of arising dissolves and the occasion of dissolution succeeds it there is no break in the basis on the occasion facing dissolution in other words presence which is what the term of common usage aging refers to so too it is necessary that the aging of a single dhamma is meant which is what is called momentary aging And there must without reservation be no break in the basis between the occasions of arising and dissolution otherwise it follows that one arises and another dissolvesAcariya Buddhaghosa though not identifying being with beingperceived rejects the notion of any underlying substance  any hypostasis personal or impersonal  thusunderstands that there is no heap or store of unarisen mentalitymateriality prior to its arisingWhen it arises it does not come from any heap or store and when it ceases it does not go in any directionThere is nowhere any depository in the way of a heap or store prior to its arising of the sound that arises when a lute is played nor does it come from any store when it arises nor does it go in any direction when it has ceased but on the contrary not having been it is brought into being by depending on the lute the lutes soundboard and a mans appropriate effort and immaterial dhammas come to be and having been they vanish VisChxxpThe transience and perpetual renewal of dhammas is compared in the same work to dewdrops at sunrise a bubble on water a line drawn on water a mustard seed on an awls point and a lightning flash and they are as coreless as a conjuring trick a mirage a dream a whirling firebrands circle a goblin city froth a plantain trunk and so onBefore leaving the aspect of rise and fall the question of the extent of the moment as conceived in the commentaries must be examinedA Sutta cited above gave arising fall and alteration of what is present as three characteristics of anything formedIn the commentaries this is restated as rise presence and dissolution which are each also called  momentsThese submoments are discussed in the Vibhanga commentaryTo what extent does materiality lastAnd to what extent the immaterialMateriality is heavy to change and slow to cease the immaterial is light to change and quick to ceaseSixteen cognizances arise and cease while materiality lasts but that ceases with the seventeenth cognizanceIt is like when a man wanting to knock down some fruit hits a branch with a mallet and when fruits and leaves are loosed from their stems simultaneously and of those the fruits fall first to the ground because they are heavier the leaves later because they are lighterSo too just as the leaves and fruits are loosed simultaneously from their stems with the blow of the mallet there is simultaneous manifestation of materiality and immaterial dhammas at the moment of relinking at rebirth And although there is this difference between them materiality cannot occur without the immaterial nor can the immaterial without materiality they are commensurateHere is a simile there is a man with short legs and a man with long legs as they journey along together while longlegs takes one step shortlegs takes sixteen steps when shortlegs is making his sixteenth step longlegs lifts his foot draws it forward and makes a single step so neither outdistances the other and they are commensurate KhandhaVibhanga AVbhElsewhere it is stated that the submoments of arising and dissolution are equal for both materiality and cognizance only the presence submoment of materiality being longerThe MuulaTiikaa however puts the mental presence submoment in question commenting as follows on the passage just quoted Now it needs investigating whether there is what is here called presence submoment of a cognizance or not It cites the Citta Yamaka as follows Is it when arisen arisingAt the dissolution submoment it is arisen but it is not not arising and Is it when not arising not arisenAt the dissolution submoment it is not arising but it is not unarisen and two similar passages from the same source pointing out that only the dissolution submoment is mentioned instead of both that and the presence submoment as might be expected had the Yamaka regarded the presence submoment as having valid application to cognizanceFor that reason the MuulaTiikaa concludesnonexistence of a presence submoment of cognizance is indicatedFor although it is said in the Suttas The alteration of what is present is evident that does not mean either that a continuity alteration which is evident cannot be called presence because of absence of any alteration of what is one only or that what is existent by possessing the pair of submoments cannot be called presentThe third aspect of impermanence that of the pattern or structure of specific conditionality still remainsIt is briefly stated thus That comes to be when there is this that arises with the arising of this That does not come to be when this is not that ceases with the cessation of this or in the words that first awakened the two Chief Disciples A Tathaagata has told the cause of dhammas that have come into being due to a cause and that which brings their cessation too such is the doctrine preached by the Great SamanaIn more detail we find Consciousness acquires being by dependence on a dualityWhat is that dualityIt is eye which is impermanent changing becomingother and visible objects which are impermanent changing and becomingother such is the transient fugitive duality which is impermanent changing and becomingotherEyeconsciousness is impermanent changing and becomingother for this cause and condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness being impermanent changing and becomingother how could eyeconsciousness arisen by depending on an impermanent condition be permanentThen the coincidence concurrence and confluence of these three impermanent dhammas is called contact but eyecontact too is impermanent changing and becomingother for how could eyecontact arisen by depending on an impermanent condition be permanentIt is one touched by contact who feels likewise who chooses likewise who perceives so these transient fugitive dhammas too are impermanent changing and becomingotherBy further development we come to the formula of dependent origination but that is beyond the scope of this articleThe Buddhas last words wereHanda daani bhikkhave aamantayaami vo

rise and fall in the five categories affected by clinging the outcome is that awareness of repulsiveness in clinging is established in him ANvoliii Fruitful as the act of giving is yet it is still more fruitful to go with confident heart for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and of the Sangha and undertake the five precepts of virtue Fruitful as that is yet it is still more fruitful to maintain lovingkindness in being for only as long as the milking of a cow Fruitful as that is yet it is still more fruitful to maintain perception of impermanence in being for only as long as the snapping of a finger ANvol abbrBetter a single day of life perceiving how things rise and fall than to live out a century yet not perceive their rise and fallIt is impossible that a person with right view should see any formation as permanent MN voliii The Visuddhimagga relies principally on the canonical commentary the Patisambhidaamagga in its handling of the contemplation of impermanenceThere that contemplation introduces the first of what are called the Eight Knowledges namely the knowledge of contemplation of rise and fallAlso perception of impermanence heads the  Principal Insights which make their initial appearance is a group in the PatisambhidaamaggaIn this connection it is stated as followsOne who maintains in being the contemplation of impermanence abandons perception of permanencethe contemplation of impermanence and contemplation of the signless are one in meaning and different only in the letterone who maintains in being the contemplation of the signless abandons the sign VisChxx pThe contemplation of what is impermanent or contemplation as impermanent is contemplation of impermanence this is insight that occurs in apprehending impermanence in the three planesThe Visuddhimagga addsHaving purified knowledge in this way by abandoning perception of permanence etc which oppose the contemplation of impermanence etc he passes on and begins contemplation of rise and fall VisChxxppThe following passage is then quotedHow is it that understanding of contemplating the change of presentlyarisen dhammas is knowledge of rise and fallPresentlyarisen materiality is born the characteristic of its generation is rise the characteristic of its change is fall the contemplation is knowledgePresentlyarisen feeling etc PsNaanakathaai He sees the rise of the materiality category in the sense of conditioned arising thus With the arising of ignorance with the arising of craving action with the arising of nutriment there is the arising of materiality one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the materiality CategoryOne who sees the rise of the materiality category sees these five characteristicsCessation and fall are treated in parallel manner and this treatment is applied to the four remaining categories but substituting contact for nutriment in the cases of feeling perception and formations and mentalitymateriality for nutriment in the case of consciousnessLastly a Sutta passage emphasizes a special relation with faithMateriality is impermanent changing becoming otherWhoever decides about places his faith in these dhammas in this way is called mature in faithHe has alighted upon the certainty of rightness Whoever has a liking to meditate by test of experiment with understanding upon these dhammas is called mature in the true ideaHe has alighted upon the certainty of rightness Whoever has a liking to meditate by test of experiment with understanding upon these dhammas is called mature in the true ideaHe has alighted upon the certainty of rightness SNvoliii fThis connection between faith and impermanence is taken up by the Visuddhimagga quoting the PatisambhidaamaggaWhen one gives attention to impermanence the faith faculty is outstanding and in the cases of attention to the unpleasant and notself the faculties of concentration and understanding are respectively outstandingThese three are called the Three gateways to liberation which lead to the outlet from the world VisChxxippff quoting PsVimokkhakathaavolii The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseTo the average man death is by no means a pleasant subject or talk for discussionIt is something dismal and oppressive  a veritable killjoy a fit topic for a funeral house onlyThe average man immersed as he is in the self ever seeking after the pleasurable ever pursuing that which excites and gratifies the senses refuses to pause and ponder seriously that these very objects of pleasure and gratification will some day reach their endIf wise counsel does not prevail and urge the unthinking pleasureseeking man to consider seriously that death can knock at his door also it is only the shock of a bereavement under his own roof the sudden and untimely death of a parent wife or child that will rouse him up from his delirious round of sensegratification and rudely awaken him to the hard facts of lifeThen only will his eyes open then only will he begin to ask himself why there is such a phenomenon as deathWhy is it inevitableWhy are there these painful partings which rob life of its joysTo most of us at some moment or another the spectacle of death must have given rise to the deepest of thoughts and profoundest of questionsWhat is life worth if able bodies that once performed great deeds now lie flat and cold senseless and lifelessWhat is life worth if eyes that once sparkled with joy eyes that once beamed with love are now closed forever bereft of movement bereft of lifeThoughts such as these are not to be repressedIt is just these inquiring thoughts if wisely pursued that will ultimately unfold the potentialities inherent in the human mind to receive the highest truthsAccording to the Buddhist way of thinking death far from being a subject to be shunned and avoided is the key that unlocks the seeming mystery of lifeIt is by understanding death that we understand life for death is part of the process of life in the larger senseIn another sense life and death are two ends of the same process and if you understand one end of the process you also understand the other endHence by understanding the purpose of death we also understand the purpose of lifeIt is the contemplation of death the intensive thought that it will some day come upon us that softens the hardest of hearts binds one to another with cords of love and compassion and destroys the barriers of caste creed and race among the peoples of this earth all of whom are subject to the common destiny of deathDeath is a great levelerPride of birth pride of position pride of wealth pride of power must give way to the allconsuming thought of inevitable deathIt is this leveling aspect of death that made the poet sayIt is the contemplation of death that helps to destroy the infatuation of sensepleasureIt is the contemplation of death that destroys vanityIt is the contemplation of death that gives balance and a healthy sense of proportion to our highly overwrought minds with their misguided sense of valuesIt is the contemplation of death that gives strength and steadiness and direction to the erratic human mind now wandering in one direction now in another without an aim without a purposeIt is not for nothing that the Buddha has in the very highest terms commended to his disciples the practice of mindfulness regarding deathThis is known as marananussati bhavana One who wants to practice it must at stated times and also every now and then revert to the thought maranam bhavissati  death will take placeThis contemplation of death is one of the classical meditationsubjects treated in the Visuddhi Magga which states that in order to obtain the fullest results one should practice this meditation in the correct way that is with mindfulness with a sense of urgency and with understandingFor example suppose a young disciple fails to realize keenly that death can come upon him at any moment and regards it as something that will occur in old age in the distant future his contemplation of death will be lacking strength and clarity so much so that it will run on lines which are not conducive to successHow great and useful is the contemplation of death can be seen from the following beneficial effects enumerated in the Visuddhi Magga  The disciple who devotes himself to this contemplation of death is always vigilant takes no delight in any form of existence gives up hankering after life censures evil doing is free from craving as regards the requisites of life his perception of impermanence becomes established he realizes the painful and soulless nature of existence and at the moment of death he is devoid of fear and remains mindful and selfpossessedFinally if in this present life he fails to attain to Nibbana upon the dissolution of the body he is bound for a happy destinyThus it will be seen that mindfulness of death not only purifies and refines the mind but also has the effect of robbing death of its fears and terrors and helps one at that solemn moment when he is gasping for his last breath to face that situation with fortitude and calmHe is never unnerved at the thought of death but is always prepared for itIt is such a man that can truly exclaim O death where is thy stingIn the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha has said Oh Monks there are ten ideas which if made to grow made much of are of great fruit of great profit for plunging into Nibbana for ending up in Nibbana Of these ten one is deathContemplation on death and on other forms of sorrow such as old age and disease constitutes a convenient starting point for the long line of investigation and meditation that will ultimately lead to RealityThis is exactly what happened in the case of the BuddhaWas it not the sight of an old man followed by the sight of a sick man and thereafter the sight of a dead man that made Prince Siddhattha living in the lap of luxury to give up wife and child home and the prospect of a kingdom and to embark on a voyage of discovery of truth a voyage that ended in the glory of Buddhahood and the bliss of NibbanaThe marked disinclination of the average man to advert to the problem of death the distaste that arouses in him the desire to turn away from it whenever the subject is broached are all due to the weakness of the human mind sometimes occasioned by fear sometimes by tanha or selfishness but at all times supported by ignoranceThe disinclination to understand death is no different from the disinclination of a man to subject himself to a medical checkup although he feels that something is wrong with himWe must learn to value the necessity to face factsSafety always lies in truthThe sooner we know our condition the safer are we for we can then take the steps necessary for our bettermentThe saying where ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise has no application hereTo live with no thought of death is to live in a fools paradiseVisuddhi Magga saysNow that we have understood why such potency attaches itself to reflections on death let us proceed to engage ourselves in such reflectionsThe first question that the reflecting mind would ask itself will be What is the cause of death Ask the physiologist what is death he will tell you that it is a cessation of the functioning of the human bodyAsk him what causes the cessation of the functioning of the human body he will tell you that the immediate cause is that the heart ceases to beatAsk him why the heart ceases to beat he will tell you that disease in any part of the human system if not arrested will worsen and cause a gradual degeneration and ultimate breakdown of some organ or other of the human system thus throwing an undue burden on the work of the heart  the only organ that pumps bloodHence it is disease that ultimately cause the cessation of the heart beatAsk the physiologist what causes the disease he well tell you that disease is the irregular functioning of the human body or by the violation of rules of healthy living or by an accident  each of which can impair some part or other of the human system thus causing diseaseAsk the physiologist what causes the entry of a germ or the violation of health rules or the occurrence of an accidentHe will have to answerI do not know I cannot say Certainly the physiologist cannot help us at this stage of our reflections of death since the question is beyond the realm of physiology and enters the realm of human conductWhen two persons are exposed to germ infection why should it sometimes be the man of lower resistance power who escapes the infection while the man of greater resistance succumbs to itWhen three persons tread the same slippery floor why should one slip and fall and crack his head and die while the second slips and sustains only minor injuries while the third does not slip at allThese are questions which clearly show that the answer is not to be expected from the physiologist whose study is the work of the human bodyNor is the answer to be expected from a psychologist whose study is the work of the human mind onlyFar far beyond the confines of physiology and psychology is the answer to be soughtIt is here that Buddhist philosophy becomes invitingIt is just here that the law of Kamma also called the law of Cause and Effect or the law of Action and Reaction makes a special appeal to the inquiring mindIt is Kamma that steps in to answer further questionsIt is Kamma that determines why one man should succumb to germinfection while the other should notIt is Kamma that decides why the three men treading the same slippery floor should experience three different resultsKamma sees to it that each man gets in life just what he deserves not more nor lessEach mans condition in life with its particular share of joys and sorrows is nothing more nor less than the result of his own past actions good and badThus we see that Kamma is a strict accountantEach man weaves his own web of fateEach man is the architect of his own fortuneAs the Buddha said in the Anguttara Nikaya Beings are the owners of their deedsTheir deeds are the womb from which they springWith their deeds they are bound upTheir deeds are their refugeWhatever deeds they do good or evil of such they will be heirs As actions are various reactions also are variousHence the varying causes of death to various persons under various situationsEvery cause has its particular effectEvery action has its particular reactionThis is the unfailing lawWhen Kamma is referred to as a law it must not be taken to mean something promulgated by the state or some governing bodyThat would imply the existence of a lawgiverIt is a law in the sense that it is a constant way of actionIt is in the nature of certain actions that they should produce certain resultsThat nature is also called lawIt is in this sense that we speak of the law of gravitation which causes a mango on the tree to fall to the ground not that there is a supreme external power or being which commands the mango to fallIt is in the nature of things the weight of the mango the attraction of the earth that the mango should fallIt is again a constant way of actionSimilarly in the realm of human conduct and human affairs the law of cause and effect of action and reaction operatesIt is not dependent on any extraneous arbitrary power but it is in the very nature of things that certain actions should produce certain resultsHence the birth and the death of a man is no more the result of an arbitrary power than the rise and fall of a treeNor is it mere chanceThere is no such thing as chanceIt is unthinkable that chaos rules the worldEvery situation every condition is a sequel to a previous situation and a previous conditionWe resort to the word chance when we do not know the causeSufficient has been said for us to know that in Kamma we find the root cause of deathWe also know that no arbitrary power fashions this Kamma according to its will or capriceIt is in the result of our own actionsYadisam vapate bijam tadisam harate phalam  as we sow so shall we reapKamma is not something generated in the closed box of the pastIt is always in the makingWe are by our actions every moment contributing to itHence the future is not all conditioned by the pastThe present is also conditioning itIf you fear death why not make the wisest use of the present so as to ensure a happy futureTo fear death on the one hand and on the other not to act in a way that would ensure a happy future is either madness or mental lethargyHe who leads a virtuous life harming none and helping whom he can in conformity with the Dhamma always remembering the Dhamma is without doubt laying the foundation of a happy future lifeDhammo have rakkhati dhamma carim  The Dhamma most assuredly protects him who lives in conformity with itSuch conformity is facilitated by the contemplation of deathDeath has no fears for one who is thus protected by DhammaThen shall he cheerful and unafraid be able to face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calmAnother approach to the understanding of death is through an understanding of the law of aggregates or Sankharas which states that everything is a combination of things and does not exist by itself as an independent entitySankhara is a Pali term used for an aggregation a combination or an assemblageThe word is derived from the prefix san meaning together and the root kar meaning to make The two together mean made together or constructed together or combined together All things in this world says the Buddha are aggregates or combinations That is to say they do not exist by themselves but are composed of several thingsAny one thing be it a mighty mountain or a minute mustard seed is a combination of several thingsThese things are themselves combinations of several other thingsNothing is a unity nothing is an entity large or smallNeither is the sun nor moon an entity nor is the smallest grain of sand an entityEach of them is a Sankhara a combination of several thingsThings seem to be entities owing to the fallibility of our senses  our faculties of sight hearing touching smelling and tasting and even thinkingScience has accepted the position that our senses are not infallible guides to usA permanent entity is only a concept only a nameIt does not exist in realityIn the famous dialogues between King Milinda and Thera Nagasena the latter wishing to explain to the King this law of aggregates enquired from the King how he came there whether on foot or ridingThe King replied that he came in a chariotWhere then Oh King asked Nagasena is this chariot in which you say you cameYou are a mighty king of all the continent of India and yet speak a lie when you say there is no chariotIn this way by sheer analysis by breaking up what is signified by chariot into its various component parts Nagasena was able to convince the King that a chariot as such does not exist but only component parts existSo much so that the King was able to answer thusSimilarly human being man I are mere names and terms not corresponding to anything that is really and actually existingIn the ultimate sense there exist only changing energiesThe term Sankhara however refers not only to matter and properties of matter known as corporeality but also to mind and properties of mind known as mentalityHence the mind is as much a combination or aggregate as the bodyWhen it is said the mind is a combination of several thoughts it is not meant that these several thoughts exist together simultaneously as do the different parts of the chariotWhat is meant is a succession of thoughts an unending sequence of thoughts now a thought of hatred thereafter a thought of sorrow thereafter a thought of duty near at hand and thereafter again the original thought of hatred etc etc in endless successionEach thought arises stays a while and passes onThe three stages of being are found here also  uppada thiti bhanga  arising remaining and passing awayThoughts arise one following the other with such a rapidity of succession that the illusion of a permanent thing called the mind is created but really there is no permanent thing but only a flow of thoughtsThe rapid succession of thoughts is compared to the flow of water in a river one drop following another in rapid succession that we seem to see a permanent entity in this flowBut this is an illusionSimilarly there is no such permanent entity as the mindIt is only a succession of thoughts a stream of thoughts that arise and pass awayIf I say that I crossed a river this morning and recrossed it in the evening is my statement true as regards what I crossed and what I recrossedWas it what I crossed in the morning that I crossed in the eveningIs it not one set of waters that I crossed in the morning and a different set of waters that I crossed in the eveningWhich of the two is the river or are there two rivers a morning river and an evening riverHad I recrossed at midday then there would also be a midday riverAsking oneself such questions one would see that every hour every minute it is a different riverWhere then is a permanent thing called riverIs it the river bed or the banksYou will now realize that there is nothing to which you can point out and say This is the river River exists only as a nameIt is a convenient and conventional mode of expression for a continuous unending flow of drops of waterJust such is the mindIt is a continuous stream of thoughtsCan you point to any one thought that is passing through the mind and say This truly is my mind my permanent mind A thought of anger towards a person may arise in meIf that thought is my permanent mind how comes it that on a later occasion a thought of love towards the same person can arise in meIf that too is my permanent mind then there are two opposing permanent mindsQuestioning on these lines one comes to the inevitable conclusion that there is no such thing as a permanent mind it is only a convenient expression for an incessant and variegated stream of thoughts that arise and pass awayMind does not exist in realityIt exists only in name as an expression for a succession of thoughtsChariot  river  body and mind  these are all combinationsBy themselves and apart from these combinations they do not existThere is nothing intrinsically stable in them nothing corresponding to reality nothing permanent no eternally abiding substratum or soulThus if body is only a name for a combination of changing factors and the mind is likewise only a name for a succession of thoughts the psychophysical combination called man is not an entity except by way of conventional speechSo when we say a chariot moves or a man walks it is correct only figuratively or conventionallyActually and really in the ultimate sense there is only a movement there is only a walkingHence has it been said in the Visuddhi MaggaNow how does this cold and relentless analysis of mind and body become relevant to the question of deathThe relevancy is just thisWhen analysis reveals that there is no person but only a process that there is no doer but only a deed we arrive at the conclusion that there is no person who dies but that there is only a process of dyingMoving is a process walking is a process so dying is also a processJust as there is no hidden agent back and behind the process of moving or walking so there is no hidden agent back and behind the process of dyingIf only we are capable of keeping more and more to this abhidhammic view of things we will be less and less attached to things we will be less and less committing the folly of identifying ourselves with our actionsThus shall we gradually arrive at a stage when we grasp the view so difficult to comprehend that all life is just a processIt is one of the grandest realizations that can descend on deluded manIt is so illuminating so enlighteningIt is indeed a revelationWith the appearance of that realization there is a disappearance of all worries and fears regarding deathThat is a logical sequenceJust as with the appearance of light darkness must disappear even so the light of knowledge dispels the darkness of ignorance fear and worryWith realization with knowledge these fears and worries will be shown as being empty and unfoundedIt is so very easy to keep on declaring thisWhat is difficult is to comprehend thisWhy is it so difficultBecause we are so accustomed to thinking in a groove because we are so accustomed to overlook the fallacies in our thinking because we are so accustomed to wrong landmarks and wrong routes in our mental journeying we are reluctant to cut out a new pathIt is we who deny ourselves the benefits of samma ditthiThe inveterate habit of identifying ourselves with our actions is the breeding ground of that inviting belief that there is some subtle ego back and behind all our actions and thoughtsThis is the arch mischief maker that misleads usWe fail to realize that the egofeeling within us is nothing more than the plain and simple stream of consciousness that is changing always and is never the same for two consecutive momentsAs Professor James said The thoughts themselves are the thinkersIn our ignorance we hug the belief that this egoconsciousness is the indication of the presence of some subtle elusive soulIt is just the minds reaction to objectsWhen we walk we fail to realize that it is just the process of walking and nothing elseWe hug the fallacy that there is something within us that directs the walkingWhen we think we hug the fallacy that there is something within us that thinksWe fail to realize that it is just the process of thinking and nothing elseNothing short of profound meditation on the lines indicated in the Satipatthana Sutta can cure us of our miccha ditthiThe day we are able by such meditation to rid ourselves of these cherished false beliefs against which the Buddha has warned us times without number beliefs which warp our judgment and cloud our vision of things shall we be able to develop that clarity of vision which alone can show us things as they actually areThen only will the realization dawn on us that there is no one who suffers dying but there is only a dying process just as much as living is also a processIf one can train oneself to reflect on these lines it must necessarily mean that he is gradually giving up the undesirable and inveterate habit of identifying oneself with ones bodily and mental processes and that he is gradually replacing that habit by a frequent contemplation on anattaSuch contemplation will result in a gradual relaxation of our tight grip on our fond ego When one thus ceases to hug the egodelusion the stage is reached when there is complete detachment of the mind from such allurementsThen shall one be able cheerful and unafraid to face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calmWe have seen how reflections on the great law of Kamma and the great law of Aggregates or Sankharas can assist us to form a correct view of death and help us to face death in the correct attitudeNow there is a third great law a knowledge of which can assist us in the same way namely the law of change or aniccaIt is the principle behind the first noble truth the truth of dukkha or DisharmonyIt is precisely because there is change or lack of permanency in anything and everything in this world that there is suffering or disharmony in this worldThis principle of change is expressed by the well known formula Anicca vata sankhara  all sankharas are impermanent Nothing in this world is stable or staticTime moves everything whether we like it or notTime moves us also whether we like it or notNothing in this world can arrest the ceaseless passage of time and nothing survives timeThere is no stability anywhereChange rules the worldEverything mental and physical is therefore transitory and changingThe change may be quick or the change may be perceptible or it may be imperceptibleWe live in an ever changing world while we ourselves are also all the while changingA sankhara we have learned is a combination of several factorsThese factors are also subject to the law of changeThey are changing factorsHence a Sankhara is not merely a combination of several factorsIt is a changing combination of changing factors since the combination itself is changingIt is because there is change that there is growthIt is because there is change that there is decayGrowth also leads to decay because there is changeWhy do flowers bloom only to fadeIt is because of the operation of the law of changeIt is this law that makes the strength of youth give way to the weakness of old ageIt is on account of the operation of the law that though great buildings are erected towering towards the sky some distant day will see them totter and tumbleIt is this aspect of the law of change the process of disintegration that causes color to fade iron to rust and timber to rotIt is such reflections that must have led the poet Gray contemplating a burial ground in a country church yard to saySometimes the working of this law is not apparentEven that which looks so solid and substantial as a rocky mountain will not always remain as suchScience tells us that maybe after thousands of years it will wear down by the process of disintegration and that where a lake now is a mountain once wasIf things arise they must fall Uppajjitva nirujjhanti says the Buddha  having arisen they fallAeons and aeons ago the earth and the moon were oneToday while the earth is still warm and alive the moon is cold and deadThe earth too science tells us is very slowly but surely losing its heat and waterGradually and slowly it is cooling downAeons and aeons hence it will cease to support lifeIt will be a cold and lifeless planetIt will be a second moonThis is just one of several instances where the mighty law of change works imperceptiblyThe Buddha also has foretold the end of the earthJust as the law of change can cause decline and decay it can also cause growth and progressHence it is that a seed becomes a plant and a plant becomes a tree and a bud becomes a flowerBut again there is no permanency in growthGrowth again gives way to decayThe plant must dieThe flower must witherIt is an unending cycle of birth and death integration and disintegration of rise and fallHence it is that Shelley has aptly saidIt is no arbitrary power that brings about these changes progressive and retrogressiveThe tendency to change is inherent in all thingsThe law of change does not merely declare that things change but also declares that change is of the very essence of the thingsThink of anything and you will find it to be a mode of change and a condition of changeChange is the working hypothesis of the scientistOne of the mightiest tasks of the scientist also his proudest boast was to destroy the idea of stability and fixity in the organic worldWe have heard of the supposed entity of the atom being shown up as a combination of energiesWhile science has applied the law of change to the physical domain to split up unity into diversity the Buddha has applied the selfsame law to the entire mindbody complex and split up the seeming unity of being into the five aggregates known as Pañcakkhandha The Buddha has gone further and explained why this aggregate is temporary why it should some day disintegrate and why a fresh integration should arise upon the disintegrationEverything works upon a triple principle of uppada thiti and bhanga  arising remaining and passing awayEven in the case of a thought these three stages are presentWhen the Buddha dealt with the four chief elements of the world of matter and showed that they too are subject to the great law of change he proceeded to show that the human body which is also formed of the same elements must necessarily be subject to the same great law of changeWhat then of this fathomlong body asked the BuddhaIs there anything here of which it may rightly be said I or mine or amNay verily nothing whatsoeverThe sooner one appreciates the working of this law of change the more will one be able to profit by it attuning oneself to that way of living that way of thinking and speaking and acting where this law will work to his best advantageThe man who knows the subtle working of this law of change will also know how nama can change by purposeful actionHowever deeply he gets involved in evil he will not regard evil as a permanent obstruction because he knows that the evil mind can also changeHe knows that by constant contemplation on what is good good thoughts tend to arise in the mindThe constant contemplation of good will cause kusala sankharas to arise in the mind and these kusala sankharas will dislodge the akusala sankharas  a process which hitherto appeared to him to be impossibleWhen his thoughts and tendencies change for the better when his mind is permeated thus with good tendencies his speech and deeds automatically change for the better  a pleasant surprise for himWith purer and purer conduct thus acquired deeper and deeper concentration is possibleIncreased power to concentrate accelerates the pace towards the achievement of that Highest Wisdom known as paññaThus the bad in him changes into goodA bad man changes into a good manBy purposeful action the law of change is made to operate to his highest benefitHe now becomes a good man in the truest sense of the wordThe good man is always a happy manHe has no fear of death because he has no fear of the life beyondOf such a man has it been said in the DhammapadaThe powerful change brought about in his life will ensure upon its dissolution the birth of a more fortunate being  a result which he can confidently expect at his dying momentNot for him then are the fears and terrors of deathFurthermore when one follows minutely the working of the Law of Change in respect of ones own body and mind and also in respect of anothers body and mind one begins to acquire so close a familiarity with change that death will not appear as just one more example of the process of change to which one has been subject all along since birthIt will appear as something to be expected something that must occur to fit in with what had occurred earlierTo one who can thus reflect on death there is nothing to fearCheerful and unafraid he can face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calmThere is another angle from which we can study death and that is from the angle of law of conditionality which is closely akin to the law of anicca or ChangeNot only are sankharas made up of several things but they are also conditioned by several factors and when these conditioning factors cease to exist the conditioned thing also ceases to existThis is the law of conditionality and has been thus expressed in very general terms Imasmim sati idam hoti  when this exists that exists Imassa uppada idam uppajjati  when this arises that arisesImasmim asati idam na hoti  when this is not that is notImassa nirodha idam nirujjhanti  when this ceases that ceasesAs this principle is of universal applicability the working of the process of life and death also comes within its operationThe chain of lifeconditioning factors consists of twelve links or nidanas which together are known as the paticca samuppada or Law of Dependent OriginationA knowledge of this law is most necessaryIn the Mahanidana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya Buddha addressing Ananda said It is through not understanding through not penetrating this doctrine that these beings have become entangled like a ball of threadThe formula of Dependent Origination runs as followsThis is the process that goes on and on ad infinitumHence has it been saidThis important law is easier told than understoodThis is one of the profoundest doctrines preached by the BuddhaIt is only frequent and hard thinking on it that will bring out its deepest meaningsThis is not the place to explain these twelve links in full but in order to dispel some of the misconception surrounding the notion of death it is necessary to make some observations on the first link  avijja or Ignorance and thereafter on the second and third links vizactivities and consciousness because it is these two links that involve death and rebirthThese twelve links it must be understood do not represent a pure succession of cause and effect a straight line of action and reactionIt is wrong to call this a causal series as it is not a chain of causes in strict sequence of timeSome of the links arise simultaneously and the next is of condition rather than causeThere are modes of conditioning which may operate in the relation of one factor to anotherEach factor is both conditioning and conditionedMany of these factors are both simultaneously and interdependently workingA few observations now on the first link of avijja or ignoranceWhen it is said the Ignorance is the first link it does not mean that Ignorance is the first cause of existenceThe Buddha has definitely said that the first cause the ultimate origin of things is unthinkable Anamataggayam sansaro pubbakoit na paññayati Beginningless O monks is this course of existenceA starting point is not to be found Bertrand Russell has stated There is no reason to suppose that this world had a beginning at allThe idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our imaginationIgnorance then is not the primary origin of things but is the originating factor of suffering in the process of life and death so far as man is concernedAll the twelve factors are continuing factorsIt is only if we ponder deeply that we will be convinced of this truth namely that there can be no beginning to a process that has no endWhat is meant by Ignorance as being the first link in the seriesBy Ignorance is here meant the Ignorance of the essentially fundamental facts of existence namely the fact of suffering or disharmony the fact of the cessation of suffering or disharmony and the fact of the way leading to the cessation of suffering or disharmonyIn other words it is the ignorance of that which the Buddha has called the Four Noble TruthsIgnorance is always a dangerous conditionIn such a condition you are at the mercy of everyone and everythingThe second link is ActivitiesBy Activities is here meant volitional activities called in Pali sankharaThe formula states  Dependent upon Ignorance arise activities This means that ignorance of the essentially fundamental facts of life becomes a conditioning factor for the volitional activities of manIt is only a knowledge and a realization of the Four Noble Truths that according to the Buddha enables a man to see things as they actually areIn the state of ignorance of these Truths man prevented as he is from seeing things as they actually are adopts various courses of actionThese activities are not merely the outcome of ignorance once and for all but ignorance continues to condition these volitional activities so long as existence continuesThese volitional activities or mental energies are multifariousIn the context of the paticca samuppada Sankhara can therefore be said to signify Kamma or Kammic Volition The first link of Ignorance and the second link of Activities refer to the past birthThe next eight links refer to the present existence and the last two refer to the future existenceThe third link is viññana or ConsciousnessThe formula states  Dependent upon Activities arises Consciousness By consciousness is here meant relinking consciousness or rebirth consciousnessBy this formula is therefore meant that the conscious life of man in his present birth is conditioned by his volitional activities his good and bad actions his Kamma of the past lifeTo put it in another way the consciousness of his present life is dependent on his past KammaThis formula is highly important since it involves a linking of the past life with the present and thereby implies rebirthHence this third link is called patisandhi viññana or relinking consciousness or rebirth consciousnessIt may be wondered how activities of the past life can condition a present birthMaterial sciences seek to explain birth on the premises of the present existence onlyThe biologist says that it is the union of father with mother that conditions birthAccording to the Buddha these two conditioning factors by themselves are insufficient to result in birth otherwise every complete union of father with mother should result in birthThese two are purely physical factors and it is illogical to expect that a psychophysical organism a mindbody combination known as man could arise from two purely physical factors without the intervention of a psychical or mental factorTherefore says the Buddha a third factor is also necessary in addition to the two purely physical factors of the sperm and the ovumThis third factor is patisandhiviññana or relinking consciousnessThe wick and the oil will not alone produce a flameYou may drown a wick in gallons of oil but there will never be a flameYou may use a wick of the most inflammable type but there will never be a flameNot until a bright spark of light comes from elsewhere will the action of the oil and the wick produce a flameWe have considered that the activities of the past are certain energies  mental energiesThe Kamma of the past releases these energies which are potent enough to create the condition for the being to be reborn in an appropriate place according to the nature of activities performedThese energies it is that produce the patisandhi viññana the third factorIt will thus be seen that these potential energies work in cooperation with the physical laws to condition the natural formation of the embryo in the mothers wombJust as sleep is no bar to the continuance of bodily operations in consequence of the principle of life continuing within it even so death is no bar to the continuance of the operation of being which is only transformed to another suitable realm or plane there to be reborn and to relive in consequence of the willtolive remaining alive and unabated at the moment of dissolutionThe lifestream the process of being thus continues while the Kammic forces it generates give it shape and form in the appropriate sphere of existence investing it with its new characteristics and securing for it a local habitation and a nameA seed coming in contact with the soil produces a plant but the plant is not born of the seed and the soil onlyThere are other factors drawn from unseen extraneous sources that come into play such as light and air and moistureIt is the combined presence of all these factors that provide the opportunity for the birth of the plantThe unseen extraneous factor where the birth of a being is concerned is the terminating kammic energy of the dying man or to express it in another way the reproductive power of the willtoliveIs there any need to doubt the potency of the past Kamma to create a present existenceDo you doubt that the activities of one existence can condition consciousness in another existenceIf so calmly reflect on the incessant and multifarious nature of human activities the one feature of human life the unfailing characteristic of every moment of individual existenceWhen you have sufficiently grasped the fact of the incessant and multifarious nature of human activities ask yourself the question who or what propels these activitiesA little reflection will reveal that the activities of man are propelled by a myriad of desires and cravings which ultimately spring from the desire to liveThis willtolive by whatever name you may call it motivates all activitiesWe eat we earn we acquire we struggle we advance we hate we love we plot we plan we deceive  all in order that we may continue livingEven the desire to commit suicide paradoxical as it may seem arises from the desire to live  to live free from entanglements and disappointmentsJust consider the cumulative effect of hundreds of desirepropelled activities performed by us day by day hour by hour minute by minute for a long period of yearsThese are all Kammas these are all energies releasedThese are all strong creative forces that are generatedIt is difficult to imagine that with the present life will end all the desireforces it has brought into existenceThere will always be at any given moment an outstanding balance of unexpected Kammic energiesThese powers energies or forces contain within themselves the potentialities of attracting for themselves the conditions for further existenceThese energies or forces are potent enough to create the conditions for reliving when the body which sustained these forces ceases to liveThese then will constitute the terminating Kammic energy of the dying man or to express the same idea in another way this is the reproductive power of the willtoliveIn short the willtolive makes it possible to reliveNow we see how the terminating Kammic energy of the dying man becomes the third factor the psychical factor which along with the two physical factors of the sperm and the ovum conditions future birthIt is this relinking consciousness that becomes the nucleus of a new namarupa or mindbody combinationThis is the resultant terminal energy generated by the volitional activities of the pastScience teaches us that energy is indestructible but that it can be transmuted into other forms of energyWhy then cannot these powerful energies of the past Kamma impelled as they are by the pulsation of craving and motivated as they are by the willtolive continue to exert their potent influences albeit in some other manner and in some other sphereWhat is it that travels from one existence to another you may askDo activities travel or do their resultant forces travelOr does consciousness itself travelThe answer is an emphatic No None of these travel but the Kammic energy of actions performed is a tremendous force or power which can make its influence felt and to effect this influence distance is no barDistance is never a bar to Kammic energies making themselves feltIn the Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta of Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha strongly reprimanded the bhikkhu Sati for declaring as the Buddhas teachings that viññana or consciousness travels from existence to existenceFoolish man said the Buddha has not consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of in many a figure of speech by me saying apart from conditions there is no origination of consciousness No physical contact is necessary for mind to influence matterSir William Crooke in his Edinburgh lectures on mental science has said It has also been proved by experiment that by an act of will the mind can cause objects such as metal levers to moveWhen the matter on which mental energies act is situated far away in other planes and spheres of existence we are only employing a figure of speech when we say that Kamma has traveled or that energy has traveledMany a simile has been employed by the Buddha to show that nothing travels or transmigrates from one life to anotherIt is just a process of one condition influencing anotherThe resultant Kammic energies of human activity not yet expanded are so powerful that they can condition the formation of an embryo in another world and give it consciousnessOne important point must not be overlookedThe patisandhiviññana or relinking consciousness arises only in the unborn childIn the prenatal stage the relinking consciousness may be said to exist only passively and not actively since the child is still part of the body of the mother and has no separate independent existence nor does it contact the external worldWhen however the child is born and assumes a separate existence and begins to contact the external world then it may be said that the bhavanga nature of the prenatal state of mind gives way for the first time to a fully conscious mind process the vithicittaDistance is no bar to the sequence of cause and effectReference had already been made to the Buddhas reprimand of a bhikkhu called Sati for declaring as having been taught by the Buddha that consciousness passes from existence to existenceIn the relinking consciousness arises the whole energy of the previous consciousness and thus the embryo while inheriting the characteristics of the new parents inherits also the impressions of the past experiences of the dying manHow else can one explain characteristics not accounted for by heredityHow else can one account for different characteristics in twins born of the same parents and growing under the same environmentWe have now studied death from several anglesFrom whatever angle we look at death it is an integral part of the great process of lifeDeath is like the break up of an electric bulbThe light is extinguished but not the current and when a fresh bulb is fixed the light reappearsSimilarly there is a continuity of life current the break up of the present body does not extinguish the current of Kammic energy which will manifest itself in an appropriate fresh bodyThe simile is not on all fours with lifeWhereas there is nothing to bring the electric current and the fresh bulb together the type of life led the nature of thought entertained the quality of deeds performed will be strong enough to cause an immediate relinking consciousness of like nature to arise on the principle that like attracts likeThus the dying man is drawn to an environment good or bad which he has created for himself by his thought word and deed for on these depend the nature of our future lifeEvery moment we are creating our futureEvery moment then we must be carefulIf we can visualize the immensity of the past and the immensity of the future the present loses its seemingly compelling importanceIf we could but visualize the vistas of innumerable births and deaths through which we will pass in the future we should not we could not fear just this one death out of the endless series of birth and deaths rises and falls appearances and disappearances which constitute the ceaseless process of samsaric lifeThere is yet another law the understanding of which helps in the understanding of deathIt is the Law of Becoming or bhava which is a corollary to the Law of Change or aniccaBecoming or bhava is also one of the factors in the scheme of Dependent OriginationAccording to Buddhism the Law of Becoming like the Law of Change is constantly at work and applies to everythingWhile the Law of Change states that nothing is permanent but is everchanging the Law of Becoming states that everything is always in the process of changing into something elseNot only is everything changing but the nature of that change is a process of becoming something elseNot only is everything changing but the nature of that change is a process of becoming something else however short or long the process may beBriefly put the Law of Becoming is this Nothing is but is becoming A ceaseless becoming is the feature of all thingsA small plant is always in the process of becoming an old treeThere is no point of time at which anything is not becoming something elseRhys Davids in his American lectures has said In every case as soon as there is a beginning there begins also at that moment to be an endingIf you stand by the sea and watch how wave upon wave rises and falls one wave merging into the next one wave becoming another you will appreciate that this entire world is also just that  becoming and becomingIf you can stand by a bud continuously until it becomes a flower you will be amazed to see that the condition of the bud at one moment appears to be no different from its condition at the next moment and so on until before your very eyes the change has taken place through you could not discern it at allThe process is so gradual one stage merging into the next so imperceptiblyIt is a becomingIf you close your eyes to this process if you see the bud one day and then see it a day later then only will you see a changeThen only will you speak in the terms of buds and flowers and not in terms of a process of a becomingIf you can keep on looking at a newborn babe without a break for ten years you will not perceive any changeThe baby born at amappears just the same at amor at noonEach moment shows no difference from the nextOne condition merges into the next so imperceptiblyIt is a becoming a continuous process of becomingClose your eyes to this process and see the baby once a monththen only will you perceive a changeThen only can you speak in terms of baby and boy and not in terms of a process or a becomingIf you think you can watch minutely the progress of time see whether you can divide it into present past and future as do grammarians speaking of present tense past tense and future tenseIn the view of Buddhist philosophy time is one continuous process each fragmentary portion of time merging into the other and forming such an unbroken continuity that no dividing line can precisely be drawn separating past time from present or present time from futureThe moment you think of the present and say to yourself this moment is present time it is gone  vanished into the past before you can even complete your sentenceThe present is always slipping into the past becoming the past and the future is always becoming the presentEverything is becomingThis is a universal process a constant fluxIt is when we miss the continuity of action that we speak in terms of things rather than processes or becomingsBiology says that the human body undergoes a continual change all the cells composing the body being replaced every seven yearsAccording to Buddhism changes in the body are taking place every momentAt no two consecutive moments is the body the sameIn the last analysis it is a stream of atoms or units of matter of different types which are every moment arising and passing awayThe body is thus constantly dying and reliving within this existence itselfThis momentary death takes place every moment of our existenceIn the Visuddhi Magga it is said that in the ultimate sense the life span of living beings is extremely short being only as much as the duration of a single conscious momentJust as a chariot wheel continues the Visuddhi Magga when it is rolling touches the ground at one point only of the circumference of its tire so too the life of living beings lasts only for a single conscious momentWhen that consciousness has ceased the being is said to have ceased Thus we see that every moment of our lives we are dying and being rebornThis being so why should we dread just one particular moment of death the moment that marks the end of this existenceWhen there are innumerable moments of death why fear the occurrence of one particular momentIgnorance of the momentary nature of death makes us fearful of the particular death that takes place at the last moment of existence here especially as the next moment of living is not seen nor understoodThe last moment in this existence is just one of the innumerable moments of death that will follow itIt is not life in this existence only that is a process of becomingThe process of becoming continues into the next existence also because there is a continuity of consciousnessThe last consciousness in one life is followed by what is known as a relinking consciousness in the next lifeThe process of one consciousness giving rise to another continues unbroken the only difference being a change in the place where such consciousness manifests itselfDistance is no bar to the sequence of cause and effectLife is a process of grasping and becoming and death is a change of the thing grasped leading to a new becomingGrasping is a continuous feature where human living is concernedIt is this grasping that leads to becomingWhat causes graspingWhere there is thirst there is graspingIt is this thirst this desire this craving this willtolive this urge which is known as tanha that causes graspingThe Kammic energy resulting from this tanha is like fireIt always keeps on burning and is always in search of fresh material upon which it can sustain itselfIt is ever in search of fresh conditions for its continued existenceAt the moment of the dissolution of the body that unexpected desireenergy that residuum of Kamma grasps fresh fuel and seeks a fresh habitation where it can sustain itselfThus proceeds the continuous flux of grasping and becoming which is lifeLet us now examine the unduly dreaded dying moment which marks the end of mans present existence only to commence anotherThe physical condition of any dying man is so weak that the volitional control by the mind at the dying moment lacks the power to choose its own thoughtsThis being so the memory of some powerfully impressive and important event of the dying mans present existence will force itself upon the threshold of his mind the forcible entry of which thought he is powerless to resistThis thought which is known as the maranasaññajavana thought and precedes the cuticitta or terminal thought can be one of three typesFirstly it can be the thought of some powerfully impressive act done which the dying man now recalls to mindSecondly the powerfully impressive act of the past can be recalled by way of a symbol of that act as for instance if he had stolen money from a safe he may see the safeThirdly the powerfully impressive act of the past may be recalled by way of a sign or indication of the place where he is destined to be reborn by reason of such act as for instance when a man who has done great charitable acts hears beautiful divine musicThis is called gati nimitta or the sign of destinationIt is symbolic of his place of rebirthThese three types of thoughtobjects which he cannot consciously choose for himself are known as death signs and any one of them as the case may be will very strongly and vividly appear to the consciousness of the dying manThen follows the cuti citta or terminal thought or death consciousnessThis last thought series is most important since it fashions the nature of his next existence just as the last thought before going to sleep can become the first thought on awakeningNo extraneous or arbitrary power does this for himHe does this for himself unconsciously as it wereIt is the most important act of his life good or bad that conditions the last thought moment of a lifeThe kamma of this action is called garuka kamma or weighty KammaIn the majority of cases the type of act which men habitually perform and for which they have the strongest liking becomes the last active thoughtThe ruling thought in life becomes strong at deathThis habitual kamma is called acinna kammaThe idea of getting a dying man to offer cloth to the Sangha or the idea of chanting sacred texts to him is in order to help him to obtain a good terminal thought for himself by way of asañña kamma or deathproximate Kamma but the powerful force of inveterate habit can supervene and in spite of the chantings by the most pious monks available the memory of bad deeds repeatedly performed may surge up to his consciousness and become the terminal thoughtThe reverse can also occurIf the last few acts and thoughts of a person about to die are powerfully bad however good he had been earlier then his terminal thought may be so powerfully bad that it may prevent the habitually good thought from surging up to his consciousness as is said to have happened in the case of Queen Mallika the wife of King Pasenadi of KosalaShe lived a life full of good deeds but at the dying moment what came to her mind was the thought of a solitary bad deed doneAs a result she was born in a state of misery where she suffered but it was only for seven daysThe effects of the good Kamma were suspended only temporarilyThere is a fourth type of Kamma that can cause the terminal thought to ariseThis last type prevails when any of the foregoing three types of Kamma is not presentIn that event one of the accumulated reserves of the endless past is drawn outThis is called katatta kamma or storedup KammaOnce the terminal thought arises then follows the process of thought moments lawfully linked with itThis terminal thought process is called maranasañña javana vithiThe terminal thought goes through the same stages of progress as any other thought with this differences that whereas the apperceptive stage of complete cognition known as javana or impulsion which in the case of any other thought occupies seven thoughtmomentsAt this apperceptive stage the dying person fully comprehends the deathsignThen follows the stage of registering consciousness when the deathsign is identifiedThis consciousness arises for two thoughtmoments and passes awayAfter this comes the stage of death consciousnessThen occurs deathThis is what happens in this existenceNow let us consider what happens in the next existenceAlready the preliminaries for the arrival of a new being are in preparationThere is the male parent and there is the female parentAs explained previously a third factor a psychic factor is necessary to complete the preliminaries for the arising of a live embryo and that is the relinking consciousness which arises in the next existence in the appropriate setting  the mothers wombOn the conjunction of these three factors life starts in the mothers wombThere is no lapse of time no stoppage of the unending stream of consciousnessNo sooner has the deathconsciousness in the dying man passed away than rebirth consciousness arises in some other state of existenceThere is nothing that has traveled from this life to the nextEven the terminal thought did not travelIt had the power to give rise to the passive or bhavanga stateAt the moment of birth which marks a separate existence through contact with the outer world the unconscious or subconscious bhavanga state gives way to the vithicitta or conscious mindFrom birth onwards activity again comes into play propelled by desire in some form or anotherSo proceeds the onward course of the lifeflux desirepropelled and desiremotivatedNow what is the relevancy of a knowledge of the law of conditionality to the question of our attitude towards deathOnce we thoroughly comprehend the fact that the will to live proceeds from life to life we come to appreciate the view that this life and the next is but one continuous processSo also the life following and the next thereafterTo one who understands life thus as nothing more nor less than a long continuous process there is no more reason to grieve at death than at lifeThey are part of the same process  the process of grasping the process of giving effect to the willtoliveDeath is only a change in the thing graspedThe man enriched with the knowledge of the law of conditionality comprehends that birth induces death and death induces birth in the round of sansaric lifeHe therefore cannot possibly be perturbed at deathTo him birth is death and death is birthAn appreciation of the law of conditionality will reveal to him the importance of living his life well and when he has lived his life well death is the birth of greater opportunities to live a still better lifeThat is how he regards deathIt all depends on the way one looks at deathSuppose there is only one gate to a house is that an exit gate or an entrance gateTo one who is on the road side of the gate it is an entrance gateTo the inmate of the house it is an exit gate but for both of them it is the selfsame gate which is thus differently viewedAs Dahlke says Dying is nothing but a backward view of life and birth is nothing but a forward view of death In truth birth and death are phases of an unbroken process of graspingDeath is a departure to those whom the dying man leaves behindIt is also an arrival to the members of the new family into which he is rebornIt is death or birth according to the way we look at it but we can only be oneway observersIf we observe the deathprocess we are not in a position to observe the birth process and if we observe the birth process we are not in a position to observe the death processSo birth and death do not get coordinated in our minds as one connected processBy our failure to see the close sequence of the two processes the coordination of birth with death or death with birth we are led to the illusion or at least the wish that we can have the one without the otherWe want life but we do not want deathThis is an impossibilityClinging to life is clinging to deathThe salient feature of life is clinginggrasping  and the logical result of clinging according to the law of conditionality is deathIf you want to avert death you have to avert life you have to reverse the process of conditionalityThis can only be done by abandoning the desire to cling the desire to graspLet there be no attachment to lifeIf you attach yourself unduly to the things of life happiness you may have for a brief time but some day when the things to which you have attached yourself disintegrate and disappear as they must by virtue of that mighty law of change working in conjunction with the equally mighty law of conditionality then the very objects of joy become objects of sorrowTo your disappointment and disgust you will find that all sources of earthly joy are sources of sorrowYou will then agree with the poet who said Earths sweetest joy is but pain disguised As great was the joy of attachment so great will be the sorrow of detachmentIs not this sufferingIs not this wearisome  one day to pursue a phantom with excitement next day to abandon it with disgust one day to be exalted and the next day to be depressedHow long will your sense of selfrespect allow you to be thrown up and down this way and that like a footballIs it not far more satisfactory far more dignified far safer and far wiser to go through life unattachedIf misfortune has to come it will if sickness has to come it willWe cannot change the events of life but we can certainly change our attitude towards themThe laws of change and conditionality will help us hereFears and sorrows will change into hopes and joysTo such a one living a life of calm and peace viewing life with equanimity death holds no fears and terrorsCheerful and unafraid he can face the phenomenon of death with fortitude and calmLet us now consider the cases of two persons who were overpowered with grief at the bereavement they had to sufferFirst let us consider the case of PatacaraShe lost her husband who was bitten by a snakeShe was too weak to cross a river with both her children  a new born babe and a child about one year oldSo she left the elder child on the bank and waded through the water with her newborn babe with the greatest difficultyHaving reached the thither shore and having left the newborn babe there she was returning through the water to reach the elder childShe had hardly reached midstream when a hawk swooped down on the newborn babe and carried it away thinking it to be a piece of fleshWhen Patacara seeing this cried out in frantic grief raising both her hands the elder child on the other bank thinking that his mother was calling him ran into the river and was drownedAlone weeping and lamenting she was proceeding now to her parental home whither she had intended going with her husband and her two children when one by one these calamities occurredAs she was proceeding she met a man returning from her home town and inquired from him about her parents and her brotherThis man gave the dismal news that owing to a severe storm the previous day her parental house had come down destroying both her father and her mother and also her brotherAs he spoke he pointed to some smoke rising into the air far away and said That is the smoke rising from the one funeral pyre in which are burning the bodies of your father mother and brother Completely distracted with grief she ran about like a mad woman regardless of her falling garmentsAgony was gnawing at her heart agony of the most excruciating typeAdvised to go to the Buddha she went and explained her plightWhat did the Buddha tell herPatacara be no more troubledThis is not the first time thou hast wept over the loss of a husbandThis is not the first time thou hast wept over the loss of parents and of brothersJust as today so also through this round of existence thou hast wept over the loss of so many countless husbands countless sons countless parents and countless brothers that the tears thou has shed are more abundant than the waters of the four oceans As the Buddha spoke these words of wisdom and consolation Patacaras grief grew less and less intense and finally not only did her grief leave her altogether but when the Buddha preached to her and concluded his discourse Patacara reached the stage of streamentry the first stage of sainthoodNow what is it that contributed to the removal of grief from the mind of PatacaraIt is the keen realization of the universality of deathPatacara realized that she had lived innumerable lives that she had suffered bereavement innumerable times and that death is something which is always occurringWhile Patacara realized the universality of death by reference to her own numerous bereavements in the past Kisagotami realized it by reference to the numerous bereavements occurring to others around her in this life itselfWhen her only child died her grief was so great that she clung to the dead body not allowing any one to cremate itThis was the first bereavement she had ever experiencedWith the dead child firmly held to her body she went from house to house inquiring for some medicine that would bring back life to her childShe was directed to the Buddha who asked her to procure a pinch of white mustard seed but it should be from a house where no death had taken placeShe then went in search of this supposed cure for her child which she thought was easy to obtainAt the very first house she asked for it but when she inquired whether any death had taken place under that roof she received the reply What sayest thou womanAs for the living they be few as for the dead they be many She then went to the next houseThere also she came to know that death had made its visit to that house as wellShe went to many houses and in all of them she was told of some father who had died or of some son who had died or of some other relative or friend who had diedWhen evening came she was tired of her hopeless taskShe heard the word death echoing from every houseShe realized the universality of deathShe buried the dead child in the forest then went back to the Buddha and said I thought it was I only who suffered bereavementI find it in every houseI find that in every village the dead are more in number than the living Not only was Kisagotami cured of her grief but at the end of the discourse which the Buddha delivered to her she too attained the stage of streamentryLet us now contrast the cases of Patacara and Kisagotami with that of the ignorant rustic farmer the Bodhisatta was in a former life as mentioned in the Uraga JatakaRustic though he was he practiced mindfulness on death to perfectionHe had trained himself to think every now and then Death can at any moment come to us This is something on which the majority of us refuse to do any thinking at allNot only did he make it a habit to think so but he even saw to it that all members of his household did the sameOne day while he was working with his son in the field the latter was stung by a snake and died on the spotThe father was not one bit perturbedHe just carried the body to the foot of a tree covered it with a cloak neither weeping nor lamenting and resumed his plowing unconcernedLater he sent word home through a passerby to send up one parcel of food instead of two for the midday meal and to come with perfumes and flowersWhen the message was received his wife knew what it meant but she too did not give way to expressions of grief neither did her daughter nor her daughterinlaw nor the maidservantAs requested they all went with perfumes and flowers to the field and a most simple cremation took place with no one weepingSakka the chief of gods came down to earth and proceeding to the place where a body was burning upon a pile of firewood inquired from those standing around whether they were roasting the flesh of some animalWhen they replied It is no enemy but our own son Then he could not have been a son dear to you said SakkaHe was a very dear son replied the fatherThen asked Sakka why do you not weep The father in reply uttered this stanzaSimilar questions were asked from the dead sons mother who replied thusSisters surely are loving to their brothersWhy do you not weep asked Sakka of the dead mans sisterShe repliedSakka then asked the dead mans wife why she did not weepShe replied thusLastly Sakka asked the maidservant why she did not weep especially as she had stated that the master was never cruel to her but was most considerate and kind and treated her like a foster childThis was her replyThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAn anthology of the Samyutta Nikaaya prepared by MrJohn DIreland has already appeared in the Wheel seriesIt contained selections from all the five books of this large collection of the Buddhas discoursesThe present volume supplements it with a further selection from the same booksAs this Discourse Collection which follows an arrangement according to subject is representative of all the basic teachings of the Buddha it places at the disposal of the anthologist an array of suttas discourses rich both in variety and in excellenceHe can however do justice to them within limits choosing such texts as bring out the salient features of those teachings in a more appealing wayNaturally he would have a preference for pithy discourses and those well illustrated by scintillating similes and metaphorsThe present anthology while drawing from the existing translations and the commentaries attempts to repay a part of this debt in the form of suggested improvements on bothIn the Notes to the Anthology the discussion of certain doctrinal points has entailed the inclusion of many parallel texts which are likely to elucidate the meanings of the selected DiscoursesThus have I heardThe Exalted One was once staying near Savatthi at Jeta Grove in Anathapindikas ParkNow a certain deity when the night was far spent shedding radiance with his effulgent beauty over the whole Jeta Grove came into the presence of the Exalted One and coming saluted him and stood at one sideSo standing he spake thus to the Exalted OneHow did you dear sir cross the flood Without tarrying friend and without hurrying did I cross the floodBut how did you dear sir without tarrying without hurrying cross the floodWhen I friend tarried then verily I sank when I friend hurried then verily I was swept awayAnd so friend untarrying unhurrying did I cross the floodThus spoke the deity and the Teacher approvedAnd then the deity noting that approval saluted the Lord and having circumambulated him by the right vanished there and thenNear SaavatthiNow a certain deity when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and coming saluted him and stood at one sideSo standing he spake thus to the Exalted OneDo you dear sir know for them that live deliverance freedom detachmentI do know O friend for them that live deliverance freedom detachmentIn what manner and how dear sir do you know for them that live deliverance freedom detachmentThe Exalted One was once staying near Saavatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas ParkAnd a great number of the Satullapa company of deities when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and so standing one of the deities uttered this verse before the Exalted Onenear Saavatthi in the Jeta GroveNow Daamali son of the gods when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and coming saluted him and stood at one sideSo standing he spake thus to the Exalted OneThus I have heard The Exalted One was once staying at Saaketa in the Anjana Grove in the deer ParkNow Kakudha son of the gods when the night was far spent came into the presence of the Exalted One and stood at one sideSo standing Kakudha the son of gods spake thus to the Exalted OneDo you rejoice recluseOn getting what friendThen do you grieve recluseWhat is lost friendWell then recluse you neither rejoice nor grieveThat is so friendat Saavatthi standing at one side Rohitassa son of the gods spoke thus to the Exalted OneWhere lord one does not get born nor grow old nor die nor pass away nor get reborn is one able lord by walking to come to know that end of the world or to see it or to get thereWhere friend one does not get born nor grow old nor die nor pass away nor get reborn that end of the world I say you are not able by walking to come to know or to see or to arrive atWonderful is it lordMarvelous it is lord how well it is said by the Exalted One Where friend one does not get born or to arrive atIn times past lord I was a seer Rohitassa by name son of Bhoja gifted so that I could fly through the airAnd so swift lord was my speed that I could fly just as quickly as a master of archery welltrained expert proficient a past master in his art armed with a strong bow could without difficulty send a light shaft far past the area covered by a palmtrees shadowAnd so great lord was my stride that I could step from the eastern to the western seaIn me lord arose such a wish as this I will arrive at the end of the world by walking And though such lord was my speed and such my stride and though with a lifespan of a century living for hundred years I walked continuously for a hundred years save the while I spent in eating drinking chewing or tasting or in answering calls of nature save the while I gave way to sleep or fatigue yet I died on the way without reaching the end of the worldWonderful is it lord marvelous is it lord how well it is said by the Exalted One Where friend one does not get born or to arrive at But neither do I say friend that without having reached the end of the world there could be an ending of illIt is in this very fathomlong physical frame with its perceptions and mind that I declare lies the world and the arising of the world and the cessation of the world and the path leading to the cessation of the worldAt Saavatthi On one occasion the Exalted One was instructing enlightening inspiring and gladdening the monks by a sermon relating to NibbaanaAnd the monks with their whole minds applied attentive and intent were listening to the DhammaThen it occurred to Maara the evil one This recluse Gotama is instructing enlightening inspiring and gladdening the monks by a sermon relating to NibbanaWhat if I were now to approach the recluse Gotama in order to blindfold him So Maara the evil one assuming the guise of a plowman bearing a mighty plow on his shoulder and holding an oxgoad in his hand his hair disheveled his raiment hempen his feet spattered with mud drew near to the Exalted One and saidHave you seen my oxen O recluseBut what have you evil one to do with oxenMine only recluse is the eye mine are the visible forms mine is the sphere of consciousness of the eyes contactWhere recluse will you go to escape from meMine only recluse is the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind mine are the mental objects mine is the sphere of consciousness of mental contactWhere recluse will you go to escape from meThine only evil one is the eye thine are the visible forms and thine is the sphere of consciousness of the eyes contactBut where O evil one eye is not visible forms are not the sphere of consciousness of the eyes contact is not there O evil one is no access for youThine only O evil one is the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind But where O evil one mind is not mental objects are not the sphere of consciousness of mental contact is not there O evil one is no access for youThen Maara the evil one thought The Exalted One knows meThe Blessed One knows meAnd sad and sorrowful he vanished there and thenat Saavatthi Sister Selaa dressed herself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe entered Savatthi for almsAnd when she had gone about Saavatthi for it and had returned after the meal she seated herself at the foot of a certain tree for noonday restThe Maara the evil one desirous of arousing fear trepidation and horripilation in her desirous of making her lose her concentration went up to her and addressed her in verseNow it occurred to Sister Selaa Who now is this human or nonhuman that utters this verse And then it occurred to her Surely it is Maara the evil one who utters this verse desirous of arousing in me fear trepidation and horripilation desirous of making me lose my concentration Then the Sister Selaa knowing it was Mara the evil one replied him with versesThen Maara the evil one thought Sister Selaa knows me and sad and sorrowful he vanished there and thenThe Exalted One was once dwelling near Gayaa on the Stone Couch at the haunt of the Yakkha SucilomaNow at that time Khara the yakkha and Suciloma the yakkha were passing by not far from the Exalted OneAnd Khara said to Suciloma Thats a recluseNo thats not a recluse thats a mere shaveling but let me first ascertain whether he is a recluse or a mere shavelingThen Suciloma came up to the Exalted One and bent his body up against himAnd the Exalted One bent his body awayThen Suciloma said Do you fear me recluseIt is not that I fear you friend but contact with you is an evil thingRecluse I will ask you a questionIf you do not answer me I will either derange your mind or split your heart or I will take you by the feet and throw you over the GangesI see no one friend in the whole world with its gods Maras and Brahmas with its progeny of recluses and Brahmans gods and men who is able to derange my mind or split my heart or take me by the feet and throw me over the GangesNevertheless friend ask whatever question you likeThus have I heard The Exalted One was once staying near Saavatthi at Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas ParkThere are these four nutriments monks for the maintenance of beings that have come to birth or for the assistance of them that seek to becomeWhich are the fourMaterial food coarse or fine secondly contact thirdly volition fourthly consciousnessThese four are nutriments for maintenance of beings that have come to birth or for the assistance of them that seek to becomeWhen this had been said the venerable Moliya Phagguna said to the Exalted OneWho now is it lord who feeds on the consciousness nutrimentNot a fit question said the Exalted OneI am not saying feeds onIf I were saying so to that the question would be a fit oneBut I am not saying soAnd I not saying so if anyone were to ask me Of what now lord is consciousness the nutriment this were a fit questionAnd the fit answer to it is The consciousness nutriment is condition for renewed becoming of rebirth in the futureWhen that is come to pass the sixfold sensesphere contact comes to be Who now lord exercises contactNot a fit question said the Exalted OneI am not saying exercises contactIf I were saying so the question would be a fit oneBut I am not saying soAnd I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus Conditioned now by what lord is contact this were a fit questionAnd the fit answer there would be Conditioned by the sixfold sensesphere is contact conditioned by contact is feeling Who now lord is it who feelsNot a fit question said the Exalted OneI am not saying feelsIf I were saying so the question would be a fit oneBut I am not saying soAnd I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus Conditioned now by what lord is feeling this were a fit questionAnd the fit answer there would be Conditioned by contact is feeling conditioned by feeling is craving Who now lord is it who cravesNot a fit question said the Exalted OneI am not saying cravesIf I were saying so the question would be a fit oneBut I am not saying soAnd I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus Conditioned now by what lord is craving this were a fit questionAnd the fit answer there would be Conditioned by feeling is craving conditioned by craving is grasping Who now lord is it who graspsNot a fit question said the Exalted OneI am not saying graspsIf I were saying so the question would be a fit oneBut I am not saying soAnd I not saying so if anyone were to ask thus Conditioned now by what lord is grasping this were a fit questionAnd the fit answer there would be Conditioned by craving is graspingConditioned by grasping is becomingConditioned by becoming birth and conditioned by birth decayanddeath grief lamenting suffering unhappiness despair come to passSuch is the uprising of this entire mass of illBut from the utter fading away and cessation of the sixfold sphere of sensecontact Phagguna comes cessation of contact cessation of feeling from cessation of feeling cessation of craving from cessation of craving cessation of grasping from cessation of grasping cessation of becoming from cessation of becoming cessation of birth cessation of decayanddeath of grief lamenting suffering unhappiness despairSuch is the cessation of of this entire mass of illat SaavatthiNow the venerable Bhuumija arising at eventide from solitary meditation came into the presence of the venerable Saariputta and exchanging greetings with him and compliments of friendship and courtesy sat down at one sideAnd so seated the venerable Bhuumija spoke thus to the venerable SaariputtaThere are friend Saariputta certain recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneselfThere are friend Saariputta certain other recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by anotherThere are friend Saariputta yet other recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself as well as by anotherAnd there are friend Saariputta still other recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought neither by oneself nor by another but they have arisen by chanceHerein friend Saariputta of what view is the Exalted OneWhat has he declaredAnd how if we were answering should we be repeating his views correctly without misrepresenting him and be explaining in accordance with he Dhamma so that no blame with justification can come upon usThe Exalted One has said friend that happiness and ill have arisen through a causeAnd because of whatBecause of contactThus speaking one will be repeating the views of the Exalted One correctly without misrepresenting him and one will be explaining in accordance with the Dhamma and no blame with justification can come upon himTherein friend those recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  even that they do because of contactWhatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by another  even that they do because of contactWhatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself as well as by another  even that they do because of contactAnd whatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought neither by oneself nor by another but have arisen by chance  even that they do because of contactTherein friend recluses and brahman believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  that they will experience without contact is verily an impossibility And whatever recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought either by oneself nor by another but have arisen by chance  that they will experience without contact is verily an impossibilityThe venerable Aananda was listening to this conversation between the venerable Saariputta and the venerable BhuumijaThen the venerable Aananda went into the presence of the Exalted One saluted him and sat on one sideThus seated the venerable Ananda so far as the venerable Saariputta had conversed with the venerable Bhuumija told all to the Exalted OneWell saidWell saidAanandaWell might Saariputta explain as he has doneIndeed Aananda I have said that happiness and ill have arisen through a causeAnd because of whatBecause of contactThus speaking one will be repeating my views correctly without misrepresenting me and be explaining in accordance with the Dhamma and no blame with justification can come upon himTherein Aananda those recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  even that they do because of contactTherein Aananda those recluses and brahmans believers in kamma who declare that happiness and ill have been wrought by oneself  that they will experience without contact is verily an impossibilityWhen body is there Aananda due to bodilyintention there arises internally pleasure and painWhen speech is there Aananda due to verbalintention there arises internally pleasure and painWhen mind is there Aananda due to mentalintention there arises internally pleasure and painConditioned by ignorance Aananda either one by oneself concocts a bodily formation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and pain or others concoct for him that bodily formation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and painAnd Aananda either he deliberately concocts that bodily formation or he does it unwittinglyEither one by oneself Aananda concocts that verbalformation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and pain or others concoct it for himAnd Aananda either he deliberately concocts it or he does it unwittinglyEither one by oneself Aananda concocts that mentalformation owing to which there arises for him that internal pleasure and pain or others concoct it for himAnd Aananda either he deliberately concocts that bodily formation or he does it unwittinglyThese items Aananda are affected with ignoranceBut from the utter fading away and cessation of ignorance Aananda that body is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and painThat speech is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and painThat speech is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and painThat mind is not whence arises for him that internal pleasure and painThat field is not that ground is not that sphere is not that occasion is not conditioned by which there arises for him internal pleasure and painThus have I heardThe Exalted One was once staying in the territory of the Bhaggas at Crocodilehaunt in Bhesakala Grove in the Deer ParkThen the householder Nakulapitaa came to the Exalted One saluted him and sat down at one sideSeated at one side the householder Nakulapitaa said thus to the Exalted One Lord I am a decrepit oldman aged far gone in yearsI have reached the last stage of my lifeI am sick in body and always ailingIt is rarely that I get the opportunity to see the Exalted One and those monks whose very sight is edifyingLet the Exalted One admonish and instruct me so that it will conduce to my weal and happiness for a long time to comeTrue it is true it is householder that your body is sickly soiled and cumberedFor householder who would claim even a moments health carrying this body about except through sheer foolishnessWherefore householder thus you should train yourself Though my body is sick my mind shall not be sick Thus householder must you train yourselfThen Nakulapitaa the householder rejoiced in and appreciated the words of the Exalted one and rising from his seat he saluted the lord circumambulated him by the right and then approached the venerable SaariputtaHaving approached and saluted him he sat down at one sideAnd the Venerable Saariputta said thus to the householder Nakulapitaa who was seated at one side Clear are your faculties householder pure and clean is the complexion of your faceHave you had the opportunity today to listen to a talk of Dhamma from the very presence of the Exalted OneHow could it be otherwise venerable sirI have just been sprinkled with the nectar of a talk of Dhamma by the Exalted OneAnd in what way householder were you sprinkled with the nectar of a talk of Dhamma by the Exalted OneWell Venerable Sir I went to the Exalted One saluted him and sat down at one sideAs I sat thus Venerable Sir I said to the Exalted One Lord I am a decrepit oldman aged far gone in yearsI have reached the last stage of my lifeI am sick in body and always ailingIt is rarely that I get the opportunity to see the Exalted One and those monks whose very sight is edifyingLet the Exalted One admonish and instruct me so that it will conduce to my weal and happiness for a long time to comeWhen I spoke thus Venerable Sir the Exalted One said to me True it is true it is householder that your body is sickly soiled and cumberedFor householder who would claim even a moments health carrying this body about except through sheer foolishnessWherefore householder thus you should train yourself Though my body is sick my mind shall not be sick Thus householder must you train yourselfThus it was Venerable Sir that I have been sprinkled with the nectar of a talk of Dhamma by the Exalted OneBut did it not occur to you householder to question the Exalted One furtherThus Pray how far Lord is body sick and mind is sick tooAnd how far is body sick and mind not sick I would travel far indeed Venerable Sir to learn the meaning of this saying from the presence of the Venerable SaariputtaIt is good if the Venerable Saariputta should think it fit to expound to me the meaning of this sayingWell then listen householder apply your mind thoroughly and I will speakEven so Venerable Sir said householder Nakulapitaa in response to the Venerable SaariputtaTheVenerable Saariputta thus spake And how is body sick householder and mind sick tooHerein householder the untaught average person taking no account of the noble ones unskilled in the doctrine of the noble ones untrained in the doctrine of the noble ones taking no account of the good men unskilled in the doctrine of the good men regards form as self or self as

the Venerable Saariputtaat Saavatthi Then the Exalted One saidThe one who approaches is not released the one who does not approach is releasedApproaching form monks consciousness in persisting it would persistWith form as its support with form as its foothold sprinkled over with delight it may come by growth increase abundanceApproaching feeling Approaching perception Approaching formations monks consciousness in persisting would persistWith formations as its support with formations as its foothold sprinkled over with delight it may come by growth increase abundanceWere a man monks to declare thus Apart from form apart from feeling apart from perception apart from formations I will show forth the coming or the going or the decease or the rebirth or the growth or the increase or the abundance of consciousness  to do that were impossibleIf lust for the formmode monks is abandoned by a monk by that abandonment of lust the support is cut off and there is no establishment of consciousnessIf lust for the feelingmode If lust for the perceptionmode If lust for the formationsmode If lust for the consciousnessmode monks is abandoned in a monk by the abandonment the support is cut off and there is no establishment of consciousnessThat unestablished consciousness not growing and not concocting is freed due to its freedom it is steady by its steadiness it is contented owing to its contentment he is not troubledBeing untroubled of himself he is perfectly tranquilized and he knows Exhausted is birth lived is the holy life done is the task there is nothing beyond this for the conditions of this existenceAt Saavatthi Then the Exalted One saidA monk who is skilled in the seven points monks who is an investigator in three ways is called accomplished in this Norm and Discipline one who has reached mastership supermanAnd how monks is a monk skilled in the seven pointsHerein monks a monk fully understands form the arising of form the ceasing of form and the path

investigator of the three waysAs to that monks a monk investigates things by way of the elements by way of sensespheres by way of Dependent ArisingThat is how monks a monk becomes an investigator of the three waysA monk who is skilled in the seven points monks who is an investigator of the three ways  he is called accomplished in this Norm and Discipline one who has reached mastership supermanOnce the Exalted One was staying near Saavatthi in East Park at the palace of Migaaras mother with a great gathering of monksNow on that occasion  it was the Uposatha day of the fifteenth on the night when the moon was full  the Exalted One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monksThen a certain monk rose from his seat and arranging his robe on one shoulder bowed before the Exalted One with folded hands and thus addressed the Exalted One Lord I would fain question the Exalted One on a certain point if the Exalted One would grant me an answer to the questionThen sit in your own seat monk and ask what you likeEven so lord replied that monk to the Exalted One and having sat down in his own seat thus addressed the Exalted One Are these the five aggregates of grasping lord to wit the formaggregate of grasping the feelingaggregate of grasping the perceptionaggregate of grasping the perceptionaggregate of grasping the formationsaggregate of grasping and the consciousnessaggregate of graspingThat is so monkThose are the five aggregates of grasping as you sayIt is well lord said that monk rejoicing in and appreciating the words of the Exalted One and put another question But these five aggregates of grasping lord in what are they rootedThese five aggregates of grasping monk have their root in desireIt is well lord said that monk and put another question Lord are just these five aggregates of grasping the whole of grasping or is there any grasping apart from these five aggregates of graspingNo indeed monk these five aggregates of grasping are not the whole of grasping and yet there is no grasping apart from those five aggregates of graspingBut it is the desire and lust in these five aggregates of grasping that is the grasping thereinIt is well lord said that monk and put another questionMight there be lord a variety of desire and lust in the five aggregates of graspingThere might be monk replied the Exalted OneHerein monks one thinks thus May I be of such a form in the futureMay I be of such a feeling in the futureMay I be of such a perception in the futureMay I be of such a formation in the future In this way monk there might be a variety of desire and lust in the five aggregates of graspingIt is well lord said that monk and put another questionPray lord how far does the definition of the term aggregate go in the case of the aggregatesAny kind of form whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  this is called the aggregate of formAny kind of feelingAny kind of perceptionAny kind of formationsAny kind of consciousness whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  this is called the aggregate of consciousnessThus far monk does the definition of aggregate go in the case of aggregatesIt is well lord said that monk and put another questionWhat lord is the reason what is the condition for designating the formaggregateWhat is the reason what is the condition for designating the feelingaggregateWhat is the reason what is the condition for designating the formationsaggregateWhat is the reason what is the condition for designating the consciousness aggregateThe four great elements monk are the reason the four great elements are the condition for

noble ones unskilled in the doctrine of the noble ones untrained in the doctrine of the noble ones taking no account of the good men unskilled in the doctrine of the good men untrained in the doctrine of the good men regards form as self or self as having form or form as being in self or self as being in form he regards consciousness as self on self as having consciousness or consciousness as being in self or self as being in consciousnessThat is how monk there comes to be the personalityviewIt is well lord said that monk and he put another questionBut lord how does there not come to be the personalityviewHerein monk the welltaught noble disciple who discerns the noble ones who is skilled in the doctrine of the noble ones welltrained in the doctrine of the noble ones who discerns the good men who is skilled in the doctrine of the good men welltrained in the doctrine of the good men does not regard form as self does not regard consciousness as self or self as having consciousness or consciousness as being in self or self as being in consciousnessThat is how monk there does not come to be the personalityviewIt is well lord said that monk and put another questionPray lord what is the satisfaction what is the misery and what is the escape in the case of formWhat is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of feelingWhat is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of perceptionWhat is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of formationsWhat is the satisfaction what is the misery what is the escape in the case of consciousnessThe pleasure and happiness monk that arises in dependence on form  this is the satisfaction in the case of formForm is impermanent painful and subject to change  this is the misery in the case of formThe restraint of desire and lust the abandonment of desire and lust for form  this is the escape in the case of formThe pleasure and happiness monk that arises in dependence on feeling in dependence on perception in dependence on formations in dependence on consciousness this is the escape in the case of consciousnessIt is well lord said that monk and put another questionHow lord should one know how should one see so that in this body with its consciousness and in all external signs there be no idea of I or mine no latent conceits thereinAny kind of form monk whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near he sees all of it with right understanding thus This is not mine this am not I this is not my selfAny kind of feelingAny kind of perceptionAny kind of formationsAny kind of consciousness whatever this is not my selfIt is when one knows thus monk and sees thus that there come to be in him no idea of I or mine and no latent conceits in this body with its consciousness and in all external signsAt that moment there arose in a certain monk this train of thoughtSo it seems form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self formations are not self consciousness is not selfThen what self will the actions done by the not self touchThen the Exalted One knew with his mind the thought in that monks mind and he addresses the monks thusIt is possible monks that some foolish man unknowing and ignorant with his mind dominated by craving might fancy that he could bypass the Masters teaching thus So it seems form is not self Then what self will the actions done by the notself touch But monks you have been trained by me by the counterquestion method on certain occasions in regard to certain teachingsNow what do you think monksIs form permanent or impermanentImpermanent lordThat which is impermanent is it painful or pleasantPainful lordThat which is impermanent painful and subject to change is it fit to be regarded thus This is mine this am I this is my selfSurely not lordWhat do you think monksIs feeling permanent perception formations consciousnessSurely not lordTherefore monks any kind of form whatever whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all form should be seen as it is with right understanding thus This is not mine this am not I this is not my self Any kind of feeling perception formations consciousness not my selfThus seeing the welltaught noble disciple becomes dispassionate towards form becomes dispassionate towards feeling becomes dispassionate towards perception becomes dispassionate towards formations becomes dispassionate towards consciousnessBeing dispassionate he lusts not for it not lusting he is liberated when he is liberated there comes the knowledge liberated And he understands Exhausted is birth lived is the holy life done is the task there is nothing beyond this for the conditions of this existenceOnce the Venerable Saariputta and the Venerable Upasena were staying near Raajagaha in Cool Grove at Snakeshood GrottoNow at that time a snake had fallen on the venerable Upasenas bodyThen the venerable Upasena addressed the monks saying Come hither friends lift this body of mine on to a couch and take it outside before it be scattered here just like a handful of chaffAt these words the venerable Saariputta said to the venerable Upasena We see no change in the venerable Upasenas body no change for the worse in his facultiesYet the venerable Upasena says Come hither friends just like a handful of chaff Indeed friend Saariputta it is to him who thinks I am the eye the eye is mine or I am the ear the ear is mine or I am the nose the nose is mine or I am the tongue the tongue is mine or I am the body the body is mine or I am the mind the mind is mine that there would be any change in the body any change for the worse in the facultiesBut as for me friend I do not think I am the eye the eye is mine or I am the mind the mind is mine How then friend Saariputta could there be for me any change in the body any change for the worse in the facultiesSo then it seems the venerable Upasena has long since eradicated the latent conceits of I and mine Hence it is that it occurs not thus to the venerable Upasena I am the eye the eye is mine or I am the mind the mind is mine Then those monks put the venerable Upasenas body on a couch and bore it outsideAnd the venerable Upasenas body there and then was scattered just like a handful of

is not excited by formsBy the change the fading away and the cessation of forms blissfully monks dwells the TathaagataSo also of sounds and the rest blissfully monks dwells the TathaagataThus spake the Exalted OneSo saying the Wellfarer the Teacher added this furtherOnce a number of eldermonks were dwelling at Macchikaasanda in Wild Mango GroveThen Citta the householder approached those eldermonksHaving approached them he saluted them and sat down at one sideSo seated Citta the householder said to those eldermonks Let the venerable sirs the elders accept of me tomorrows mealAnd those eldermonks accepted by silenceThereupon Citta the householder understanding the acceptance of those eldermonks rose from his seat saluted them and having circumambulated them by the right went awayNow the eldermonks when the night was gone robed themselves in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe went to the dwelling of Citta the householder and on reaching it sat down on seats preparedThen Citta the householder came to those eldermonks and saluting them sat down at one sideSo seated Citta the householder said to the venerable elderAs to these divers views that arise in the world Venerable Sir such as Eternal is the world not eternal is is the world finite is the world infinite is the world soul and body are the same soul and body are different the Tathaagata exists after death he exists not after death he both exists and exists not after death he neither exists nor exists not after death also as to the sixtytwo views set forth in the Brahmajaala  owing to the existence of what Venerable Sir do these views prevail owing to the nonexistence of what do these views not prevailAt these words the venerable chiefelder was silentThen Citta the householder put the same question for a second and a third time but the venerable chiefelder was silentNow on that occasion the venerable Isidatta was the junior of that company of monksThen the venerable Isidatta said to the venerable chief elder Venerable Sir may I reply to this question of Citta the householderYou may reply to it IsidattaNow householder your question was this was it notYes Venerable SirNow householder as to those divers views that arise in the world such as Eternal is the world and as to these sixtytwo views set forth in the Brahmajaala it is owing to the personalityview that they arise and if the personalityview exists not they do not existBut Venerable Sir how comes to be the personalityviewHerein householder the untaught average man That is how householder there comes to be the personalityviewBut Venerable Sir how does there not come to be the personalityviewHerein householder the welltaught noble disciple That is how householder there does not come to be a personalityviewWhence comes the venerable Isidatta my lordI come from Avanti householderThere is at Avanti Venerable Sir a clansman named Isidatta an unseen friend of ours who has gone forthHas your reverence seen himI have householderPray Venerable Sir where does that venerable one now dwellAt these words the venerable Isidatta was silentIs your reverence the worthy IsidattaI am householderThen may the worthy Isidatta take his pleasure at MacchikaasandaLovely is wild Mango GroveI will do my best to supply the worthy Isidatta with the requisites of robes alms lodgings and medicamentsThat is kindly said householderThereupon Citta the householder was delighted with the words of the venerable Isidatta and rejoicing in them with his own hand he served the elder monks with choice food both hard and soft until they had eaten their fillThen the eldermonks having had their fill and withdrawn hand from bowl rose up and went awayThen said the venerable chief elder to the venerable IsidattaIt was good friend Isidatta the way that question occurred to youThat question did not occur to meTherefore friend Isidatta if on another occasion such a question arises you may reply in like mannerThen the venerable Isidatta having set his lodgings in order took bowl and robe and departed from MacchikasandaAnd in thus departing from Macchikaasanda he was gone for good and came not back any moreOnce the Exalted One was staying among the Mallas at Uruvelakappa a township of the MallasThen Bhadragaka the headman approached the Exalted OneHaving drawn near he saluted him and sat down at one sideSo seated Bhadragaka the headman said to the Exalted OneWell for me lord if the Exalted One would teach me the arising and passing away of illIf I were to teach you headman the arising and the passing away of ill with reference to past time saying Thus it was in the past you would have doubt and perplexityAnd if headman I were to teach you the arising and the passing away of ill with reference to future time saying So will it be in the future you would likewise have doubt and perplexityBut seated here as I am headman I will teach you even as you are sitting there the arising and the passing away of illDo you listen attentivelyApply your mind and I will speakEven so lord replied Bhadragaka the headman to the Exalted OneThe Exalted One saidNow what think you headmanAre there any people in Uruvelakappa owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame there would come upon you sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairThere are such people in Uruvelakappa lordBut headman are there any people in Uruvelakappa owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame no sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair would come upon youThere are such people in Uruvelakappa lordNow headman what is the reason what is the cause why sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair would come upon you in respect of some but not of othersIn the case of those lord owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame there would come upon me sorrow I have desire and attachmentAnd as for the others lord I do not have such desire and attachment in their caseYou say I do not have such desire and attachment in their case Now headman by this Norm thus seen and known attained and plumbed into without any timelag you draw an inference in regard to the past and future thus Whatsoever ill has arisen in the past  all that is rooted in desire caused by desireDesire indeed is the root of ill Wonderful lordMarvelous lord how well said is the saying of the Exalted One Whatsoever ill that arises all that is rooted in desire caused by desireDesire indeed is the root of illNow Lord there is my boy  Ciravaasi is his nameHe lodges away from hereRising up betimes lord I send off a man saying Go my man inquire of Ciravaasi Then lord till that man comes back again I am in an anxious state lest some sickness may have befallen CiravaasiNow what think you headmanWould sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair come upon you if your boy Ciravaasi were slain imprisoned or suffered loss or blameLord if such were to befall my boy Ciravasi even my life will be at stake how should I not have sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairIn this manner too you must know this fact whatsoever ill that arises all that is rooted in desire caused by desireDesire is indeed the root of illNow what think you headmanWhen you had not seen had not heard about Ciravasis mother did you then have any desire or longing or love for herNo indeed lordBut headman when you got sight of her heard about her did you then have desire or longing or love for herYes LordNow what think you headmanWould sorrow and lamentation come upon you if Ciravaasis mother were slain or imprisoned or had any loss or blameLord if such were to befall Ciravaasis mother even my life itself will be at stake how should I not have sorrow and despairSo in this manner too headman you must know this fact Whatsoever ill that arises all that is rooted in desire caused by desireDesire indeed is the root of illOnce upon a time monks a shefalcon suddenly swooped down and seized a quailThen monks the quail while it was being carried away by the shefalcon thus lamented Just my bad luck and lack of meritfor trespassing outside my own pasture into others propertyIf I had kept my own ancestral beat today this shefalcon would have been no match for me if it came to a fightBut what is that pasture quail which is your own ancestral beatIt is a field turned up by the plowshare a place all covered with clodsThen monks the shefalcon without being stiff in her assertion of strength not caring to argue with the quail on her own strength released the quail saying Off with you quail but even by going there you will not escape meSo monks the quail went off to a plowed field to a place all covered with clods perched on a great clod and stood challenging the shefalcon thus Now come on you falconNow come on you falconThen monks the shefalcon without being stiff in her assertion of strength not caring to argue with the quail on her own strength poising both her wings swooped down upon the quailBut monks as soon as the quail knew that the shefalcon had come too close to her she slipped inside that very clodAnd then monks the falcon shattered her breast thereonSo it is monks with one who goes roaming out of his own pasture in others propertyWherefore monks roam ye not outside your own pasture in others propertyTo those who so roam monks Maara will get accessIn them Maara will find a supportAnd what monks is not ones own pasture but others propertyIt is the five kinds of sensepleasureWhat fiveForms cognizable by the eye desirable charming pleasant delightful passionfraught and

ardent fully aware He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind He dwells as regards mindobjects contemplating mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldThis monks is a monks own pasture this is his ancestral beatOn a certain occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Sumbha country in a township of the Sumbhas called SedakaThere the Exalted One addressed the monksOnce upon a time monks a bambooacrobat set up his pole and called to his pupil Medakathaalika saying Come my lad Medakathaalika climb the pole and stand on my shouldersAll right master replied the pupil to the bambooacrobat climbed the pole and stood on his masters shoulderThen monks the bambooacrobat said to his pupil Now Medakathaalika my lad you protect me well and I shall protect youThus warded and watched by each other we will show our tricks get a good fee and come down safe from the bamboopoleAt these words Medakathaalika the pupil said to the bambooacrobat No noThat wont do masterYou look after yourself master and Ill look after myselfThus warded and watched each by himself well show our tricks get a good fee and come down safe from the bamboopoleTherein that is the right way  said the Exalted OneJust as Medakathaalika the pupil said to his master Ill protect myself so monks should the Foundations of Mindfulness be practicedIll protect others so should the Foundations of Mindfulness be practicedProtecting oneself monks one protects others protecting others one protects oneselfAnd how monks does one in protecting oneself protect othersBy frequent practice development and makingmuchofThus monks in protecting oneself one protects othersAnd how monks does one in protecting others protect oneselfBy forbearance by nonviolence by lovingkindness by compassionThus monks in protecting others one protects oneselfI shall protect myself with this intention monks the Foundations of Mindfulness should be practicedI shall protect others with this intention the Foundations of Mindfulness should be practicedProtecting oneself one protects others protecting others one protects oneselfOnce the Exalted One was dwelling in the Sumbha country at Sedaka a township of the Sumbha peopleThere the Exalted One addressed the monksSuppose monks a large crowd of people flock together crying The beautyqueenThe beautyqueen And if that beautyqueen is also a highly gifted performer as to dancing and singing a still larger crowd would flock together crying The beautyqueen is dancing she is singingThen comes a man who wishes to live and does not wish to die who desires happiness and abhors sufferingThe people say to him Look here manHeres a bowl filled to the brim with oilYou must carry it round between the large crowd and the beautyqueenA man with uplifted sword will follow behind your back and wherever you spill even a little drop of the oil there itself he will chop off your headNow what do you think monksWould that man without paying attention to that bowl of oil solicit heedlessness from outsideSurely not lordWell monks this parable I have given to make the meaning clearAnd its significance is this The bowl filled to the brim with oil monks is a term for mindfulness relating to bodyWherefore monks thus must you train yourselves Mindfulness relating to body shall be cultivated by us shall be made much of made a vehicle a groundplanIt shall be made effective wellacquainted and consummate in us Thus monks must you train yourselves References are to page numbers in PTSeditionsTranslations from the Pali Text Society Translation SeriesIn the case of the first flood they bring out the ethical significance of the Noble Eightfold Path in the avoidance of the two extremes of selfindulgence and selfmortificationThe former extreme tends to moral stagnation while the latter leads to extreme forms of asceticism which are not conducive to a healthy development of the mindSince both attitudes of stagnation and struggling are ineffective against the flood of sensedesires the Buddhas Middle Path advocates sanity and moderationExtreme reactions to the second flood took the form of Eternalism and Annihilationism which again reflect attitudes of attachment and aversionThe Eternalist leaned back while Annihilationist overreached himself in the face of the problem of existence Delighting in the existence monks are gods and men they are attached to existence and rejoice in itWhen Dhamma is being preached their minds do not leap towards it do not become pleased established or released thereinThus monks do some lean backAnd how monks do some others overreach themselvesBeing afflicted by and loathing this very existence some others delight in nonexistence thus Inasmuch as this being when the body breaks up after death gets annihilated will be destroyed and be no more after death this is peace this is excellent this is the true state Thus monks some others overreach themselvesThe former ran after his shadow while the latter tried in vain to outstrip it both being equally obsessed I taking it to be realHere the Buddhas solution was to recognize the shadow for what it is by seeingthingsastheyare  as dependently arisen  thus dispelling both Narcissistic love and morbid hate for it and ushering in equanimity in the light of wisdom and how monks do those who have eyes seeHerein a monk sees the become as become Having seen the become as become he treads the path towards the disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to the become Thus it is monks that those who have eyes seeThe third flood brought forth the dichotomy between the extreme views of absolute existence and absolute nonexistence  nothing existsAvoiding these two extremes runs the Middle Path of Dependent arising He who with right insight sees the arising of the world as it really is does not hold with the nonexistence of the worldAnd he who with right insight sees the passing away of the world as it really is does not hold with the nonexistence of the worldIn place of the static worldview of the metaphysicians and the nihilists we have here a dynamic vision of the rise and fall of phenomenaThe fourth flood resulted in the polarization of the extreme attitudes of extraversion and introversion both of which spelt delusionThis is the paradox of consciousness interdependent as it is on nameand form  each providing a footing or support for the otherThe deepest riddle of existence lay between them as they doted upon each other forming the whirlpool of samsaaraThe consciousness turns back from nameandform it does not go beyondHowever much it tried to dart out of the vicious cycle with the force of samkhaaras or formations it found itself confronted by nameandformEpistemologically all views  even those based on jhaanic experience  stood condemned since they all centered around some aspect or other of nameandform which in its turn implicated consciousness itselfA seeing man will see nameandform and having seen he will understand just those thingsVerily let him see much or little yet the experts do not speak of purity therebySimilarly the almost refrainlike pronouncement running through the concluding sections of the Brahmajaala Sutta even that is due to contact is a disqualification of the whole range of sixtytwo views since contact comes under nameandformThe Buddha discovered a way out of this impasse in a unique realm of meditation in which the consciousness neither partakes of extraversion nor of introversion and is free from the samkhaaras that keep one leashed to existenceIt is the DeliverancethroughKnowledge having as its Fruit the Knowledge of Nibbaanic freedom The consciousness now is nonmanifestative providing no footing for nameandform and it is neither distracted or diffuse without nor established within neither approaching nor receding neither turnedtowards nor turnedoutwards neither focused nor excitableHaving no object it is unestablished and noncontinuingIt is not a state of pent up tension forcibly held in check by formationsThis level of transcendental experience was so subtle and refractory to definition that the Buddha declared This too were a state very difficult to see that is to say the calming of all formations the renunciation of all assets the destruction of craving dispassion cessation NibbaanaThe two words appatittham and anaayuuham can thus be interpreted with reference to the four floods in their ethical existential metaphysical and epistemological aspectsThe validity of the interpretation is doubtful as there is Canonical evidence to show that some of the metaphors are suggestive of a different order of factsTo begin with the abyss is clearly defined in the eponymous sutta at Sin terms of physical painsA synonym monks is this for painful feelings of the body namely the abyss Similarly the ocean is defined for us at Sin the Ocean Sutta in words which are in full accord with the imagery of the verse The eye monks is the ocean for a manIt has the force of visual formsWhoever withstands that force of visual forms he O monks is called one who has crossed the ocean of eye with its waves eddies seizures and demonsHaving crossed over and gone beyond the saint stands on dry ground The ear The nose The tongue The body The mind monks is the ocean stands on dry ground This quotation itself provides the clue to the twelve eddies which as the commalso suggests are the internal and external spheres of senseThe five arenas are indeed the five types of sensepleasures for at Sthe arahant is called one who has crossed the five floods It is the floods or currents that provide the sphere of action for the eddies and the abyssThe three stains can also be interpreted in accordance with the comm as lust hatred and ignorance on the strength of the following reference at S He in whom lust hatred and ignorance have faded away is the one who has crossed this ocean so hard to cross with its seizures demons and the danger of waves The turningtwice most probably refers to the painful feeling and the pleasant feeling which form the counterparts in the seesaw experience of the worldlingThat it is a kind of blind alley for him is clearly stated at S He on being touched by painful feeling delights in sensepleasuresAnd why is thisBecause the uninstructed worldling O monks knows no way out of painful feeling other than the sensepleasures Lastly as for the significance of that one root in the verse the following citation from Phassamuulaka Sutta at S should suffice Monks there are these three feelings which are born of contact rooted in contact originating from contact and which depend on contactWhich are the threePleasant feeling unpleasant feeling and neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feelingIt is the painful bodily feeling that constitutes the most immediate and palpable aspect of sufferingThe arahants claim to have transcended all suffering will not be fully valid unless he has crossed over this quaking abyss as wellThat paradoxical samaadhi of the arahant is just the refuge from the floods the eddies and the abyss The most emphatic illustration of this fact is perhaps the SakalikaSutta at S where the Buddha being mindful and aware is seen bearing up with an unruffled brow the bodily pains which are painful sharp acute distressing and unwelcome while gods draw near and express wonder and admiration at this remarkable feat of enduranceThis aspect of Nibbaanic bliss is summed up in a verse at S Concentrated mindful and aware the disciple of the Buddha understands feelings the origin of feelings the state wherein they are destroyed and the path leading theretoBy the destruction of feelings the monk is devoid of hankering and is fully appeasedThe significance of the metaphor used with reference to painful bodily feelings can also be appreciated in the context of the Buddhas definition of the development of the body and the development of the mind in the Mahaa Saccaka SuttaIn whomsoever Aggivessana in this manner and on either side the pleasant feelings that are arisen do not obsess the mind due to the development of his body and the painful feelings that are arisen do not obsess the mind due to the development of his mind it is thus Aggivessana that he becomes one who is developed as to body and as to mind too The arahant in attaining to the Influxfree Deliverance of the Mind and the Deliverance through Wisdom reaches the perfection of these two idealsAs the unshakable deliverance of the mind arahantship is the unfailing refuge and shelter even from the quaking abyss of bodily feelingsWhile the Influxfree Deliverance of the Mind provides him with an inner retreat from painful bodily feelings the Deliverance through Wisdom serves as a permanent safeguard against the seductive and deluding character of pleasant feelingThe arahant freedinbothways can therefore disengage himself from all percepts in addition to remaining undeluded in the face of experienceUnto him who is detached from percepts there are no fetters and to him who is emancipated through wisdom there are no delusionsEverything comes under the sway of name as a result of mans urge to familiarize himself with the worldSorting out naming and defining things are practical necessities in ordinary life since they help us avoid trippingover just as in the case of one groping in the darkThere is a constant need to recognize things and the easiest way of doing it is by putting a sign on themWhile the five senses have their own separate modes of indentation mind largely relies on the labelingmode of attaching a name in the course of its own gropingSince mind partakes of the range and pasture of the other five senses as well its own mode of indentation has a preponderating influence over the restThus perceptual data of the five external senses in all their permutations and combinations finally come to be assigned names and pigeonholed as things This convenient but superficial indentation beclouds the mind and prevents the immediate understanding of sensecontactIts mode of apperception therefore is largely a process of imagining and figuringout of objects located in the darkness of ignorance and in its blind groping the phenomenon of sensecontact as such hardly receives any serious attentionThe overriding power of name could only be nullified by the process of attendingbywayofmatrix in order to understand the very structure of senseexperienceBy comprehending the phenomenon of sensecontact for what it is the imaginary world of things will cease to obsess the mindWhen the light of wisdom is turned on there will be no gropinginthedark and consequently no necessity to imagine or figureout things for one now knows and sees for oneself that there is NothingAnd what monks is the passing away of the worldDependent on the eye and forms arise visual consciousnessThe concurrence of the three is contactConditioned by contact is feelingConditioned by feeling is cravingBy the utter fading away and cessation of that craving grasping ceases by the ceasing of grasping becoming ceases by the ceasing of becoming birth ceases by the ceasing of birth decayanddeath grief lamentation suffering despair ceaseSuch is the ceasing of this entire man of IllThis monks is the passing away of the worldThe same sermon is introduced in the preceding sutta with the words I will teach you monks the arising and passing away of suffering The culmination of the notself attitude is the eradication of the conceit  amthe percipient of notself attains to the eradication of the conceit I am which is Nibbaana here and nowThe removal of the subtle conceit I am is tantamount to a destruction of that delusive superimposed frame from which all measurings and reckonings of the world were directed through the instrumentality of the sensefaculties and by which the mass of relative concepts in the form of sensedata were so organized as to give a picture of the world with self mirrored on itWhat we call the normal functioning of the five external senses is but the outward manifestation of the notion Iam Given the notion Iam monks there set in then the five sensefaculties When this frame is dismantled the conveyors  the senses  losing their provenance and sanction become ineffective and their usual objects too fade away into insignificance Wherefore monks that sphere should be known wherein the eye ceases and the perception of forms fades away wherein the ear ceases and the perception of sounds fades away the nose ceases and the perception of smell fades away the tongue ceases and the perception of tastes fades away the body ceases and the perception of touch fades away the mind ceases and the perception of ideas fades awayThat sphere should be known that sphere should be knownAll percepts are signs and when signs cease to be significant they are as good as nonexistentThe signless deliverance of the mind as one of the doorwaystodeliverance points to this reorientation of the arahants mental lifeThus although he is wide awake when he is in this paradoxical samaadhi although his senseorgans appear to be all intact yet he is free form normal senseexperienceThat very eye will be there those very visible forms will be there yet one will not experience the corresponding sphere of sense that same body will be there those very tactile objects will be there yet one will not experience the corresponding sphere of senseHe is not one with the normal perception nor is his perception abnormalHe is not nonpercipient nor has he put an end to perceptionIn the case of a monk who is fully emancipated in mind friends though many forms cognizable by the eye may come within the range of the eye they never obsess his mind unalloyed is his mind steady and become imperturbable and he sees its passing awayThough many sounds cognizable by the ear may come many smells cognizable by the nose many tastes cognizable by the tongue many tangibles cognizable by the body many ideas cognizable by the mind may come within the range of the mind they never obsess his mind unalloyed is his mind steady and become imperturbable and he sees its passing awayThis nonmanifestative consciousness of the arahant which is uninfluenced by extraneous forces and is steady and imperturbable is perhaps the Inertial Frame in search of which Relativity Physics has in modern times set outAs the scientist gradually awoke to the truths of relativity he too longed for a stateofrest from the everdeepening conflict of viewpoints But his search for this imaginary laboratory was unsuccessful for like Rohitassa he searched it outside relying on the demonstrative apparatus known to scienceThe Buddhas exhortation to Rohitassa is therefore of refreshing relevance to the modern age in that it implies that the sphere wherein one transcends the labyrinths of relativity is not somewhere in outer space but within this very fathomlong physical frameAs an interesting sidelight it may be mentioned that according to the Theory of Relativity light is the topvelocity in the universe it propagates even in vacuum its velocity is constant and it propagates in all directionsNow that nonmanifestative consciousness of the arahant is described in the suttas as infinite and lustrous allaround The arahants consciousness is untrammeled by nameandform and has no object as its point of focusHence it is infinite and he is one of infinite range as regards his mental compassWisom according to the Buddha is a light which excels all other forms of light known to the worldIt has the property of penetration and its function is comprehension of the consciousness which is called an illusionHence in that illumination through wisdom consciousness becomes infinite and lustrousallround The mind thus lusterbecome and gone to the Fruit of Arahantship lights up in its turn the five external sensesThe senseobjects which are but the denizens of the dark world of ignorance fade away before the penetrative allencompassing lusterThe illusion of consciousness  the magic of the senses  thereby becomes fully exposed to the light of wisdomThe six spheres of sense cease altogether and the arahant is now conscious merely of the cessation of existence which is Nibbaana itselfHe is conscious in other words of the voidness of the world which the scientist might prefer to call the vacuum which this lightofwisdom now pervadesThe scientist however might hesitate to grant the possibility of a lightofwisdom which is not amenable to any demonstrative apparatusHe has recognized only the purely physical notions of light and has already set a limit to this topvelocity  km per secondHe considers that the discovery of the existence in the Universe of the top velocity is one of the greatest triumphs of human genius and of the experimental capacity of mankind On the basis of the foregoing observations it can be said that this greatest triumph was made by the Buddha more than years ago when he discovered by means of his noble experiment that the mind is intrinsically luminous and that when cleansed of all extraneous taints it develops that penetrative allpervasive luster of wisdom which liberates one from the labyrinths of the world of relativityIt is a penetration into the truth of impermanence by thorough reflection on the riseandfall of phenomena and the deeper it proceeds the more one becomes aware of the conflictFor Buddhism the conflict of viewpoints is a far more intricate affair than what the scientist would make it out to beIt is not simply a question of a spectators physical presence at a point in time and space but one that deeply involves such facets of psychological life as interest and attentionRooted in desire friends are all phenomena originating in attention are all phenomenaThe result is an awareness of a conflict that affects life as a wholeThis awareness naturally enough is the springboard for utter detachment through the perception of notself the culmination of which as stated above is the eradication of the most subtle conceit of all  the conceit IamThe Buddha has pointed out that the liberation from the world of senseexperience is not possible until the influxes are made extinct and the influx of the notion of existence can only be destroyed by means of a penetrative perception of cessation focused on senseexperience itselfAs far as is the range of attainments to levels of perception so far is there a penetration into KnowledgeThe habitenergy we have acquired in the course of our blind groping in Samsaara impelled by craving readily flows in in our ordinary sense experience and with its agglutinative effect creates before us a world of things that we can grasp Hence nothing short of an inner illumination could fully penetrate this faade and liberate us from the bondage of the sensesIt is noteworthy that the paradoxical samaadhi of the arahants is also called aanantarika in the sense that in it the extinction of the influxes is immediateIn his infinite and alllustrous consciousness where viewpoints have been displaced by an all encompassing vision of truth the signaltransmission as to the impermanence of the senses and their objects occurs at such an infinite velocity that it prevents the most elementary coagulation or compounding which accounts for the six spheres of senseRohitassas fantastic journey which was perhaps the prototype of modern spacetravel was undertaken for the purpose of coming to know and to see and reach that end of the world where there is no birth or death According to the Buddha everything could not be verified in this mannerMonks there are these four realizable thingsWhat fourThere are things monks that are realizable through the bodyThere are things monks that are realizable through memoryThere are things monks that are realizable through the eyeThere are things monks that are realizable through wisdomAnd what monks are the things that are realizable through the bodyThe eight deliverances monks are realizable through the bodyAnd what through memoryOnes former habitations monks are realizable through memoryAnd what through the eyeThe death and rebirth of beings monks is realizable through the eyeAnd what monks are the things realizable through wisdomThe extinction of influxes monks is realizable through wisdomThese monks are the four realizable thingsJust as much as one cannot board a timemachine and race back into the Past in order to verify the fact of ones former lives even so it is inherently impossible for one to take a leap into the Future in order to ascertain whether one has actually destroyed all influxes that make for rebirthThe verification can only be made through the penetrative faculty of wisdom  the eye of wisdom  which gives one the certitude here and now that all influxes of existence as well as the sediments of speech associated with them are burnt out and are no moreThat his cycle of Samsaara is breached at its vortex is vouched for the arahant by the breached epicycle that he sees and experiences in his paradoxical samaadhiThe whirlpool cutoff whirls no more  this even this is the end of IllThe end of the world is thus seen and realized in this very life in ones own immediate experience avoiding all pitfalls of speculative logic  a fact which accounts for such epithets of the Dhamma as sanditthiko akaaliko ehipassiko opanayiko paccatam veditabbo vinnuhi and above all atakkaavacaroThe ensemble of this realization is resented in that stereotyped sentence in the suttas which announces a new understood Extinct is birth lived is the holy life done is the task and there is nothing beyond this for the conditions of this existenceThe fact that the arahant has transcended the relativity of space mass motion and time with which the scientist is still grappling is clear enough from certain Canonical statementsIt is said that in his nonmanifestative consciousness the concepts of earth water fire and air find no footing and that the relative concepts of long and short are cut off altogetherLikewise the concepts of here there and betweenthetwo have lost their significance for himHe does not consider himself to be anywhere nor can any god or man trace him as to where he standsHe has done away with the abode of the mind and is abodeless in the fullest sense of the termThe distinctions between a subtle and a gross which may well be a reference to the relativity of mass have also faded awaySo too the concepts suggestive of the relativity of motion such as coming going and standingRelativity of time which the modern world regards as the brainchild of Einstein was not only discovered but transcended by the Buddha in that extraordinary dimension of the mindDeathandbirth  the most formidable dichotomy of all  has no sway at all in that jhanic consciousness of the emancipated oneThe elusive phenomenon of time is hypostatised in Buddhist usage in that multiple personality of Maara  the god of DeathAs his epithet kinsman of the indolent ironically suggests he has the vicious trait of lying low in order to take his victims unawaresHe is also very aptly called the EnderMaara as the symbol of death is indeed the curfew that tolls the knell of parting day Now the Buddha and the arahants are those who have outwitted Mara blinded him put him off the track and attained the DeathlessThis feat was made possible by a recognition of the principle of the relativity of timeThe Buddha discovered that the concepts of birth and death are correlative  the one being given the other followsAnd the concept of birth itself is born in the matrix of the notion of becoming or existenceThe becoming the existence is an attempt to standforth  that is to stand forth in defiance of the universal law of impermanenceIt is an everfailing struggle but the struggle itself continues depending on the supply of fuel which is upaadaanaDependent on grasping is becoming having become one undergoes suffering unto the born there is death this is the origin of sufferingThe Buddha realized that Maaras tragic drama of birthdecayanddeath is staged on this supply of fuel itself Whatever they grasp in the world by that itself does Maara pursue a manWhatever they egotistically conceive of ipso facto it becomes otherwiseThe only escape from Maras strategy therefore lay in the complete givingup of all supplies of fuel which grasping impliesSave by their giving up all  no weal for beings do I beholdWith the cessation of the process of grasping and becoming consequent on destruction of craving or thirst all assets are abandoned thus depriving Maara of the basic wherewithal for his dramaOnce Mara in his role as Tempter declares in the presence of the Buddha that such assets like sons and cattle are a source of joy to a man but the Buddhas reprisal was that on the contrary they are a source of griefAll assets in the long run turn out to be liabilitiesBy giving them up the arahant has transcended time and the concepts of existence birth decay and death have lost their significance for himNibbaana is not only the Deathless it is also the BirthlessEpithets of Nibbaana such as the notbecome the notmade and not compounded suggest the absence of that fundamental notion of existence which gives rise to the relative distinctions of birth decay and deathMonks there are these three compoundcharacteristics of the compoundedWhich are the threeAn arising is manifest a passing away is manifest a change in persistence is manifest Monks there are these three uncompounded characteristics of the uncompoundedWhich are the threeNo arising is manifest no passing away is manifest no change in persistence is manifestThe emancipatedone is in the world but not of the world For him the world is no longer the arena of a lifeanddeath struggle in which he is sorely involved but one vast illustration of the first principles of impermanence suffering and notself  of the separative privative and transformative nature of all existenceHe experiences the ambrosial Deathlessness in the very destruction of craving and consequent detachment characteristic of that unique samaadhi that detachment that excellent deathless state which the Sakyan sage attained to being concentrated  SnvHis contemplative gaze is now fixed not on the things with their fluid superficial boundaries but on that nature of things  that causalstatus that causal orderliness namely the relatednessofthistothatThis being that becomes from the arising of this that arisesThis not being that becomes not from the ceasing of this that ceasesWhatever is of a nature to arise all that has a nature to ceaseThis law of Dependent Arising itself being always such invariable and nototherwise in its contemplation the arahants mind too is firm and steadyMind is steady and wellfreed and he sees its passing awayHence he is such in his adaptability and resilience having understood the suchness of all conditioned phenomenaIt is to one who takes his stand upon the concepts of existence and birth that the fear of decay and death can occurTo the emancipated one who is fully attuned to the reality of impermanence by giving up all standpoints there can be no fear at allAnd when Death does come as surely it must he is no more shocked at it than at the crash of an extremely brittle jar ascertained well in advance to be perforatedbeyonduse  a jar notworthitsnameThe prospect of eluding death by traveling into outer space has kindled the imagination of the modern scientist also though unlike Rohitassa he did not take it up in all seriousnessHe has however speculated on the possibility of prolonging human life by flying to a distant star many lightyears away in an Einstein rocketTheoretically traveling at a sufficiently high speed we can reach the star and return to the Earth within a minuteBut on the Earth years will have passes just the sameTo all appearances we thus possess a way of prolonging human life though only from the point of view of other people since man ages according to his own timeTo our regret however this prospect is illusory if we take a closer look at itNo wonder that the prospect is illusory particularly when it is examined in the context of the Buddhas teachingsIndeed man ages according to his own time and this as shown above was precisely the point of divergence for the BuddhaThat end of the world where one does not get born nor die nor pass away nor get reborn is therefore within this very fathomlong physical frame with its perceptions and mindThis momentous declaration is quite popular with writers on Buddhism and perhaps for that very reason it has rarely enjoyed the privilege of a long annotationTraditionally too it does not seem to have been much favored in this respect if Buddhaghosas commentary to the sutta is any indicationAs MrsRhys Davids remarks It was a great opportunity for exegesis but Buddhaghosa makes no use of itThis quotation provides the clue to that muchdisputed passage in Itivwhich defines the two NibbaanaElements  the one with residual assets or appendages and the one without them And what monks is the Nibbaana element with residual assetsHerein monks a monk is an arahant whose influxes are extinct who has lived the Holy Life accomplished the task laid down the burden reached his Goal whose fetters of existence are fully extinct and who is freed through right knowledgeHis five sensefaculties still remain which being undestroyed he partakes of the pleasant and the unpleasant and experiences the pleasurable and the painfulThe extinction of lust hatred and delusion in him  this monks is called the NibbaanaElement with residual assetsAnd what monks is the NibbaanaElement without residual assetsHerein monks a monk is an arahant whose influxes are extinct and is freed through right knowledgeAll his feelings monks will even here cool down not having been delighted inThis monks is called the Nibbaana Element without residual assets Once he has experienced within his own sensorium that transcendence which results from the removal of the latest conceit Iam all his influxes are extinguished and he gains mastery over the mechanism of the sixfold sensesphere in its five aspects  the arising the passing away the satisfaction the misery and the escapeFor him the sensespheres become detachable since he now knows the principle on which they function  the law of Dependent Arising in its direct and indirect order which pivots upon Ignorance involving the notion Iam While Saupaadidesaa Nibbaanadhaatu enables the Arahant to live in the world Anupaadidesaa Nibbaanadhaatu ensures that he is not of the world Once crossed over the suchlike One comes not back To the further shore they go not

Sutta is found also in the Sutta NipaataIts commentary shows some modifications when compared with SAThe banyan tree runners and the Maaluvaa creeper depict a significant feature of thought processesOnce those thoughts connected with love hate dislike delight and terror which originate from within get attached to senseobjects their true source tends to be forgotten and the senseobjects themselves begin to dominate the sceneJust as the banyantree runners having grown up conceal the original trunk and even as the parasite Maluvaa creeper literally throws into shade the trees which gave it nourishment thoughts too once they get rooted in senseobjects bring about an obsession in which their original source is completely ignoredAnd as it is said at SpPhaggunas question Who feeds on the consciousness nutriment  is not a fit question because the very concept of an individual implies both consciousness and nameandform bound in a reciprocal relationshipThe passage of consciousness at death is merely a gravitation towards its object nameandform implicit in the last thought moment which thereby crystallizes into a new existenceThe vortex has shifted consciousness has changed its station and a new world of experience has unfolded itselfThis is the polarization between thisness and otherwiseness in Samsaaric existenceThe other questions of Phagguna concerning contact feeling grasping and craving were similarly disallowed since they all fall within the orbit of the vortical interplay between consciousness and nameandform samucchissathaProbably from sam  ud

and no otherThe commentary gives more than one interpretationFor instance at SAI it is explained with particular reference to the preceding phrase thus Done is the task the meaning is that the sixteenfold task has been accomplishedNomorefor thisness now there is no more Pathdevelopment to be done for this state that is as regards this sixteenfold task or the destruction of defilementsOr else forthisness means beyond this present process of aggregates of such a type there is no other process of aggregatesAnd he knew that these five aggregates on being comprehended just stand like a tree cut off at the rootPerhaps the meaning of naaparam itthattaaya can best be elicited from the following two Canonical passagesThis consciousness turns back from nameandform it does not go beyondIn

savingwisdom which amounts to a full comprehension of the illusion that is consciousnessBetween these two links of the Paticca Samuppaada there is a vortex or a whirlinground for a designation of thisnessNow a vortex or an eddy is a current running back contrary to the main stream thus causing a circular motion and this Samsaaric vortex too is the outcome of defying the flux of nature with its three characteristics of impermanence suffering and notselfWhen the reflexmechanism of the consciousness is discovered the motive force for this whirling round will lose its sanctionThe nutrimentofconsciousness will expose itself to be a vicious feedback system even as in the case of a vortexNameandform will be seen as a mere product of proliferation  a Narcissistic image doted upon due to delusionWith this vision ofthingsastheyare there comes a disgust for this interplay which is nothing but a secondary manifestation of a conflict with the main stream of NatureThis disgust gives rise to a turningaway which leads to the Freedom from the conflict that characterizes Samsaaric existence as a wholeThere can be a designation or a pointingout as a thisness only as long as the vortex of individual existence is kept goingWhen the vortex ceases all pathways of designation lose their point of reference since where there was an itthatta now tathataa prevailsThe Tathaagata the Transcendent One thus truly becomes deep immeasurable unfathomable as is the great ocean and the five aggregates which he has abandoned have only a semblance of connection with him now like the stirred up surface waters which still betoken a vortex long since ceased at its depthsNaaparam itthattaya is the guarantee of this freedom from the Samsaaric vortexIt conveys the arahants conviction that in so far only  that as far as nameandform together with consciousness  can one be born or grow old or die or pass away or reappear and that there is nothing beyond this for the designation of these conditions of Samsaaric existenceChamberss Twentieth Century Dictionary pThe word saamaggiyam though explained by the Commto mean fit and proper seems to have a significance of its own as suggested by the contextIt connotes the inner concord of the fullyintegrated arahant its primary sense being concord or unanimity in a social contextThus is form thus is its arising thus is its passing awayThus is feeling thus is its arising thus is its passing awayThus is perception thus is its arising thus is its passing awayThus is formations thus is their arising thus is their passing awayThus is consciousness thus is its arising thus is its passing awayThus this being that becomes from the arising of this that arises this not being that becomes not from the ceasing of this that

sixfold sensesphere contact conditioned by contact feeling conditioned by feeling craving conditioned by craving grasping conditioned by grasping becoming conditioned by becoming birth conditioned by birth oldage and death sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair come to passSuch is the arising of this entire mass of sufferingBut from the utter fading away and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of formations from the cessation of formations the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of birth oldage and death sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of sufferingThis investigation by way of Dependent Arising is an illustration of the practical application of that law in order to understand the structure of experienceBy tracing experience to its very source  ignorance  one understands the cumulative process whereby the Five Aggregates of Grasping come into existenceAttentionbywayofmatrix is an integral element in the law of Dependent Arising as the Mahaapadaana Sutta clearly revealsIgnorance when discovered is transmuted into Knowledge and as such the outcome of this yonisomanasikaara is the destruction of that foundation on which the structure of senseexperience rests precariously balancedThe three ways of investigation would thus lead to a comprehension of the three basic categories khandhaa aayatanaani and dhaatuyoHere the question concerns not so much the simple identity or difference between the two terms as the delimitation of their meaning and applicabilityThe usual Paali idiom for expressing identity and difference runs something like this Tam jiivam tam sariiram annam jivam annam sariiram SIVIn contrast with it is the idiom used in the present context Tanneva nu kho bhante upaadaanakkhandhaa udaahu annatra pancupadaanakkhandehi upaadaananti Hence the rendering of this sentence at MLSIII is to be preferred to the one given at KSIIIAt AI we get a classification of three types of assemblies according to the modes of training adopted one of them being the assembly trained by the counterquestion methodMoreover at AII where four types of questions are mentioned it is said that some questions have to be dealt with by a counterquestionThat one has to be skilled enough to use ones discretion in determining to which category a question belongs is also clearly stated thereOne is that which admits of a categorical reply another requires an analytical statement the third type should be questionedinreturn while the fourth should be set asideThat monk who knows what type is applicable here and there according to circumstances such a one they say is an expert in the tetrad of questionsThe latter half of that sentence in the sutta with its clumsylooking iteratives can be better explained in the context of the above two versesIts import is exactly the same as that of the second verseThe prefix anu in anudhammatam fulfills the same distributive function as does the phrase tesu tesu dhammesu Hence it is clear that the Buddha is here reminding the monks that he has upon occasion trained them by the counterquestion method and this is just the method he proposes to employ on the present occasion too in order to dispel the wrong view of that monkThe catechism on the Three Signata with its arrestive whatdoyouthink is in fact a kind of counterquestion by which the questioners false assumptions are gradually exposed layer by layerThe final rhetoric question That which is impermanent painful and liable to change is fit to be regarded thus This is mine this am I this is my self  goes to the root of the matter in its appeal to common senseOn the whole this catechism serves the very practical purpose of disabusing the questioners mind of his prejudices thus shattering the very basis of his questionSome critics who have failed to appreciate the cathartic significance of this catechism in the present context seem to have interpreted it as some sort of a cavalier escapade from the point at issueWhen the full import of the expression patipucchaaviniitaa is understood there can be no provocation for such an attitude the less so since here the Buddha himself has taken the trouble to probe into the mind of that monk and bring out a question which otherwise might well have remained unaskedEqually unjustified is the attempt to find in this type of catechism an excuse for a self outsidethefiveaggregatesNow the following verse of the Dhphas a reference to dyadsWhen the arahant becomes one who has gone beyond with regard to the things forming the dyads then all fetters of the knowingone pass awayThe commentary takes the dyads to mean calmandinsightHowever on the strength of the Buddhas declaration cited above it is more reasonable to interpret it in the light of the present suttaThe word paaraguu in the verse may be taken as an illusion to the Oceansutta at SIV which compares each of the six senses to an ocean with its respective object as its force and speaks of the arahant as one who has crossed over and gone beyondA distinction has to be made between this dyad and the dichotomy which is the theme in the Dvayataanupassana sutta of the sutta Nipaata since the latter is set out in the form of contrastsNibbaana as the Unshakable Deliverance of the Mind is given four epithets in the Mahaa Vedalla SIt is called the highest form of Boundless Deliverance of the Mind since the limitative tendencies of lust hatred and delusion are abandoned in the arahantIt is also the highest form of Possessionless Deliverance of the Mind as it is devoid of those three taints each of which is a somethingFor the same reason it is at the same time the highest Voidness Deliverance of the MindIn so far as lust hatred and delusion are significant their absence in Nibbaana makes it the supreme Signless Deliverance of the MindThese four aspects of that Unshakable Deliverance of the Mind  the Boundless the Possessionless the Void and the Signless  are also suggestive of the infinite and nonmanifestative nature of the arahants consciousnessThere is reason to believe that those three and sixty views referred to in that verse include Sammaa Ditthi Right as the sixtythirdThey are collectively called resorts dependent on talks of recluses with percepts as their syllables and supported by percepts  all of which the Buddha is said to have dispelled when he reached the Floods EndIn this connection the summingup occurring at the end of the Brahmajala Sutta is particularly significantAfter setting forth the types of speculative views falling under each subheading the following declaration is made And this monks the Tathaagata knows  These viewpoints thus taken up thus taken hold of lead to such and such bournes to such and such states after death That the Tathaagata knows and he also knows something higher than that and even that knowledge he does not take hold of and not taking hold of it within himself appeasement has been understoodHaving known the arising the passing away the satisfaction the misery and the escape in regard to feelings and not grasping liberated monks is the Tathaagata Towards the end of the sutta where the final summary of all the sixtytwo views comes it is clearly stated that this higher knowledge is the understanding as they truly are the arising the passing away the satisfaction the misery and the escape in regard to the six spheres of sensecontactThe very synoptic nature of this higher knowledge comprehending all the five aspects of the spheres of sensecontact gives rise to detachmentIt is the kind of mastery which an expert physician is endowed with and the Buddha as a matter of fact claimed himself to be oneThe Four Noble Truths can be resolved respectively into the Malady its Cause Health and the Remedy the mastery of all four being the sine qua non for emancipationTo the emancipated one all dogmatic views appear as symptoms of a malady  as twitchings and writhings fraught with pain vexation despair and fever and through them he diagnoses the maladyHence he is not in conflict with them and like a kind physician with perfect equanimity he understands the law of Dependent Arising implicit in that situationGiven the malady  symptoms ariseGiven the remedy  symptoms ceaseAnd his relations with the patient will be purely on therapeutic linesLikewise the abovementioned synoptic understanding of the spheres of sensecontact gives rise to detachment and equanimityIt signifies the Middle Path underlying the law of Dependent ArisingAt S Right view is defined as the law of Dependent Arising which avoids the two extreme views of absolute existence and absolute nonexistenceThus to the questions Does it exist Does it not exist and likewise to the questions Is it oneIs it many  Sthe reply is It depends and this dependence takes the form of the twelvelinked formula in its direct and reverse orderThe theme in brief isWhen ignorance arises the world arisesWhen ignorance ceases the world ceasesSeeing the arising of the world within ones own sixfold sensesphere one does not entertain the dogmatic view Nothing exists and seeing the cessation of the world therein one does not incline to the other extreme view Everything existsThis Sammaa Ditthi as the understanding of the principle of Dependent Arising has an essentially disengaging qualityIt is in the proximity of nonattachment disengagement nondelighting nonentanglement and nongraspingIts counterpart is disenchantment which in its turn leads to detachment cessation NibbaanaRather in keeping with the pragmatic concept of truth the knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyreallyare is one that merely serves the practical purpose of leading onwards without inviting dogmatic involvementHence when Anaathapindika a Streamwinner was questioned by the ascetics of other sects as to whether he is not himself attached to his view Whatever is become compounded thought out and impermanent that is suffering and whatever is suffering that is not mine that I am not that is not my self  he silenced them with the reply that he knows a higher steppingout even from that Right ViewBecause all views couched in percepts and syllables have a centripetal tendency as the word osaranaani suggests the Noble Disciple does not cling even to the Right View but on the other hand developing the centrifugal force implied by nissarana he attains NibbaanaThose who explained to me before  outside the dispensation of Gotama  all of them said So it was and so it will be But all that is soandso talkAll that is productive of logicI did not delight thereinBut as for you O sage you have taught me the Dhamma that is destructive of craving by knowing which and mindfully faring along one might get beyond the worlds viscosityWherefore monks you stir up energy that you may reach what is still unreached that you may attain what is still unattained that you may realize what is still unrealizedThus will this goingforth of ours not be barren but fruitful and of consequenceAnd those offerings of them whose requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicaments we enjoy shall on our part be of great fruit of great consequence for them Verily it is thus monks that you should train yourselvesFor one who discerns his own good this is enough to call up diligent effortFor one who discerns anothers good this is enough to call up diligent effortFor one who discerns the good of both this is enough to call up diligent effortThe frequent practice development and making much of mindfulness recommended by our sutta is one that is conducive to the good of both oneself and othersAs the commentary observes even the mere appreciation of a monk who by his diligent practice attains to arahantship will be a thought productive of great meritBesides ones devotion to the practice and exemplary life can be a source of inspiration to othersSince greed hatred and delusion are the mainsprings of all evil intentions resulting in harm to oneself and others in protecting ones mind from them one is at the same time protecting others as wellForbearance nonviolence lovingkindness and compassion being positive altruistic attitudes directly concern ones relations with the outside worldYet on the mental side too they exercise a wholesome influence conducive to ones own spiritual growthThey are all objectlessons in the practice of mindfulnessThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe present volume on anattaa concludes the treatment of The Three Basic Facts of Existence within The Wheel seriesThough the Buddhas teaching on notself has been treated quite often in these publications it was felt that some more material from sources not easily accessible to the general reader should be offered hereFrom different angles these essays and translations will throw light on that central teaching of Buddhism anattaaAs the earlier books on anicca and dukkha this volume too concludes with a concise and systematic treatment of the subject by the late venerable anamoli Thera which is a valuable guide to the source material as well as to a deeper study of this profound doctrineThe diverse renderings chosen by the individual authors for the key term anattaa or nairaatmya have been retainedHence it should be understood by the reader that egolessness soullessness impersonality and notself all stand for the Pali term anattaa Nyanaponika TheraMore and more the noble teaching of the Buddha seems to be on the way to conquer the worldMore than ever before the Buddhists are working for its propagation in nearly all the countries of the earthEspecially in India the birth place of Buddhism whence it disappeared for nearly a thousand years Buddhism has again made its entrance and gained a firm footing and with rapid strides it is ever gaining more and more groundOne therefore should rather think it a good omen that India having regained its independence has adopted as its emblem the Buddhist FourLion symbol of Emperor Asoka and that at the proclamation of the Indian Republic behind the presidential throne crowned with this Buddhist emblem there appeared the Buddhas statueAlso all over Europe and America a mighty Buddhist wave is set in motion which no longer can be kept back and suppressed and which sooner or later will flood the world with its beneficial influenceThe world is no longer satisfied with dogmas based on blind beliefEverywhere in the world there is found today a striving for freedom and independence externally and internally and ever more the thinking man feels that the destinies of beings are not dependent on the omnipotence and infinite goodness of an imaginary creator but that they rest entirely on the beings themselvesIt is in Buddhism that one may find the true answers to many of the problems that are troubling men and which they wish to get solvedEverybody knows that Buddhism is not a revealed religion and not based on blind belief but that it is a doctrine to be realized by mans own understanding a doctrine that makes man free and independent in his thinking and assures him of happiness and peaceBut of one thing I wish to warn all those who are working for the propagation of Buddhism namely not to allow themselves to be influenced or carried away by seemingly identical theosophical Christian or what is still worse materialistic teachingsFor all these are in essence and substance very often diametrically opposed to the Buddhas doctrines and prevent a real understanding and realization of the profound law discovered and proclaimed by the BuddhaThe most crucial point for most men seems to be the Buddhas fundamental teaching of phenomenality egolessness and impersonality of existence in Pali anattaaIt is the middle way between two extremes namely on the one hand the spiritualistic belief in an eternal egoentity or soul outlasting death on the other hand the materialistic belief in a temporary egoentity becoming annihilated at deathTherefore it is said There are three teachers in the worldThe first teacher teaches the existence of an eternal egoentity outlasting death that is the Eternalist as for example the ChristianThe second teacher teaches a temporary egoentity which becomes annihilated at death that is the annihilationist or materialistThe third teacher teaches neither an eternal nor a temporary egoentity this is the BuddhaThe Buddha teaches that what we call ego self soul personality etc are merely conventional terms not referring to any real independent entityAnd he teaches that there is only to be found this psychophysical process of existence changing from moment to momentWithout understanding the egolessness of existence it is not possible to gain a real understanding of the Buddhaword and it is not possible without it to realize that goal of emancipation and deliverance of mind proclaimed by the BuddhaThis doctrine of egolessness of existence forms the essence of the Buddhas doctrine of emancipationThus with this doctrine of egolessness or anattaa stands or falls the entire Buddhist structureIndeed for anyone who wishes to engage in the study of the Buddhist scriptures the best thing would be from the very start to get himself acquainted with the two methods in which the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the worldThe first method is the teaching in conventional language the second method is the teaching in philosophically correct languageThe first one relates to conventional truth the second to truth in the ultimate senseThus whenever the Buddha uses such terms as I person living being etc this is to be understood as conventional speech hence not correct in the highest senseIt is just as speaking of the rising and setting of the sun though we know thoroughly well that this does not correspond to realityThus the Buddha teaches that in the ultimate sense amongst all these psychophysical phenomena of existence there cannot be found any eternal or even temporary egoentity and hence that all existence of whatever kind is something impersonal or anattaaIn this connection I would like to emphasize the fact that this fundamental doctrine of egolessness and emptiness is not as some misinformed Western Buddhists assert only taught in the southern school of Buddhism but that even in the socalled the Mahayana schools it forms a most essential partWithout this teaching of anattaa or egolessness there is no Buddhism and without having realized the truth of egolessness no real progress is possible on the path to deliveranceThe Buddha is in every respect a teacher at the golden mean ethically as well as philosophicallyFrom the ethical standpoint for example the Buddha rejects two extremes the way of sensual pleasures and the way of selftortureFrom the philosophical standpoint he rejects eternity as well as temporariness of an ego entityJust so he rejects belief in an absolute identity and an absolute otherness of the various stages of the process of existenceHe rejects the determinism as well as the belief in chanceHe rejects the belief in absolute existence and absolute nonexistence likewise in freedom of will as well as in unfreedom of willAll these things will become clear to one who understands the egolessness and conditioned nature of all phenomena of existenceOn the understanding of these two truths depends the understanding of the entire doctrine of the BuddhaHence the understanding and final penetration of the egolessness and conditionedness of all phenomena of existence are the necessary foundation to the realization of the noble eightfold path leading to deliverance from all vanity and misery namely right understanding right thought right speech right bodily action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration of mindOnly this golden middle path based on these two kinds of right understanding namely of egolessness and conditionedness can alleviate and destroy these vain illusions of self and craving which are the rootcauses of all war and bloodshed in the worldBut without these two kinds of understanding there is no realization of the holy and peaceful goal pointed out by the BuddhaThere are however to be found various wouldbe Buddhists in the West who are attached to an imaginary Great Self and who uphold that the Buddha did in no way reject the view of an eternal Atman or soul behind and independent of the phenomena of existence and who believe that the Mahayana texts teach such a doctrineSuch assertions however do not in the least prove correct for neither do the Pali texts nor the early Mahayana texts proclaim an eternal selfAny reader who is unbiased in mind and free from prejudices can never from a study of the Buddhist scriptures come to the conclusion that the Buddha ever taught any such egoentity within or outside the corporeal mental and spiritual phenomena of existenceNowhere in the world can there be found such an entity as was clearly pointed out by the BuddhaRegarding the questions whether the Holy One will continue after death or not continue etc the Buddha says that all such questions are wrongly putAnd whyBecause what is called the Holy One is here only a conventional term and refers to no real entity while in reality there is only to be found a process of corporeal mental and spiritual phenomenaIn another text therefore the Buddhist asks a monk whether he considered corporeality as the Holy One or the feelings or the perceptions or the mental formations or consciousnessOr whether he believed the Holy One to exist within these five groups of phenomena or outside thereofOr whether all these phenomena heaped together were the Holy OneAnd denying all these questions the Buddha further said that even during lifetime the Holy One could not be discovered in reality and that therefore it would be wrong to ask whether the Holy One will continue or not continue after death etcThus no entities are existing in the world but only everchanging processesThe Buddha further says Only because man does not understand corporeality feeling and the other mental and spiritual phenomena being impermanent unsatisfactory and impersonal and does not understand their conditioned origin their extinction and the path leading to their extinction therefore he will think that the Holy One does continue or does not continue after death etcThis therefore is the reason why the Buddha did not answer such questionsAccording to Buddhism the whole of existence is comprised in the five groups of phenomena mentioned above or still more briefly expressed in the three groups corporeality consciousness and the mental factorsAnd within these three groups are comprised the only and ultimate things given though also these again are mere fleeting and evanescent phenomena flashing up for a moment in order to disappear immediately thereafter foreverThus whenever in the Buddhist scriptures mention is made of I self living being etc even of the Buddha these expressions accordingly are used merely as conventional terms without referring to any real entitiesTherefore the Buddha has said It is impossible it cannot be that a man with real understanding should ever consider anything as a real entityHe who does not understand the egolessness of existence and who still attached to egoillusion such a one cannot comprehend and understand the four Noble Truths of the Buddha in the true lightThese four truths areHe who has not penetrated the egoillusion and is still attached to selfvanity will believe that it is he himself that suffers will believe that is he himself that performs the good and evil deeds leading to his rebirth that it is he himself that will enter Nirvana that is he himself that will bring the eightfold path to perfectionWhoso however has fully penetrated the egolessness of existence knows that in the highest sense there is no individual that suffers that commits the kammic deeds that enters Nirvana and that brings the Eightfold Path to perfectionIn the Visuddhi Magga it is therefore saidTherefore wherever the doctrine of the egolessness of all existence is rejected there the Buddhas word is rejectedBut wherever through penetration of the egolessness of all existence the egovanity has reached ultimate extinction there the goal of the Buddhas teaching has been realized namely freedom from all vanity of I and Mine and the highest peace of NibbaanaIf something is yours you have power over it you can make it into whatever you wishIt will change according to your plansBut have you power over your selfCan you make your body larger or smaller or let it be this or that as you desireIf it is not governed by your power but by its own laws and processes then it is not yoursIf it were the body would not be involved in sickness for you would be able to make it be whatever you wishedAdmittedly one has control over the body to an extent but not as much as one has over this house or any other possessionWhyYour body was once very much more delicate and smaller than it is nowNow it is bigger and strongerIt will get weaker and degenerate later onThis body which you call yours  has it developed and deteriorated according to your willOr perhaps the question of ownership does not arise  the body being subject to the same laws of nature as everything else ie birth decay and deathIf this is so should one be concerned or unconcerned regarding the bodyIf neglected the natural processes of destruction act quickly disease and death soon resultingTherefore food exercise and clothing must be used to maintain it and to stop the natural processes being acceleratedDo people feed and dress the body for maintenance only and if not whyTake a person who dresses only to keep his body protected from the elementsWhats wrong with thisShould he be criticized and if he is for whatBecause others dont dress similarly doesnt mean hes doing something wrongSomeone may say he looks ugly and unsightly but how did we learn what ugliness was in the first placeIs the person criticizing him or his clothesWell him is not the body the person criticizing him is not taking offense at the body but just at the clothesThis is where opinion together with vanity creep in and facts become concealedLeaving the body let us turn to another aspect of self  feelingSay a man tries to grasp something which continually slips through his fingersCan he say that thing is hisHe tries to keep it but he can never clutch it solidly and he would never dream of calling that thing his ownBut say he has a fountain penThat really seems to be his ownIt is always with him and it keeps its shape and doesnt change very muchHow about feelings  happiness indifference and painAre not these like the first exampleHow can we ever say feelings are our ownIf they were happiness would be ours for the rest of our life and not an illusive thing which comes and goes against our wishesBody is born it decays and diesLikewise we find on investigation that exactly the same is true for feelingsThe body does not come from nothingIt starts off by the fusing of two cells from mother and fatherBy way of nourishment it grows and developsThen it diesFeeling is born of senseimpingement eg eye and material shape lead to sense impingement which leads to visual consciousness which leads to feeling  pleasant indifferent or painful according to whether or not what has been seen is liked or disliked as a result of past experienceThus we see how feeling is bornBut this feeling changesIf a painful feeling arises we are not content but crave to get away from itAlternatively if we have perceived something that gives a pleasing feeling we long to keep this feeling and try to possess whatever has caused it to ariseWhy dont feelings lastBecause the very things from which they arise do not lastTherefore if we do not grasp after feelings we never sufferFeelings are continually born and continually die but the body takes a long time to do soIf we cannot call body our own how much less so is this true of feelingsLet us now examine a third aspect of ourselves  perceptionWhat do we perceive and is it we who actually perceivePerception is the recognition of senseimpingementsHow is it bornI hear a loud noise and recognize that a door has been slammedWhat is the basis of this recognitionFirstly without the ear no sound would be heard therefore the ear is a necessary basisThe sound impinges on the ear this being sensory impingementFrom this perception arises but like feelings it does not last and soon dies away another rising in its placeDo I enter into this perceptionDo I perceive the door slammingNoWe have definitely seen that perception arose of its own accord with oneself not being involved at allWell if body feeling and perception are not me what isBefore this can be answered there is yet another aspect of ourselves and this is volitional actionHere surely we shall find our true selfI say to a friend I am going to do that and I keep to what Ive saidHere it appears a deliberate choice has been made between doing two specific things either I will or I wontHow does the will or act of choosing arise or is it there all the timeDoes it only come into force when we have to make a choiceOn investigation we find that this is so for example Im going to ride my bicycle tonightThis is a deliberate choiceI could have gone to the cinema or for a walkWhy did I choose ridingDoes volition come into this at allWhat other volitional tendencies are thereI have killed a manSurely volition was thereBut if I ask myself why I wanted to kill him several interesting things come to lightFor arguments sake let us say he murdered my wifeI was very attached to herHe took something away from me which I wantedMissing the pleasurable feelings which were continually aroused by my wifes company a painful feeling took its place when I lost her and I craved to get the former feeling backThe only satisfaction for me was to get rid of the object which caused the painful feeling to arise and therefore I killed himSo we see from this example that the volitional drive had a basis for arising and we see also that after arising it passed away on completion of its primary objectVolition therefore is a conditioned force directed specifically toward something eg I can arouse myself to apply my mind to somethingBut as just proved volition is a conditioned phenomenonCan I therefore be equated with volitionIf so I only exist when volition is present when it passes away I die alsoBut we say we are present all the time  therefore I cannot be equated with volitionIn conclusion we can state that if I say Im going to do this or that what this really means is that this or that is going to be done not by me but through cause and necessityWell we still have not found ourselves yet there is only one more aspect of ourselves to consider  consciousnessAre you conscious am I consciousYes is the usual immediate answerIf this were not so you would say Id be unconscious Can you be conscious without being conscious of anythingMost people would say notLet us find out what are the factors involved in being consciousCan one be conscious without a bodyNot that we know of so we can assume from this that consciousness arises dependent on the bodyWill there be consciousness if no senseorgans are in the bodyWe can categorically state that there will not beSo our second step is that consciousness is dependent on the senseorgansWill there be consciousness with body and senseorgans and no internal or external senseimpingementAgain we can say definitely No Given senseimpingement shall we be consciousYes but it will not be a very meaningful consciousnessWe shall see a conglomeration of colors hear noises smell things have bodily sensations and taste things but not be able to recognize themIf perception is missing one cannot say I am consciousWe have already discussed perception and shown that it is not ones real selfSenseconsciousness together with perception gives us our awareness of things but is there an I who is awareIf you say I am conscious of a vase of flowers on the table are you really conscious of itBy our investigation we have tried to show that you do not enter into is at all and that consciousness like all the other aspects of self has birth decay and deathTo fall into the delusion that the body feelings perception volitional action and consciousness are you is to suffer because unfortunately they are not of you and you are not of them and you cannot expect them ever to give satisfaction for very longIn conclusion I would say that the more disgusted one becomes with compounded things the closer one gets to things that give lasting happiness From The Maha Bodhi MayThe labors of a succession of devoted scholars from Turnour to Rhys Davids has now made impossible at any rate for all serious students of religion the cruder misconceptions of Buddhism that were current in Europe at the end of last centuryIts deeply intellectual character its unique and unsullied record of tolerance its priority of five centuries in promulgation of the higher ethic all these things are now widely knownAnd yet in spite of all this even among such as are devoid of prejudice it is seldom that one meets with a real penetrating understanding of the TeachingTo some its philosophy to others its influence appear alike unintelligibleNow the source of this perplexity it may safely be affirmed is invariably a failure to apprehend that characteristic and central doctrine or principle of Buddhism that is summed up in the Pali term anattaaWithout this there must appear to be an unbridgeable gap in the Buddhist doctrine of causation its power over the hearts and lives of men must seem incapable of explanation its final goal still present the insoluble enigma that it has for long presented to the European mindAnattaa once comprehended however all whether thought or practice is clear and openThat is the key that unlocks the secret the way to the heart of the Buddhist mysteryThe term is generally explained as meaning denial of the soul and yet such a translation is apt to be somewhat misleading to a EuropeanFor it involves in a certain sense both less and more than thatIt does not by any means imply for example that death ends all in the sense of some of the Western schoolsAnd on the other hand the idea of a soul is but a part though indeed the most important part of the great body of conceptions which it deniesTaken in connection with aniccaa the principle of impermanence that which it denies is the idea of separate and abiding substance in anything whatever in the whole unbounded universe whether psychical or physicalPsyche of course was the particular kind of substance which the Buddhist teachers had in view and its proper treatment is naturally psychologicalBut every kind of substance comes under the same condemnation and as the Western mind of today is far more at home in and thinks far more clearly and powerfully upon physical affairs a consideration of some of the physical and biological aspects of anattaa is likely to be the best possible preparation for an understanding of those psychical aspects of it which the Buddhist teachers so earnestly labored to convey the more so as such cases are it should most clearly be understood not illustrations or analogies only they are actual examples of the principle itselfConsider such a phenomenon as a rainbowTo the unsophisticated mind a rainbow is just as real as any other object much more vivid and real than the faint and distant hills that lie beyond itA child indeed filled with longing will beg that it may be given to him that he may have and hold and possess for himself this beautiful and brilliant thingLater on he learns something of its real nature learns that there is in it no thing whatever capable of being so held that it is but a conditioning of certain rays of light and drops of water and has no existence in itself at allThat is precisely the anattaa doctrineThe rainbow is anattaaThis step in sound philosophy every sane adult is taught to takeHow many take any further stepsFor most the cares of life and the deceitfulness of riches  riches often of another world as much as of this  occupy the mind entirely and there is no desire for further knowledgeYet to some one day to all the question cannot but arise  If this be so if the rainbow be but a conditioning how about the things of which it is a conditioningHow about the light and waterSurely those are real enoughVery well thenThe light first what is thatLittle as we all know we know enough to answer that it is an undulation or vibration a particular kind of very rapid movement of somethingBut what is this but just the very answer that was given to the child about the rainbow given to the adult about the lightJust as that rainbow was a conditioning of the light and had no existence in itself so now the light proves to be a conditioning in its turn to have no more existence in itself than the rainbow hadThe light too is anattaaYet if it be an undulation of what is it an undulationOf the etherAnd what is this etherHere we are getting near the limits of our knowledgeYet this much can be said that it is not matterIt is not this it is not that it is not the other  to any question concerning it such are the replies and yet it is not nonexistenceSeek it and it vanishes from the grasp of the mind just as the rainbow and the light did in their turnIt is the very type of insubstantiality of anattaaThe water however that at least is tangible and substantive enoughHere is existence in a way that cannot be deniedGo far enough to north or south and water will react to even the Johnsonian fistNevertheless let it but feel the touch of a lump of sodium or even of a few inches of hot copper and where is itVanished utterly and in its place two things that are no more water than it or light were rainbowWater in itself then is not and never was  nothing was but a particular conditioning of these other things this hydrogen and oxygen as we call them and water is but a name for such conditioningNor need we even think that this waterconditioning is the rule and the waterabolishing experiments mere curious exceptionsThroughout the whole vast universe that is visible to us only in a score of tiny specks is that the caseNot for one fleeting moment in the great star that daily lights us or in a single one of the millions of its peers in the depths of space could the waterconditioning hold goodBoth the constituents of the rainbow therefore are as truly anattaa as the rainbow itselfAs in the case of the first constituent however the question leads us furtherWhat of these elements this hydrogen and this oxygen into which the water has resolved itselfWell it is true that misled by the unsound views of the nature of things in which they were brought up many probably most chemists did for a long time think that in the ultimate combining particle the atom of such elements real separate and abiding substance had at last been hunted downNot all indeed were so deceivedHardly had the atomic theory been formulated when discerning minds began to seek first by one means then by another for that of which the atom must be but a compoundingThe time had not come and they were baffledHow in the last few years they have been completely justified how abiding substance eludes us no less in the atom than it does elsewhere has been already told elsewhereThe hydrogen and oxygen therefore are in their turn nothing but conditionings of something else and when we inquire concerning that of which they are conditionings then as we have done to the ether we can give to it a name we can show that it must behave in such and such a way but the moment that we attempt to lay the profane finger of thought upon it and say that it is this or that it is goneAs of the rainbow so of all things process there is conditioning there is but nowhere the least trace of substance nowhere the least trace of selfThat is the anattaa doctrine as exemplified by matterAccording to the theory of the soul familiar to all of us from our childhood each living body at any rate each living human body is inhabited and informed by a single psychic entity the thinker of all its thoughts doer of its deeds and director of the organism generallyIn Christianity until very lately such a soul was ascribed to human beings only animals had no soulsFor them death ended all without even the hope of a future life in which might be redeemed some of their unmerited sufferings and the present writer well remembers his passionate yearnings as a child after a larger hope for some of the dear animals he loved so well and remembers the quenching of this hope by his orthodox instructorsThe Roman Catholic Church still holds valorously to this ancient orthodoxy but the rapidlygrowing feeling of compassion for animal suffering that has sprung up in the Western world during the past hundred years and is one of its kindliest and noblest features has outside the Roman pale begun to modify opinion and souls are now postulated for at any rate the higher animalsConcurrently with this an influence of a different kind has accelerated the movement of mens minds in the same directionThis comes from the acceptance now general of the theory of evolutionFear for the existence of the human soul was the motive indeed of much of the early opposition to that theory but now that resistance is no longer possible it is coming to be felt that a worthier way out of the difficulty is to be found in the concession of a soul to these our fellowbeingsThe interrelationship and unity of all life left indeed no other way if the soul theory was to be held at allThe unity of life however has other bearings very searching some of them upon the whole question and a consideration of these may throw some light upon animistic views in generalFor there is no stopping at the higher animals still less at those who are our especial friends and loversIf we concede a soul to a dog so must we also to a wolf if to a cat then also to a tigerNor can we call a halt at any place as passing from these sensitive and splendid beings we descend lower and lower through the mammalia till we reach the very humblest of the primitive marsupialsBut the mammalia form but one of the branches of the Tree of Life bird reptile fish put in the same claim and it cannot be denied to themNot even the lowly Amphioxus brooks the refusal of a soul and he standing at the confines of his kingdom opens the gates to the still vaster and dimmer armies of the life we call InvertebrateTo cut an almost endless story short we find even here no place at which to stop and are fain to concede at last that the microscopic protoplasmic cellunits called the protozoa are as able to make good their title as the lordliest of the mammaliaBesides if we were inclined to pass them by with a De minimis non curat lex they could reinforce their claim by pointing out that man himself enters upon his existence as a protozoan unit indistinguishable from themselves and that if this unit contains a soul why should not each of them contain one likewiseThere is another curious considerationIf my soul enters upon existence along with me and is mine and no one elses so also does any other beings even such as a protozoans and it is his soul and no other protozoansNow man propagates his kind at an exceptionally slow rate but the rate of increase in the lower ranks of life is prodigiousStatisticians amuse themselves sometimes by computations of the progeny of a single codfish in quite a moderate space of time and the results are astonishingBut the multiplication of the protozoa proceeds by geometrical progression so that without books at hand I am afraid to quote the shortness of the period in which one such will have given rise to millionsThe influx of new souls into this world alone therefore is proceeding at a rate beyond all power of numbers to convey and when we reflect that this has been going on throughout the whole of geological time the conception is truly staggeringWellfound indeed must be the ship of speculation that can carry such a freight as that across the stormy seas of modern thoughtSo far we have considered the single soul in a single body such as we ourselves have been taught we are endowed withBut there are cases not so simpleAmong the coelenterata and the polyzoa there are as well as a single hydroid animals many species of compound ones in which whole colonies of such beings are united by a coenosarc or fleshbody common to them allWhat are we to say of the soul in a case of this sortShall we ascribe it to the individuals to the coenosarc or to the colony as a wholeThe individual is just such another as any simple hydroid yet if we assign to him a soul like that of the simple one what becomes of the coenosarc which is just as much aliveOr if we assign it to the community then why to the hydra that is rooted in a coenosarc should be denied that which is conceded to his cousin who is rooted on a stoneAnd as if this were not perplexing enough sometimes a member of such a community will detach himself from it altogether and conduct his life on his own accountTo return however to the higher beings ourselves included with a single body and its single soulClosely bound up with the theory of evolution are the facts of histology the structures and relationships that is to say of the microscopic units that compose the living beingLet us consider first the corpuscles of the bloodThey are of the two kinds the large white corpuscles and the smaller red onesBoth are cells but we will consider just now the white onesThey are minute specks of living protoplasm constantly changing their shape moving slowly about and living upon what they meet withNow amongst the protozoa animals consisting of a single cell whose claims to a single soul we were obliged to admit capable of being made good with such irresistible effect is a creature known as the amoebaIt is a speck of protoplasm that moves slowly about from point to point changing its shape as it goes along and living upon any suitable object it can meet withThe white bloodcorpuscles in short and the amoeba are indistinguishable in composition aspect and behaviorThey differ in nothing but their habitat the amoeboid corpuscle can make every whit as effective a claim to a single soul as the amoebaThe one however is an independent being the other an integral part of a most essential portion of our own economy essential indeed for without them the blood cannot perform its functions and is not the blood as we have long ago been told the lifeEven if we take refuge in the brain and seek to locate the soul where thought goes on to that retreat also they pursue us for stop the blood and in a few short minutes thinking ceasesClearly there is something wrongIt is evident that the simpleseeming hypothesis of a single soul in a single body hides a world of perplexities and complicationsThe difficulty of the hydrozoan coenosarc has reappeared in a more subtle form than ever and that within our own breasts the very citadel of the soulhypothesisNor is this even the end of the matterThe relations of the amoeboid corpuscle to the amoeba strike the mind at once and the lessons that they teach are past mistakingBut the red corpuscle is no whit less a cell which were it found elsewhere than in the blood would pass without challenge as one among many protozoan creaturesNay further stillIf we watch through the microscope a drop of pondwater full of paramecium or any other simple animals it will not be long before we see one of them constrict into a sort of waist develop there a medial cellwall and part along that into two each of which proceeds without more ado to go about its own businessIn paramecium and its congeners the new cells leave each other but in slightly higher animals they remain united along the medial wall dividing perhaps and redividing until we have a tissue or colony of several cellsThe members of such a tissue are to the free separating cells as the hydroids of a coenosarcal community to the solitary hydroidsThe inner nature of the cell remains the sameNow all the tissues of the living body are neither more nor less than just such coloniesModified in various ways according to the nature of the tissue here for muscle here for skin there for bone differently again for nerve and finally in a special way for brain itself the units of these tissues are throughout the body cells alike in their essential nature different only in their modificationsThe blood corpuscles are just some of these cells which in order to perform a particular function remained detached and free to move like the protozoaAnd every activity of the being physical or psychical depends entirely on the coordinated activities physical or psychical of this vast multitude which indeed no man can numberBut each one of these is as we now perceive a being to whom if we set out the hypothesis of souls it is logically impossible to refuse a separate soulunit of its ownSeeking in the first part of this article for the essential inner self or being of the rainbow light water and their elements we found that there was not in any one of them any essential self or being whatsoeverEvery one of them turned out to be by its very nature a conditioning of elements that were not itself and this held good to the last stages of analysis that knowledge could applyEvery one of them had to be pronounced anattaaWhat have we now found to be the case of the living beingWe have found it to be more conspicuously if possible than even those other phenomena a conditioning of a vast number of elements that are not one of them itself dependent absolutely upon these elements having apart from them and their activities no existence in itself whateverBeginning with a phenomenon the rainbow with regard to which the Anattaa doctrine is already held by every sane adult we have followed that doctrine and found it to apply to the highest form of existence that we know upon this earthFrom the biological point of view the living being is and that in a superlative degree anattaaFurther treatment of the anattaa subject is of course psychologicalWith that this article is not concernedBut any sound psychology must be in harmony not at variance with biology and physicsSuffice it then to say here that we may be sure that what is biologically compound will not prove to be psychologically simpleWere we ever inclined to regard the doctrines of anattaa and the khandhas as either fantastic or perverse we may wonder rather at the discernment which perceived the one long before biology and physics were and at the moderation which gave us but five khandhas where modern science would give for one of them alone something much more like five hundred millionsFar more marvellous however was that surpassing spiritual penetration that could see in this compositeness of our nature nothing less than the balm of sorrow the justification of the Golden Rule and lifes liberation from the house of bondageParts of this article may have perhaps a somewhat polemical expressionWell argument if undertaken at all should be made conclusive and convincing if that be possible and should result in intellectual convictionBut intellectual conviction is not religion it may not even have religion as its consequence in lifeSomething more is neededHe who discerns not lifes pathos and its sorrow will not find out the Annattaa path of love to sorrows utter ceasing From The Buddhist Review VolIII NoNarcissism is a passion the intensity of which in many individuals can only be compared with sexual desire and the desire to stay aliveIn fact many times it proves to be stronger than eitherEven in the average individual in whom it does not reach such intensity there remains a narcissistic core which appears to be almost indestructible Erich Fromm The Heart of ManThe word narcissism is derived from a Greek legendNarcissus in mythology is a beautiful youth who loved no one till he saw his own body reflected in waterNarcissus fell in love with his own reflection finally he pined away died and was turned into the flower of like nameThus the word narcissism derived from this legend has been generally used to refer to a kind of morbid selfloveThe concept of narcissism was woven into psychological theory by Sigmund FreudFreud himself borrowed this name from Paul Nacke who used the term to describe a perversion where an adult individual lavishes upon his own body all the caresses expended only upon a sexual object other than himself it was Freud however who grasped for the first time the tremendous significance of the concept of narcissismFreuds essay on narcissism is one of the richest spots in his psychology unfortunately neglected by his fellow psychiatrists and submerged by the popular image of Freuds workFreuds essay on narcissism is a little gem which would have been pushed into an insignificant corner in the field of psychological theory but for the efforts of Eric Fromm who remarks that One of the most fruitful and farreaching of Freuds discoveries is his concept of narcissismFreud himself considered it to be one of his most important findings In this paper I shall very briefly refer to the Freudian concept of narcissism and then present Fromms development on this against the background of the anattaa doctrineBefore his paper on narcissism appeared Freud made a clear distinction between the sexual instinct and the ego instinct or in more popular terms between love and hunger But he came across an interesting category of patients whose condition presented a great challenge to this distinction between sexual and ego instinctsWe became slowly accustomed to the conception that the libido which we find attached to certain objects and which is the desire to gain some satisfaction in these objects can also abandon these objects and set the ego itself in their place says FreudMore reflection on this point made him realize that a fixation of this kind to the subjects own body and his person was not something accidental it is probable that this is the original condition of man out of which object love develops later without thereby necessarily affecting a disappearance of narcissismThis conception of narcissism was backed by evidence from a number of sourcesIn megalomania we get the subjective overestimation of selfimportance in dementia praecox we get the magical belief in the omnipotence of thought Freud also studied the mind of the infant and the primitive man and here too discovered an expression of narcissismThere are also other situations in life like disease after an accident in old age etc when the tendency to this withdrawal into selfpreoccupation is apt to become pronounced Normal love is also affected by a great deal of narcissismThe notion of narcissism was used to explain a wide range of distinct phenomena ranging from love jealousy and fear to mass phenomenaContinuing on these lines Fromm has worked out the spell of narcissism in group behavior nationalism and warIt was due to Fromms insight that the concept of narcissism was salvaged from its limited base in the libido theory and given a more comprehensive interpretationFromm himself makes a reference to Buddhism which is extremely significant for an understanding of narcissismFromm says that the essential teachings of all the humanistic religions in the world can be summarized in one sentence It is the goal of man to overcome ones narcissismPerhaps this principle is nowhere expressed more radically than in Buddhism Fromm concludes on these lines that if man sheds the illusion of his indestructible ego and the other objects of greed only then can he be totally open awake and be fully related to the worldThe illusion of the indestructible ego that Fromm mentions is quite clearly a reference to the Buddhist doctrine of anattaaThere is no ego entity existing apart and independently of those physical and mental processes that constitute lifeThe illusion of the ego has two basic forms eternity belief and annihilation beliefThe craving for selfish pursuits arises with a false conception of personality based on the dogma of personal immortality and the craving for annihilation arises with a false conception of personality based on the annihilationist viewAn understanding of the doctrine of sakkaayaditthi helps us to grasp the Buddhist doctrine of egolessnessWhere there is a mere complex of corporeality feeling perception dispositions and consciousness the individual being subject to the ego illusion assumes the existence of an egoThis does not mean that the ego is merely an intellectual constructionThe roots of the ego illusion are strong and it is fed by deep effective processesThese processes are dormant proclivities described in the Discourses of the Buddha as the latent desire for continued existenceThe origin of the Freudian concept of narcissism is the point at which Narcissus falls in love with his own bodyIn relating autoeroticism to narcissism Freud says that the ego is first and foremost a bodyego Fromm also says that one of the most elementary examples of narcissism can be found in the attitude to the body exhibited by the average personThe narcissistic relation to ones body has its parallel in the doctrine of the Buddha where he discusses the operation of personality beliefs in relation to corporealityThe majority of the people who are not skilled in the doctrine of the Buddha are subject to the egoillusion associated with their bodyThis egoillusion is described in the suttas These people who are untrained in the doctrine of the Buddha regard body as the self they regard the self as having a body body as being in the self the self as being in the bodyI am the body say they body is mine and they are possessed by this idea The Buddha also says that due to the excessive attachment to the body when it alters and changes sorrow and grief set in thus the doctrine of anattaa is linked to the doctrine of dukkhaHowever while the bodyimage concept of the ego dominates the thought of Freud the Buddha offers a more comprehensive analysis relating the egoillusion to feeling perception dispositions and consciousnessTo use a phrase of Wolheim the corporeal overtones of the ego concept prevented Freud from presenting a broad base for his theory of narcissismIn fact Wolheim has pointed out a significant ambiguity in the Freudian analysis of narcissismSometimes Freud conceives narcissism as an attraction towards ones own person and sometimes as an attraction towards ones own bodyFromm has not merely revitalized the Freudian concept of narcissism but takes it very much beyond this and brings it close to the doctrine of the BuddhaNot merely does Fromm offer a theory of narcissism which is of interest to the Buddhist but he quite clearly refers to the doctrine of the Buddha The awakened person of whom Buddhist teaching speaks is the person who has overcome his narcissism and who is therefore capable of being fully awakeThe narcissistic person is not only proud of his body but he has an exaggerated and inflated image of all aspects of his personality his intelligence his honor and his wealth his social standing etcJust as the narcissistic person has made his selfimage the object of his narcissistic attachment he does the same with everything connected with himHis ideas his knowledge his house but also people in his sphere of interest become objects of his narcissistic attachment As both Freud and Fromm point out ones narcissistic image about oneself is projected on to the childrenThis is extended to identification with wider groups culminating in nationalismKaren Horney was quick to point out that at the root of this kind of narcissistic selfimage is found a kind of selfinflation rather than selflove with a need not for love but the admiration of othersAt this point we see the relevance of the Buddhist concept of maanaSelfconceit according to the Buddha takes three forms I am superior to others I am equal to others I am inferior to othersMaana is one of the fetters that bind man to the ills of existence and it varies from a crude feeling of pride to a subtle feeling of distinctiveness that prevails till the attainment of arahantshipIf a person is proud of his attainments exaggerates them and feels infuriated when someone gives a lower estimation of his doings he suffers from an inflated sense of vanityIf he feels frustrated disappointed and underestimates his attainments he is subject to a kind of inferiority complexThis is similar to what Fromm describes as depression The element of mourning in melancholia refers in my opinion to the narcissistic image of the wonderful I which has died and for which the depressed person is mourningPride vanity and conceit manifest clearly in interpersonal relations as a reactive expression as wounded narcissism Its mechanism is similar to what Freud refers to as secondary narcissism Ones wounded narcissism gives way either to an ego collapse depression and melancholy or to anger and furyApart from discussing the pathology of narcissism and its crippling impact on healthy personality growth Fromm raises the question whether there could be a kind of healthy selflove a benign form of narcissism as different from malignant narcissismIs a certain degree of narcissism necessary for survivalIs there a necessary antinomy between love of self and othersPart of the problem could of course arise due to the linguistic issues besetting the use of the word self in diverse contextsA grasp of the subtle mechanisms that bear upon the psychology of human motivation can clear up another facet of this issueUltimately this might involve a whole philosophical perspective or a way of looking at the universe and manFromms analysis of this question too can be presented against the background of the Buddhist analysis of the issues involvedThe problem arises when we consider love for others and love for oneself as alternatives which are mutually exclusiveSelfishness is not identical with mature selfloveIn fact selfishness is caused by a real lack of genuine selfloveLove in principle is indivisible as far as the connection between the objects and ones own self is concernedGenuine love is an expression of productiveness and implies care respect responsibility and knowledgeIt is not an affect in the sense of being affected by somebody but an active striving for the growth and happiness of the loved person rooted in ones own capacity to loveFromm says that it is only a symbiotic attachment which is rooted in ones narcissismSymbiotic attachment takes two basic forms that of passive submission and active dominanceThe masochistic person escapes from the unbearable feeling of separation and isolation by making himself a part and parcel of another person the sadistic person wants to escape from his aloneness by making another person part and parcel of himselfFrom the Buddhist standpoint a clear distinction could be made between selfdevoting motives and selfcentered motivesThe practice of mettabhaavanaa is the finest expression of the fusing of selflove and love for others in BuddhismThe meditation of lovingkindness is first developed towards oneself and then radiates towards othersOne first starts with the thought May I be happy and then extends it to the welfare and happiness of othersEven where a person makes a sacrifice and forgoes certain material benefits for the sake of others it merely strengthens his selfdevelopmentThe very nature of the good is such that no one can seek the salvation of others without seeking his ownIt is extremely important to mention that Buddhism considers the life of renunciation as the highest expression of the otherregarding instinctsThis is very well expressed in the Kindred SayingsIn the suttas there is a classification of beings into four types He who is neither bent on his own profit nor on the profit of another he who is bent on the profit of another but not his own he who is bent on his own profits not anothers and he who is bent on the profit both of himself and anotherThe Buddha considers the last category as the bestThe context in which the Buddha made the analysis cited above may be a little different from the context in which Fromm has made a case for genuine selfloveBut I do not see any fundamental difference between the approaches in Buddhism and that of Erich FrommIt is true that the Buddha was basically concerned with the life of renunciation and the otherregarding virtues in Buddhism are based on a deeper doctrine of compassionBut if we present the basic human relations presented in a homily to Sigaala it will be quite clear that even in limited social situations the Buddha advocates mature human relations which deny any symbiotic attachment of abnormal domination or dependenceThere is however a wider dimension in which the Buddhist analysis of selflove has to be presentedA layman who has made a necessary compromise with life will find it difficult to handle the obtruding ego while the recluse committed to the path of renunciation will have at his command a more effective therapeutic control over the spell of narcissismThe only way to bridge the gap is to discover significant similarities between the techniques used by the psychiatrist in special clinical situations and that the recluse who has made a lifelong commitment to a therapeutic procedure of his ownThis short paper is essentially a response to a psychiatrist with vision who has opened a significant dialogue with humanistic religionsThe five groups are a classification in which the Buddha has summed up all the physical and mental phenomena of existence and in particular those which appear to the ignorant man as his ego or personalityThey are corporeality feeling perception mental formations and consciousnessIt is said in the Visuddhi Magga Whenever different parts as axle wheels frame pole etc are combined in a certain manner we use the conventional designation chariot But if we examine one part after the other we cannot in the ultimate sense discover anything that can be called a chariot It is likewise with the five groups of existenceIf they are present one uses the conventional designation being or personality etcBut if we examine each phenomenon in its ultimate sense there is nothing that can form a basis for such conceptions as I am and I Hence in the ultimate sense only mental and physical phenomena existBut who Venerable One is it that feelsThis question is not proper said the Exalted OneI do not teach that there is one who feelsIf however the question is put thus Conditioned through what does feeling arise then the answer will be Through senseimpression is feeling conditioned through feeling craving through craving clingingBut what are old age and death and to whom do they belongI do not teach that there is one thing called old age and death and that there is someone to whom they belongVerily if one holds the view that life is identical with the body in that case there can be no holy lifeAnd if one holds the view that life is one thing but body another thing also in that case a holy life is impossibleAvoiding both of these extremes the Perfect One has taught the doctrine that lies in the middle namely Through rebirth conditioned are old age and death Through the process of becoming rebirth through clinging the process of becoming through craving clinging through feeling craving etcVisuddhi Magga quotesBetter it would be to consider the body as the ego rather than the mindAnd whyBecause this body may last for or years even for years and moreBut that which is called mind consciousness thinking arises continuously during day and night as one thing and as something different again it vanishesNow here the learned and noble disciple considers thoroughly the Dependent Origination If this is then that becomesThrough the arising of this that comes to arise through the extinction of this that becomes extinguished namely Through ignorance conditioned arise the karmaformations through the karmaformations consciousness through consciousness corporeality and mind through the extinction of ignorance the karmaformations become extinguished through the extinction of the karmaformations consciousness etcCorporeality feeling perception mental formations and consciousness are impermanentwoeful egoless be they of the past or the future not to mention the presentUnderstanding thus the learned and noble disciple does no longer cling to things past and he enters the path leading to the turning away therefrom to detachment and extinctionThe five groups of existence are impermanent woeful and egolessAnd also the causes and conditions of the arising of these groups of existence are impermanent woeful and egolessHow could that which has arisen through something impermanent woeful and egoless as its root be itself permanent joyful and an egoAll those ascetics and priests who again and again in manifold ways belief in an ego they all do so with regard to the five groups of existence or to one of them namelyThere the ignorant worldling considers one of the five groups as the ego or the ego as the owner of that group or that group as included in the ego or the ego as included in that groupNow someone holds the view This is my ego this is the worldAfter death I shall remain permanent steady eternal and not be subject to any changeThis eternityview is one karmaformationBut through what is this karmaformation conditionedIt is the craving which has arisen in the ignorant worldling while being impressed by a feeling conditioned through an infatuated senseimpressionIt is through this craving arisen hereby that the karmaformulation has arisenHence that karmaformation is impermanent created and has conditionally arisenIn one who thus understands thus sees the immediate extinction of biases takes placeAgain someone holds the view May I not beMay there nothing belong to meI shall not beNothing will belong to me Also this annihilationview is a karmaformation is impermanent created and conditionally arisenIn one who thus understands thus sees the immediate extinction of biases takes placeTo the monk Yamaka once the following wrong view had arisen Thus do I understand the doctrine shown by the Blessed One that he in whom all Biases have vanished at the dissolution of the body after death will become annihilated and will no longer exist after deathWhat do you think Brother Yamaka are corporeality feeling perception mental formations or consciousness permanent or impermanentImpermanent venerable sirNow do you consider corporeality etc as the Perfect OneNo venerable sirOr do you consider the Perfect One as contained thereinNo venerable sirOr do you consider all these groups combined as the Perfect OneNo venerable sirOr do you think that the Perfect One is without corporeality or without feeling without perception without mental formations without consciousnessNo venerable sirNow since you cannot even during lifetime make out the Perfect One according to truth and reality how can you rightly maintain that the Perfect One will at the dissolution at the body become annihilated and no longer continue after deathShould someone asked me what will become of the Holy One I should answer thus Corporeality feeling perception mental formations and consciousness are impermanent and what is impermanent that is woeful and what is woeful that will become extinguished and annihilatedFive groups of existence forming the objects of attachment have been taught by the Blessed One corporeality feeling perception mental formations consciousnessWith regard to these five groups I do not find any ego or something belonging to an ego but still I am not yet a Holy One not yet freed from biasesAlso concerning these groups of existence liable to attachment I am no longer subject to the thoughts of I am or this I amThe world as a rule is fettered by attachment and clinging to things and is firmly adhering to themBut the learned and noble disciple does no longer attach himself cling and firmly adhere and incline to the thoughts I have an ego and he knows Merely woe is it that arises merely woe that vanishesSuppose a man who is not blind beheld the many bubbles on the Ganges as they drive along and he watched them and carefully examined themAfter carefully examining them they will appear to him empty unreal and unsubstantialIn exactly the same way does the monk behold all corporeal phenomena feelings perceptions mental formations and states of consciousness whether past present or future ones own or external gross or subtle lofty or low far or nearAnd he watches them and examines them carefully and after examining them they appear to him empty unreal and unsubstantialThere is no corporeality no feeling no perception no mental formation no consciousness that is permanent enduring and lasting and that not subject to any change will eternally remain the sameIf there existed such an ego that is permanent enduring and lasting and not subject to any change then a holy life leading to complete extinction of suffering will not be possibleOnce the contemplation of impermanency has been developed and has attained full growth then it will overcome all craving for sensuous existence all craving for finematerial existence all craving for immaterial existence it will overcome and uproot all conceit of I amThe learned and noble disciple does not consider corporeality feeling perception mental formations or consciousness as the ego nor the ego as the owner of one of these groups nor this group as included within the ego nor the ego as included within this groupOf such a learned and noble disciple it is said that he is no longer fettered by any group of existence his own or externalThus I sayIt is possible that a virtuous man while contemplating the five groups of existence as impermanent woeful empty egoless may realize the fruit of streamentranceThe noble disciple who out of faith has gone forth from home to the homeless life has with regard to the five groups of existence to fulfil the task of living in contemplation of their impermanency woefulness and egolessnessAnd while penetrating these things he becomes freed therefrom freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation grief and despair becomes freed from suffering thus I sayWhat must exist and what must be the condition that such views may arise as This is my ego this the worldAfter death I shall continue be everlasting eternal not subject to any changeThe five groups of existence must exist that such views may ariseWhat do you think Are these five groups permanent or are they impermanentImpermanent venerable sirBut what is impermanent is that joyful or woefulWoeful venerable sirBut based on that which is impermanent woeful and subject to change may arise such views as This is my ego this the worldAfter death I shall continue be everlasting eternal not subject to any changeNo venerable sirThe visible objects are egoless sounds odors tastes bodily impressions and mindobjects are egolessBut of that which is egoless one has according to reality and true wisdom to know thus That am I not that does not belong to me that is not my egoWhat is the totality of thingsEye and visible objects ear and sounds nose and odors tongue and tastes body and bodily impressions mind and mindobjects these are called the totality of thingsAll things are egolessAll things one has to comprehend fully all things one has to overcome all things one has to know directlyIt is said that the world is emptyBut why does one call the world emptyBecause the world is empty of an ego and of something belonging to the ego therefore the world is called emptyBut which are the things that are empty of an egoEmpty of an ego are eye and visible objects ear and sounds nose and odors tongue and tastes body and bodily impressions mind and mindobjectsOne should not imagine oneself of being identical with the eye should not imagine oneself of being included within the eye should not imagine oneself of being outside the eye should not imagine oneself The eye belongs to meOne should not imagine oneself of being identical with the visible objects should not imagine oneself of being included within the visible objects should not imagine oneself of being outside the visible objects should not imagine The visible objects belong to meOne should not imagine oneself of being identical with eyeconsciousness should not imagine oneself of being included within eyeconsciousness should not imagine oneself of being outside of eyeconsciousness should not imagine The eyeconsciousness belongs to meOne should not imagine oneself of being identical with the totality of thingsThus not imagining any more the wise disciple clings no longer to anything in the worldClinging no longer to anything he trembles notTrembling no longer he reaches in his own person the extinction of all vanity Exhausted is rebirth lived the holy life and no further existence have I to expect thus he knowsConsciousness is egolessAlso the causes and conditions of the arising of consciousness they likewise are egolessThen how could it be possible that consciousness having arisen through something which is egoless could ever be an egoWhoso understands and contemplates the mind as egoless in him the egoview disappearsWhoso understands and contemplates as egoless the mindobjects mindconsciousness mindimpression and the agreeable disagreeable and indifferent feeling conditioned through mindimpression in him the egoview disappears Just as this body has in various ways been revealed disclosed and explained as egoless in exactly the same way one should explain also mind as egoless Empty village is the name for the six senseorgansThus whenever an experienced learned and wise man examines the six senseorgans eye ear nose tongue body or mindorgan then all these things appear to him as delusive empty and deceitfulI am is a delusionThis I am is a delusionCorporeal shall I be is a delusionUncorporeal shall I be is a delusionEndowed with perception shall I be is a delusionWithout perception shall I be is a delusionNeither with nor without perception shall I be is a delusionDelusion is a sickness an ulcer a thorn What is the minddeliverance of emptinessThere the monk repairs to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty hutAnd he contemplates thus Empty is all this of an ego and of anything belonging to an ego If one develops the contemplation of impermanency of egolessness due to woefulness then all these contemplations are leading to higher blessingDo not think such evil unwholesome thoughts as Life and body are identical or Life is one thing but another is the body or Does the Perfect One live after death or not and why should one not think such thoughtsBecause such thoughts are not profitable do not belong to the genuine holy life do not lead to the turning away and detachment not to extinction appeasement enlightenment and NirvanaI shall show here the advantages arising from the realization of the characteristic of notselfIf one can clearly perceive the characteristic of anattaa one achieves the knowledge pertaining to the path of streamentry wherein egodelusion and personality belief are totally eradicatedAll beings who drift and circle in the long and beginningless round of rebirths called samsaara rarely encounter the teachings of a BuddhaThey may not encounter them for the time of even a hundred thousand worldcyclesThey may not get the opportunity of hearing of a Buddhas teachings even once while an infinite number of worldcycles elapseThe number of existences and worldcycles in which beings have been afflicted by evil and error predominateHence in the mental makeup of a being there is always an infinite number of unwholesome actions that can result in its falling into a world of utmost torment or in being reborn in other worlds of woeEgodelusion is the foremost of the unwholesome kamma of old and accompanies beings incessantlyAs long as personalitybelief exists these old unwholesome actions are fiery and full of strengthThough beings may be enjoying happiness and splendour as deities as divine rulers or in the finematerial or immaterial Brahma worlds yet they necessarily exist as it were with their heads forever turned towards the four worlds of woePalm fruits in a palm grove have an everexisting tendency to fall to the ground even though they may be attached to the very top of a palm treeSo long as the stalks are firm the fruits will remain on the tree but as soon as the stalks weaken they will inevitably fall to the groundIn the same way deities and Brahma gods afflicted with egodelusion will be able to exist in their respective worlds only as long as the stalks of vital life force as deities and Brahmas remain intactBut when these stalks of vital life force are severed they inevitably fall into worlds below just like the palm fruitsThis happens because personalitybelief which is ever present in the mental makeup of a being is a great burden  heavier than even the Mount Meru  inasmuch as personalitybelief gathers in its fold an infinite number of unwholesome kamma accumulated in the pastThus beings who harbor within themselves this personalitybelief are continually under pressure to gradually descend or directly to fall towards the worlds of woe although they may be living in the highest of the Brahma worldsThe cases of beings living in the lower Brahma worlds or in the celestial or human world are much worse and need no further commentAlthough such beings may exist as the rulers of Brahma worlds or of celestial worlds yet their mental makeup contains readymade the eight great hells the lesser hells the worlds of ghosts and demons and the animal realmIt is because these beings do not know that the tendency towards those miseryfilled lower realms is always present in their mental makeup that the Brahma kings and divine kings can afford to derive pleasure and enjoyment from their form of existenceBut all the old unwholesome actions that have accompanied beings throughout the long and beginningless round of rebirths will be extinguished completely when their head and chief personalitybelief has been made to disappear entirelyApart from that old unwholesome kamma that had accompanied beings since time immemorial even in the case of the numerous unwholesome actions committed in the present existence their tendencies entirely disappear as soon as their head and chief the personalitybelief becomes completely extinguishedFor such beings there may remain occasion to fear affliction by vermin but there no longer remains any occasion for them to fear the resultants of the infinite number of past unwholesome actionsBeings whose mental makeup is entirely freed from personalitybelief have as it were their heads turned towards the higher planes of the celestial and Brahma worlds even though they may be living in the human worldAnd if living in the lower celestial and Brahma realms their heads are always turned towards the higher planes of those worldsThey resemble the vapors that invariably rise upwards from forests and mountains during the latter part of the rainy seasonThis shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of personalitybelief as far as relating to past kammaHuman beings deities and Brahmas who have personalitybelief in their mental makeup may be good and virtuous beings today but any time later they may commit an unlimited number of evil deeds even grave offences like matricide parricide killing of arahants etc and this may happen to them tomorrow or the day after next month or next year or in following existencesToday they may be devotees within the fold of the Buddhas Dispensation while tomorrow or the day after etc they may be outside its pale or even become enemies and destroyers of the Buddha SaasanaThose beings however human or divine who well perceive the characteristic of notself and thus have entirely extirpated personalitybelief from their mental makeup will cease to commit evil deeds and other unwholesome kamma even in their dreams although they may continue to circle in samsaara for many more lives to comeFrom the day of freeing themselves from personalitybelief until their final existence before their attainment of Nibbaana they will always remain within the fold of the Buddhas Dispensation wherever they are rebornThey will never appear in a form of existence or in a world where the Buddhas Dispensation is absentThis shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of personalitybelief as far as relating to future kammaHow the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past become inoperative at the moment when personalitybelief is extinguished may be illustrated as followsIn a string of beads where a great number of beads are strung together by a strong silk thread if one bead is pulled all the others will follow the one that is pulledBut if the silk thread is cut or removed pulling one of the beads will not disturb the other beads because there is no longer any attachment between themSimilarly a being that possesses personalitybelief harbors a strong attachment to the series of the aggregates arisen during past existences and past world cycles and transforms them into an egoThinking In the past I have often been a human being a deity or a Brahmaa he acquires the thread that is personalitybeliefIt is thus that the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past which have not yet produced resultants will accompany that being wherever he may be rebornThese unwholesome actions of the past resemble beads that are strung and bound together by a strong threadBeings however who clearly perceive the characteristic of notself and have rid themselves of personalitybelief will perceive that the bodily and mental aggregates that arise and disappear even within the short period of one sitting do so as separate phenomena and not as a closely interlinked continuumThe concept of my self which is like the thread is no longer presentThose bodily and mental processes appear to them like the beads from which the thread has been removedThey clearly perceive that the unwholesome actions of the past committed by them are not persons nor beings not an I nor my actions but that they arise and disappear in an instantThat is why that past unwholesome kamma disappears as soon as personalitybelief disappearsIt should be known however that only unwholesome kamma disappearsWholesome kamma of the past does not disappear through the mere disappearance of personalitybeliefIt is only when the stage of the path of sainthood is reached and when craving is completely eradicated that wholesome kamma of the past becomes inoperativePersonalitybelief is an evil that is extremely deeprooted and farreachingA person who commits an evil deed and thus becomes extremely agitated and worried over the prospect of being reborn in states of woe transforms that evil deed of his into a self and becomes greatly distressed by such firmly held thoughts as I have done wrongI have gravely erred But if that being fully comprehends and realizes the characteristic of notself and thereby can abolish attachment to such thoughts as I have gravely erred that kamma will no longer have the power of producing resultants so far as that being is concernedBut generally beings do not discard their attachment to such thoughtsAlthough that kamma does not as it were desire to accompany that being nor to produce resultants yet it is forced to do so by the fact that being takes possession of it by harboring such thoughts as I myself have committed that deedIt is my kamma Because of this forcible possessive act that kamma is obliged to produce its resultantsTo this extent are beings possessing personalitybelief deluded and erring in their waysIt is the same in the case of unwholesome kamma of the past that remains operativeIt is because of the forcible possessive act of personalitybelief that this kamma accompanies beings throughout their samsaric wanderings and will produce its resultants in due courseBeings find that they cannot discard their unwholesome actions though being oppressed by their resultants and suffering great privations in the processThey think I have committed those evil deeds and thus they take as it were possession of themThus these unwholesome actions cannot help to produce resultants and continue to do so disabling those beings to achieve releaseTo this extent personalitybelief is profoundly evil and erroneousBeings are very much afraid of the dangers of disease old age and deathBut through harboring such fear they become attached to the past incidents of disease old age and death by identifying themselves with those experiences in the thought For a long time in the past I have suffered these ills Thus they find it impossible to relinquish even such fearsome phenomenaHence these phenomena of disease old age and death continue to accompany them as it were against their own will and continue to cause oppressionTo this extent too is personalitybelief profoundly evil and erroneousIn this present existence too when external and internal dangers are encountered or disease and ailments occur beings attach themselves to them through such thoughts as I feel pain I feel hurt and thus take a possessive attitude towards themThis becomes an act of bondage that later may obstruct beings from ridding themselves of those diseases ailments and dangersBecause this bondage through personalitybelief is so strong beings have often found those diseases ailments or dangers to be their inseparable companions through many existences up to the present dayThus personality creates a possessive attachment even to diseases ailments and dangers though these are so greatly oppressiveAlso fears of encountering disease ailments and dangers in future will produce such a bondageAnd as long as there is personalitybelief beings will certainly meet such eventualities also in futureThis is a brief description of how personalitybelief is profoundly evil and erroneousThe attachments of craving and conceit are not necessarily attachments of wrong viewsCraving develops an attachment for all the phenomena in the three spheres of existence in the form It is my property Conceit develops a proud attachment for them in the form It is I who owns it or It is I who has those great qualities In the case of beings who have personalitybelief craving and conceit follow the lead given by personalitybeliefIn the case of streamwinners oncereturners and nonreturners who have eliminated personalitybelief craving and conceit follow the distortion of perception and the distortion of consciousnessThe attachments produced by these distortions are superficial but those produced by personalitybelief are deepThis ends the description how unwholesome actions of the past totally cease with the disappearance of personalitybeliefVacchagotta the Wanderer went to visit the Exalted One and saidNow master Gotama is there a self At these words the Exalted One was silentHow then master Gotama is there not a self For a second time the Exalted One was silentThen Vacchagotta the Wanderer rose from his seat and went awayNow not long after the departure of the Wanderer the Venerable Aananda said to the Exalted OneHow is it lord that the Exalted One gave no answer to the question of the Wanderer VacchagottaIf Aananda when asked by the Wanderer Is there a self I had replied to him There is a self then Aananda that would be siding with the recluses and brahmins who are eternalistsBut if Aananda when asked Is there not a self I had replied that it does not exist that Aananda would be siding with those recluses and brahmins who are annihilationistsAgain Aananda when asked by the Wanderer Is there a self had I replied that there is would my reply be in accordance with the knowledge that all things are impermanentSurely not lordAgain Aananda when asked by Vacchagotta the Wanderer Is there a self had I replied that there were not it would have been more bewilderment for the already bewildered VacchagottaHe would have said Formerly indeed I had a self but now I have not one any moreIn the SamuyttaNikaaya is the story of Vacchagotta the Wanderer the man who was concerned with the existence or nonexistence of his selfIn the DighaNikaaya is the story of Potthapaada an inveterate asker of questions in search of a soulIt is of interest to note the different response these two inquirers received from the BuddhaVacchagottas questions remained unanswered while Potthapaadas doctrinal questions were discussed and answered in fullBoth of these inquirers have their counterparts in the West today  those who are concerned with a self and those who are concerned with a soul While the two terms self and soul are often used as synonyms and interchangeable I think that those who use them in reference to themselves have a differential conception of the two wordsThe seeker for a self is more concerned with the preservation of his ego in the here and now whereas the wouldbe possessor of a soul is perturbed as to survival after deathIt is empiric that the protagonists of the self theory or concept are by nature extrovert and egotisticOn the other hand those who most ardently cling to the soul concept are less concerned with asserting themselves before others but are concerned mainly with their inmost nature  natural introvertsYet these too in their quiet way are also egotistical in that they desire to preserve their identityWhile the Asian Buddhist world unanimously accepts and adheres to the doctrine of anatta  the absence of an abiding and stable entity  it is by no means uncommon to find nominal Buddhists in the West who are unable to shake off years of indoctrination of the soul concept and as a consequence bring to their Buddhism preconceived views often bolstered up by a syncretic admixture of other Indian beliefsThe story of Vacchagotta precedes this articleHis questions are akin to asking a man if he has stopped beating his wifeThe man may have not have lifted his hand against her at any time but if he answers Yes the inference is that he had previously beaten herIf he answers No the inference is that he still beats herHad the Buddha agreed that Vacchagotta had a self for the Buddha did not deny the existence of phenomenon Vacchagotta could have taken it as a confirmation of the brahmin belief in an eternal atman or spark of the Divine to survive after deathHad the Buddha agreed that there was not a self in the ultimate sense Vacchagotta could have taken the reply as an endorsement of the view held by the annihilationists  that nothing survived after deathVacchagotta was not asking questions idly but this was an occasion on which confusion could have arisen and so the Buddha maintained the noble silence and left Vacchagotta to ponder further on the point that was bothering himHe still had not grasped the higher truths of karma and aniccaa under which the conventional self is but a momentary manifestation of everchanging components to be cast aside at death and without a stable entity to be carried forward to a new birthLater Vacchagotta did grasp these truths and he finally became one of the arahantsThose who are fond of quoting this dialogue between the Buddha and Vacchagotta to support their theory of a soul seldom if ever go on to the Buddhas final explanation to Aananda which closes the passage and which incidentally displays one of those flashes of the Buddhas humor that peeps out here and there in his dealings with inquirersIt would be stretching the argument beyond reason to presume that the Buddha was not capable or not inclined to make an assertion on the soul if it really existed in the light of his many expositions of its nonexistenceThe commentator Kumaralabdha quoted by DrMalalasekera in the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism puts it in a nutshellFor our purpose we can dismiss the self seekers for while they insist on having a self to satisfy their ego many of them give at least lipservice to the anattaa doctrineThey have their self that thinks writes or teaches to present to the worldThey have their self that strives to lift the self still higher in mans estimation till it equals or becomes part of the SELF and some go on to the Overself or Godhead by another nameThese people see themselves as gods in the making and their word is final  so far as they are concernedTheir concepts are usually derived via Theosophy from preBuddhistic Brahmanism even though they may call themselves Buddhists Brahman the First Cause or Great SELF was personified as Brahma the Creator the Self and all beings were or had in them a spark of the Divine a lesser self which was still essentially of the same substance as the Great SELF to which it eventually returned when purified by rites and ceremoniesOn the question of a soul Potthapaada and his friends were discussing the importance of consciousness its arising and its ceasingOne had put forward the theory thatStates of consciousness come to a man without reason and without a cause and so also do they pass awayAt the time when they spring up in him then he becomes consciousThis was rejected by a second speaker who protestedThat sirs will never be as you sayConsciousness sirs is a mans soulIt is the soul that comes and goesWhen the soul comes into a man then he becomes conscious when the soul goes away out of a man he becomes unconsciousSeeing the Buddha approaching they decided to ask his opinion on the matter and Potthapaada outlines the pith of their discussion and the various arguments that have been put forwardThe Buddha refuted the former view by stating that it was precisely through a reason by means of a cause that states of consciousness come and goBy training some states of consciousness ariseBy training others pass away Through training one sort of consciousness arises and through training another passes awayThe Buddha illustrates his meaning by a lengthy discourse on training showing the causal origination of consciousness as a consequenceHe then goes on to the cessation of consciousness dependent on the cessation of ideas as the adept in meditative practices achieves the various trance states of the jhaanasTo him neither thinking anymore nor fancying the ideas the states of consciousness he had pass away and no others coarser than they ariseSo he enters in jhaanaThus it is Potthapaada that the attainment of the cessation of conscious ideas takes place step by stepThe first proposition of the independent arising of ideas leading to consciousness having thus been disposed of by the Buddha Potthapaada admits to not having heard this explained before but I now understand what you say He then proceeds to the second opinion that had been expressed by his fellow mendicantsIs then Sir the consciousness identical with a mans soul or is consciousness one thing and the soul anotherBut what then PotthapaadaDo you really fall back on the soul queries the BuddhaPotthapaada replies that he takes for granted the existence of a soul of some kindMaybe a material soul he suggests tentatively but without much convictionFailing that what about a soul the exact copy of the body but so subtle in texture that it could only be described as being made of mind NoWell then a soul without form and made of consciousnessTo all of these suggestions the Buddha has but one replySuppose you did have a soul conforming to any of these descriptions still some ideas some states of consciousness would arise to the man and others would pass away so you can see how consciousness must be one thing and the soul would be anotherHowever Potthapaada was still not convinced that he was totally lacking in a soulOn that point he had a closed mind as is shown by his next questionHe does not ask Is there or is there not a soul but is it possible for him to ever understand what the soul isIs it possible for me to understand whether consciousness is the mans soul or is the one different from the otherThe Buddhas reply to Potthapaada is equally applicable to the soulseekers of today those who accept the Buddhas teachings with reservations  the right to reject what does not fit in with their preconceived notions beliefs and viewsHard it is for you Potthapaada holding as you do different views other things approving themselves to you setting different aims before yourself striving after a different perfection trained in a different system of doctrine to grasp this matterPotthapaada abandons his search for a definition of his soul to which he still clings and changes the subject by propounding ten questions on the imponderablesThe Buddha bears patiently with him and in answer to each question replies it is not a matter on which he had expressed an opinion for such questions were not calculated to profit were not concerned with his Dhamma nor to the attainment of NirvanaBut Potthapaada has not exhausted his propensity for asking questionsThen what is it that the Exalted One has determinedI have expounded what Dukkha is I have expounded what is its origin I have expounded what is the cessation of Dukkha I have expounded what is the method by which one may reach the cessation of DukkhaThe Buddha departed with dignity while Potthapaada was subjected to the jeers and sarcasm of his fellow mendicants for having failed to obtain the answers to his later questionsIt is worthy of note that to the doctrinal questions the Buddha gave serious and ample replies sufficient to remove any reasonable grounds for differing from the Dhamma he taught but he refused to be drawn into any discussion that could not lead to finality such matters being outside of the Dhamma taught by himThe Buddha taught his doctrine of soullessness  anattaa  in two ways and by two methods demonstrated its truth and necessity if the major purpose of his teachings was to be accomplished  the cessation of DukkhaOne was by the analysis of constituents of personality the other was that any belief in a permanent self would conflict with the causal law and so deny the possibility of escape from the wheel of becomingIn regard to the analysis of personality there are so many passages that deal with this method that lack of space prevents more than a passing mention of themThose who wish to clarify their thinking on this point will have no difficulty in finding themThe most common formula is to proceed with those who regard body as the self or the self as being in the body so with feelings with perception with activities with consciousnessSuch ones become obsessed with the idea I am the bodyThe body is mine or I feel I perceive or there are activities I am conscious Feeling is mine perception is mine activities are mine consciousness is mine But when these change and alter owing to their unstable nature then arises sorrow woe and grief due to their impermanence and instabilityIn SN prior to an analysis as above a certain one asked of the BuddhaPray Lord is there any body feeling perception activity or consciousness that is permanent stable by nature lasting unchanging like unto the eternal so that it will stand fastThen the Exalted One took up a pinch of dust on the tip of his nail and said to that brotherEven thus much material form brother is not permanent stable eternal by nature unchanging like unto the eternal so that it will stand fastIf even thus much material form brother were permanent unchanging then the living of the holy life for the utter destruction of suffering would not be set forthBut inasmuch as even thus much material form brother is not permanent stable eternal by nature unchanging therefore the living of the holy life for the utter destruction of suffering is set forthWe have on previous occasions written that no one doctrine taught by the Buddha stands in isolation from any other or all of themThe Buddhas reply to Potthapaada quoted above as to what he expounded is the key to them all and the connecting link between them  Dukkha its origin its cessation and the way to its cessation  was the Buddhas only concernAll his doctrinal dissertations climaxed in moral perfection as the way to Dukkhas ceasingThe purpose of the analysis in expounding the anatta doctrine is to understand the functioning and the impermanence of the five aggregates that constitute the phenomenal person If this be accomplished the major delusion of a self that obsesses mankind generally will be eliminatedWith the elimination of this illusory self the rootcause of our unhappiness is eliminatedThe eternal thirst to satisfy its demands the grasping after sensepleasures to please it the clinging to phenomena that must fade and die is the source of DukkhaSo the doctrine of Anattaa becomes a coordinating link with all other doctrines leading to the ethical life and sorrows ending From Metta Vol NoIt is in vain that we return to the places that once we lovedWe shall never see them again because they were situated not in Space but in Time and because the man who tries to rediscover them is no longer the child or the youth who decked them with the fervour of his emotionsThe classic philosopher assumes that our personality is built about a hard and changeless core is a sort of spiritual statue which stands like a rock against the assaults of the external worldSuch is man as viewed by Plutarch by Moliere and even by BalzacBut Proust shows us that the individual plunged in Time disintegratesThe day comes when nothing at all remains of the man who once loved who once made a revolutionMy life as I saw it  wrote Marcel Proust presented me with the spectacle of a succession of periods so occurring that but for a brief space of time nothing of that which had been ones sustaining force continued to exist at all in that which followed itI saw human life as a complex from which the support of an individual identical and permanent self was so conspicuously absent was something so useless for the future so far extended into the past that death might just as well intervene at this point or that because it could never mark a conclusion that was other than arbitrary The successive selves are so different from one another that each ought really to have a different nameAn electric light bulb has burned outThis small incandescent bulb that shone so brightly is now dark it will never shed light again it will no longer turn darkness into daylight in the nighttimeIn its useless state it will nevermore be able to shine forth its miraculous rays to enable us to read and to see the other people and objects that surround usThere it hangs in its socketIt cannot respond to our command to render service it is lifeless it is deadWhat do we doReplace the bulb with another one of courseThe used bulb that is no longer a part of life is consigned to the trash can but the living force the electricity that gave it life now courses through the new bulb that now hangs in the socketLight and life go onThe discarded light bulb has not been able to take along the life that flowed through it to its final resting placeSo it is with our lifeIt is one and indivisible although its ever changing forms are innumerable and perishableThere is in truth no death although every form must dieWe cannot permanently possess the life that flows through us any more than the electric light bulb can own the current that gave it lightLife alone is continuous ever seeking selfexpression in new formsSo it is with what we call the soulThere is no substantial categorical entity as a soul which belongs to us and only to us in death as it did in lifeA human individual is composed of psychological elements and a physical bodyIt is consciousness which unifies the individualThis relationship between consciousness and the psychophysical existence often gives rise to the egocentric belief that we possess an immortal unchanging soul the destiny of which may be eternal happiness or eternal misery according to the deeds of the personality it inhabitsUnfortunately this idea is so deeprooted in Western man so near and dear to him that he naturally experiences great difficulty in understanding any teaching contrary to this established notionBuddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a separative soul self or aatmanAccording to the teachings of the Buddha the idea of self is an imaginary false belief which has no corresponding reality and produces harmful thoughts of me and mine Buddhism insists that the soul is not a rigid unchanging entity but a living evolving organismThe soul as Buddhists understand it is an ever growing changing bundle of attributes or characteristics forming our character and personalityAll of these manifested things when analyzed are found to lack continuous form or unchanging substanceIn reality there is nothing infinite apart from finite thingsWhatever exists is in a constant state of flux through and through like the flame of the lamp and all existence is in a process which continues to constantly renew itselfOur mind and its thoughts is essentially a stream of consciousnessThought however is not simply a physiological function but a kind of energy something like electricityWe should therefore strive to translate and activate this thought energy in the world we live in the life we live in this existence where the illusion of the separative self and the unchanging permanent soul can be forever eliminated no longer causing us to cling to forms that lack reality and substanceThe bonds of selfhood are then brokenNew vistas appear before usA clearer unclouded understanding of the living forces of life is now ours from Suchness AprilSaantaraksita was born in a royal family in India in the th century CEHe was one of the greatest Buddhist philosophers of his time and a chancellor of the famous Naalanda UniversityHis main opus the TattvaSamgraha is a monumental work of philosophical criticism comprising no less than stanzasA very voluminous commentary on it written by his pupil Kamalasila is likewise a work of great philosophical and critical acumenBoth stanzas and commentary are extant in their Sanskrit original and in a Tibetan translationThe Sanskrit text of both in Devanaagari script was published in in the Gaekwards Oriental Series in two volumesIn the same series a complete English translation of stanzas and commentary by DrGanganath Jha appeared in and likewise in two volumes of together pagesThe following extracts have been taken from that translation with some necessary changes chiefly in Buddhist terminology which were made after consulting the Sanskrit originalA few more extracts had been published earlier in Buddhism and God IdeaIt is difficult to identify Saantaraksitas philosophical position with any of the contemporary schools since his work shows features of Madhyamika Vijnaanavaada as well as Sautrantika thoughtProbably Saantaraksita took an independent and eclectic position of his ownHis work and thought is still in need of careful research before it can be evaluated as it deserves itSaantaraksitas life had also an active side together with Padmasambhava he founded the first monastery in Tibet Samye and had visited Tibet once before Nyanaponika TheraCommentaryThe doctrine of Nosoul is called the Gateway to the Highest Good because it is the means of entering Nirvana it is Nirvana that is meant by the term Highest GoodThis doctrine causes fright in those who uphold wrong beliefs as for instance the soulbelief and are attached to unrealistic viewsAs it was said The foolish man is always beset with such fears as I am not I may cease to exist naught is mine nothing shall be mine but in the wise fear has ceased stanza Commentary It is indeed omniscience that follows from the removal of the hindrance by the defilements and by cognizable thingsIt is because these very defilements ie greed hate etc obstruct an understanding of the real nature of things that one speaks of the hindrance consisting in the defilementsThough things are perceived the lack of capacity to discern them in all their aspects as to whether they are to be rejected or accepted and also the incapacity to conduct oneself  this is the hindrance in regard to cognizablesOf these two the hindrance caused by defilements is removed by the direct experience of SoullessnessThe hindrance in regard to cognizables is removed by the dedicated constant and longcontinued absorption of that very doctrine of SoullessnessAll these defilements as greed hatred and the rest have their root in the wrong notion of a soulThey do not arise from external things because even when the external thing is there the said defilements will not appear without unwise attention to them and conversely even when there is no external thing the defilements will appear when there is a confrontation with unwise imaginingsThus when presence and absence of one thing do not follow the presence and absence of another the latter cannot be the cause of the former if it were so there would be incongruitiesDefilements really proceed from the unrealistic notion of a selfFor instance unless one seizes upon the notion of I one cannot have selfloveNor can love arise for objects taken as self or selfs property unless one seizes upon the notion of mine and on what is conducive to the arising of pleasure to oneselfLikewise hatred towards anything does not appear unless one seizes upon objects as being repulsive to ones self and selfs property because there cannot be hatred against what is not harmful to ones self and its property nor against what removes that harmFrom all this it is clear that it is the notion of a soul or self produced from time beginningless by a repeated habituation to ones nature which generates the grip on selfs propertyThese two produce selflove which again generates hate and other defilementsFrom this concatenation it is abundantly clear that the defilements have their root in the clinging to self and its property originating from an excessive habituation to the notion of a self or soulContrary to this idea of soul or self is the idea of nosoul or notself because the latter rests upon a mode quite the reverse of the formerIt is incompatible too that both these ideas  of Soul and Nosoul  should be identical or coexist in the same continuity because they are as contrary to each other as the notions of serpent and rope applied to the same objectThus the doctrine of Nosoul being contrary to the doctrine of Soul it becomes contrary to  incompatible with  the defilements too iegreed hatred and the restConsequently when the doctrine of Nosoul being incompatible with all defects and aberrations has been directly experienced then its contrary  ie the whole host of defilements as greed etc cannot obtain any footing just as darkness ceases in a place flooded with lightIt is in that way that the hindrance caused by defilements is eliminated by the realization of the doctrine of NosoulBut if it were impossible for the idea of Nosoul to appear in the continuity of a man whose defilements have not been destroyed then there would be no room at all for the arising of an understanding of NosoulIt is however a matter of common experience that the idea of Nosoul presents itself before all menAnd if it is meditated upon it is capable of reaching great intensity just as the thought about a young womanSubsequently it becomes as obvious as if one were to observe a directly perceived thingHow then can it be impossible for the idea of Nosoul to arise in the minds of menThe host of defilements even in their most blatant forms are unable to shake the strength of the doctrine of NoSoulBecause being due to adventitious causes the defilements are never very firmOn the other hand as to the idea of NoSoul it forms the very nature of things and is also helped by the means of cognition hence it is strong and firmIt has been argued that even for those who have cognised the doctrine of NoSoul through inference the defilements as greed etc do appear But this is not conclusive because it is the knowledge acquired by meditation which through its clarity and distinctness directly envisages soulless things in a nonconceptual way and having as its object wellascertained things it is not erroneousIt is such an understanding of NoSoul that can entirely uproot the notion of a Soul and has on that account been described as being opposed to itThis knowledge is not of the kind derived from study and reflective thought stanzas CommentaryIt is accepted that liberation consists in the absolute cessation of the series of rebirthsBut the only means of attaining this consists in the teachings of the Blessed Lord as it is only here and nowhere else that we have the doctrine of NoSoul which is the sole destroyer of defilements that are the source of rebirthAll other philosophers are wedded to the false doctrine of a SoulThus it is the word of the Blessed Lord alone which as being the means of obtaining the highest good can be the indicator of Dharma hence it is this teaching alone that should be depended upon by all who seek their own welfare Such is the purport of the whole textIt might be argued that the Yogin does abrogate it But if the Soul were to be abrogated it could be repudiated only in the words it does not exist as otherwise there would be no point in repudiating itBecause if after having accepted the concept of a Soul one were to repudiate it as the source of pain then such repudiation would be useless because the repudiation of a thing is done for the purpose of abandoning it and no abandoning would be possible of what one regards as being ones everlasting Self hence that repudiation would be uselessNor can those other philosophers repudiate the Soul as being nonexistent because having regarded it as existent if they now regard it as nonexistent this would mean a complete volteface on their partAnattaa is the last of the three characteristics or general characteristicsLike the teaching of the four Noble Truths it is the teaching peculiar to BuddhasThe most usual English rendering which will be employed here is notself though the words soulless egoless and impersonal are often used for itEtymologically anattaa consists of the negative prefix an plus attaaThere are two main Pali forms of the word namely attaa and attaNeither form seems to be used in the plural in the Tipitaka the singular form being used with a plural verb subjectThere is also a rare subsidiary form namely atumo and tumoAs principal Tipitaka uses of the very commonly employed attaa and atta the following five types of examples may be citedThe first two senses of attaa distinguished above may be assumed to have been ordinary usage and no subject of disagreement between the Buddha and his opponentsThe last two are of minor import and need not concern us beyond noting themThe characteristic of Notself deals with the third the unidentifiable entity that is conceived and sought and made the subject of a certain class of views namely selfviewsMany suttas classify the conflicting notions of the nature of self held by opponents of the BuddhaIt could be and apparently was for instance claimed that it had materiality or was immaterial or both or neither was percipient of oneness or of plurality or of the limited or of the measureless was eternal or uneternal or both or neither had only pleasure or only pain or both or neither each of these theories being maintained by its propounder as the only truth and all else wrongOr else it could be described as having materiality either limited or infinite or as immaterial and either limited or infiniteAnd then whichever of these four is adopted it may be seen as such now or due to be such or in this way Though it is not yet real still I shall contrive for its realityAll these rationalized views stem from uncritical acceptance or overlooking of an underlying tendency or fetter  a natural predisposition  to regard to identify some aspect or other in the situation of perceiving a percept as this is mine or this is what I am or this is my selfThese two levels  the selfview and the Isense  are respectively what are called the  fetter of views and the  fetter of conceitThe first is abandoned with the attainment of the first stage of realization while the second is abandoned only with the fourth and final stageIt may be noted here in parenthesis that the rendering of maana by pride though not wrong severs the semantic relationship with mannati and mannanaa which it is most important to preserve intact for the understanding of this situationThe overlooked fundamental conceit I am  a mirage that in the act of perceiving is conceived will fulfil its counterpart the intuitive sense of lack which is craving  in the basic ontological structure of ordinary perception provokes the ordinary man with no knowledge of the Buddhas teaching to indulge in uncritical speculation about what this may be that I am and consequently to build up selftheoriesHe perceives but the very act of his perceiving is tendentious so that he simultaneously conceives his percepts with an ItendencyBut a streamenterer who has attained the first stage of realization has direct acquaintance where the ordinary man has perception owing to which fact the former has the possibility of hastening his attainment of arahatship and an arahant has no more conceivings at allSo long as a man leaves intact this fundamental tendency to conceive in the very act of perceiving accompanied by the tendency to formulate views he will look for answers to the questions that these two tendencies together prompt him to ask and he will invent them and try to prove themThis is how he gives unreasoned attention Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is doubtful in himself about the presently arisen extent thus Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhence will this creature have comeWhither will it be boundWhen he gives unreasoned attention in this way one of the six kinds of view arises in him the view A self exists for me arises as true and established or the view No self exists for me or the view I perceive self with self or the view I perceive notself with self or the view I perceive self with notself arises in him as true and established or else he has some such view as It is this my self that speaks and feels and that experiences here and there the ripening of good and bad actions but this my self is permanent ever lasting eternal not subject to change and it will endure as long as eternity This field of views is called the thicket of views the wilderness of views the vacillation of views the fetter of viewsNo untaught ordinary man bound by the fetter of views is freed from birth aging and death from sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair he is not freed from suffering I say Mvoli In assuming that I was etccannot be analyzed all these philosophical systems attempt to settle with unilateral certainty the dialectic questions what was I and the rest and to dispose of them on an inadequate ontological basis of selfidentity without querying how the questions come to be put in the first place or what is the structural nature of beingBut any one answer I am this cannot as it happens be decisively established over its contrary opposite though it can be fortified by arguments more or less logical or emotional introducing my self and defining relations between it and what it is considered not to be endowing it then with certain qualities and values and with either eternal or temporary permanence according to bentThe impossibility of establishing absolutely any one of these views as the only truth may lead to abuse and even to violence in the end since it is often thought important to be rightThe prerational conceit I am is a fetter but not a viewTo perceive is to recognize and identifyIn perceiving a percept the untaught ordinary man automatically conceives in the positional terms of I which then must seem involved in an Irelationship to the percept either as identical with it or as contained in it or as separate from it or owning it as mine That relationship so conceived is relished through want of full knowledge of the situationThe rational selfview is both a fetter and a view Though the conceit I am is normally associated with the tendency to formulate views these views need not by any means be definitely formulated but whenever they are none can be specifically described without reference to the five categories affected by clingingFor that reason they can all be reduced to one of the types of what is called the embodiment view plus kaaya  true body which is set up schematically as follows The untaught ordinary man who disregards the ariyas sees materiality as self or self as possessed of materiality or materiality in self or self in materialityAnd likewise with feeling perception formations and consciousnessThese four selfidentifications embracing the five categories make twenty typesFor each of the four basic modes of identifying the Patisambhidaamagga gives a simile as followsHow does he see as self Just as if a man saw a lighted lamps flame and color as identical thus What the flame is that the color is what the color is that the flame is How does he see self as possessed of Just as if there were a tree possessed of shade such that a man might say This is the tree this is the shade the tree is one the shade another but this tree is possessed of this shade in virtue of this shade How does he see in self Just as if there were a scented flower such that a man might say This is the flower this is the scent the flower is one the scent another but the scent is in this flower How does he see self in Just as if a gem were placed in a casket such that a man might say This is the gem this is the casket the gem is one the casket another but this gem is in this casket  PsDitthikathaavoli Self so viewed is then taken either as eternal thus This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting or as temporarily permanent but eventually annihilated for instance thus As soon as this self is annihilated that is peaceAll possible views of whatever shade are again classified under sixtytwo types in the first Sutta of the DiighaNikaaya called Brahmajaala Sutta or the Divine Net In this net all possible views are caught and so it can be seen how they come to beNow all these views  and all these standpoints for views  are formed because it is impossible that anyone shall experience apart from contact and with contact as condition feeling with feeling as condition craving with craving as condition clinging with clinging as condition being with being as condition birth with birth as condition aging and death come to be and also sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair that is how there is an origin to this whole aggregatemass of sufferingThe structure of the conceit I am and the views to which it gives rise is in fact nothing else than the structure of being the structure of what is impermanent formed and dependently originated A Tathaagata understands that thus  are formed and gross but there is cessation of formations there is that By knowing and seeing the escape from them a Tathaagata transcends them The Buddha explains how he uses the word attaa in the second sense namely the person or individual noted aboveThere are these three kinds of acquisition of self gross constituted of mind and immaterial The first has materiality and consists of the four great entities and consumes physical food the second is constituted by mind with all the limbs and lacking no faculty the third consists of perception I teach the Doctrine for the abandoning of acquisitions of self in order that in you who put the teaching into practice defiling ideas may be abandoned and cleansing ideas increase and that you by realization yourselves here and now with direct knowledge enter upon and abide in the fullness of understandings perfection If it is thought that to do that is an unpleasant abiding that is not so on the contrary by doing that there is gladness happiness tranquillity mindfulness full awareness and a pleasant abiding These are worldly usages worldly language worldly terms of communication worldly descriptions by which a Tathaagata communicates without misapprehending them Dvoli  abbrIt is only after this sketch of views that we can treat of the doctrine of notself The first discourse given by the Buddha after his Enlightenment set out the Four Noble TruthsThe second stated the characteristic of Notself as follows Bhikkhus materiality is not selfWere materiality self then this materiality would not lead to affliction and one could have it of materiality Let my materiality be thus let my materiality be not thus And it is because materiality is not self that materiality leads to affliction and one cannot have it of materiality Let my materiality be thus let my materiality be not thus The Buddha then continuedHow do you conceive this bhikkhus is materiality permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  Is what is impermanent pleasure or pain  Pain Lord  Is what is impermanent painful and subject to change fit to be seen thus This is mine this is what I am this is my self  No Lord Consequently bhikkhus any kind of materiality whatever whether past future or presently arisen in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near is all This is not mine this is not what I am this is not my self That is how it should be seen with right understanding as it actually is SXXII voliii The characteristic is stated more succinctly in this way The eye is impermanent what is impermanent is suffering what is suffering is not self or All is notselfAnd what is the all that is not selfThe eye is not self or again All things are notselfThe canonical commentary the Patisambhidaamagga adds Materiality is notself in the sense that it has no core Aacariya Buddhagohosas definitions are as follows The characteristics of impermanence and suffering are known whether Buddhas arise or not but that of notself is not known unless there is a Buddha for the knowledge of it is the province of none but a BuddhaThe Blessed One in some instances shows notselfness through impermanence in some through suffering and in some through bothWhy is thatWhile impermanence and suffering are both evident notself is unevident for the characteristic of notself seems unevident obscure arcane impenetrable hard to illustrate and hard to describeHe distinguishes the notself and the characteristic of notself Those same five categories are notself because of the words What is suffering is not self WhyBecause there is no exercising mastery over themThe mode of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery is the characteristic of notselfAgain  is notself in the sense of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery over itOr alternatively because there is no exercising of mastery over it in the following three instances namely Let it when arisen not reach presence or Let it when already reached presence not age or Let it when already reached aging not dissolve it is void of that mode of exercise of mastery therefore it is notself for four reasons because it is void because it has no owner because it cannot be done with as one wants and because it denies selfThe VibhaaviniTiikaa says Notself is the absence of self as conjectured by other teachers that notself as a characteristic is the characteristic of notselfWhat is conditioned by notself cannot be called selfMateriality is not selfThe cause and condition for the arising of materiality are not self so how could materiality which is brought to being by what is not self be self SXXII voliii cfXXXV iv voliv Nor can what is possessed of rise and fallIf anyone says that the eye is self that is not tenableThe eyes rise and fall is evident from which it follows that self would rise and fallThat is why should anyone say that the eye is self that is not tenable Mvoliii Craving however provides an emotional attachment to the survival of the personalityHere someones view is this This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change I shall endure as long as eternity He hears a Tathaagata or a Tathaagatas disciple teaching the True Idea for the elimination of all standpoints for views all decisions insistencies and underlying tendencies for the stilling of all formations for the relinquishment of all essentials for the exhaustion of craving for fading out cessation extinctionHe thinks thus So I shall be annihilatedSo I shall be lostSo I shall be no more Then he sorrows and laments beating his breast he weeps and becomes distraughtThat is how there is anguish about what is nonexistent in oneself  Mvoli Some shrink back in that way from the truth but some go too far the other waySome who are humiliated ashamed and disgusted with being relish nonbeing thus As soon as this self is annihilated on the dissolution of the body after death that is peace that is the supreme goal that is reality  Iti II ii pBut One who has eyes sees how what is has come to be and by so doing he practices the way to dispassion for itBhikkhus the possession that one might possess that were permanent everlasting do you see any such possession  No Lord  The selftheory clinging whereby one might cling that would never arouse sorrow and despair in him who might cling thereby do you see any such selftheory clinging  No Lord  The view as support that one might take as support that would never arouse sorrow and despair in him who might take it as support do you see any such view as support  No Lord  Bhikkhus there being self there would be selfs property  Yes Lord  Or there being selfs property there would be self  Yes Lord  Bhikkhus self and selfs property being unapprehendable as true and established then would not this view This is self this the world after death I shall be permanent endure as long as eternity be the pure perfection of a fools idea  How not LordIt would be the pure perfection of a fools idea Mvoli The Wanderer Vacchagotta during one of his numerous visits to the Buddha askedHow is it Master Gotama does self exist When this was said the Blessed One was silentHow then does self not exist A second time the Blessed One was silentThen the wanderer Vacchagotta got up from his seat and went awaySoon after he had gone the venerable Aananda asked Lord why did the Blessed One not answer the wanderer Vacchagottas questionAananda if when asked Does self exist I had answered Self exists that would have been the belief of those who hold the theory of eternalness and if when asked Does self not exist I had answered Self does not exist that would have been the belief of those who hold the theory of annihilationAgain if when asked Does self exist I had answered Self exists would that have been in conformity with my knowledge that All things are notselfNo LordAnd if on being asked Does self not exist I had answered Self does not exist then Vacchagotta who is already confused would have become still more confused My self certainly existed but it does not exist now  SXLV voliv Self is conceivable only on the basis of clinging to the five categoriesBut so conceived it must always founder owing to the radical impermanence of their existenceAnd no other basis for it is possible since no other can be found which does not fall within themWhy this characteristic is hard to see is explained in the commentaries as followsThe characteristic of notself does not become apparent because when resolution into the various elements is not given attention it is concealed by compactnessHowever when the resolution of the compact is effected by resolving it into its elements the characteristic of notself becomes apparent in its true nature VisChXXIpThe Paramatthamanjuusaa further explains as followsResolution of the compact is effected by resolving in this way The earth element is one the water element is another and so on distinguishing each one and in this way Contact is one feeling is another and so on distinguishing each one When the resolution of the compact is effected means that what is compact as a mass or as a function or as a supporting object has been analysedFor when material and nonmaterial dhammas have arisen mutually steadying each other then owing to misinterpreting that as a unity compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressureAnd likewise compactness of function is assumed when although definite differences exist in such and such dhammas functions they are taken as oneAnd likewise compactness of supportingobject is assumed when although differences exist in the ways in which dhammas that take supportingobjects make them so those supportingobjects are taken as oneBut when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the handThey are mere dhammas occurring dependent on conditions and voidThat is how the characteristic of notself becomes more evidentThe Visuddhimagga repeatedly emphasizes that no doer is discoverable but only doing ChXVIp XIXp that there is no experiencer of the fruit of action and that there is no one who feelsThe simile of the blind man able to walk who mounts on his shoulder the cripple who can see so that together they can travel as they like is used to illustrate the radical contingency of dhammas and contingency also forms the subject of a verse quoted from the MahaaNiddesaVoid world void world is said LordIn what way is void world said  It is because of what is void of self or selfs property that void world is said AanandaAnd what is void of self or selfs propertyThe eye forms eyeconsciousness eyecontact any feeling whether pleasant or unpleasant or neitherunpleasantnorpleasant that arises born of eyecontact is void of self or selfs property SXXXV voliv Voidness as voidness in formations  for instance the more general as void of the more particular  is exemplified in one Sutta and voidness of self in anotherVoidness is variously classified in the Patisambhidaamagga SunnakathaaThe void minddeliverance is that connected with attasunnataaOne discourse shows how the tendency to perceive in terms of I underlies theories of selfWhatever samanas or brahmanas see self in its various types all of them see the five categories affected by clinging on one or other of themWhat fiveHere an untaught ordinary man who disregards the ariyas is unconversant with their teaching and undisciplined in it sees materiality as self or self as possessed of materiality or materiality in self or self in materiality he sees feeling perception formations consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or self in consciousness or consciousness in selfSo he has this way of seeing and also this attitude I am When there is the attitude I am then there is the organization of the five faculties of eye ear nose tongue and bodyThere is mind and there are ideas and there is the element of ignoranceWhen an untaught ordinary man is touched by whatever is felt born of the contact of ignorance it occurs to him I am and I am this and I shall be and I shall not be and I shall be formed and I shall be formless and I shall be percipient and I shall be nonpercipient and I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient Now in the case of the welltaught disciple of the ariyas while the five faculties persist in the same way nevertheless ignorance is abandoned and knowledge arisen in himWith the fading out of ignorance and the arising of knowledge it no more occurs to him I am and I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient  SXXII voliii I am is derivative not underivativeDerivative upon whatDerivative upon materiality SXXII voliii It is this conceit that takes on the appearance of prideWhen any samana or braahmana with materiality as the means which is impermanent painful and subject to change sees thus I am superior or I am equal or I am inferior what is that if not blindness to what actually is SXXII voliii Again when the Elder Khemaka was questioned by other elders he saidI do not see in these five categories affected by clinging any self or selfs property Yet I am not an arahant with taints exhaustedOn the contrary I still have the attitudes I am with respect to these five categories affected by clinging although I do not say I am this I do not say I am materiality or I am feeling or I am perception or I am formations or I am consciousness nor do I say I am apart from consciousness yet I still have the attitude I am with respect to the five categories affected by clinging although I do not say I am thisAlthough a disciple of the ariyas may have abandoned the five immediate fetters still his conceit I am desire I am underlying tendency I am with respect to the five categories affected by clinging remains unabolishedLater he abides contemplating rise and fall thus Such is materiality such its origin such its disappearance and by so doing his conceit I am eventually comes to be abolished SXXII voliii  abbrOn a certain occasion it had been stated by the Buddha how when a man knows and sees the five categories whatever their mode thus this is not mine this is not what I am this is not by self there come to be no more underlying tendencies to treat this body with its consciousness and all external signs in terms of I and MineThen in a certain bhikkhus mind this thought arose So it seems materiality is not self nor are feeling perception formations and consciousnessThen what self will the action done by the notself touchHe was rebuked for ignoring the Buddhas teaching of dependencyAgain when the Buddha was asked by the naked ascetic Kassapa whether suffering was of ones own making or of anothers or both or neither the Buddha replied Do not put it like that When asked whether there was no suffering or whether the Buddha neither knew nor saw it the Buddha replied that there was and that he both knew and saw itHe then said Kassapa if one asserts that He who makes feels being one existent from the beginning his suffering is of his own making then one arrives at eternalismBut if one asserts that one makes another feels being one existent crushed out by feeling his suffering is of anothers making then one arrives at annihilationismInstead of resorting to either extreme a Tathaagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle way Now what is called an acquisition of self  in other words the person or individuality  may be physical or mental or immaterial according to the plane of being in which rebirth has taken placeAlso from birth to birth any one kind can succeed and so must exclude any otherThat being so it cannot be successfully argued that only one of the three kinds is true and the others wrong one can only say that the term for each one does not apply to the other twoJust as with milk from a cow curd from milk butter from curd ghee from butter and fineextract of ghee from ghee the term for each applies only to that and not to any of the othersThat is how there are these worldly usages by which a Tathaagata communicates without misapprehending Individual selfhood is what the physical body is called or it is simply the pentad of categories since it is actually only a descriptive device derived upon the pentad of categoriesHere when the categories are not fully known there is naming of them and of the consciousness as self that is the physical body or alternatively the five categories presence as a mere description in the case of what is called a being though in the ultimate sense the being is nonexistent A Tathaagata is indescribable in terms of being or of consciousnessBhikkhus when a bhikkhus mind is liberated the gods when they seek him do not find the consciousness of one who is thusgone with anything as its supportWhy is thatOne thusgone is here and now no longer knowable I saySo saying so proclaiming I have been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly misrepresented by some samanas and brahmanas thus The samana Gotama is one who leads away he describes an existent creatures annihilation loss nonbeing As I am not as I do not proclaim so I have been wrongly misrepresented Mvoli cfvoli For these and other reasons the Buddha refused to answer the ten undecided matters ending with the four logical questions whether after death a Tathaagata is is not both is and is not neither is nor is notThese ten and some others as well not answered all contain some concealed assumption in fact which either of the answers yes or no would alike confirmSelf in any form particular or absolute one or many cannot be conceived apart from identification without which no meaningful statement can be made about it and any identification is always wrongThere are three principal types of argument used by the Buddha with which he exposes selftheories by means of the very basis on which they are builtThese are affliction impermanence and nonexistence If self is identified with any of the five categories indiscriminately or with say the eye then since one cannot have any of these as one wishes in this way Let it be thus let it be not thus one suffers affliction by it and so cannot claim to have mastery over it consequently it cannot rightly be called selfIf it is claimed that self is consciousness then it can be shown that because consciousness always arises dependent on impermanent conditions it too is impermanentAgain if self is identified with feeling it can be asked With pleasant or unpleasant or neutral feelingWhichever is admitted then since the three kinds of feeling come and go self must come and go tooConsequently such a self is likewise untenableIf on the other hand it is claimed that self is not feeling and has nothing to do with it then it can be asked whether where there is no feeling at all one can say I am and no affirmative answer can be givenAgain if it is claimed that self while not feeling is not without experience of feeling since it feels and is inseparable from the idea of feeling then it can be asked whether if feeling altogether ceased one could say I am this and no affirmative answer can be givenThis last argument among others precludes predicating attaa of nibbaana which is called cessation of perception and feelingThe characteristic of notself unlike those of impermanence and suffering does not have its opposite applied to extinction attaa cannot be and never is applied to nibbaanaWhen asked how he taught his followers the Buddha repliedI discipline my hearers thus Bhikkhus materiality is impermanent and so are feeling perception formations and consciousness materiality is notself and so are feeling perception formations and consciousnessAll formations are impermanent all things are notself  Mvoli The contemplation is described as followsWhat is perception of notselfHere a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to a room that is void considers thus Eye is not self forms are not self ear sounds nose odors tongue flavours body tangibles mind ideas are not selfThat is how he abides contemplating notself in these six inoneselfandexternal bases Avolv Whatever is conditioned should be judged according to its actual nature of impermanence and contingency no matter whether even a pleasant abiding or a quiet abidingWhatever is there to be included as materiality or feeling or perception or formations or consciousness such things he sees as impermanent as suffering as ailment as a cancer as a dart as a calamity as an affliction as alien as disintegrating as void as not selfAnd again Whatever is not yours abandon itWhen you have abandoned it that will be long for your welfare and happinessWhat is not yoursMateriality is not yoursWhen a bhikkhu abides much with his mind fortified by perception of notself in suffering his mind is rid of conceits that treat in terms of I and mine this body with its consciousness and all external signsAnd when a bhikkhu sees six rewards it should be enough for him to establish perception of notself unlimitedly in all formationsWhat sixI shall be aloof from the world of all I shall be no more impeded by treating in terms of I and likewise of mine I shall come to possess knowledge not shared and I shall see clearly causation and also causally arisen thingsWhen a man knows and sees the eye as not self his fetters come to be abolished and Perception of notself reaches the abolition of the conceit I am which is extinction here and nowLastly It is impossible that anyone with right view should see any thing as selfThe perception of notself is the third of the Eighteen Principal Insights of which the Visuddhi magga says One who maintains in being the contemplation of notself abandons perception of self and contemplation of notself and contemplation of voidness are one in meaning and only the letter is different since one who maintains in being the contemplation of notself abandons misinterpreting On the development of the contemplation of notself based on rise and fall given in the Visuddhimagga see article AniccaThe Patisambhidaamagga connects this contemplation specially with the faculty of understanding and it is there called the third Gateway to Liberation When one gives attention to notself the understanding faculty is

neither coming nor going nor staying nor passingaway and not arisingUnsupported unmoving devoid of object  that indeed is the end of dukkhaAnd this dhamma is profound hard to see hard to awaken to peaceful excellent beyond logic subtle and to be experienced by the wise Translated from the Royal Chanting Book compiled by HH the th Sangharaja of Siam Sa Pussadevo and printed at Mahamakut Press BangkokUpon the Full Moon of the month of Visakha now more than two thousand five hundred years ago the religious wanderer known as Gotama formerly Prince Siddhattha and heir to the throne of the Sakiyan peoples by his full insight into the Truth called Dhamma which is this mind and body became the One Perfectly Enlightened by himselfHis Enlightenment or Awakening called Sambodhi abolished in himself unknowing and craving destroyed greed aversion and delusion in his heart so that vision arose superknowledge arose wisdom arose discovery arose light arose  a total penetration into the mind and body its origin its cessation and the way to its cessation which was at the same time complete understanding of the world its origin its cessation and the way to its cessationHe penetrated to the Truth underlying all existenceIn meditative concentration throughout one night but after years of striving from being a seeker He became the OnewhoKnows the OnewhoSeesWhen He came to explain His great discovery to others He did so in various ways suited to the understanding of those who listened and suited to help relieve the problems with which they were burdenedHe knew with his Great Wisdom exactly what these were even if his listeners were not aware of them and out of His Great Compassion taught Dhamma for those who wished to lay down their burdensThe burdens which men indeed all beings carry round with them are no different now from the BuddhatimeFor then as now men were burdened with unknowing and cravingThey did not know of the Four Noble Truths nor of Dependent Arising and they craved for fire and poison and were then as now consumed by fearsLord Buddha One attained to the Secure has saidThe notunderstanding of Dependent Arising is the root of all sorrows experienced by all beingsIt is also the most important of the formulations of Lord Buddhas EnlightenmentFor a Buddhist it is therefore most necessary to see into the heart of this for oneselfThis is done not be reading about it nor by becoming expert in scriptures nor by speculations upon ones own and others concepts but by seeing Dependent Arising in ones own life and by coming to grips with it through calm and insight in ones own mind and bodyLet us now see how this Teaching is concerned with our own livesThe search of every living being is to find happiness in whatever state human or nonhuman they find themselvesBut what it is really important to know is this the factors which give rise to unhappiness so that they can be avoided and the factors from which arise happiness so that they can be cultivatedThis is just another way of stating the Four Noble TruthsIn the first half of this statement there is unhappiness or what is never satisfactory called in Pali language DukkhaThis Dukkha is the first Noble Truth which we experience all the time usually without noticing it which does not make the dukkha any lessFirst there is occasional dukkha birth old age disease and death for these events usually do not compose the whole of lifeThen we have frequent dukkha being united with what one dislikes being separated from what one likes not getting what one wants and this is everyday experienceFinally as a summary of all kinds of dukkha there is continuous dukkha the five graspedat groups that is to say body feeling perceptions volitions and consciousness the components of a human beingExplanation of these in full would take too long here but all the readers are provided with these kinds of dukkha in themselvesThey should look to see whether these facts of existence are delightful or notThis Dhamma should be thoroughly known in ones own person and life that is where the first Noble Truth may be discoveredThen the factors which give rise to unhappiness were mentionedHere again ones person and life should be investigatedNow when living creature are killed intentionally by me when I take what is not given when I indulge in wrong conduct in sexual relations when I speak false words and when I take intoxicating drinks and drugs producing carelessness  now are these things factors for happiness or unhappinessWhen I covet the belongings of others when I allow illwill to dwell in my heart and when I have as the tenants of my heart ignorance delusion and views which lead astray  is this for my welfare or destructionThere are many ways of describing these factors which make for unhappiness but all of them derive from unknowing and craving which are just two sides of the same thingThis is the Second Noble Truth of the Arising of DukkhaWhen craving is at work when unknowing clouds ones understanding then one is sure to experience dukkhaLord Buddha instructs us for our own benefit and for the happiness of others that this craving should be relinquishedNow happiness in the second half of the statement above can be of many kindsTwo kinds dependent upon conditions can be seen illustrated by the world while one kind unsupported by conditions should be realized in ones own heartWe are all looking for happiness so let us see what is needed for itFirst there is materially produced happinessThis is born of possessions and jugglery with conditions of life out there Called amisasukha in Pali this happiness is most uncertain for all the factors supporting it are subject to instability and changeMoreover they are out in the world and not in ones own heart so that they call for expert jugglery to save one from dukkhaAnd failure and disappointment cannot be avoided if one goes after this sort of happinessSo this sort of happiness is shortlived and precariousA great improvement on this is the happiness which comes from practicing Dhamma called nonmaterial happiness or niramisasukhaThis kind of happiness is made sure whenever a person performs wholesome kamma such as doing the following ten things giving moral conduct minddevelopment reverence helpfulness dedicating meritorious acts to others rejoicing in the meritorious acts of others hearkening to Dhamma teaching Dhamma and setting upright ones viewsPeople who practice this Dhamma purifying their hearts in this way are sure to reap happinessBut this happiness though more lasting than the first is not to be relied upon foreverAs a fruit of it one may dwell among the gods for aeons or be born as a very fortunate man but even the gods have to pass away let alone manAnd the fruits of kamma good or evil are impermanent so it cannot be relied upon to produce a permanent happinessThis can only be found by removing entirely the cause for dukkha when craving is uprooted no growth of dukkha can take placeOn the contrary with purity compassion and wisdom one has reached the Supreme Happiness of Nibbana which is stable indestructible and never subject to changing conditionsThis is the Third Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha by the removal of its causeA good deal of hard work is needed to get to this which should be realized and that work must be done along the right lines hence the Fourth Noble TruthThis is called the Truth of the Path which should be cultivated It comprises elements of wisdom Right View and Right Attitude elements of moral conduct Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood and elements of meditation Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right CollectednessThese will not be explained in detail hereIt is certain that any one who practices Moral Conduct Collectedness and Wisdom in his life has the conditions which sustain happinessFrom his practice he may have Dhammahappiness or the Supreme Happiness according to the degree he practices for the latter requires welldeveloped meditation both in calm and in insightThese Four Noble Truths  Dukkha Cause Cessation and Path  are the heart of the Dhamma and they are in the heart of every man who cares to see themFrom their seeing and understanding comes happiness but by trying to escape them only more misery is bornThese Truths are illustrated by the formula of Dependent Arising which is found elaborated in various waysThe simplest form isBut Dependent Arising can be given in much more detailed ways than thisThe important principle to understand is that whatever is experienced by us all that arises due to many conditionsAn aspect which grows in size from birth throughout youth which develops certain characteristics in maturity and as old age creeps on becomes infirm in various ways and finally diesThe processes which govern this growth and decline are of great complexity and interdependenceThe body to keep going at all needs clothes food shelter and medicines at leastBut once the internal chemistry starts the process leading to old age and death none of the exterior supporting conditions can do more than retard the process for a little whileThe body as a whole does not arise from nocause nor is it derived from one causeIf examined nothing which we experience arises from only one or no cause at all on the contrary our experiences all arises dependentlySight is actually dependent on the eye as base the object to be seen and the operation of eyeconsciousnessSimilarly there is ear sound earconsciousness nose smell noseconsciousness tongue taste tongueconsciousness body touch bodyconsciousness and mind thoughts mindconsciousnessAll of our experience falls within these eighteen elements and there is nothing which we know outside themIt is also important to understand that much of what one experiences arising dependently is the fruit of ones own actionsThe happiness one feels and the dukkha one feels although sometimes brought about by events in the physical world is very often brought about by ones own past intentional actions or kammaAnd in the present time with each deliberate action one performs more kammas which will come to fruit as experience in the futureSo if one wants to experience the fruits of happiness the seeds of happiness must be planted nowThey may fruit immediately in this life or in a future existenceWe make ourselves we are the creators of ourselves no one else has a hand in this creationAnd the Lord of Creation is no other than Ignorance or UnknowingHe is the Creator of this Wheel of Samsara of continued and infinitely varied forms of dukkhaAnd this Lord resides in the hearts of all men who are called ordinarymen We shall return to this in more detail laterDependent Arising is explained many times and in many different connections in the Discourses of Lord Buddha but He has not compared it to a wheelThis simile is found in the Visuddhimagga and in the other commentarial literatureAlthough Theravada tradition has many references to this simile it does not seem to have been depicted at allBut in Northern India and especially in Kashmir the Sarvastivada school was strongly established and besides producing a vast literature upon Discipline and the Further Dhamma they produced also a way of depicting a great many important Buddhist teachings by this picture of the Wheel which is the subject of the present essayIn Pali it is the bhavacakka or Samsaracakka which is variously rendered in English as the Wheel of Life the Wheel of Becoming or the Wheel of RebirthIn their collections of stories about Lord Buddha and his disciples there is one which opens with the story of this wheelReaders will observe that the story refers to Lord Buddhas lifetime and says that He has authorized the painting of this picture as well as laying down its contentsIt is certain that in the Buddhatime painting was well known while the other facts given in this short introductory story are quite in accord with the spirit of the Pali DiscoursesEven the collection of stories in which this account is contained was compiled according to some scholars before the Christian eraSo if one does not believe that this painting was ordained by Lord Buddha still it has an age of two thousand years a venerable tradition indeedOf all teachingaids this expression of Buddhist skillfulmeans must surely be the oldestNow let us turn to the storyLord Buddha was staying at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels FeedingplaceNow it was the practice of Venerable Mahamoggallana to frequent the hells for a certain time then the animalkingdom also to visit the ghosts the gods and menHaving seen all the sufferings to be found in the hells which beings there experience as they arise and pass away such as maiming dismembering and so forth having witnessed how animals kill and devour others how ghosts are tormented by hunger and thirst how the gods lose fall are spoiled and come to their ruin and how men crave and come to naught but thwarted desires  having seen all this he returned to Jambudipa and reported this to the four assembliesWhatever had a fellowbhikkhu or a bhikkhupupil leading the holy life with dissatisfaction he would take him to Venerable Mahamoggallana The Venerable Mahamoggallana will exhort and teach him wellAnd the Venerable Mahamoggallana would exhort and teach him wellSuch would again lead the holy life with keen interest even distinguishing themselves with the higher attainments since they had been taught and exhorted so well by the Venerable MahamoggallanaAt that time the Venerable Mahamoggallana was surrounded by the four assemblies consisting of bhikkhus bhikkhunis pious laymen and womenNow the illustrious Enlightened Ones who Know ask questionsThus Lord Buddha asked the Venerable AnandaVenerable Ananda then related Venerable Mahamoggallanas experiences and said that he instructed discontented bhikkhus with success The Elder Moggallana or a bhikkhu like him cannot be at many placesTherefore in the gateways a wheel having five sections should be madeThus the Lord laid down that a wheel with five sections should be made But the bhikkhus do not know what sort of wheel should be madeThe Lord explained The five bourns should be represented  the hellish bourn that of the animal kingdom of ghosts of men and the bourn of the godsIn the lower portion the hells are to be shown together with the animalkingdom and the realm of the ghosts while in the upper portion gods and men should be representedThe four continents should also be depicted namely Pubbavideha Aparagoyana Uttarakuru and JambudipaIn the middle greed aversion and delusion must be shown a dove symbolizing greed a snake symbolizing aversion and a hog delusionFurthermore the Buddhas are to be painted halos pointing out NibbanaOrdinary beings should be shown as by the contrivance of a waterwheel they sink and rise up againThe space around the rim should be filled with the twelve links of Dependent Arising in the forward and reversed ordermust show clearly that everything all the time is swallowed by impermanence and the following two verses should be added as an inscriptionThus at the instance of the bhikkhus it was laid down by the Lord that the Wheel of Wanderingon with five sections should be made in the gatewaysNow brahmans and householders would come and ask Reverend Sir what is this painting aboutBhikkhus would reply We also do not knowThereupon the Lord advised A bhikkhu should be appointed visitors in the gateway and to show themBhikkhus were appointed without due consideration foolish erring confused persons without meritThey themselves do not know so how will they explain to visiting brahmans and householdersThe Lord said A competent bhikkhu should be appointed Tibetan legend says that Lord Buddha outlined the Wheel with grains of rice while walking with bhikkhus in a rice fieldHowever this may be in India at least in all the Sarvastivada monasteries this painting will have adorned the gateways arousing deep emotions in the hearts of those who knew its meaning and curiosity in othersIt is a measure of how great was the destruction of the Buddhist religion in India that not a single example survives anywhere since no gateways to temples are known to have survivedA solitary painting in Ajanta cave number seventeen may perhaps be some form of this wheelIn the translation above the pictures for representing the twelve links of Dependent Arising were not given and it is said that these were supplied from the scriptures by Nagarjuna a great Buddhist TeacherFrom India the pattern of this wheel was taken to Samye the first Tibetan monastery by Bande Yeshe and there it was the Sarvastivada lineage of ordination which was establishedThe tradition of painting this wheel thus passed to Tibet where due to climatic conditions it was painted in the vestibule of the temple there to strike the eyes of all who enteredTibetan tradition speaks of two kinds of Wheel the oldstyle and the newstyleThe oldstyle is based upon the text translated above while the newstyle introduces new featuresThe great reformer Je Tsongkhapa founder of the Gelugpa gave authority for the division of the Wheel into six instead of five and for drawing the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara in the guise of a Buddha in each of the five nonhuman realmsBoth these features may be seen upon the drawing of the Tibetanstyle WheelThe sixth realm is that of the titans who war against the gods of the sensualsphere heavensThese troublesome and demonic characters are included in a separate part of the world of the gods in my drawingThe introduction of a Buddhafigure into each realm illustrates the universal quality of a Buddhas great compassion for Avalokitesvara it the embodiment of enlightened compassionThe writer has preferred to retain the oldstyle representation according to the text as it agrees perfectly with Theravada teachingsThe terrors and violence of samsara which are with us all the time may be seen plainly in the ravishment of Tibet by the Chinese invadersTibetan artists have kept this tradition alive to the present day and still paint under difficulties as refugees in IndiaBut this ancient way of presenting Dhamma deserves to be more widely known and appreciatedBuddhist shrines could well be equipped with representations of it in the present day to remind devotees of the nature of this whirling wheel of birth and deathWe now turn to the pictures of the Bhavacakka accompanying this bookOne is from a Tibetan original after WaddellThe second is a modern version executed by the author in which the scenes and figures have been given a contemporary coloringThe hub of this painting is the central point for us who live in the realm of samsara so it is the best point to start a description of the symbolismIn this center circle a cock a snake and a hog wheel around each having in its mouth the tail of the animal in frontThese three representing Greed Aversion and Delusion which are the three roots of all evil are depicted in the center because they are the root causes for experience in the wandering onWhen they are present in our hearts then we live afflicted in the transitory world of birth and death but when they are not there having been destroyed by wisdom or pañña developed in Dhammapractice then we find rest the unshakable peace of NibbanaIt is notable that Tibetan paintings show these creatures against a blue ground showing that even these afflictions of mind although powerful have no real substance and are void as are all the other elements of our experienceThe cock of fiery yellowred represents greedThis greed includes every desire for all kinds of I wish I want I must have I will have and extends from the violent passion for gross physical form through attachments to views and ideas all the way to the subtle clinging to spiritual pleasures experienced by meditatorsThe color of the cock a fiery red is symbolic of the fact that the passions burn those who indulge in themPassions and desires are hot and restless just like tongues of flame and never allow the heart to experience the cool peace of nonattachmentThe cock is chosen as a symbol of greed because as an animal it is observed to be full of lust and vanityIn the cocks beak there is the tail of a green snake indicating that people who are not able to satisfy their oceanlike greeds and lusts tend to become angryAversion of any form springs up when we do not get what we want or when we get what we do not wantThis also can be very subtle from aversion to mental states ranging through hostile thoughts against other beings to expressions of inward resentment finding their way out in untruthful malicious or angry words or as physical violenceThe greenness of the snake indicates the coldness the lack of sympathy with others while the snake itself is an animal killing other beings by poison and strangulation which is exactly what aversion does to those who let it grow in their heartsOur lives can be corrupted by this venomous beast unless we take very good care to remove itAt the bottom of the picture there is a heavy hog the tail of which is chewed by aversions snake while in turn it champs upon the tail feathers of greeds cockThis heavy hog is black in color and represents delusionThis black hog like its brethren everywhere likes to sleep for long to root for food in filth and generally to take no care at all over cleanlinessIt is a good symbol for delusion which prevents one from understanding what is advantageous and what is deleterious to oneselfIts heaviness is that sluggishness of mind and body which it induces in people called variously stupidity dullness boredom but worry and distraction with skeptical doubt also arise from this delusionrootOne who is overwhelmed by delusion does not know why he should restrain himself from evil for he can see neither his own benefit with wisdom nor the benefit of others by compassion  all is blanketed by delusionHe does not know or does not believe that kamma have results according to kindOr he has wrong views which lead him astray from the highway of DhammaWhen people do not get what they want either using greed or aversion then they turn dull and the pain of their desire is dulled by delusionFrom this black hog are born the fiery cock and the cold green snakeThese three beasts none more dangerous anywhere are shown each biting the tail of the other meaning that really they are inseparable so that one cannot have say greed without the other monsters lurking in its trainEven characters which are rooted predominantly in one of these three have the other two present while most people called normal have a sort of unhealthy balance of these three in their hearts ever ready to influence their actions when a suitable situation occursThese three beasts revolve endlessly in the heart of the ordinaryman and ensure that he experiences plenty of dukkhaOne should know for oneself whether these beasts control ones own heart or notOut from the innermost circle the first ring is divided into two one half with a white background and the other having a black backgroundIn the former four people are seen ascending the bhikkhu holding a Dhammalight goes on in front being followed by a whiterobed nun after which come a man and a woman in present day dressThe four of them represent the Buddhist Community made up of monks nuns laymen and laywomenThey are representative of anyone practicing the path of good conduct in mind speech and bodyThey represent as well two classes of persons going from dark to light and going from light to light In the first case they are born in poor circumstances and have few opportunities due to past evil kamma but in spite of this they make every effort to practice Dhamma for their own good and others happinessThus they go towards the light for the fruit of their present kamma will be pleasant and enjoyableThe latter class going from light to light are those people who have attained many benefits with plentiful opportunities in their present life due to having done much good kamma in the pastIn the present they continue with their upward course devoting themselves to further practice of Dhamma in their livesWhat is this DhammapracticeThere are two lists both of ten factors which could be explained here but the space required would be too great for more than a summaryThe first list is called the ten Skilled Kammapaths three of which pertain to bodily action four to speech and three to mental actionPaths here means ways of action and skillful means neither for the deterioration of ones own mind nor for the harm of others The bodily actions which one refrains from are destroying living creatures taking what is not given and wrong conduct in sexual desiresIn speech the four actions which should be avoided are false speech slanderous speech harsh speech and foolish chatterThe three actions of mind which should be avoided are covetousness illwill and wrong viewsAnyone who restrains himself from these ten practices a skillful path a white path which accords with the first steps of training in DhammaThe other ten factors are called the Ten Ways of making PuññaThey have a different range from the first list of ten being divided into three basic ways and seven secondary onesThe basic factors are giving moral conduct and mind development while the remaining seven are counted as aspects of these three reverence helpfulness dedicating ones puñña to others rejoicing in others puñña listening to Dhamma teaching Dhamma and straightening out ones viewsThese actions lead to uprightness skillful conduct and to the growth in Dhamma of oneself as well as the benefit of othersThose who tread upon this white path going toward the light are able to be born in two bourns either as men or as shiningones  the gods in the three sorts of heavens of sensuality subtle form and formlessnessA life of good practice is thus usually followed by a life in one of these two bourns called sugati or the good bournsBut Lord Buddha does not declare that everyone who has led such a life is necessarily born thereThis depends not only upon the intensity of their Dhammapractice but also upon the vision which arises at the time of deathThrough negligence at the last moment one can slip into the three evil bourns difficult to get out ofThe round of Samsara is very dangerous even for those who lead almost blameless livesMore of this belowTo be born in the two good bourns is the fruiting of puñña or skillful kamma and the more purified ones heart the higher and more pleasant will be ones environmentIn the dark half of the ring naked beings are tumbling downwards in disorderTheir nakedness symbolizes lack of shame in doing evil and their disorder shows the characteristic of evil to cause disintegration and confusionDownwards means that they are falling by the commission of subhuman actions to subhuman states of existenceIn some Tibetan versions they are chained together and pulled downwards by a female demon who squats at the bottomThis demoness is craving of tanhaThis craving is of course not outside those who follow the path of evil but in their own heartsOn this path there are two sorts of persons those going from light to dark and those going from dark to dark The former have good opportunities in this life but do not make use of them or else use them for evil ends without laying up any further storeInstead they prefer from delusion to store up evil now for fear and distress in futureThose who go from dark to dark do not have even the advantages of the former group for they are born in conditions of deprivation due to past evil kamma and then driven on by the fruit of suffering received by them they commit more evilThe Ten Unskillful Kammapaths are the ways along which they walk destroying living creatures taking what is not given wrong conduct in sexual desires false speech slanderous speech harsh speech foolish chatter covetousness illwill and wrongviewsThey do not delight in making puñña but are by nature mean immoral undeveloped in mind proud selfish grasp at possessions envious never listen to Dhamma and certainly never teach it while their hearts are ridden with confused and contradictory views and ideasFor their pains having pursued evil these beings upon their death already having destroyed humanness in themselves fall down to the three lower states which are called the Evil BournsThese are in order of deterioration and increase of suffering the hungry ghosts the animals and the hellwraithsTruly a case ofas the Thai proverb saysThese two halfcircles are also an illustration of the refrain which closes every one of the Avadana stories Thus bhikkhus completely black kamma bears completely evil effects completely white kamma bears completely good effects and composite kamma bears composite effectsTherefore bhikkhus abstain from doing completely black kamma and composite kamma strive to do kamma completely whiteThus O bhikkhus must you train yourselvesThe two good bourns and the three evil bourns contain the whole range of possibilities for rebirthIn most Tibetan illustrations including the one shown here a sixth bourn is given by dividing the devas and asurasIn this section the five or six bourns will be described together with the ways to get to themBirth in any bourn is a fruit or effect and here we shall see the causesA person who has done evil persistently or even one heavy crime is likely to see at the time of death a vision either relating to his past evil actions or else to the bourn which his past evil actions or kamma have prepared for himWhen his physical body is no longer a suitable basis to support life his mind creates a body ghostly and subtle in substance which then and there begins to experience one of the evil bournsBut in case his kamma drives him to be born as animals there is the vision of animals copulating and he is dragged into the womb or egg of those animalsKamma which leads to birth as an animal is a strong interest in the things which mankind shares with the animals that is eating drinking and sexIf a man strengthens the animal in himself to become an animalman he can expect only to be born as an animalHuman beings interested in only these things strengthening the Evil Root of Delusion in their minds have already the minds of animalsThere is no essential manness which can prevent such a catastrophe for no unchanging human soul existsIf a man wishes to guard himself against this he must protect the conditions for humanity which are the Five PreceptsSinking below the level of conduct of these precepts is to sink into the subhuman levelsOnce rebirth as an animal has taken place it is by no means easy to gain human birth again as Venerable Nagarjuna has writtenKamma dragging one to the hells which are the most fearful and miserable states are actions involving hatred killing torture and violence generallyPeople lead themselves to experience hell because they have made the Evil Root of Aversion very strong within themselvesOn the other hand those who have strengthened the Evil Root of Greed while they were men having been mean possessive and selfish are liable to arise as spirits with strong cravings forever unsatisfied for which reason they are known as hungry ghostsHowever it does sometimes happen that one who has led an evil life turns sincerely to religion upon his deathbedWhen this occurs with his mind centered upon Dhamma and purified by faith a person like this may be reborn among men even arise among the devasThat evil kamma which has been done though it may have no chance to fructify in those good bourns remains a potential for creating very unpleasant results whenever conditions are favorable to its fruitionThe reverse of this may happen as when good and noble men become distracted at death and so remember some small evil done or see a vision of evil done in some past life the result of which is the arising of unwholesome consciousness leading to the evil bournsIt is more usual for one who has followed the path of white deeds to be born as a man or among the godsThe basis for the former is the practice of the Five Precepts which constitute the level of humannessThey are in brief refraining from destroying living creatures refraining from taking what is not given refraining from wrong conduct in sexual desires refraining from false speech and refraining from distilled and fermented intoxicants which cause carelessnessThose who refrain from such things having really lived as men having strengthened the base of humanness in their own hearts are born again as men wellendowed with the riches of fine qualities of varied opportunities as well as with a wealth of worldly goodsThe path to the heavens is cultivated by those who make special efforts to live with purity and selfrestraint exercising lovingkindness toward all beings and so purifying their minds to some extent through meditationAt the time of death having fulfilled the ten Skillful Kamma paths and the ten Ways of Making Puñña the heart will be joyful and peaceful to varying degrees which will result in the experience of arising in one of the many heavenly levels according to the degree of purity and concentration which has been attainedAll these possibilities are within the scope of the mind the quality of which can be changed in this way or that by kamma good or badFrom the type of mind which performs the duty of relinkingconsciousness at birth is determined the kind of senseorgans possessed by a being and hence the kind of world experienced by himPerception varies  as the famous Buddhist verse puts itFrom such verses we catch a glimpse of the mysterious depths of the mind and of the truth of the Exalted Buddhas words which open the DhammapadaTo come now to a description of the pictureIn the world of the gods or shiningones the gilded palaces and glittering jewel trees of the gods of sensuality are shown in the lower part of the drawingThe Tibetan picture shows more details of these superlatively beautiful worlds in which there is also a kind of subtle sexual relationshipBeing based upon sensuality as this world of men is these devas must also pay the price for this  which is conflictThis conflict is an everrecurring battle with the asuras the antigods or titans who have in past times fallen through their quarrelsome nature from the heavens and who now enviously try to invade the celestial realmsIn my picture they share a segment of the world of gods and they are equipped with ancient and modern weapons and are in the dress of soldiersBut they do not only battle with the gods but also among themselves and so a bit of insubordination is depicted as wellThe Tibetan picture gives them a world to themselves among the frontiers of which they are fleeing from the victorious heavenly hosts led upon a very large elephant by Sakka the lord of the sensualrealm godsThese titans only understand force so the Buddha shown in their world bears a sword with which to duly impress them after which they may be able to hear a little DhammaBy contrast the Buddha appearing among the gods bears a lute in order to lure them into listening to Dhamma sung in exquisite strains for it was believed that they would not be interested in mere spoken wordsAbove the battling of the sensualrealm gods dwell the Brahmas of subtle form and of formlessness experiencing meditative happiness serene joy or sublime equanimityThe Tibetan picture also shows a magnificent Brahma world palace in the upper lefthand cornerAbout all this heavenly splendor VenNagarjuna warns usHe goes on to speak of the devas as thoseThe Brahmas of formlessness dwelling for unthinkable ages in the realms of infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness and neitherperceptionnornonperception being quite without any form naturally cannot be shown but even their states are not eternal but come to an endAmong men the progress of the humanbeing is shown birth and death but with this basis of dukkha men can also understand DhammaLord Buddha foremost among men sits highest in the human world teaching Dhamma in a forest grove to his first five disciplesIn the original version which my picture follows He is shown only in the human world thus emphasizing the value of human birth during which it is possible to gain insight into DhammaThe religious aspirations of man are represented by a Hindu temple a Christian church and Muslim mosque while a war and a bar show his tendencies towards aversion and greedThe Tibetan picture shows several mundane activities such as plowing the fields while people climb towards the top of the picture where there is a temple in which they can listen to DhammaIn the center stands a Buddha carrying the almsbowl and staff showing to men the way of peacefulness leading to Sublime Peace of NibbanaThis is shown in my picture by the sure Dhammapath which issues from the mouth of the Exalted BuddhaUpon this way a bhikkhu lends a hand to help householders out of the realms of samsara leading them forward upon the Eightfold PathVenerable Nagarjuna has this to sayHungry ghosts or peta crave for food and drink but find that it turns to fire or foul things when they are able to get itI have shown a huge moon and a tiny sun as the verse saysThen there is a skygoing peta being torn to shreds by birds as seen by Venerable Moggallana one resting upon rocks under a leafless tree which is the simile used by the Exalted Buddha in the suttas to symbolize the sole comforts of this realm and two ghosts sunk in the water up to their lower lips their gaping mouths just a little too high to get any of itThe state of Tantalus was obviously birth among the hungry ghostsThe ghosts all have bloated bellies extremely slender necks and needlemouths Their sufferings are illustrated further in the TibetanThey have to bear intense cravings for food and drink and then more sufferings when they manage to get a little of it for it turns to swords and knives in their belliesThe Buddha in this abundantly painful realm carries celestial food to allay the ghosts cravingsIn the words of VenNagarjunaThey ghostly kamma made LKThe animals in the Tibetan illustration are being encouraged in the Dhamma by a Buddha holding a book illustrating the point that animals have little ability to understand and are in need of wisdomMy picture illustrates the sufferings of animallife as described by VenNagarjunaIn the animalworld where feelings experienced are painful sharp and severe one can see the dukkha the hunter and the hunted in my illustrationThe birds of the air are being shot while a vulture is feeding on its preyA wasp struggling in the net of a spider represents the horrors of life among the insects while among the larger animals a buffalo is being forced to work a deer is being shot and a lion feeds upon his preyThe fish fare no better and are shown being devoured by larger fish or else hooked and netted by menSlithering down the division of this world from the hells there is a geckoThe Tibetan picture illustrates the diversity of animal life and shows under the waters the palace of the serpentspirits or naga half snake and half manThe hells which are not permanent states of course have some new horrors of our day for railway lines run into a concentration camp from the chimneys of which belches sinister black smoke while a uniformed member of some secret police force compels a suppliant hellwraith to swallow molten metalTowards the viewer flows the river of caustic soda called Vaitarani which burns the flesh off the bones of those swirling along in it mingled with a stream of blood from the clashing mountainsWhatever torments hellwraiths experience though their bodies are mangled crushed and ripped apart yet they survive still for vast ages of time experiencing feelings which are exclusively painful sharp and severe unrelenting and uninterruptedIn the foreground is the hell of filth where hellwraiths who as men had corrupted the innocent are devoured by gigantic maggots while floundering in a stinking oozeTo the left are the trees of the swordblade forest which have to be climbed so that hell wraiths are pierced through and throughThis particular aspect of hell is said to be the punishment which adulterers bring on themselvesVarious murderers and torturers are impaled upon stakes while a steelbeaked bird rips out the entrails of former cockfightersVenerable Nagarjuna has some more verses upon these lower and mostmiserable statesJetsun Milarepa the great sage and poet of Tibet who had seen the heavens and hells and other states once sung this verseThose who now violate the peoples of Tibet and their Dhamma might well take noteThis brief survey of the Five Bourns may be concluded with a verse of exhortation from The Letter of KindheartednessOur description has now come to the Rim or felly of the Wheel which depicts the Twelve Links of Dependent ArisingIt is these links which chain the entire universe of beings to rebecoming and to sufferingIt is a wellestablished tradition to explain this chain as referring to three livesWhile the present is the only time which is real it has been moulded in the pastIt is in the present that we produce kamma of mind speech and body to bear fruit in the futureIn the twelve nidanas or links around this wheel are set out the whole pattern of life and in it all questions relating to existence are answeredThe teaching of Dependent Arising central in our DhammaVinaya is not however for speculation but should be investigated and seen in ones own and others lives and finally it may be perceived in ones own heart where all the Truths of Dhamma become clear after practiceBut people who do not practice Dhamma are called upholders of the world they let this wheel whirl them round from unknowing to oldage and deathThe Exalted Buddha urged us not to be world upholders but through Dhammapractice to relinquish greed aversion and delusion so that by the cessation of unknowing there comes to be a cessation of birth oldage and deathNow let us have a look at these twelve links in briefThis Pali word avijja is a negative term meaning not knowing completely but it does not mean knowing nothing at all This kind of unknowing is very special and not concerned with ordinary ways or subjects of knowledge for here what one does not know are the Four Noble Truths one does not see them clearly in ones own heart and ones own lifeIn past lives we did not care to see dukkha so we could not destroy the cause of dukkha or craving which has impelled us to seek more and more lives more and more pleasuresThe cessation of dukkha which perhaps could have been seen by us in past lives was not realized so we come to the present existence inevitably burdened with dukkhaAnd in the past we can hardly assume that we set our feet upon the practicepath leading to the cessation of dukkha and we did not even discover streamentryWe are now paying for our own negligence in the pastAnd this unknowing is not some kind of first cause in the past for it dwells in our hearts nowBut due to this unknowing as we shall see we have set in motion this wheel bringing round old age and death and all other sorts of dukkhaThose past selves in previous lives who are in the stream of my individual continuity did not check their craving and so could not cut at the root of unknowingOn the contrary they made kamma some of the fruits of which in this present life I as their causal resultant am receivingThe picture helps us to understand this a blind old woman with a stick picks her way through a petrified forest strewn with bonesIt is said that the original picture here should be an old blind shecamel led by a driver the beast being one accustomed to long and weary journeys across inhospitable country while its driver could be cravingWhichever simile is used the beginninglessness and the darkness of unknowing are well suggestedWe are the blind ones who have staggered from the past into the present  to what sort of futureDepending on the existence of unknowing in the heart there was volitional action kamma or abhisankhara made in those past livesIntentional actions have the latent power within them to bear fruit in the future  either in a later part of the life in which they were performed in the following life or in some more distant life but their potency is not lost with even the passing of aeons and whenever the necessary conditions obtain that past kamma may bear fruitNow in past lives we have made kamma and due to our ignorance of the Four Noble Truths we have been worldupholders and so making good and evil kamma we have ensured the continued experience of this worldBeings like this obstructed by unknowing in their hearts have been compared to a potter making pots he makes successful and beautiful pottery and he is sometimes careless and his pots crack and break up from various flawsAnd he gets his clay fairly well smeared over himself just as purity of heart is obscured by the mud of kammaThe simile of the potter is particularly apt because the word Sankhara means forming shaping and compounding and therefore it has often been rendered in English as FormationsDepending on the existence of these volitions produced in past lives there arises the consciousness called relinking which becomes the basis of this present lifeThis relinking consciousness may be of different qualities according to the kamma upon which it dependsIn the case of all those who read this the consciousness leaping into a new birth at the time of conception was a human relinking consciousness arising as a result of having practiced at least the Five Precepts the basis of humanness in past livesOne should note that this relinking consciousness is a resultant not something which can be controlled by willIf one has not made kamma suitable for becoming a human being one cannot will when the time of death comes round Now I shall become a man again The time for intentional action was when one had the opportunity to practice DhammaAlthough our relinkingconsciousness in this birth is now behind us it is now that we can practice Dhamma and make more sure of a favorable relinking consciousness in future  that is if we wish to go on living in SamsaraThis relinkingconsciousness is the third constituent necessary for conception for even though it is the mothers period and sperm is deposited in the womb if there is no being desiring to take rebirth at that place and time there will be no fertilization of the ovumAppropriately the picture shows a monkey the consciousness leaping from one tree the old life to another treeThe old tree has died while the one towards which it jumps is laden with fruits  they may be the fruits of good or evilThe Tibetan picture shows a monkey devouring fruit experiencing the fruits of deeds done in the pastDependent upon relinkingconsciousness there is the arising of mindbodyThis is not a very accurate translation but gives the general meaningThere is more included in rupa that is usually thought of as body while mind is a compound of feeling perception volition and consciousnessThis mind and body is two interactive continuities in which there is nothing stableAlthough in conventional speech we talk of my mind and my body implying that there is some sort of owner lurking in the background the wise understand that laws govern the workings of both mental states and physical changes and mind cannot be ordered to be free of defilements nor body told that it must not grow old become sick and dieBut it is in the mind that a change can be wrought instead of drifting through life at the mercy of the inherent instability of mind and bodySo in the illustration mind is doing the work of punting the boat of psychophysical states on the river of cravings while body is the passive passengerThe Tibetan picture shows a coracle being rowed over swirling waters with three other passengers who doubtless represent the other groups or aggregatesWith the coming into existence of mindbody there is the arising of the six sensespheresA house with six windows is the usual symbol for this link windowThese six senses are eye ear nose tongue touch and mind and these are the bases for the reception of the various sorts of information which each can gather in the presence of the correct conditionsThis information falls under six headings corresponding to the six spheres sights sounds smells tastes tangibles and thoughtsBeyond these six spheres of sense and their corresponding six objective spheres we know nothingAll our experience is limited by the senses and their objects with the mind counted as the sixthThe five outer senses collect data only in the present but mind the sixth where this information is collected and processed ranges through the three times adding memories from the past and hopes and fears for the future as well as thoughts of various kinds relating to the presentIt may also add information about the spheres of existence which are beyond the range of the five outer senses such as the various heavens the ghosts and the hellstatesA mind developed through collectedness is able to perceive these worlds and their inhabitantsThe six sensespheres existing there is contactThis means the contact between the six senses and the respective objectsFor instance when the necessary conditions are all fulfilled there being an eye a sightobject light and the eye being functional and the person awake and turned toward the object there is likely to be eyecontact the striking of the object upon the sensitive eyebaseThe same is true for each of the senses and their type of contactThe traditional symbol for this link shows a man and a woman embracingWhere contact arises feeling existsWhen there have been various sorts of contact through the six senses feelings arise which are the emotional response to those contactsFeelings are of three sorts pleasant painful and neither pleasant nor painfulThe first are welcome and are the basis for happiness the second are unwelcome and are the basis for dukkha while the third are the neutral sort of feelings which we experience so often but hardly noticeBut all feelings are unstable and liable to change for no mental state can continue in equilibriumEven moments of the highest happiness whatever we consider this is pass away and give place to different onesSo even happiness which is impermanent based on pleasant feelings is really dukkha for how can the true unchanging happiness be found in the unstableThus the picture shows a man with his eyes pierced by arrows a strong enough illustration of thisWhen feelings arise cravings are producedUp to this point the succession of events has been determined by past kammaCraving however leads to the making of new kamma in the present and it is possible now and only now to practice DhammaWhat is needed here is mindfulness for without it no Dhamma at all can be practiced while one will be swept away by the force of past habits and let craving and unknowing increase themselves within ones heartWhen one does have mindfulness one may and can know this is pleasant feeling this is unpleasant feeling this is neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling  and such contemplation of feelings leads one to understand and beware of greed aversion and delusion which are respectively associated with the three feelingsWith this knowledge one can break out of the Wheel of Birth and DeathBut without this Dhammapractice it is certain that feelings will lead on to more cravings and whirl one around this wheel full of dukkhaAs Venerable Nagarjuna has saidIn Sanskrit the word trisna means thirst and by extension implies thirst for experience For this reason craving is shown as a toper guzzling intoxicants and in my picture I have added three bottles  craving for sensual sphere existence and the craving for the higher heavens of the Brahmaworlds which are either of subtle form or formlessWhere the kamma of further craving is produced there arises GraspingThis is an intensification and diversification of craving which is directed to four ends sensual pleasures views which lead astray from Dhamma external religious rites and vows and attachment to the view of soul or self as being permanentWhen these become strong in people they cannot even become interested in Dhamma for their efforts are directed away from Dhamma and towards dukkhaThe common reaction is to redouble efforts to find peace and happiness among the objects which are grasped atHence both pictures show a man reaching up to pick more fruit although his basket is full alreadyWhere this grasping is found there Becoming is to be seenWith hearts boiling with craving and grasping people ensure for themselves more and more of various sorts of life and pile up the fuel upon the fire of dukkhaThe ordinary person not knowing about dukkha wants to stoke up the blaze but the Buddhist way of doing things is to let the fires go out for want of fuel by stopping the process of craving and grasping and thus cutting off Unknowing at its rootIf we want to stay in samsara we must be diligent and see that our becoming which is happening all the time shaped by our kamma is becoming in the right directionThis means becoming in the direction of purity and following the white path of DhammapracticeThis will contribute to whatever we become or do not become at the end of this life when the pathways to the various realms stand open and we become according to our practice and to our deathconsciousnessAppropriately Becoming is illustrated by a pregnant womanIn the presence of Becoming there is arising in a new birthBirth as one might expect is shown as a mother in the process of childbirth a painful business and a reminder of how dukkha cannot be avoided in any lifeWhatever the future life is to be if we are not able to bring the wheel to a stop in this life certainly that future will arise conditioned by the kamma made in this lifeBut it is no use thinking that since there are going to be future births one may as well put off Dhamma practice until then  for it is not sure what those future births will be likeAnd when they come around they are just the present moment as wellSo no use waitingVenerable Nagarjuna shows that it is better to extricate oneselfNaturally where there is Birth is also Oldage and DeathIn future one is assured given enough of Unknowing and Craving of lives without end but also of deaths with endThe one appeals to greed but the other arouses aversionOne without the other is impossibleBut this is the path of heedlessnessThe Dhammapath leads directly to Deathlessness the going beyond birth and death beyond all dukkhaThe Tibetan picture shows an old man carrying off a bundledup corpse upon his back taking it away to some charnel groundMy picture has an old man gazing at a coffin enclosing a corpseWe are well exhorted by the words of Acarya NagarjunaThis is a very brief outline of the workings of this wheel which we cling to for our own harm and the hurt of othersWe are the makers of this wheel and the turners of this wheel but if we wish it and work for it we are the ones who can stop this wheelBoth pictures show the Wheel as being in the grip of a fearful monsterIn my drawing the monsters name is engraved upon his crown so that people should not think of him as a common demonHe is no such thing for his name is Impermanence and his crown shows his authority over all worlds whateverHe devours them and they are all heavens and hells together securely held in the grasp of his taloned handsThe crown upon his head is adorned with five skulls representing the impermanence of the five groups or aggregates comprising the personHis eyes ears nose and mouth have flames about them an illustration of the Exalted Ones Third Discourse in which He says The eye is afire and so onAbove the monsters two eyes there is a third one meaning that while for the fool impermanence is his enemy for the wise man it helps him to EnlightenmentAlthough the monster has adorned himself with earrings and the like he fails to look attractive  in the same way this world puts on an outer show of beauty puts its beauty fades when examined more carefullyBelow the painting of the wheel some Tibetan examples show parts of a tigerskin adorning the monster a symbol of fearfulnessIn my drawing I show the monsters tail which has no beginning looping back and forthIn the same way we have been born lived and then died countless times in the whirl of samsaraSometimes our deeds were mostly good and sometimes mostly bad and we have reaped the fruit of it allThe whole wheel glows with heat and is surrounded by flames burning with the fires of greed aversion and delusion as the Exalted One has repeated many times in His DiscoursesIn the upper right corner of both pictures stands the Exalted Buddha shown crossed over to the Further Shore meaning NibbanaThe Tibetan picture shows him pointing out the moon upon which is drawn a hare the symbol of renunciation the way to practice Dhamma and the way out of this wheelIn my picture He indicates with his hand the nature of samsara and warns us to bewareHe is adorned with a radiance about Him symbolizing the spiritual freedom and majestic wisdom won by Him which can be described in many ways but is finally beyond the limitations of everything known to usThe Tibetan picture shows in the upper left a drawing of Avalokitesvara the embodiment of compassion as the way and the goal for those who follow the bodhisattvapathMy picture has the Path of Dhamma of eight lotuses leading to the wheel of DhammaThe eight lotuses are the eight factors of the Noble Path the first two  Right View Right Attitude  being the wisdomsection the next three  Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood  being the morality section and the last three  Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Collectedness  being the section of collectedness or meditationThe Wheel of Dhamma has at its center suññata the Void another name for the experience of NibbanaAround its hub are the ten petals of a lotus representing the ten perfecting qualities which are necessary for complete attainment generosity moral conduct renunciation wisdom determination energy patience truthfulness lovingkindness and equanimityEight spokes radiate from the hub which stand for the practice by the arahant the one perfected of the Eightfold Path when each factor instead of being just right becomes perfectOn the inside of the wheels nave there are jewels symbolizing the thirtyseven factors of Enlightenment while the outer edge of the nave is adorned with four groups of three jewels showing the Four Noble Truths in each of the three ways wherein they were viewed by the Exalted Buddha when he discovered EnlightenmentThis picture teaches us and reminds us of many important features of the Dhamma as it was intended to by the teachers of oldContemplating all its features frequently helps to give us true insight into the nature of SamsaraWith its help and our own practice we come to see Dependent Arising in ourselvesWhen this has been done thoroughly all the riches of Dhamma will be available to us not from books or discussions nor from listening to others explanationsThe Exalted Buddha has saidThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe present treatise Buddhism in Sri Lanka A Short History deals with the history of Buddhism in this island from the time of its introduction in BCE in the reign of King Devaanampiya Tissa up to the present timeThe work is the outcome of an attempt to revise DrWAde Silvas monograph entitled History of Buddhism in Ceylon appearing in Buddhistic Studies of

History of Buddhism in Ceylon by the VenWRahula The Pali Literature of Ceylon by DrGPMalalasekera Bauddha Toraturu Prakaasaka Sabhaave Vaartaava the Buddhist Commission Report and the Diamond Jubilee Souvenir of the Maha Bodhi Society of India should be especially mentioned among them with gratitude to their authors and editorsThe relevant material from these numerous works has been synthetised to give the reader a basic knowledge of the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka from the earliest time up to the presentIt is hoped that this book will serve this purpose especially to those who wish to gain this knowledge by reading a single short treatise HRPereraPublishers Note In accordance with the official change of the islands name in throughout the text the word Ceylon has been changed to Sri Lanka or Lanka except in a few cases where it was thought necessary or desirable to retain Ceylon Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in beand became the national religion of the Sinhalese from that dateIt is however necessary for a proper study of the history of Buddhism in the island to consider the state of the island and its social and political developments and the culture and character of the people immediately preceding this periodThis will enable us to get a clear understanding of the manner in which such a farreaching revolution in the beliefs manners customs and character of a people was effected by the introduction of this new religion and the progress in literature art and culture that has been manifested through its influenceAccording to the early chronicles relating the historical traditions of Sri Lanka a prince named Vijaya and his followers who came from India and landed in Lanka on the day of the Parinibbaana of the Buddha were the first human inhabitants of this islandWhen they came the island was occupied by yakkhasYakkhas and naagas are also said to have inhabited Lanka in the time of the BuddhaA legend relating the existence of a great civilization before this time under a king named Raavana is also current though the early chronicles make no mention of itThe Vijaya legend of these chronicles is taken by modern historians as a poetic expression of the actual aryanization of Sri Lanka in about the sixth century BCE The term yakkhas and naagas may refer to the aborigines who occupied the island before their arrivalNo traces of an advanced civilization however have yet been discovered to support the Raavana legendArchaeologists have discovered chert and quartz implements and tools at various sites believed to have been used by aborigines of Sri Lanka and they indicate that these people were a primitive tribe who lived by huntingThese aborigines have not left traces of a strong political organization or an advanced cultureThe present Veddas are believed to be their descendantsVijaya and his followers are described in the Lankan chronicles as a set of adventurous young men who when they were banished from their Indian homeland Laala came in search of new land for settlementOther legends some of which are even older relating how the first aryan inhabitants came to settle down in Lanka are found in several Pali and Sanskrit worksMost of them show that the settlement of early aryan settlers is due to the enterprise of the pioneering merchant mariners who came to this island for pearls and precious stonesHistorians thus do not lay much reliance on the details of the Vijayan legend but they accept Vijaya as the first traditional ruler of the newcomers  the SinhaleseVijaya who was a Kshatriya landed in Lanka according to the chronicles on the day of the Parinibbaana of the BuddhaHe allied himself with an aboriginal princess named Kuveni and married her and with her influence soon became the master of the countryLater he drove Kuveni away and obtained a princess from Maduraa whom he made his queenMaidens of high birth came from the Pandyan kingdom as wives of his followersVijaya ruled from his settlement Tambappanni and his ministers founded other settlements like Anuraadhagaama Upatissagaama Ujjeni Uruvelaa and VijitapuraThus the earliest settlements that were founded in the time of King Vijaya were located along the river banks in the northwestern region of Lanka like the Malvatuoya and the KalaaoyaVijaya died after a rule of yearsSince he had no son to succeed him before his death he sent messengers to his brother Sumitta in Sihapura to come and rule hereSumitta sent his youngest son Panduvaasudeva since he himself was king of Sihapura and was also too oldPanduvaasudeva Vijayas nephew arrived one year after Vijayas death during which period the ministers of Vijaya ruled the countryWhen Panduvaasudeva came he brought with him sons of ministersThe early chronicles preserve an episode which connects the Sakka family of the Buddha with the sovereignty of Lanka from the time of King PanduvaasudevaAccording to this account Bhaddakaccaanaa who also arrived in Lanka with other maidens shortly after Panduvaasudeva arrived was the daughter of Pandu Sakka who himself was the son of Amitodana an uncle of the BuddhaPanduvaasudeva ruled for years and was succeeded by his eldest son Abhaya who ruled for yearsAbhayas successor was Pandukaabhaya the son of his sister UmmaadacittaPandukaabhaya was a great ruler in whose reign Anuraadhapura developed into a great city with wellmarked boundariesAfter a long reign of years Pandukaabhaya was succeeded by his son Mutasiva who ruled for yearsMutasivas second son Devaanampiya Tissa succeeded him in BCE that is years after the accession of VijayaThese years could be reckoned as a separate period in the history of Sri Lanka for it formed the background for the offical introduction of Buddhism which occurred during the opening years of the next ruler King Devaanampiya TissaDuring this period the aryan colonists founded settlements along the fertile river banks almost throughout the islandThey chose the river banks because they were mainly agriculturistsThus the regions watered by the Malvatuoya Kalaaoya Valaveganga Kirindioya Menikganga and Kumbukkanoya the Kelaniganga and some regions around the Mahaveliganga soon became populatedAnuraadhapura became a wellorganized city with boundaries marked lakes dug and hospitals and other buildings constructedIn the south Mahaagaama became the center of activityThe majority of the aboriginal inhabitants were absorbed into the new community through intermarriage while a few withdrew to the Malayadesa the highlandsIt is evident from the chronicles relating the early history of Sri Lanka that before the introduction of Buddhism in the reign of King Devaanampiya Tissa there was no single religion which was widely accepted as the national religion of the countryNevertheless there was a wide range of religious beliefs and practices different from one another and each individual seems to have freely observed his religion according to his beliefA noteworthy feature of the preBuddhist religion of Sri Lanka is that it was a mixture of the aboriginal cults and the beliefs of the aryan newcomersThe worship of yaksas and yaksinis was a widely prevalent aboriginal custom of preBuddhist LankaKing Pandukaabhaya the grandfather of Devaanampiya Tissa provided shrines for many of these spirits and also gave them sacrificial offerings annuallySome of these yaksas and yaksinis mentioned by name are Kaalavela Cittaraaja Vessavana Valavaamukhi and CittaaVyaadhadeva Kammaaradeva and Pacchimaraajini though not known as yaksas and yaksinis also belong to the same category of aboriginal spiritsTrees like the banyan and palmyrah were also connected with the cults of these spirits showing that treeworship was also prevalentMany scholars agree that these yaksas and other nonhuman beings are none but the spirits of the dead relatives and tribal chiefs who the people believed were capable of helping friends and harming enemiesThis belief as is widely known formed one of the main features of the primitive religion and is extant even todayAccounts relating the preBuddhist history of Sri Lanka also show a considerable influence of the religious trends of India on the society of LankaSeveral niganthas such as Giri Jotiya and Kumbhanda lived in the reign of Pandukaabhaya and hermitages were constructed for them and other ascetics like aajivakas brahmans and the wandering mendicant monksFive hundred families of heretical beliefs also lived near the city of AnuraadhapuraThe brahmans occupied a high place in society and their religious beliefs were also respectedThe worship of Siva too may have been prevalentThe account in the Mahaavamsa of the settling of the adherents of various sects by King Pandukaabhaya does not specifically mention the presence of any adherents of Buddhism among themBut the work refers to three visits of the Buddha to Sri Lanka a statement which though not corroborated by other evidence has not been disprovedLegendary accounts also claim that two stuupas  the Mahiyangana and the Girihandu  were constructed before the introduction of BuddhismAmong the newcomers too there could have been some members who were acquainted with Buddhism especially as Bhaddakaccaanaa who arrived with other maidens in the guise of nuns was a close relative of the BuddhaBuddhism as a form of religious expression gained ascendency in India during this periodEmperor Asoka was crowned according to the chronicles in the year of the Buddhist eraLike his father Bindusaara and grandfather Candragupta Asoka was a follower of the brahmanical faith at the beginning of his reignIn the early years of his reign he followed an expansionist policy and in the eighth year of his coronation he conquered Kaalinga in the course of which were slain and taken prisonersBut the carnage of the Kaalinga war caused him much grief and the king was attracted towards the humanistic teachings of BuddhismAccording to the Sri Lanka chronicles it was a young novice named Nigrodha who converted AsokaAfter the conversion of this great emperor Buddhism flourished under his patronageHe inculcated the teachings of the Buddha and set up edicts of morality at numerous places of his vast empire so that his subjects would adhere to them and his successors might follow himHe himself followed those morals and set an example to the othersThe king is reputed to have built stupasThe monks were lavishly provided with their requisitesThe king even permitted his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamittaa to join the Order when they were twenty and eighteen years of age respectivelyThese two illustrious disciples became noted for their piety attainments learning and profound knowledge of the DhammaVast numbers joined the Order in the reign of Asoka solely to share the benefits showered on it by the king and such people were not only lax in their conduct but also held doctrines counter to the teachings of the BuddhaIt was this dissenting element that led to the holding of the Third Buddhist Council under the patronage of King Asoka in order to purify the Buddhist religionIt was at this Council held by a thousand theras under the leadership of Moggaliputta Tissa at Paataliputta that the Pali Canon of the Theravaada as it exists today was finally redactedAt this Council was also taken the important decision of sending missionaries to different regions to preach Buddhism and establish the Saasana thereThus the thera Moggaliputta Tissa deputed Majjhantika Thera to KaasmiraGandhaara Mahaadeva Thera to Mahisamandala Rakkhita Thera to Vanavaasi YonaDhammarakkhita Thera to Aparaantaka Dhammarakkhita Thera to Mahaarattha Mahaarakkhita Thera to Yonaloka Majjhima Thera to Himavanta theras Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhuumi and Mahinda Thera with theras Itthiya Uttiya Sambala and Bhaddasaala to Lanka saying unto the five theras Establish ye in the delightful land of Lanka the delightful religion of the VanquisherMahinda was thirtytwo years old when he undertook the mission to Sri LankaHe had adopted the religious life at the age of twenty mastered the doctrines and attained the highest spiritual life ie arahantshipPondering on the fitting time to come to Lanka he perceived that Mutasiva the ruler at that time was in his old age and hence it was advisable to tarry until his son became rulerIn the meantime Mahinda visited his relatives at Dakkhinaagiri and his mother at Vedisagiri along with his companionsHis mother Devi whom Asoka had married while he was yet a prince was living at Vedisagiri at that timeHaving stayed for six months at Dakkhinaagiri and a month at Vedisagiri Mahinda perceived that the right time had come for the old ruler was dead and his son Devaanampiya Tissa had become kingDevaanampiya Tissa was the second son of MutasivaHe was a friend of Asoka even before he became king but the two had not seen each otherThe first thing that Devaanampiya Tissa did when he became king was to send envoys to Asoka bearing costly presentsThe envoys when they returned brought among other things the following message from AsokaAham Buddhañ ca Dhammañ ca Sanghañ ca saranamgato upaasakattam vedesim Saakyaputtassa saasane tvampimaani ratanaani uttamaani naruttama cittam pasaadayitvaana saddhaaya saranam bhajaI have taken refuge in the Buddha his Doctrine and his Order I have declared myself a laydisciple in the religion of the Saakya son seek then O best of men refuge in these best of gems converting your mind with believing heartThis message of Asoka was conveyed to King Devaanampiya Tissa in the month of Vesakha and it was the fullmoon day of the following month Jettha that Mahinda fixed for his arrival in Sri LankaAmong the companions of Mahinda were the theras Itthiya Uttiya Sambala and Bhaddasaala the saamanera Sumana who was the son of Sanghamittaa and the laydisciple Bhanduka who was the son of a daughter of Devis sister and had become an anaagaami on hearing a sermon of Mahinda preached to DeviThus on the fullmoon day of the month of Jettha in the year beMahinda and his companions departing from Vedisagiri rose up in the air and alighted on the Silakuuta of the pleasant Missaka hill presently Mihintale eight miles east of AnuraadhapuraThe thera alighted here for he had perceived that he would meet the king there on that dayThe first meeting of the king of Lanka and the thera Mahinda is graphically described in the chronicles of Sri LankaThe fullmoon day of Jettha was a day of national festival in LankaMen and women were engaged in amusing themselvesThe king with a large party of followers went to Mihintale hills on a hunting expeditionThere he saw the theras with shaven heads dressed in yellow robes of dignified mien and distinguished appearance who faced him and addressed him not as ordinary men addressing a king but as those to whom a king was their inferiorThe conversation impressed the king and his immediate surrender to the wisdom and piety displayed by the thera was completeMahinda Thera in reply to the kings inquiry as to who they were and whence they had come saidSamanaa mayam Mahaaraaja Dhammaraajassa saavakaa taveva anukampaaya Jambudiipaa idhaagataaWe are the disciples of the Lord of the DhammaIn compassion towards you Mahaaraaja We have come here from IndiaWhen he heard these words of the thera the king laid aside his bow and arrow and approaching the thera exchanged greetings with him and sat down near himMahinda then had a conversation with the king and realizing that the king was intelligent enough to comprehend the Dhamma preached the Cuulahatthipadopama SuttaAt the end of the discourse the king and his retinue of forty thousand people embraced the new faithHaving invited the missionaries to the city the king left for his palaceMahinda spent his first day in Sri Lanka at Mihintale where he solemnized the first ecclesiastical act by admitting to the Order the layfollower Bhanduka who had accompanied him from IndiaOn the invitation of the king Mahinda and the other theras arrived at Anuraadhapura the following dayGoing forward to meet the theras the king respectfully led them into the palace where he himself served them with dainty foodAfter the meal Mahinda preached the Petavatthu the Vimaanavatthu and the Saccasamyutta to the royal householdThe people of the city who heard of the theras flocked near the palacegate to see them and the king prepared a hall outside the palace so that the townspeople could see the therasOn this occasion Mahinda preached the Devaduuta SuttaThis hall too was not spacious enough for the vast gathering and seats were prepared for the theras in the Nandanagarden in the royal park where Mahinda preached the Baalapandita SuttaIn the evening the theras expressed their desire to go back to MihintaleThe king who wished them to stay in his capital granted to the Sangha the royal park Mahaamegha for their residenceThe king himself marked the boundaries by plowing a furrowThus was established the Mahaavihaara which became the earliest celebrated center of the Buddhist religionHaving spent twentysix days in the Mahaamegha Park the thera returned to Mihintale for the rainretreatThis was the beginning of the Cetiyagirivihaara another great monastic institution of early Buddhist Sri LankaMany women of Sri Lanka headed by Queen Anulaa desired to enter the Order of disciples and thus it came about that emissaries led by the kings nephew Arittha were sent to Emperor Asoka to obtain the help of female disciples to enable the women of Lanka to obtain ordinationSanghamittaa the sister of Mahinda Thera who had entered the Order and had received ordination was sent out to Lanka at the request of the king and the people and on the recommendation of Mahinda TheraThe message sent by thera Mahinda to Emperor Asoka pleased him very much for in it he realized that the mission to Lanka had been eminently successful and the king and the people of Lanka had accepted the new doctrine with enthusiasmEmperor Asoka decided on sending a token of the Great and Enlightened One to the land of Lanka and prepared a branch of the Sacred Bodhi Tree under which the Lord attained enlightenmentHe planted the branch in a golden vessel and when it had taken root conveyed it to the ship depositing it in the shipHe also sent a large number of attendants to accompany the treeThe chronicles mention that these were selected from the brahmans nobles and householders and consisted of familiesSanghamittaa Therii and her attendants embarked on the same ship as well as the ambassadors and messengers who came from LankaThe ship sailed from Taamralipti and arrived at the port in Lanka in seven daysThe port was known as Jambukola and was situated in the north of the islandThe king of Lanka on hearing of the arrival of the ship had the road from Jambukola to the capital city of Anuraadhapura gaily decoratedHe arrived in state and himself took charge of the Sacred Bodhi TreeThis tree was planted in the Mahaamegha garden of Anuraadhapura with great festivities and tended with honor and careUp to this date it flourishes as one of the most sacred objects of veneration and worship for millions of BuddhistsArittha the kings nephew who had obtained the kings permission to enter the Order of monks on his return from India did so with five hundred other men and all became arahantsWith the ordination of Anulaa and the other women both the Bhikkhusaasana and the Bhikkhunisaasana were established in the islandSeparate residences for monks and nuns were built by the kingThe Thuupaaraamacetiya enshrining the right collarbone and other bodily relics of the Buddha was built and the Sacred Bodhi Tree was planted for the devotion of the laityWhen these acts of religious devotion were accomplished the king asked Mahinda Thera whether the Saasana had been firmly established in the island to which the latter replied that it had only been planted but would take firm root when a person born in Sri Lanka of Sinhalese parents studied the Vinaya in Sri Lanka and expounded it in Sri LankaArittha Thera had by this time become noted for his piety and his learning and on an appointed day at a specially constructed preaching hall in the presence of numerous theras the king and the chiefs Arittha Thera was invited to give a discourse on the Vinaya in the presence of the thera Mahaa MahindaAnd his exposition was so correct and pleasing that there was great rejoicing as the condition required for the firm establishment of the Saasana was fulfilled by himDevaanampiya Tissa ruled in Sri Lanka for forty yearsIt was in the first year of his reign that Buddhism was introduced and from that time the king worked for the progress of the new faith with great zealApart from the Mahaavihaara the Cetiyapabbatavihaara the Thuuparaama and the Sacred Bodhi Tree he established numerous other monasteries and several Buddhist monumentsThe chronicles mention that he built monasteries a yojana from one anotherAmong these monuments the Isurumunivihaara and the Vessagirivihaara are important centers of worship to this dayHe is also credited with the construction of the Pathamakacetiya the Jambukolavihaara and the Hatthaalhakavihaara and the refectoryThousands of men and women joined the Order during his reignThe king not only built vihaaras for their residence but also provided them with their requisitesIt was not only in the capital city that Buddhism spread in his reign but even in distant regions like Jambukola in the north and Kaajaragaama and Candanagaama in the southThe remarkable success of Mahindas mission and the rapid spread of the religion in a very short time were mainly due to the efforts of Mahinda and the unbounded patronage of King Devaanampiya TissaApart from them the people of Lanka too were eminently ripe at this period for receiving and adopting the teachings of the BuddhaThe people in the land were prosperous their wants were few and these were supplied by the fertile soilThere was prosperous trade for merchants came from all lands to barter goods their art was well developed for in the leisure people enjoyed they were able to build cities and tanks great and small and to perform works both of utility and artistic valueContentment reigned supremeWhere such conditions existed the people were ready to embrace new ideals that had the prospect of helping their culture and elating their thoughts and activities and as such the new doctrine preached by Mahinda Thera fell on a fertile soil where it soon rose to its full heightHundreds of thousands of men and women rose to high spiritual attainments on hearing the new message and thus the Law of the Blessed One was firmly establishedBoth Mahinda and Sanghamitta survived Devaanampiya TissaMahinda lived to the age of years and Sanghamittaa to the age of yearsThey spent nearly years in the islandThe former died in the eighth year and the latter in the ninth of the reign of King Uttiya brother and successor of Devaanampiya TissaUttiya performed their funerals with great honor and built stuupas over their relicsThe king himself died in the following year be after a reign of ten yearsThe hierarchy of the disciples was continued in pupilary successionArittha Thera succeeded Mahinda Thera he was in turn succeeded by Isidatta Kaalasumana Diighanaama and DiighasumanaTwenty years after the death of Uttiya foreign usurpers from South India seized AnuraadhapuraTwo of them Sena and Guttika reigned together for twentytwo years and another Tamil usurper Elaara reigned for fortyfour yearsThe lack of interest of these Tamil rulers in the Buddhist faith and the vandalism of their supporters evidently retarded the progress of the religionFurthermore the Sinhalese rulers were not free to work for the religion during these periods of political unrestNevertheless the people held strongly to their new religion and showed no signs of laxityIt was a young prince from Maagama of the southeastern principality of Ruhuna who restored the lost glory of the Sinhalese and their religionHe was Abhaya known to posterity by a nickname which means disobedient DutthagaamaniHe was a descendant of Mahaanaaga who had established himself at Maagama when his older brother Devaanampiya Tissa was ruling at AnuraadhapuraKaakavanna Tissa and Vihaaramahaadevi were his parentsAfter a thorough preparation for war Dutthagaamani defeated and killed Elaara in battle and became the ruler of AnuraadhapuraThus the sovereignty of the Sinhalese rulers of Anuraadhapura was once more establishedDutthagaamani reigned for twentyfour yearsThe advancement of the Buddhist religion was his main concernThe Ruvanvelisaaya the most celebrated stupa in Sri Lanka was his greatest workThe magnificent edifice of nine storeys and nine hundred chambers called the Lohapaasaada the Brazen Palace was constructed by him for the use of the monksMirisavetidaagaba was another of his worksDutthagaamani was not only a supporter of Buddhism but was also a zealous follower himselfMany episodes in the Pali commentaries depict him as a pious monarchUnder his patronage there flourished several learned monks during his reignIt is well to find out the social and cultural development of the Sinhalese during the two centuries following their acceptance of the Buddhist religionWe have many incidents and stories in the Sri Lanka chronicles from which a definite idea regarding these conditions can be inferredFor instance the Rasavaahinii a Pali work composed in the thirteenth century of the Christian era contains over a hundred stories of the life of the people during this early periodAccording to these stories among the Sinhalese there do not appear to have been any caste divisionsBrahmans are mentioned as living apart in their own villages and they were more or less counted as foreign to the SinhaleseThe members of the royal families were held in a class by themselves and those of such families who aspired to the kingdom had to marry a member of a royal family or at least from a Brahman familyThe rest of the people were grihapatisThe Candaalas were those without a fixed abode they were despised on account of being tramps and vagrants with no fixed residenceIn some cases the word Candaala was used in a selfdeprecatory manner in order to indicate unworthinessThere is the instance of Prince Saali son of King Dutthagaamani who fell in love with a village artisans daughter DeviIn addressing the prince she said that she was a Candaali as she did not belong to a family into which a member of the royal family was allowed to marryThe two divisions of people merely appear to be those who had a fixed abode and those who had no fixed abodeThere were at this time no special caste divisions for trades or occupations for a householder or members of a family were in general expected to engage themselves in one of the three occupations as traders as artisans or as cultivatorsPrince Dighaabhaya when appointed as governor of Kasaatota required attendants and asked each chief family of a village to send one of its sons for service and sent a messenger to Sangha the chief of the villageThe chief called together his seven sonsThe elder six asked him to send the youngest to the kings service as he was idling his time at home without engaging in any workWe six are engaged in such occupations as trade industries and cultivation and work hard at our occupations Again in another story the father a chief of a village addressing his daughter regarding her husband tells her that her husband is living in idleness and like her brothers should engage himself in an occupation such as cultivation industry and commerceThus it appears all trades were common and the same family engaged in work as artisans tradesmen and cultivators without distinctionThe religion of the Sinhalese during this period was purely and entirely Buddhist and the stories indicate much practical activity in religious affairs both in endowment and maintenance of religious institutions and the practice of religious principlesThe Orders of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis flourished during this period a very large number of men and women entered the religious OrdersSome of the vihaaras had thousands residing in themThere were also large numbers who were practicing meditation in forests and rock cavesThey were well supported by the laityThere were four classes of disciples the novices bhikkhus theras and mahaatheras There are no Sangharaajas mentioned in any of the stories and no interference by kings or ministers in appointment or in giving ranks to the members of the OrderThe affairs of the Sangha were managed by the monks themselves under well established rules of the VinayaThere appear to have been large numbers of disciples who had attained to the state of arahant ie saints who had gained emancipationIn addition practically every man or woman was an upaasaka or upaasikaa a devotee who regularly performed religious dutiesThe bhikkhus lived in their vihaaras during the rainy season and at other seasons traveled far and wide in the country visiting villages other vihaaras and as pilgrims worshipping at shrinesBoth laymen and bhikkhus are frequently mentioned as going on pilgrimages to Gayaa in India to worship at the sacred Bodhi Tree thereThese parties of pilgrims sometimes crossed over to Southern India and walked all the way to Gayaa taking about six months on the journey sometimes they went by sea and landed at Taamralipti at the mouth of the Ganges and reached Gayaa in half the timeThe canonical scriptures had not been committed to writing at this time though writing was knownThe bhikkhus learned the Dhamma and many committed to memory the scriptures or parts of them thus preserving the tradition by frequent rehearsalThat the art of writing was probably introduced to Sri Lanka only after the introduction of Buddhism seems deducible from the circumstance that so far no preBuddhist writing lithic or other has been identifiedThe earliest lithic records date back to the time of King Uttiya successor of Devaanampiya TissaThe bhikkhus were the instructors of the peopleThis was practically a dutyThe Dhamma was expounded individually on every occasion and sermons to congregations were also held from time to timeThere is mention of the periodical expounding of the Dhamma at a templeEach temple in a district sometimes took its turn once a year to preach the Ariyavamsa Sutta which was continued each time for seven days the gatherings on these occasions appear to be very large as in instances mentioned it is said that the crowds were so great that large numbers usually had to stand outside the hall for the whole night and listen to the Dhamma the audience including bhikkhus and the laityThere is also mention of discourses by lay preachers well versed in the Dhamma employed by the king at halls of preachingIt is not clearly stated whether brahmans who lived in brahman villages practiced their own religionMention is made of sannyaasis or yogis who practiced asceticism and sometimes lived in cemeteries scantily clad with bodies covered with ashes and as the story says pretending to be saints while at the same time they led sinful livesThere is no mention of brahman temples or places of worshipWomen had a very high status in society during this periodPractically in every strata of society the position of women showed no distinction from that of menThey freely took part in every activity of life and their influence is well markedTheir character is depicted in most favorable terms they were gentle courteous and good natured hospitable tender and intelligent ever ready to help others to preserve the honor of their families devoted to religion and country with untrammelled freedom of actionThe position of women is further seen from the fact that monogamy was a definite institutionThere is no mention of any other form of marriageWomen had freedom to choose their husbandsAfter the death of King Dutthagaamani his younger brother Saddhaatissa ruled for eight years and did a great deal for BuddhismHe was succeeded by his sons Thuulatthana Lanjatissa Khallaata Naaga and Vattagaamani Abhaya in successionThe period of Vattagaamani Abhaya also known as Valagambahu is noteworthy in the history of early Buddhism in Sri LankaFive months after his accession to the throne in BCE a brahman named Tiya from Ruhuna South Lanka revolted against himAt the same time a Tamil army led by seven Tamil chiefs landed at Mahaatittha and waged war against the kingThe Tamil army vanquished Tiya and defeated Vattagaamani in battle after which the latter fled and lived in exile for fourteen yearsThese fourteen years of Tamil domination were disastrous to the cause of Buddhism especially because the country was also ravaged by an unprecedented famine during that periodFood was so scarce during that time that even cases of cannibalism are said to have occurredMany thousands of monks and laymen died of starvationThe monasteries were desertedThe Mahaavihaara of Anuraadhapura was completely abandoned and the Mahaathuupa was neglectedTrees grew in the courtyards of vihaaras arahants from the Tissamahaaraama and another from the Cittalapabbatavihaara passed away in the forest due to lack of foodWhile thousands of monks died in the country many left the country and went to IndiaAs a result of the death of most of the learned monks there was even the fear that some parts of the scriptures would be lostThe Mahaaniddesa of the Sutta Pitaka for instance was on the verge of being lost for this text was known by only one monk at that timeThe monks in their earnestness to preserve the teachings of the Buddha subsisted on roots and leaves of trees and recited the scriptures lest they should forget themWhen they had the strength they sat down and recited and when they could no longer keep their bodies erect they lay down and continued their recitationThus they preserved the texts and the commentaries until the misery was overAfter Vattagaamani Abhaya regained the throne he demolished the monastery of a nigantha named Giri for having mocked him when he was fleeingHe built a Buddhist monastery called the Abhayagirivihaara over it which he presented to a monk named Kupikkala Mahaa Tissa who had helped the king in his exileLater the monks of the Mahaavihaara imposed the punishment of expulsion on Tissa on the charge of improper contact with lay familiesTissas pupil Bahalamassu Tissa who resented the punishment imposed upon his teacher was likewise expelled from the MahaavihaaraHe then went away with a following of five hundred monks and lived at Abhayagirivihaara refusing to return to the MahaavihaaraThere was thus a group of monks who broke away from the Mahaavihaara and lived separately in the Abhayagirivihaara but they did not yet disagree with each other either in the theory or the practice of the DhammaThe actual schism occurred only when monks of the Vajjiputta sect in India came to Sri Lanka and were received at the Abhayagiri not long after Tissa and his followers occupied that monasteryTissa and his followers liked the new monks and adopted their doctrinesThenceforth they came to be known as the Dhammaruci sect after the name of the great Indian monk who was the teacher of the newcomers to AbhayagiriThere was no official suppression of the new sect presumably because the king was in their favor but the Mahaavihaara monks opposed them as unorthodox and hereticalFrom this time the Abhayagiri existed as a separate sect opposed to the MahaavihaaraIt is stated in the early chronicles that after the acceptance of Buddhism by the people in Lanka and after the formation of a hierarchy of disciples who were Sinhalese a council was held under Mahinda Thera where all the leading theras were present and the teachings were recited and authoritatively laid down as was done in the third convocation held in India under the direction of Emperor AsokaTheravaada was thus established in Sri Lanka and according to tradition and custom the various parts of the Tipitaka were learned by the members of the Order committed to memory and preserved as oral traditionsIt was seen how during the famine that broke out in the time of King Vattagaamani Abhaya a great strain was put on the continuance of this form of preserving the teachings of the TipitakaWhen conditions became normal the members of the Order considered that they could lose the teachings if any similar calamity or calamities were to occur in the future and they decided that the time had arrived for committing these teachings to writing so that they might be preserved for future generationsThe advent of schisms about this time might also have weighed strongly in favor of this decisionThus the members of the Order assembled at the Mahaavihaara at Anuraadhapura took counsel together and with the permission and encouragement of the king a convocation was heldThe teachings were recited and scribes were engaged to commit to writing on palm leaves the Pali canonical texts consisting of Vinaya Sutta and Abhidhamma and the Sinhalese commentariesAccording to the Nikaaya Sangraha a Sinhalese work of the fourteenth century dealing with the history of the Buddhist order after the convocation at the Mahaavihaara at Anuraadhapura the selected number of reciters and scribes in all went to Alulena cave temple close to Matale in the central provinceThere in retirement they completed the work assigned to them and thus for the first time brought out in book form the teachings of the BuddhaAbout two centuries after the formation of the Dhammaruci sect at the Abhayagirivihaara in the days of King Vohaarika Tissa the monks of the Abhayagirivihaara adopted the VaitulyavaadaThereupon the monks of the Mahaavihaara having compared it with their own texts rejected the Vaitulya doctrines as being opposed to traditional doctrineThe king who had them examined by a learned minister named Kapila burnt them and suppressed the VaitulyavaadinsDespite the suppression by Vohaarika Tissa the Vaitulyavaadins began to assert themselves again and a few years later in the time of King Gothaabhaya the Dhammaruci monks of Abhayagiri again accepted VaitulyavaadaWhen this happened about three hundred monks left the Abhayagirivihaara to reside at the Dakkhinavihaara founding a new sect known as SaagaliyaThe king having assembled the bhikkhus of the five great monasteries of the Theriya Nikaaya had the Vaitulya books examined ordered the books to be destroyed and expelled the Vaitulya monksSixty of them left for the Chola country in South IndiaThe struggle did not end here for the adherents of the new doctrine were firmly established in South India and they planned to undermine the Mahaavihaara Nikaaya in Sri LankaWith this object a very learned monk by the name of Sanghamitra came to Sri Lanka and obtained the post of tutor to the kings two sonsSanghamitra gained considerable influence over the young pupil Mahaasena and was able to instil into him the new doctrine and make him a follower of his viewsWhen Mahaasena ascended the throne the opportunity looked forward to by the Vaitulyans cameThe new king became a great supporter of his tutor and as such persecuted the Mahaavihaara monksThe king at the instigation of Sanghamitra Thera ordered that no one should give food to the monks of the MahaavihaaraThe Mahaavihaara as a result had to be abandoned for nine yearsThe supporters of Sanghamitra destroyed the buildings of the Mahaavihaara and carried away their material to construct new buildings for the AbhayagirivihaaraTwo persons a minister and a queen came forward this time to suppress Vaitulyavaada and save the MahaavihaaraThe minister Meghavannaabhaya by name managed to persuade the king to rebuild the MahaavihaaraThe queen caused Sanghamitra to be put to death and burned the Vaitulya booksBut the king who was yet favorable towards the followers of Sanghamitra built and gave the Jetavanavihaara to a monk named TissaTissa who was later charged by the Mahaavihaara monks of a grave offense was expelled from the OrderThe monks of the Sagaliya sect at Dakkhinavihaara then came to reside in the JetavanavihaaraIn the reign of Silaakaala a Vaitulyan book called the Dharmadhaatu which was brought to Sri Lanka from India was kept at the Jetavanavihaara and veneratedThus from this time the monks of Jetavanavihaara too became adherents of VaitulyavaadaIn the reign of King Aggabodhi I a great monk and teacher named Jotipaala coming from India so exposed the fallacies of the Vaitulya doctrines that in his day they fell into disrepute and disappeared from Sri LankaSince that time the monks of the Abhayagiri and Jetavana vihaaras who adhered to Vaitulyan doctrines abandoned their pride and lived in submission to the monks of the MahaavihaaraIntercourse with India was so frequent that from time to time other unorthodox doctrines occasionally found favor with certain monks but these had no marked effect on the general progress or the stability of the Mahaavihaara NikaayaFor nearly three centuries after the time of Aggabodhi I the chronicles make no mention of the Vaitulyavaada or any other heretical teaching until in the reign of King Sena I a monk of the Vaajraparvata Nikaaya came to Sri Lanka from India and introduced Vaajiriyavaada converting the king to his doctrinesIt was at this time that teachings like the Ratnakuutasuutra were also introduced to Sri Lanka and another heresy called Nilapatadarsana appearedSena II who succeeded Sena I managed to suppress these new doctrinesFrom his time until the Chola conquest in the early eleventh century there is no mention of any heretical sect in Sri LankaHowever a survey of the religious monuments of that period clearly shows that their teachings survived side by side with the teachings of the TheravaadaIt is opportune here to enquire about the nature of the new doctrines that were mentioned in the previous chapter as having been introduced into Sri Lanka from time to time since the first century acIt was the monks of the Vajjiputra sect in India who were the first to introduce a new teachingThe Vajjiputra sect is mentioned in the Sri Lanka chronicles as one of the groups that parted from the Theriya Nikaaya after the Second Buddhist Council to form a new sectThey thus evidently held some views different from those of the orthodox teachingsBuddhaghosa mentions in the Pali commentaries that the Vajjiputrakas held the view that there is a persistent personal entity which is opposed to the accepted theory of anattaa of the Theravaada teachingsThey also believed that arahants may fall away from their attainmentThese followers of the Vajjiputraka doctrines residing at the Abhayagirivihaara became adherents of the Vaitulya doctrines about two centuries afterwards and until the beginning of the seventh century Vaitulyavaada became closely associated with Abhayagirivihaara and JetavanavihaaraLike the Vajjiputra sect the Vaitulyavaada is mentioned in the Nikaaya Sangraha as one of the sects that arose in India after the Second Buddhist CouncilThe Nikaaya Sangraha also states that the Vaitulya Pitaka was composed by heretic brahmans called Vaitulyas who entered the Order in the time of King Asoka to destroy BuddhismIt has been noticed that the terms Vaitulya Vaipulya and Vaidalya are commonly used as a designation for Mahaayaana suutras and hence the term Vaitulyavaada is used in the Sri Lanka chronicles to denote Mahaayaanism in general without having a particular Buddhist school in viewThe Vaitulyavaadins were considered even more heretical than the VajjiputrakasThe Pali commentaries mention some of their heretical viewsThey held the view that the Buddha having been born in the Tusita heaven lived there and never came down to earth and it was only a created form that appeared among menThis created form and nanda who learned from it preached the doctrineThey also held that nothing whatever given to the Order bears fruit for the Sangha which in the ultimate sense of the term meant only the path and fruitions does not accept anythingAccording to them any human pair may enter upon sexual intercourse by mutual consentThe Diipavamsa used the term Vitandavaada in place of Vaitulyavaada and the Pali commentaries mention them as holding unorthodox views regarding the subtle points in the Dhamma particularly the AbhidhammaBuddhaghosa also refers to the Vaitulyavaadins as MahaasuññavaadinsThe philosophy of the Mahaayaana as expounded by the great Mahaayaana teacher Naagaarjuna was SuunyavaadaThus the fact that the first appearance of Vaitulyavaada in Sri Lanka took place shortly after Naagaarjunas teachings spread in South India and that Vaitulyavaada is also identified with Suunyavaada of Naagaarjuna suggests that it was the teaching of Naagaarjuna that was received by the monks of Abhayagirivihaara in the days of Vohaarika TissaThe book called Dharmadhaatu which was brought to Lanka in the reign of Silaakaala is described in the chronicles as a Vaitulyan bookThe monks of the Abhayagirivihaara and the Jetavanavihaara are connected with the honors paid to itIt has become evident that a book named Dharmadhaatu was known and held in high esteem in the tenth century in Lanka and it is quite probable that this book was a Mahaayaanistic treatise dealing with the doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha found among the teachings of the MahaayaanaVaajiriyavaada was introduced in the reign of King Sena I by a monk of the Vajraparvata NikaayaScholars have pointed out that the Vaajiriyavaadins are identical with the Vajrayaanists a school of Buddhism which flourished in eastern India about this time and which was an exponent of the worst phases of TantrismThe Nikaaya Sangraha describes their writings as secret teachings and the Guudhavinaya ie the secret Vinaya is one of the compositions of the VajrayaanistsThe Nikaaya Sangraha mentions that about this time the Ratnakuutasuutra was introduced to Sri LankaIn the Chinese Canon the second of the seven classes of the Mahaayaanasuutras is called the RatnakuutaThe Niilapatadarsana which was also introduced about this time was also an extreme form of TantrismBlue has been a color often favored by TantristsAn important event in the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is the arrival of Buddhas Tooth Relic the left eyetooth from India about be during the time of King Sirimeghavanna son and successor of King MahaasenaEver since this Sacred Tooth Relic was received in Sri Lanka it has been a national treasure of great value and a tangible token of the attachment of the Sinhalese to the doctrine of the Blessed TathaagataKing Sirimeghavanna held a great festival for the Tooth Relic and decreed that it should be brought every year to the Abhayagirivihaara and the same ceremonial should be observedToday it is enshrined in golden caskets in the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy which has become the center of devout pilgrims from all over the island and from Buddhist lands elsewhereAncient customs and ceremonies are scrupulously kept up offerings are made daily and in honor of the Sacred Relic an annual festival lasting fourteen days is held in Kandy every year during AugustThe Perahera or procession on these occasions is conducted by the temple authorities with elephants lights music and dancers and is witnessed by thousands of devoteesChiefs in full ancient attire accompany the processionLarge tracts of land have been set apart as fees for services at this temple and the tenants of these lands have various services apportioned to themThe exhibition of the Sacred Relic itself takes place at rare intervals when tens of thousands of pilgrims find their way to the Temple to worship and view the RelicA medieval chronicle chiefly of the eastern part of the island mentions the existence of the right eyetooth and its enshrinement in Somavati Cetiya in preChristian timesThe Sacred Tooth Relic was in the possession of King Guhasiva of Kaalinga before it was brought to Sri LankaWhen he was about to be defeated in battle he entrusted it to his daughter Hemamaalaa Hemamaalaa with her husband Dantakumaara brought the Sacred Tooth to Lanka and handed it over to King Sirimeghavanna at AnuraadhapuraFrom this date the Sacred Tooth Relic became the care of the kings of Lanka who built special temples for itDuring the many vicissitudes of the fortunes of the kings of Lanka the Sacred Relic was conveyed from place to place where the fortunes of the king happened to take himReplicas of the Sacred Tooth were made at various times and were owned by princes claiming the throneAbout the year King Anawrahta of Burma sent various presents to King Vijayabaahu I of Sri Lanka and in return received a duplicate of the Sacred Tooth Relic which he received with great veneration and a shrine was built for it in BurmaThe Portuguese in one of their expeditions to Sri Lanka claim to have captured the Sacred Tooth Relic at Jaffna in the yearJaffna was an outlying port away from the strongholds of Sinhalese kings and the relic said to have been found by the Portuguese in a temple at Jaffna appeared to be one of the several duplicates which had been made at various timesOn this question ProfRhys Davids wrote in the Academy of September Jaffna is an outlying and unimportant part of the Ceylon kingdom not often under the power of the Sinhalese monarchs and for some time before this it had been ruled by a petty chieftain there is no mention of the Tooth brought by Dantakumaara having been taken there  an event so unlikely and of such importance that it would certainly have been mentioned had it really occurredWe have every reason to believe therefore that the very Tooth referred to in the Daañhaavamsa is preserved to this day in KandyIn the British occupied KandyAs usual the Sacred Tooth Relic had been taken to the mountains for security and one of the earliest tasks of the Agent of the British Government in the Kandyan Province was to arrange for the bringing back of the Relic with due ceremonyThe houses and streets of Kandy were decorated the surface of the streets whitened and the Relic was brought in a magnificent processionIn there was a rebellion in the Kandyan provinces and the Sacred Tooth Relic was taken away from Kandy and hidden in a forestAfter the suppression of the rebellion the British were able to find the Sacred Tooth Relic and bring it back to KandyThe Sacred Tooth Relic continued to be in the custody of the British Government till when by order of the Secretary of State for the Colonies the charge was given over to the Diyawadana Nilame and the chief monks of Malwatte and Asgiriya monasteries in KandyThe compilation of the Pali Atthakathaa by Buddhaghosa Thera is another important event in the annals of Sri Lanka which marks the progress of BuddhismAs has already been stated the Pitakas or the teachings of the Buddha which were being handed down orally were committed to writing in beand the commentaries on these composed in Sinhalese were also committed to writing at this timeSince this period much by way of exegetical works in Sinhalese was added from time to time and during the next five hundred years literary activity progressed considerablyBy about be when King Mahaanaama reigned at Anuraadhapura the fame of Buddhist literature in Sri Lanka was well recognized throughout India and tradition mentions Sinhalese Buddhist monks visiting India China and other countries and introducing the literature produced in Sri LankaMonks from India and China also visited Anuraadhapura during this time to procure Buddhist booksIt was about this time that Buddhaghosa Thera came to Sri Lanka in the reign of King MahaanaamaMahaanaama succeeded to the throne years after the death of King Sirimeghavanna during whose reign the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka and three rulers namely Jetthatissa II Buddhadaasa and Upatissa I reigned in betweenThe story of Buddhaghosa is given in detail both in the Mahaavamsa and the Sinhalese works composed in later timesAccording to these sources Buddhaghosa was a brahman youth who was born in the vicinity of Buddha Gayaa and became well known as an exponent of Veda and philosophyHe was such a proficient scholar that in his youth he was able to assert his knowledge among the great scholars of the timeHe traveled from place to place from one seat of learning to another from one set of teachers to another triumphantly asserting his knowledge and scholarshipAt a wellknown Buddhist monastery at Tamluk he met Revata Mahaathera one well versed in the doctrines and philosophy of BuddhismThere he entered into discussions and found not a peer but one superior to him in knowledge and understandingThis made him join the Order of Buddhist monks as a pupil of Revata MahaatheraAt this vihaara he studied Buddhist philosophy diligently and produced a treatise on Buddhism aanodaya he also planned to compose commentaries on the Abhidhamma and the suttasHis teacher at this stage advised him to go to Anuraadhapura before undertaking this work as he said that in Lanka were preserved not only the Tipitaka the teachings of the Buddha himself but also the Sinhalese commentaries and various expositions of the teachings which were very valuable and of high reputeBuddhaghosa Thera proceeded to Sri Lanka and stayed at the Mahaapadhaanaghara of the MahaavihaaraHe then asked the monks at Anuraadhapura for access to books for the compilation of commentariesThe learned theras at Anuraadhapura tested his knowledge and ability by setting him a thesis on which he compiled the wellknown VisuddhimaggaThey were so pleased with this work that he was given facilities for his projected work and books were placed at his disposal for the preparation of Pali commmentariesThe old Sinhalese commentaries from which Buddhaghosa drew material for the compilation of his Pali commentaries are occasionally named in his worksThe Mahaa Atthakathaa occupied the foremost position among them while the Mahaapaccari Atthakathaa and the Kurundi Atthakathaa were also importantThese three major works probably contained exegetical material on all the three PitakasApart from these there were other works like the Sankhepatthakathaa Vinayatthakathaa Abhidhammatthakathaa and separate commentaries on the four AAgamas or Nikaayas namely the Diigha Nikaaya Atthakathaa Majjhima Nikaaya Atthakathaa Samyutta Nikaaya Atthakathaa and the Anguttara Nikaaya AtthakathaaReferences to numerous other sources like the Andhakatthakathaa the aacariyaa and the Poraanaa are also found in Buddhaghosas worksUtilizing the copious material of these commentaries and other sources which sometimes contained conflicting views and contradictory assertions Buddhaghosa compiled his Pali commentaries including all authoritative decisions sometimes giving his own views but leaving out unnecessary details and repetitions as well as irrelevant matterThe first of such commentaries was the Samantapaasaadikaa on the Vinaya PitakaThe Kankhaavitaranii on the Paatimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka was compiled laterThese books were followed by the commentaries on the four Nikaayas the Sumangalavilaasinii on the Diigha Nikaaya the Papañcasuudanii on the Majjhima Nikaaya the Saaratthappakaasinii on the Samyutta Nikaaya and the Manorathapuuranii on the Anguttara NikaayaThe Dhammapadaññhakathaa on the Dhammapada the Jaatakaññhakathaa on the Jaataka and the Paramatthajotikaa on the Khuddaka Nikaaya are also ascribed to himOn the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka Buddhaghosa compiled the Aññhasaalinii on the Dhammasanganii the Sammohavinodanii on the Vibhanga and the Pañcappakaranaññhakathaa on the other five booksThe voluminous literature which Buddhaghosa produced exists to this day and is the basis for the explanation of many crucial points of Buddhist philosophy which without them would have been unintelligibleHis commentaries become all the more important since the old Sinhalese commentaries gradually went out of vogue and were completely lost after the tenth centuryBuddhaghosas activities gave an impetus to the learning of Pali in Sri Lanka which resulted in the production of many other Pali commentaries and other literary works and also established the preeminence of Sri Lanka as the home of Theravaada BuddhismSome time before and after the compilation of the Pali commentaries by Buddhaghosa two important literary works of a different type were produced in Sri LankaThey are the Diipavamsa and the Mahaavamsa described in the foregoing pages either as the Sri Lanka chronicles or the Pali chroniclesThese two works are the earliest extant literary records giving a continuous history of the activities of the kings of Sri Lanka from preBuddhistic times up to the end of the reign of King MahaasenaBoth works are composed in Pali metrical versesThe Diipavamsa is the earlier of these two chroniclesIt is not a compilation of one individual author but is the outcome of several previous works to which additions have been made from time to time taking its present form about the fourth century acThe chronicle does not name any author but it has been held by some scholars from the abundant material it contains about nuns that the Diipavamsa is a work compiled and continued by nuns from time to timeThe Diipavamsa consists of chaptersThey contain accounts of the three visits of the Buddha to Sri Lanka the ancestry of the Buddha the three Buddhist councils and the different Buddhist schools which arose after the Second Council the activities of King Asoka the colonization of Sri Lanka by Vijaya his successors the introduction of Buddhism in the reign of King Devaanampiya Tissa and the activities of his successors especially Dutthagaamani Vattagaamani and MahaasenaThe narrative ends with the reign of MahaasenaThe Diipavamsa has obtained its material from different sources of which the Sihala Mahaavamsatthakathaa was preeminentBesides this there were several other sources like the Uttaravihaara Mahaavamsa Vinayatthakathaa and the DipavamsatthakathaaBy these names were known the records collected and preserved in the Mahaavihaara and the other monasteriesThe Mahaavamsa which is the better work in its comprehensiveness arrangement of facts and high literary standard was compiled by a thera named Mahaanaama either in the late fifth century or the early sixth century acIt also covers the same period of history and its material is drawn from the same sources as the Diipavamsa but it contains much more additional material presented in a better formThe Mahaavamsa contains chapters in allThey deal mainly with the same events as those of the Diipavamsa but there are much longer accounts and greater details of the activities of several kings such as Pandukaabhaya and Dutthagaamani and events like the establishment of Buddhism and the rise of new schoolsThese two chronicles contain many myths and legendsYet they are among the primary sources for the reconstruction of the early history of Sri Lanka for they contain a great deal of historical facts especially in the narratives dealing with the period after the nd century BCE corroborated by epigraphical archaeological and other evidenceThe Mahaavamsa has been continued in later times at three stages giving a connected history of the island up to modern timesThis continuation of the chronicle which is in three parts is called the CuulavamsaThe first part brings the history down to the twelfth century the second part to the fourteenth century and the third part to modern timesThe political situation in Sri Lanka from about the middle of the fifth century acuntil the third quarter of the eleventh century acwas not favorable towards the progress of BuddhismThis period of Sri Lankan history is marked with continuous warfare between the reigning king and his rival claimants or the foreign invadersOften when the reigning king was defeated in battle he fled to India and came back with a Tamil troop to regain his lost throne and as a result the Tamils who thus settled down in Sri Lanka from time to time also became an important element even powerful enough to seize political power for themselvesSuch a political situation evidently did not give the rulers an opportunity to work for the religion and as a result the community and the monasteries were neglectedSome rulers like Aggabodhi III and Daathopatissa I even resorted to the evil practice of robbing monasteries of their gold images precious gems and other valuables which had accumulated there for centuries for the purpose of financing their military operations when the royal treasury had become emptyDaathopatissa I also removed the gold finial of the Thuupaaraama and the gemstudded umbrella of the cetiyaRelic chambers of stuupas were opened and valuable offerings were removedTheir Tamil soldiers were allowed to burn down monastic buildings like the Sacred Tooth Relic Temple and take away the valuablesThe Pandya and the Chola invaders from South India who also attacked Sri Lanka several times during this period ransacked the monasteries and carried away vast treasuresThese conditions necessarily worsened when Sri Lanka passed into the hands of the South Indian Cholas in and remained a part of the Chola empire untilAmidst this political unrest and the resultant religious decline several events important in the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka occurredIn the reign of Moggallaana I the Sacred Hair Relic of the Buddha was brought to Sri Lanka from India and the king placed it in a crystal casket in an image house and held a great festivalThe writing of the Mahaavamsa by a Mahaavihaara monk is ascribed to the reign of his successor Kumaara DhaatusenaIn the reign of Silaakaala the Mahaayaana book the Dharmadhaatu was brought to Sri Lanka and in the reign of Aggabodhi I the monk Jotipaala defeats the Vaitulyavaadins in a public controversyApart from these special events several rulers purified the Saasana and repaired the old and neglected monasteriesThey also encouraged the recital of DhammaIn the year Vijayabaahu I succeeded in defeating the Cholas and becoming the king of Sri LankaResiding at Polonnaruwa which he made the capital of his kingdom he turned his mind to the noble task of repairing the damage that had been inflicted upon the national religion by the invadersThe great religious edifices the pirivenas and the monasteries which were in utter destruction were restored and new ones were builtBut the greatest of his tasks was the restoration of ordination of monksWhen he found that the five ordained monks required to carry out an ordination ceremony could not be found in the whole island he sent an embassy to his friend and ally King Anuruddha of Burma soliciting his help in restoring the Saasana in Sri LankaKing Anuruddha sent a number of eminent theras who reestablished the Saasana in Sri Lanka and instructed a large number of monks in the three Pitakas and the commentariesThe king also brought about a reconciliation of the three Nikaayas of the Mahaavihaara Abhayagiri and Jetavana and restored their ancient monasteries to themThousands of laymen joined the OrderThe religious revival inaugurated by King Vijayabaahu led to a great intellectual reawakening and a large number of religious literary works in Pali and Sanskrit were writtenKing Vijayabaahu also encouraged learned men to come and settle down in Sri Lanka and also induced his courtiers to engage in literary pursuitsThese activities suffered temporarily with his death in but were revived after the accession of Paraakramabaahu the Great inKing Paraakramabaahu the Great ascended the throne after a great struggle with rival claimants and even after his accession he had to suppress many rebellionsBeing a great leader of men he was able to restore order and even carry his prowess as a conqueror to foreign lands including South India and BurmaHe rebuilt the city of PolonnaruwaKing Paraakramabaahu also undertook the restoration of the ancient capital city of Anuraadhapura which had been neglected and abandoned after the Cholas had captured and devastated it about a century and a half earlierThe four great thuupas were overgrown with trees and bears and panthers dwelt thereThe king restored all the important monuments at Anuraadhapura and the entire Mihintale monasteryBut the most important task which the king performed for the establishment of the Saasana was its purification and the unification of the SanghaIn spite of the activities of King Vijayabaahu I there were by this time members of Sangha who were unfit to lead the monastic lifeSome of the monks are said to have even supported wives and childrenWith a learned thera named Mahaa Kassapa of Udumbaragiri Vihaara at its head the king convened a Council of the leading monks of the dissentient schools and was convinced that the teachings of the Mahaavihaara were correct and their claims were in keeping with the DhammaConsequently with great care and patience the king made investigations into the members of the schismatic schoolsMany of the unworthy monks were persuaded to leave the Order and those who were not open to persuasion were expelledSome monks were made to return to the status of novicesAfter that the three fraternities of the Mahaavihaara the Abhayagirivihaara and the Jetavanavihaara remained unitedSubsequent to this purification of the Sangha the king with the assistance of the leading monks proclaimed a code of regulations for the guidance of the bhikkhusAfter the proclamation of that code the internal discipline of the Sangha was in the hands of the monks themselves and the king acted only when a necessity aroseThe code of regulations enforced by King Paraakramabaahu became a royal proclamationIt gave directions for the proper observance of the Vinaya rules and dealt with the procedure that should be followed by his subjects who had become or who wished to become lay pupils novices and subsequently ordained monksThe king also caused this proclamation to be engraved on the rock surface of the Uttaraaraama presently known as Galvihaara which exists to this dayIt is now known as Polonnarukatikaavata or the ParaakramabaahukatikaavataThe great interest taken by the king in the affairs of the religion coupled with internal peace and prosperity brought about a revival of Buddhist learning which created a rich literature during this periodIt has been mentioned earlier that Buddhaghosa Thera compiled the Pali commentaries to many of the texts of the Tipitaka in the early part of the fifth centuryBuddhaghosa was however not able to compile commentaries to all the books of the Tipitaka due perhaps to the fact that the illness of his teacher Revata in India caused him to leave Sri Lanka before he finished the entire workFortunately there were several other scholars who took up the work left undone by Buddhaghosa and in the succeeding years they compiled commentaries to the rest of the texts of the Pali CanonThus the commentator Dhammapaala Thera compiled the commentaries to the Udaana Itivuttaka Vimaanavatthu Petavatthu Theragaathaa Theriigaathaa and Cariyaapitaka of the Khuddaka Nikaaya all these commentaries are known by the name Paramatthadiipanii Upasena Thera compiled the Saddhammappajjotikaa on the NiddesaMahaanama Thera compiled the Saddhammappakaasinii on the Patisambhidaamagga and Buddhadatta Thera compiled the Madhuratthavilaasinii on the BuddhavamsaThe author of the Visuddhajanavilaasinii which is the commentary on the Apadaana is not knownOf these commentators Buddhadatta was a contemporary of Buddhaghosa Upasena and Mahaanaama flourished about the latter part of the sixth century and Dhammapaala about the latter part of the tenth centuryThe political disturbances from the time of King Dhaatusena until the reign of Vijayabaahu I greatly hampered literary activities and as a result only a few religious works were composed during this periodAbout the end of the tenth century a thera named Khema wrote an expository work on the Abhidhamma called the ParamatthadiipaniiTo the same period belongs also the Pali Mahaabodhivamsa which gives primarily the history of the Sacred Bodhi Tree at Anuraadhapura and the ceremonies connected with itA poem entitled Anaagatavamsa on the future Buddha Metteyya is also ascribed to this periodTo the tenth or the early part of the eleventh century belongs a Pali poem of stanzas called the Telakañaahagaathaa in the form of religious exhortations of a great elder named Kalyaaniya Thera who was condemned to be cast into a cauldron of boiling oilKing Vijayabaahu I in whose reign occurred a great intellectual reawakening was himself a great patron of literature and a scholar of high reputeMany Sinhalese works including a Sinhalese translation of the Dhammasanganii are attributed to him but not one of them exists todayAbout this time a monk named Anuruddha composed the Anuruddhasataka the Abhidhammatthasangaha the Naamaruupapariccheda and the ParamatthavinicchayaThe first is a Buddhist devotional poem of stanzas in elegant SanskritThe second work is a compendium on the teachings of the Abhidhamma and is held in high esteem by all Buddhists of the southern schoolThe third and fourth are two short works in verse on the Abhidhamma giving the reader a general idea of the subjects dealt with in the Abhidhamma PitakaThe reign of King Paraakramabaahu the Great ushered in another great epoch of literary activityThree great scholarly monks flourished in his reign namely Mahaa Kassapa of Dimbulaagala Vihaara Moggallaana Thera and Saariputta TheraMahaa Kassapa was the author of a Sinhalese paraphrase to the Samantapaasaadikaa which is now lostHe is also reputed to have written a subcommentary to the AbhidhammatthasangahaIt is probable that he was also the author of several other works such as the Mohavicchedanii which is a treatise on the Abhidhamma and Vimativinodanii which is a commentary on the VinayaMoggallaana a contemporary of Mahaa Kassapa was the author of the Pali grammar Moggallaana VyaakaranaHe is also credited with the authorship of the Abhidhaanappadiipikaa which is the only ancient Pali dictionary in Sri LankaSaariputta was the most prominent scholar of the reign of Paraakramabaahu the GreatA clever Sanskrit scholar as he was Saariputta compiled two works on Sanskrit grammarAnother work by him the Vinayasangaha was a summary of the Vinaya PitakaThis work was known by several titles and was widely known in BurmaOn this work Saariputta himself wrote a subcommentary and a Sinhalese paraphraseThe most comprehensive and therefore important work of Saariputta is the masterly subcommentary called the Saaratthadiipanii which he composed on Buddhaghosas commentary on the Vinaya the SamantapaasaadikaaThe immense and valuable information it contains shows that his knowledge was extensive and profound even as that of the great commentator BuddhaghosaHe further wrote a Sinhalese paraphrase to the Abhidhammatthasangaha of Anuruddha Thera and this paraphrase is still held in high esteem by modern scholarsSaariputta is also credited with the authorship of two other ñiikaas the Saratthamañjuusaa on the Manorathapuuranii and the Liinatthappakaasinii on the Papañcasuudanii which are commentaries on the Anguttara and Majjhima Nikaayas respectively by BuddhaghosaTo this period also belong the ñiikaas on the other three Nikaayas of the Sutta Pitaka collectively known as the SaratthamañjuusaañiikaaIt should be mentioned here that the ñiikaas named above formed one of the major groups of Pali literature compiled during this periodAs described in the Saddhammasangaha a Pali work of the th century Mahaa Kassapa and a large congregation of monks who assembled at the Jetavana Vihaara at Polonnaruwa decided to compose exegetical commentaries since the existing subcommentaries on the old Atthakathaas were unintelligibleActing on this decision they compiled ñiikaas namely the Saaratthadiipanii on the Vinaya Pitaka the Saratthamañjuusaa in four parts on the first four Nikaayas of the Sutta Pitaka and the Paramatthadiipanii in three parts on the Abhidhamma PitakaThese ñiikaas or subcommentaries were works containing expositions of points in the Atthakathaas compiled by Buddhaghosa and other commentators which needed further elucidation for their correct interpretationThere were ñiikaas compiled from time to time subsequent to the compilation of the commentaries and what the council headed by Mahaa Kassapa performed was the bringing of these various ñiikaas together and making a synthetic summary of themThough the Saddhammasangaha does not give any prominence to the part played by Saariputta at this council it is well known that several ñiikaas were compiled either by him or under his supervisionSeveral religious works written in Sinhalese also belong to this periodThe Sinhalese exegetical works on which the Pali commentaries were based were preserved in the Mahaavihaara as late as the tenth centuryLikewise there were the collections of Jaataka stories and the stories connected with the verses of the Dhammapada in the Sinhalese languageA collection of stories from which the Pali Rasavaahinii drew material and a work called the Siihalaññhakathaa Mahaavamsa on which the Pali chronicles were based also existed in SinhaleseNone of these works is now extantSeveral Sinhalese religioliterary works which were composed in or about the twelfth century are popular even todayAmong them are the Sasadaavata which is a poem on the Sasa Jaataka the Muvadevdaavata which is a poem on the Makhaadeva Jaataka and the Kavsilumina which is a poem on Kusa JaatakaGurulugomis Amaavatura and Dharmapradiipikaava and Vidyaacakravartis Butsarana are also generally ascribed to the twelfth centuryAfter the death of Paraakramabaahu the Great there was much internal disturbance in the country caused by rival claimants to the throne and invasions by foreignersAs a result Buddhism was on the decline againParaakramabaahus immediate successor Vijayabaahu II promoted trade and religious relations between Burma and Sri Lanka but was slain after a years rule by a usurperThe usurper was however slain five days later by Nissankamalla who thereafter reigned for nine yearsNissankamalla was a great benefactor of BuddhismHe built several notable religious edifices in Polonnaruwa his capitalSome of these like the Ruvanvelidaagaba the beautiful Vatadaage the Sacred Tooth Relic Temple and the Nissankalataamandapa exist to this dayHe made occasional tours in his kingdom visiting places of religious significance like the Sumanakuuta and the DambuluvihaaraHe built almshouses at several important places and purified the Saasana by expelling corrupt bhikkhus from the OrderThe period of two decades that followed the death of King Nissankamalla was one of the most disturbed periods in Sri Lanka during which time occurred several assassinations of rulers and invasions by foreignersIn a foreigner named Megha invaded defeated the Sinhalese ruler and reigned for yearsHis reign was one of the most disastrous for Buddhism for he plundered the monasteries and made them over to his soldiers to dwell inThe people were persecuted by torture and were forced to adopt a different faithHe also destroyed libraries containing many valuable booksThe situation was temporarily saved by Paraakramabaahu II who ruled from Dambadeniya from while Maagha was still dominating north LankaParaakramabaahu II who was a ruler of great learning earned for himself the title Kalikaala Sahitya Sarvajña PanditaHe made efforts to restore the Saasana by bringing over monks from the Chola country in South India and holding a festival to admit monks to the higher ordinationHe established several monasteries and pirivenas and encouraged learningThe king also held a great council of monks under the leadership of the great thera Aranyaka Medhankara and purified the SaasanaSubsequently like Paraakramabaahu I he formulated rules for the proper conduct of the monks the code of these rules being known by the name Dambadeni KatikaavataAt Palaabatgala he constructed a great monastery for the hermitmonks who were full of virtue and were able to undergo strict austeritiesTwo succeeding kings Vijayabaahu IV and Paraakramabaahu III took much interest in maintaining Buddhism and consolidating the efforts of their predecessorThe religious revival brought about by Paraakramabaahu II continued until about the fifteenth century though there was not much political stability in the country during that periodThe outstanding feature of the period is the compilation of a large number of religioliterary worksParaakramabaahu II himself obtained teachers from India to teach Lankan monksHe persuaded his younger brother Bhuvanekabaahu to become a scholar and be a teacher to many thousands of eldersThe kings minister Devapatiraaja was a great patron of learningTo Paraakramabaahu II is ascribed the authorship of the Sinhalese translations to the Visuddhimagga and the Vinaya Vinicchaya the Sinhalese poem Kavsilumina the masterpiece of Sinhalese poetry based on the Kusa Jaataka and the Sinhalese prose work DaladaasiritaIn the reign of Paraakramabaahu II lived the thera Dharmakirti who was the author of the Pali poem Daathaavamsa and the first part of the CuutavamsaThe Thuupavamsa on the erection of stuupas in Lanka the Hatthavanagallavihaaravamsa on the history of the ancient vihaara at Attanagalla the Rasavaahinii which is a collection of stories about ancient India and Sri Lanka the Samantakuutavannanaa on the Buddhas visit to Sumanakuuta the Kesadhaatuvamsa on the history of the hairrelics of the Buddha the Paaramimahaasataka on the ten perfections the SaddhammaSangha which gives an account of the history and development of Buddhism in Lanka are several of the religious works of merit composed in Pali from the time of Paraakramabaahu II until the fifteenth centuryA large number of Sinhalese works on religious subjects too belongs to this periodThe Saddharmaratnaavalii which narrates the stories of the Pali Dhammapadatthakathaa in Sinhalese the Puujavalii which relates the honor and offerings received by the Buddha the Pansiyapanasjaataka based on the Pali Jaataka commentary the Sinhala Bodhivamsa on the history of the Bodhi Tree the EluAttanagaluvamsa which is a translation of the Pali work the Saddharmaalankaara based on the Pali Rasavaahinii the Guttilakaavyaya based on the Guttila Jaataka the Kaavyasekharaya based on the Sattubhatta Jaataka the Budugunaalankaaraya which narrates the dispelling of the calamity in Vesaali by the Buddha and the Lovedasangaraava containing religious instructions for the laity are the standard works among themAs a result of this religious revival the reputation of the Sangha in Sri Lanka became so well established that in the year King Dhammaceti of Burma decided to send twentytwo selected bhikkhus to Lanka to obtain ordination and bring back to Burma the traditions of LankaHe sent these bhikkhus with numerous presents in charge of two ministers Citraduuta and RaamaduutaThey came in two shipsThe first ship with eleven bhikkhus and their attendants in charge of the minister Citraduuta arrived in Colombo and the other ship in charge of Raamaduuta with eleven bhikkhus and attendants arrived at Weligama on the southern coast of LankaThese deputations were received with due ceremony and given a cordial reception by King Buvanekabaahu VI who reigned at Kotte six miles from ColomboThe king of Burma sent the following message to the chief theras of Lanka My Lords I am sending many articles to be offered to the Sacred Tooth Relic etcand I request you to make an endeavor to offer these to the Sacred Tooth RelicMay the noble ones obtain facilities for the twentytwo bhikkhus and their pupils and the two ministers Citraduuta and Raamaduuta who are attending on these bhikkhus to assist them in worshiping honoring and viewing the Sacred Tooth Relic if they are so fortunate as to get an opportunity to do so after which may the Noble Ones be pleased with their endeavor to enable the twentytwo bhikkhus and their pupils to be ordained in the community of succession from Mahaavihaara fraternity founded by the great thera Mahinda by selecting such bhikkhus who hold an established high reputation and giving the ordination of Upasampadaa in the Siimaa in the river Kalyaani which has been made sacred by its association with our Great LordThe request made by the king of Burma was duly granted the bhikkhus were ordained in the Siimaa in the Kalyaani RiverThe minister Raamaduuta with twenty bhikkhus and thirtythree pupils duly ordained returned to BurmaThe other minister Citraduuta and his party of bhikkhus were shipwrecked and six of these bhikkhus met with their deathThe remaining ones reached their countryIn Burma King Dhammaceti built an ordination hall known as Kalyaani Siimaa and the bhikkhus ordained there went by the name of KalyaanivamsaAt a later period ordination of this Nikaaya was carried to Siam from BurmaThe connection with Burma at this period has an important bearing on the fortunes of Buddhism in Sri Lanka for through these embassies the books that existed in Lanka were taken to Burma Siam and Cambodia and the Mahaavihaara Nikaaya was established in these countriesThis helped Lanka to reobtain the books and the ordination at a subsequent period when ordination had disappeared in the island and the books were lostThe political stability that was maintained by Paraakramabaahu II and his successors until about the fifteenth century began to weaken by the end of that centuryAt this time the Sinhalese king who ruled at Kotte was the head of a very small territoryThe interior regions of the country were in the hands of several petty chiefs who did not care about the religion or the welfare of the peopleThe Moors on the other hand controlled the trade of the coastal regionsEconomically too the country had sunk to such a very low level that by this time Sri Lanka had become dependent on India even for foodSuch was the condition when the Portuguese who were engaged in discoveries and conquests in the East and were in pursuit of Eastern trade landed in Lanka in when Vira Paraakramabaahu VIII was ruling at KotteThe Portuguese promised him military aid against his rivals and great riches from the trade which they proposed to establishThey then gained a foothold in Lanka by erecting a fortress on the rocky beach in Colombo and establishing many trading settlementsBefore long the entire coastal region passed into the hands of the Portuguese and the kings of Kotte were entirely at the mercy of their alliesThey even made several assaults on the interior of the country in order to become masters of the whole islandThe Portuguese arrived in Colombo in and gradually occupying all maritime provinces remained in their possession up toThe Lanka chronicles as well as the records of their friendly historians describe them as cruel inhuman rapacious bigoted and savage persecutors of Buddhism in their endeavor to impose their own faith  Roman Catholicism  on the people of Sri LankaA few decades after the arrival of the Portuguese King Bhuvanekabaahu VI who ruled at Kotte sought the assistance of his allies the Portuguese to ensure the succession of his grandson Dharmapaala to the throneFor this purpose an ivory image of Dharmapaala was sent to Portugal where a coronation of the effigy was held by the Portuguese emperorWhen the Sinhalese ambassadors returned they were accompanied by a party of Franciscans who under the direction of the Portuguese emperor and with the permission of the king of Kotte preached the Christian Gospel in LankaThus for the first time Christian communities were organized in the maritime provinces of LankaDharmapaala who had become a baptized Christian under the name of Don Juan Dharmapaala as an expression of thankfulness to the Portuguese gave them a deed of gift after his accession transferring to them the Daladaa Maaligaawa the temple at Kelaniya and all the temple revenues in the island for the maintenance of the missionary establishmentsThus there was the necessary assistance given to the Portuguese by the rulers of Kotte to suppress the national religion of the Sinhalese and propagate their own religion  CatholicismWith this support they set about their taskIn their conversions they adopted two distinct methods namely inducement by offices and other temporal favors and brutal punishment where inducement failedPeople who wished to obtain high offices under them and who wished to earn the goodwill of those in power readily adopted the new faith and took up new Biblical namesOthers who hesitated to give up their national faith and showed resistance were brutally punishedThere are lurid accounts of men thrown into rivers to be eaten by crocodiles babies spitted on the soldiers pikes and held up before the parents or crushed between millstones before the eyes of their mothers who later were to be tortured to deathThose who dared to worship in public or wear the yellow robe were put to deathBuddhist monasteries and institutions were destroyed and their treasures lootedLibraries were set on fireThus did the period of Portuguese rule become one of the darkest periods of Buddhism in Sri LankaThe Portuguese were not the only enemies of Buddhism at this periodKing Raajasinha I who was the son of Mayaadunne a brother of Bhuvenekabaahu VI ruled from Sitawaka when the Portuguese were holding power at KotteA gallant leader as he was Raajasinha succeeded in gaining the confidence of the Sinhalese who opposed the Portuguese rule and winning several battles against the Portuguese the battle at Mulleriyaawa being the most famousBut as the chronicles mention his popularity was shortlivedThe foolish king in his thirst for power slew his old father with his own handsLater being seized with the fear of his crime Raajasinha sought the advice of the monks for setting himself free from the sinWhen the monks explained to him that it was too great a crime to be absolved the king was provoked to angerHe then became a follower of the Saivites in whose advice he took refuge and became an enemy of BuddhismThe chief Buddhist elder was stoned to death and many other monks were buried neckdeep in the earth and their heads plowed offSome others were put to the swordThe sacred edifices and the monasteries were pulled down and the sacred books were reduced to ashesThe lands which had been endowed in earlier times to the monastic establishments were taken away and Sri Paada the Sacred Footprint of the Buddha on Adams Peak was handed over to the SaivitesThose monks who managed to escape from the kings wrath disrobed themselves and fledIn the year in which Raajasinha died a Sinhalese ruler Vimala Dharmasuriya I ascended the throne of the hill capital Kandy and ruled for twelve yearsThough he had been educated by the Portuguese and was originally favored by them the king soon after his accession turned against them out of his love for the country and the religionVimala Dharmasuriya I was a great patron of Buddhism of that timeAfter his wars with the Portuguese he set his heart on repairing the damage done by RaajasinhaSeveral Buddhist monuments were restoredFinding that there was hardly a single monk left in the country who was properly ordained Vimala Dharmasuriya sent an embassy to the country of Arakan to obtain monks to restore ordination in Sri LankaThe mission was successful several monks led by the elders Nandicakka and Candavisaala came to Kandy and in the year an ordination ceremony was held in the Udakukkhepa Siimaa at Getambe near Kandy many men of noble families entering the Order on this occasionThe king also built a storeyed pavilion and bringing back the Sacred Tooth Relic from the Delgamuvihaara where it was hidden deposited it in the pavilionThe control of Sri Paada was taken from the Saivites and handed over to the Buddhist monksVimala Dharmasuriya was succeeded on the throne of Kandy by Senarat a man zealous in religious worksIn his reign the Portuguese invaded Kandy and the king carried away the Sacred Tooth Relic to Mahiyangana for safetySenarats son and successor Raajasinha II was a great warrior but was not zealousIn his reign ended the Portuguese rule in the maritime provinces of Lanka a feat which the king accomplished with the aid of the Dutch in JuneIt was as early as that the Dutch visited the court of Kandy in the reign of Vimala Dharmasuriya I seeking an allianceIn a treaty was agreed upon between the Dutch and King Senarat the then king of Kandy and in accordance with this agreement in Raajasinha II sought Dutch assistance against the PortugueseFrom that time the two European nations fought each other until in the Portuguese were expelled from the country and the Dutch came to occupy those regions which formerly were occupied by the PortugueseThey remained in possession until in which year they were ousted by the BritishThe Dutch whose religion was Protestant Christianity followed a policy which was in marked contrast to that of the PortugueseExtension of commerce was their main concern and since peace was essential to achieve this end they even endured with subdued humbleness and patience whatever insult and provocation came from the SinhaleseThey even assisted the Sinhalese in two embassies to Siam which were sent to obtain monks to establish higher ordination in Sri LankaThe Dutch however had an established system of education throughout their territoriesThe school building was both church and school the schoolmaster was both teacher and representative of the religionServices were held regularly at these places births and marriages were registered according to Christian ritesWhen the agent of the Church was so disposed he was able to get those who did not attend church punished for the alleged offenseAll civil rights and inheritance depended on a persons church affiliationNo person who was not a Christian could hold even a minor office under government no person who was not a Christian could get married legally or register the birth of a childThere was however one redeeming feature of this systemThe organization was so extensive that they had to employ Sinhalese as their teachers and agents of religionThe vast majority of these Protestant agents were at heart Buddhists they were Christians only in the sense of their officeThe people themselves followed this plan they were Buddhists inwardly but were officially Christians for the purpose of registering their marriages the births of their children for holding office etcThus the efforts of the Dutch in the propagation of their religion did not affect Buddhism muchOn the other hand the Portuguese where they had priests and where they had established churches under the direct control of these priests were able to look after the congregations and gradually established their religion in such centersMost of them were zealous and earnest in their duties and took a genuine interest in the welfare of their flocksWhen the Dutch were occupying the maritime provinces several Sinhalese rulers of the Kandyan kingdom made attempts to restore BuddhismOne of them was Vimala Dharmasuriya II son and successor of Raajasinha He constructed a threestoreyed pavilion for the Sacred Tooth RelicThe king also made a pilgrimage to Sumanakuuta on footSeeing that the state of the Order of monks was unsatisfactory again to such an extent that not more than five ordained monks were found in the whole country the king sent an embassy to Arakan and obtained monks for an ordination ceremonyWith the help of these monks an ordination ceremony was held at Getambe at the place where a similar ceremony had been held formerly in the reign of Vimala Dharmasuriya At this ceremony thirtythree novices were given higher ordination and another one hundred and twenty persons were admitted to the OrderVimala Dharmasuriya II was succeeded by his son Sri Viraparaakrama Narendrasinha a just ruler mindful of the welfare of the religionHe constructed a twostoreyed building for the Sacred Tooth Relic provided the monks with their requisites and induced several members of the laity to enter the OrderHowever during his reign many a monk had resorted to scandalous practicesHis successor Sri Vijaya Raajasinha also a pious ruler induced many a young person to join the Order and also held several religious festivalsHe spent money on getting religious books written caused preaching halls to be constructed at several places and took measures to educate the people in the doctrineDiscovering that the Order of the Sangha was almost extinct in the island he sent two missions to Siam with the help of the Dutch who lent a ship for the voyageThe first expedition proved disastrous due to shipwreck and before the second mission returned the king diedThus his attempt to restore higher ordination failedSri Vijaya Raajasinha was succeeded by King Kirti Sri Raajasinha whose reign proved to be one of the most inspiring periods for Buddhism in that centuryAt the time of his accession the Order of monks had sunk to very low levels of degeneracyThere was not a single monk in the whole island who had received the higher ordinationThere were plenty of novices but apart from a few skillful and pious ones among them the majority were leading a life unbecoming to monksThey set aside the study of Dhamma and Vinaya and resorted to the study of astrology medicine and devil worship led scandalous lives and engaged in cultivation of land and in tradeThe older saamaneras ordained only the sons of their relatives so that they could obtain the immense wealth which the generations of kings and ministers had dedicated to the service of the OrderKirti Sri Raajasinha was determined to set right this state of affairsWith the aid of the Dutch who gave a vessel for the voyage the king sent an embassy to King Dhammika of Siam and reestablished the higher ordination in Sri LankaSeveral hundreds were ordained and education was fosteredThe king also proclaimed a code of conduct for the guidance of the monksIn all these religious activities of King Kirti Sri Raajasinha he was inspired and guided by a great personality a saamanera who was distinguished for his piety enthusiasm learning and determinationHe was Velivita Pindapaatika Sri SaranankaraBorn in at Velivita a village near Kandy he became a novice at the age of sixteen as a pupil of an elder saamanera called SuuriyagodaWith great effort and devotion he studied the Pali language and the doctrine for which purpose he traveled from place to place in search of books and tutorsLater he went about preaching the Dhamma thus encouraging others to rise up for the welfare of the religionThese activities of Saranankara Saamanera soon made him popular as a teacher of great renown who devoted his life to his own welfare and that of others a poet preacher and controversialistApart from his skill as a scholar he was also known for his austere practicesWhen he went round the country learning or preaching he depended for his sustenance on the ancient practice of a bhikkhu called pinnapaata gathering his food from house to house in his almsbowlFor this he became known as Pindapaatika SaranankaraWhen King Vimala Dharmasuriya II reigned he was a saamanera but his sincere devotion had pleased the king so much that he made a gilt casket set with seven hundred gems and presented it to Saranankara Saamanera with many booksThis king also provided the monk with the requisites and induced him to write several literary worksWhen King Sri Vijaya Raajasinha came to the throne it was at the request of Saranankara Saamanera that the king sent two embassies to SiamIn the reign of King Kirti Sri Raajasinha Saranankara Saamanera offered his fullest cooperation in his activities in the revival of Buddhism and the king depended upon the saamanera for guidance advice and inspirationHe urged the king to send the embassy to Siam and himself wrote the messages that were taken to the Siamese king and the Sangharaaja of that countryThe kings ministers who constituted the embassy were chosen on his advice and this mission was successful mainly due to his exertionsAfter the return of the embassy Saranankara Saamanera was given higher ordination and was appointed Sangharaaja of Sri Lanka the highest office conferred on a monkThe activities of Saranankara Thera not only restored the higher ordination and the purity of the Sangha but also brought about a literary revival as a result of the impetus given by him to the study of the Pali language and the Buddhas teachingsSaranankara Thera himself compiled several important religious works such as the Munigunaalankaara a Sinhalese poem in praise of the Buddha the Saaraartha Sangraha a treatise on various doctrinal teachings in BuddhismAbhisambodhialankaara a Pali poem in a hundred stanzas on the life of the Buddha from the time of Dipankara up to his enlightenment the Madhuraartha Prakaasanii which is a Sinhalese commentarial paraphrase to the Pali Mahaabodhivamsa and the Ruupamaalaa a work on Pali grammarSeveral others who were pupils of Saranankara Thera also composed many literary worksThe great monk died in acat the age ofThe successors of Sri Saranankara Thera are known as belonging to the Syaamopaali Nikaaya now popularly called the Siyam NikaayaOnly those who belonged to what was regarded as the highest caste could obtain higher ordination in that NikaayaIn the year a saamanera named Ambagahapitiya aanavimalatissa who did not belong to that caste went to Amarapura in Burma to obtain higher ordination and on his return he established the Amarapura Nikaaya inSubsequently in Ambagahawatte Sri Saranankara Thera established the Raamañña NikaayaThese three Nikaayas exist up to this day with no doctrinal differences between themKing Kirti Sri Raajasinha whose reign as was seen above was one of the most fruitful for the cause of Buddhism was succeeded by his brother Raajaadhi RaajasinhaA scholar of Pali Sanskrit and Sinhalese as he was the king himself composed the beautiful Sinhalese poem Asadisadaakava and worked for the religion by taking necessary steps to preserve the purity of the SaasanaHis nephew Sri Vikrama Raajasinha was the next and last king of LankaThis ruler who was in constant fear of the intrigues of his Adigar Pilima Talawe and his allies had recourse to intoxicating drinks hoping thus to forget his sorrows and tortured all his enemies with appalling crueltyThere was general unrest in the kingdom and these conditions were evidently not conducive to the progress of BuddhismIt was in during the reign of Raajaadhi Raajasinha that the Dutch who were defeated in battle surrendered their territories to the British colony and Sir Frederick North was sent as the first British governorBefore long North realized that the opportunity would come soon for them to possess the whole island for Pilima Talawe the Adigar of King Sri Vikrama Raajasinha of Kandy disclosed his plans to ruin the king to the British governor himselfHowever this plan of Pilima Talawe was revealed to the king and the Adigar was beheaded inEhelepola who became the next Adigar was detected in an attempt to organize a general rebellion against the king and as punishment the king tortured his wife and children cruellySubsequently the king punished all whom he suspected and as a result unrest and disorder became the order of the dayIn these circumstances Ehelepola appealed to the British for helpIn January a British army marched to the capital city of Kandy and took the Sinhalese king captiveOn the nd of March at a solemn assembly of the Kandyan chiefs and the monks the king was deposed and his dominions were vested in the British CrownThus ended the glamour of the Kingdom of Kandy which had withstood the invasions and attacks of the Portuguese and the Dutch and for some time the EnglishThus ended too the line of the Buddhist kings of Lanka who for years from the accession of Vijaya in BCE brought glory and fame to their country and religionIt was seen in the previous chapter how the British occupied the lowcountry of Lanka in and the Kandyan territories inThese territories remained in their hands until in which year Sri Lanka regained her independenceMention has already been made of the solemn assembly of the nd of March held in KandyAt this assembly a treaty was signed between the British rulers and the Kandyan chiefs by which the chiefs handed over the country to the British and the British promised to safeguard Buddhism declaring its rites and ceremonies sacred and inviolateThe inclusion of this clause referring to Buddhism in the very treaty by which the chiefs handed over the country to the British is very significantOn the one hand it indicates how concerned the Sinhalese leaders were about the future of Buddhism even in the hour of their misfortuneOn the other hand the British had obviously considered that its omission would bring disastrous resultsHowever the British attitude towards Buddhism soon caused dissatisfaction among the Sinhalese chiefsThe chiefs and the Buddhist monks realized that the British had no desire to respect the clause of the treaty relating to Buddhism and that they were keen to convert the people to their own faithDuring the early years after the signing of the treaty the British governor took part in the annual ceremonies connected with the Sacred Tooth Relic and appointed the chief theras as had been done by the Sinhalese kings in former timesThis created resentment on the part of the Christian missionaries in Sri Lanka and the Christian authorities in England and soon both practices were dropped severing whatever connection they had with BuddhismFrom the bhikkhus were required to elect and appoint their own chiefs and in the British government handed over the Tooth Relic from their custody to the Diyawadana Nilame and the chief monks of the Malwatte and the Asgiriya monasteriesWhile thus violating the treaty of the British rulers even prohibited the Buddhists from enjoying some of the privileges that were granted to the followers of the Christian faithThus for instance even as late as no child could be legally registered without previous baptism by a Christian minister and the clergy did not solemnize the marriage of unbaptized individualsFurther only those who adopted the Christian faith were favored with government employmentThis attitude of the British made vast numbers of Buddhists adopt the new faith without any understanding of its teachingsThese people saw in Christianity not only happiness in the world which is to come but what was more important to them the promise of this life as wellSome of the British governors in their attempt to disrupt the Buddhist organization even tried to bring about disunity between the monks and the laity and also to win over some of the leading Buddhist monks to their sideFor they realized that the monks were the main obstacle to their conversions and that as long as the monks and the laity remained united their attempts would not meet with great successLastly the British rulers gave all possible support to the Christian missionaries to carry out their educational and missionary activitiesHow these missionary bodies attempted the Christianization of Lanka will be discussed in the next chapterFrom the beginning of the period of British rule several Christian missionary bodies engaged themselves actively in missionary activities in Sri LankaThe Baptists had already started their activities inThey were followed by the Wesleyan Methodists in the Americans in and the Church of England inThese missionary bodies received every encouragement and assistance from the governmentThe establishment of missionary schools in various parts of the island was one of the principal undertakings of these missionary bodiesThese schools were manned and managed by the missionary societies with the assistance of the British government and were partly financed by public fundsThe schools attracted large numbers of Buddhist children because they were the centers where young men were trained for high government officesHitherto the temple had been the village school and the monks were the instructors of the village children in secular learning as well as in spiritual wisdomBut under the British government temple education could not provide the learning necessary for government employmentThus the Buddhist parents who wished to see their children in high government offices willingly sent them to the new missionary schoolsIn these schools the children were molded according to the requirements of the missionary bodiesThe authorities did not insist that one should become a Christian before admission but each student was required to learn the Christian religion and to participate in the morning and evening religious services in the schoolThey had no opportunity of participating in their own religious observancesAlmost every school had its own churchThe lessons imparted to these children were arranged with a view to undermining their Buddhist religionThe teaching of the Buddha was criticized and condemned and the Buddhist practices were ridiculedBuddhism was held up as a religion of the vulgar masses as opposed to the Christianity of civilized peopleThis disparagement in course of time naturally had its expected resultPeople gradually began to give up their national faith for the new faith which they were trained to think of as more refined and culturedIt now became the fashion to adopt the Christian faith and Christian names and customsEven those who did not embrace Christianity became indifferent to their own religionWhen they grew up they did not even mind their conversion to any religionThe missionaries also did not neglect the education of the girlsConvents were opened up with boarding facilities and in them the girls were brought up and educated with the utmost care until they were married in due time with the sanction of the Christian guardiansThe following table enumerating the assisted schools in Sri Lanka in belonging to the different denominations shows the extent of missionary activities in Lanka in the sphere of educationNUMBER OF ASSISTED SCHOOLS IN Apart from the Christianization carried out through schools these missionary bodies sought conversion by distributing books and pamphlets which criticized and ridiculed the Buddhist religion and sang the praises of ChristianityFor this purpose the missionaries themselves studied the doctrines of Buddhism and the Buddhist literature and also the Sinhalese language thus enabling them to write tracts in Sinhalese attacking the Buddhist religion and extolling the virtues of ChristianityChristian preachers went about from village to village distributing these books and pamphlets and denouncing Buddhism and exhibiting the supremacy and the divine origin of ChristianityWhen the Christian missionaries were thus active in towns and villages propagating their gospel and converting the Buddhists to their faith the Buddhist monks were not able enough to offer much resistanceWhen the villagers assembled in the temple on Poya days they attempted to refute the arguments of the Christian preachers in the course of their sermons but this method was not very effectiveIt was at this time about that a young Buddhist saamanera named Mohottiwatte Gunaananda appeared on the scene and challenged the Christian missionaries to meet him in opendebateThis young novice had obtained his early education in Christian schools and had thus studied the Christian scriptures and was also well versed in the Buddhas teachingsHe went from village to village making public speeches and held meetings in several Christian strongholds often challenging the Christian clergy to face him in open debateSoon he earned a great reputation for his eloquence and people flocked in thousands to hear himThe Christian clergy at first took no notice of the challenge of this monk but later quite confident of their success they accepted the challengeThis resulted in three public controversies one at Udanvita in another at Gampola in and the last at Panadura inThe Panadura controversy which lasted for a week was the most important of them allIt was the culmination of his efforts and it led to a Buddhist reawakeningThe controversy was to take place in the presence of leading Sinhalese Christians and BuddhistsRules were laid down so that the meeting could be held in a fair mannerThe leading English newspaper of the time The Ceylon Times sent a special representative to report the proceedingsA complete report of all the speeches corrected by the speakers themselves was published in English day by dayThe controversy ended with victory for the BuddhistsThe Buddhist orator not only replied effectively to the fallacies of the Christian speakers but also enlightened them on the principles and tenets of the Buddhist doctrineWhen the Christians retired from the debate defeated the Buddhists were overjoyedFestivities were held in every temple to mark their triumph and the effigy of Gunaananda Thera was carried in procession in every villageThe triumph of the Buddhists over their Christian adversaries at the Panadura controversy flushed into their veins vigor and enthusiasm to work for the recovery of their lost gloryAn American scholar named DrPeebles who happened to be in Sri Lanka on a visit about the time of this Panadura controversy was so impressed with it that he published its proceedings in book form on his return to AmericaThe attention of Colonel Henry Steele Olcott was first drawn towards Buddhism by this report of the controversy which he happened to read in a public library in AmericaOlcott was an American by birth who had spent his early life as a very successful farmer and a colonel of both the army and the navyAt an early age of years in he gave up all worldly fortunes and together with Madame Blavatsky formed the Theosophical Society for the quest of truth in all religionsHaving read the reports of the Panadura controversy he realized the importance of the teachings of the Buddha and in he came over to Lanka along with Madame Blavatsky to gain a firsthand knowledge of BuddhismWhen his studies soon convinced him of the teachings of the Buddha he embraced Buddhism and worked for the upliftment of the Buddhists in LankaOlcott showed the Buddhist leaders of Sri Lanka that if Buddhism was to raise its head against the Christian missionary activities they should open up Buddhist schools to educate their childrenUnder his guidance and leadership and with the support of all the leading Buddhist monks the lay Buddhist leaders in Sri Lanka at that time founded the Buddhist Theosophical Society on th JuneThe primary objects of the society were the establishment of Buddhist schools and the bringing together of Buddhist workers in a cooperative body without distinction of caste or position for the purpose of promoting the welfare of the Buddhists of LankaAt the time of Olcotts arrival there were only three Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka which obtained government grants one at Dodanduwa another at Panadura and the third at BandaragamaIn twelve years after the establishment of the society there were boys schools girls schools and mixed schools founded by the societyIn there were schools under the management of the society with an attendance of about childrenIn the number of schools had risen toOlcott and his supporters went from village to village appealing to the people to donate subscriptions for the maintenance of these schools and funds were readily forthcomingSeveral leading educationists of his day made his educational plans a great successMention should be made among them of WLeadbeater Bowles Daly FWoodward AEBultjens and MrsMMHigginsMrsHiggins was particularly responsible for the successful education of the Buddhist girlsThe leading Buddhist schools of the present day such as Ananda and Nalanda Colleges in Colombo Dharmaraja in Kandy Mahinda in Galle Dharmasoka in Ambalangoda Visakha in Bambalapitiya and Museus in Colombo are outstanding examples of the success of his effortsOlcott pointed out to the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders of his time that they should have their own publications to give publicity to Buddhist and national opinionFor this purpose the Buddhist Theosophical Society started the Sinhalese newspaper Sarasavisandarasa in December and later its English supplement The Buddhist now a monthly of the YMBA ColomboColonel Olcott worked hard to win back for the Sinhalese their lost rightsIt was as a result of his efforts that the Buddhists of Lanka gained freedom to hold their Buddhist processions and that the fullmoon day of Vesak was declared a public holidayThe present Buddhist flag is also a creation of Olcott which he appealed to the Buddhists to hoist on all important Buddhist occasionsHis efforts also resulted in the appointment of Buddhist registrars of marriagesOf the Panadura controversy and the consequent arrival of Colonel Olcott it could justly be said that these two events jointly closed down a dark period in Lankan Buddhism and ushered in a new bright eraThis noble personality who awakened the Sinhalese Buddhists and showed them the path on which they should proceed passed away in while he was in IndiaApart from meeting the Christian opponents in open debate Mohottivatte Gunaananda Thera and his companions had planned other devices to counteract the antiBuddhist propaganda of the Christian missionaries and revive the Buddhist faith in the countryOne of these devices was the establishment of a printing press whereby they could reply to the criticisms of the Christians and also publish books for the study of BuddhismThus the first press controlled by Sinhalese Buddhists was established in under the name of Lankopakaara PressIt was a donation by the king of SiamIn the same year Mohottivatte Gunaananda Thera established the Sarvajñasaasanaabhivurddhidaayaka Press at Kotahena near ColomboConsequently the Lakrivikirana Press was established in and the Lankabhinavavisruta Press inIn the meantime learned monks of the period with the assistance of lay followers brought about a revival of Buddhist learningPioneers among them were the venerable Hikkaduve Sri Sumangala who founded the Vidyodaya Pirivena of Maligakanda in Colombo in and the venerable Ratmalaane Sri Dhammaaloka who founded the Vidyaalankara Pirivena of Peliyagoda in Colombo inIn these two great centers of learning a vast number of monks and lay people received education and in a short time the fame of these two pirivenas spread even in foreign countriesThe scholars whom these two centers produced opened up other pirivenas in different parts of the country and also contributed to Buddhistic studies by compiling and editing numerous booksIt was also about this time that devoted scholars from foreign countries who happened to be in Sri Lanka evinced a great interest in Buddhism its culture and literature and created an interest in their kinsmen in the West through their valuable treatisesTurner Tennant Childers Rhys Davids and Geiger were but a few among themA different type of revivalistic activity was carried out by a group of lay Buddhist leaders just at this time the foremost of this group being Anagaarika DharmapaalaThe fame of this great personality lies in his successful effort of reforming the Buddhist society in Sri Lanka which had fallen into a very low moral state and also in his activities in India for the purpose of reviving Buddhism in that country and for winning back the Buddhist sacred places there for their rightful owners the BuddhistsWe are presently concerned only with his social reformation in Sri LankaAnagaarika Dharmapaala formerly known as David Hewavitarana was born in as the eldest son of a leading businessman in Colombo who had migrated to the capital city from Matara in south LankaThe father mother and the grandfather of the child were devoted Buddhists who were close associates of the venerable Hikkaduve Sri Sumangala TheraAt home the child was thus brought up in a Buddhist environment though he received his education in Christian schoolsThose were the days when Mohottiwatte Gunaananda Thera was engaged in verbal battles against the Christian missionary activities and young Dharmapaala had not only listened to the orations of the great speaker with much inspiration but also had become a favorite of the monks by his constant visits to the temple at KotahenaWhen Colonel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky arrived in Lanka in Dharmapaala then a youth of years naturally became a great favorite of the two foreigners through his association with Gunaananda TheraThe speeches and activities of Colonel Olcott greatly inspired the young enthusiastIn consequent upon a brutal assault on a Buddhist procession by a Catholic mob at Kotahena Dharmapaala left his Catholic school and in the following year became a member of the Buddhist Theosophical Society in Colombo of which his grandfather was the presidentAt the age of Dharmapaala obtained permission from his father to leave home and lead a celibate life as he wished to devote all his time to the welfare of the SaasanaFrom that time he stayed at the headquarters of the Buddhist Theosophical SocietyIn when Colonel Olcott returned to Sri Lanka after a short stay abroad and planned to go round the country addressing public gatherings and collecting money for the Buddhist Educational Fund Anagaarika Dharmapaala joined him as his interpreterFor this purpose he obtained leave from the Education Department where he was working as a junior clerk and subsequently vacated his post in order to dedicate all his life to the good of the religionAs the interpreter of Colonel Olcott Dharmapaala gained immense experience as a speakerHe now traveled throughout the country with or without his companion OlcottThose were the days when the Buddhists of Lanka were reluctant to declare themselves Buddhists for Buddhism was considered to be the faith of the unurbanized massesIt was the fashion at that time to become a Christian to study English and other allied subjects to adopt a foreign name and to imitate the dress of the foreigners and their customs and mannersBuddhism and Buddhist culture were subjected to ridicule and were the heritage of villagers in the interiorAnagaarika Dharmapaala was the foremost among those who rose against this mentality of the BuddhistsThrough his public speeches and numerous articles in newspapers and journals he vehemently opposed the habit of imitating foreigners in religion names and customsHe emphatically pointed out that this tendency to imitate was a clear manifestation of a lack of the primary element of selfesteemIn keeping with his preaching he himself changed his name from David to DharmapaalaThe people listened to his sermons and attentively read his articles in journals and newspapers and were convinced of the truth of his philosophyGradually there came about a cultural revivalThe people began to take pride in their religion their language and their customsAbove all several younger men of his time joined the Buddhist forward movement to guide the destinies of future generations of Buddhists in Sri LankaThis great personality who indefatigably gave his services for the revival of Buddhism in Lanka India and other parts of the world in his last days entered the Order as the venerable Devamitta Dhammapaala TheraHe passed away in the year while he was in IndiaTo perpetuate his memory Sri Lanka and India celebrated his birth centenary in The leading men in the Buddhist community at the beginning of the twentieth century were inspired by the activities of Anagaarika Dharmapaala and they formed into organized bodies for the promotion of the Buddhist revivalistic movementAmong them were great personalities such as Sir DBJayatillake FRSomnayake Valisinha Harishchandra and WAde SilvaTo them the Buddhist revival was the national revivalThese prominent men whose names have gone into history became active members of leading Buddhist associations like the Buddhist Theosophical Society the Colombo Young Mens Buddhist Association the Maha Bodhi Society and the Ceylon Buddhist Congress and worked with remarkable success to achieve the aims and objects of those organizationsThrough such organizations these Buddhist leaders were able to unite and bring together all Buddhists in Sri Lanka to inspire them to be active to collect funds for educational and other religious purposes to give the Buddhist children a sound religious and secular education to do a great deal of social work and to raise the spiritual and moral standard of the peopleA great deal of literary work was produced during this periodThe Vidyodaya and the Vidyaalankaara Pirivenas and their affiliated institutions which numbered about had produced many scholars who edited several canonical and commentarial works in the early twentieth centurySimon Hewavitarana the youngest brother of Anagaarika Dharmapaala had left a large legacy which was to be used for the printing and publishing of Pali books and this greatly facilitated the production of books at this timeFrom about many modern scholars both monks and laymen have edited and published many more texts of Pali Buddhism and have also compiled several secondary works on the different aspects of BuddhismTo name these scholars and their publications is not necessary since they and their works are very well knownA great enthusiasm was also created for the rebuilding of ancient Buddhist shrines in the old capitals of Sri LankaThe Ruwanveli Daagaba was the first to receive attentionThe other shrines too were renovated one by one and today the old city of Anuraadhapura has once more become a sacred city with the Catholic Church and the commercial sites which were in the city being moved to other placesSri Lanka has not only reorganized her Buddhist activities within the country but has also taken a leading part in sending Dhammaduutas messengers of the Dhamma abroadIn the World Fellowship of Buddhists was set up in order to bring all Buddhist countries together and several conferences were held in the subsequent yearsIt is a very significant fact that this revival of Buddhism in the twentieth century was accelerated towards the middle of that century as a result of the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders of the time gaining control of the reins of governmentUltimately in Sri Lanka regained its independence after a period of British rule of yearsThe Buddhist leaders who worked indefatigably for the cause of Buddhism were also the Sinhalese national leaders who led the struggle for liberation from foreign ruleIt was therefore to be expected that when these leaders gained national freedom and took over the reins of government from the British rulers they were mindful of their national faith and its culture and therefore took the necessary steps to set things right so that Buddhism would once more receive its rightful placeIn the year on the rd of May which was the Vesak fullmoon day of that year the Buddhists in Sri Lanka and other parts of the world celebrated the Buddha JayantiThat was the th anniversary of the Buddhas Parinibbaana a day specially significant to the Buddhists the world over on account of the tradition that it constitutes half the lifespan of the Saasana and that from that year the Dhamma would flourish and spread far and wideThe history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka from the closing years of the last century has clear indications that the prophecy as far as Lanka is concerned is coming trueIn other parts of the world too it is seen that more and more people who were not Buddhists by birth are becoming interested in BuddhismThe government of Sri Lanka on its part undertook numerous activities in commemoration of the Buddha JayantiA committee of leading Buddhist monks and laymen was appointed to advise the government on all matters relating to the Buddha Jayanti celebrationsArrangements were made to translate the Tripitaka into Sinhalese and compile an Encyclopaedia of Buddhism in English and one in Sinhalese as wellIt was also decided to compile other books dealing with the biography of the Buddha his teachings and the history of BuddhismThe completion of the renovation of the Daladaa Maaligawa in Kandy before the Buddha Jayanti and to aid the reconstruction of the Mahiyangana Thupa were among its other undertakingsA substantial grant was also given to the organization which was handling the construction work of a Sanghaaraama for the Buddhist monks at the University of Ceylon PeradeniyaArrangements were made to hold a World Buddhist Conference in Colombo in the following yearFrom the Buddha Jayanti year it was noticeable that the Buddhists in Lanka applied themselves more keenly to the practice of morality taught in Buddhism while showing interest in the celebration of Buddhist festivalsMore and more people observe the eight precepts on the Poya days and young children are given a sound religious educationThe government on its part has given the necessary encouragement for this religious reestablishmentIn January the Vidyodaya and the Vidyaalankaara Pirivenas were made two universitiesThe private Buddhist and Christian schools were taken over in December and are now managed by the governmentThe four Poya days of the month were made the weekend holidays in instead of Sundays as in previous timesIt has also been planned to start a new Bhikkhu University in AnuraadhapuraSri Lanka has today aboutmillion Buddhists which is about sixtyfive percent of her total populationThere are nearly Buddhist monasteries all over the island with approximately monksAlmost all the monasteries in the island have their Dhamma schools where Buddhist children are given religious instruction on the Poya daysThe Colombo Young Mens Buddhist Association conducts an islandwide examination annually for the pupils of these Dhamma schoolsThe children are provided with free books by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and prizes are given to those who pass these examinations including one on the Dhammapada and this association spends annually a large sum of money on the religious education of childrenIn  children sat for the Dhamma examinationThe foregoing account will tell the reader of the vicissitudes that this great religion Buddhism had to face during its history of over years in this isle of Sri LankaIt had its tidal ebb and flowDuring the four centuries of foreign domination Buddhism withstood all the assaults that almost crushed itSince Sri Lanka gained its independence in there has been a revival of the Buddhist religion and culture in the country and this reawakening was particularly noticeable when the Buddha Jayanti was celebrated inThe progress achieved since the eighties of the last century may well be called remarkableYet to the Buddhists of Lanka this should not be a cause of complacency for which there is no room in a world of changeIt remains the duty of the present generation and the coming ones to preserve and strengthen these achievements against the corrosive forces of a materialist age and to work devotedly so that the Buddhas message of Wisdom and Compassion may take still firmer and deeper roots in Lanka and also spread its beneficial influence over the worldThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe following pages were originally intended as new sections to be added to the second edition of my introductory book on the Dhamma What is BuddhismHowever as many people are greatly interested in the practice of meditation and as many are also separated from the sources of a living tradition it is hoped that the following may be of value even apart from the sections of the book which they supplementWhen we consider meditation we cannot stress too much the importance of having the right reasons for taking it upMeditation  or as a better translation of samadhi collectedness  is only one aspect of Buddhist practice and must to be successful go hand in hand with such other practices as generosity gentleness nonviolence patience contentment and humilityIf such genuine qualities of the Dhamma neither exist in oneself initially nor grow through ones practice then something is drastically wrong and only a foolhardy person will try to proceedThe practice of collectedness is based upon firm roots of virtue and cannot succeed in anyone who does not make a real effort to be strict in keeping the preceptsThe signs of progress in collectedness are not strange visions peculiar feelings and the like but rather an allround and harmonious growth in the way of DhammaIf one is without a teacher then one has to be doubly vigilant otherwise one will never become aware whether one of Maras distractions is likely to succeed or whether one does in fact tread the Middle PracticePathThis essay is an extract from Buddhism Explained the second edition of the book formerly known as What is Buddhism published by The Social Science Press of Thailand Phya Thai Road Chula Soi BangkokTwo apparently distinct streams of Buddhist meditation may be discerned though when meditation is established these are seen to be complementaryIt may be profitable for some people whose minds are very active and who suffer from distraction to follow with mindfulness the mad monkeyminds acrobaticsAs the mind is really a series of mental events which arise and pass away with incredible rapidity each of which is a mind complete with supporting mental factors so at the beginning this kind of mindfulness is really one mindful mind watching other mindsOne thereby develops the ability to look into the mind and to see where it has gone toHas it gone to the past present or futureHas it gone to materiality or to feelings or perhaps to cognitions to volitional activities or has it gone to consciousnessBy this method of Where has it gone the distracted mind slowly comes under the surveillance of the mindful mind until mindfulness forms a strong foundation for further developmentConsiderable though mundane brilliance of mind is both needed and developed by this practice which however should be balanced by the tranquillity of the absorptionsWhen the mind has become calm one should start to practice for the absorptions which will in their turn be the basis for the arising of real insightThis method is called wisdom leading to calmOther methods suited to those whose minds are less disturbed initially include the classic forty subjects of meditation and these together with more developed types of meditation practice involve the use of a definite object for concentrationThis may be ones own body or a part of it a color or a picture a word or a phrase or abstract contemplation and so forthAll these methods involve some firm but gentle discipline of the mind in that each time it strays away it must be gently brought back again to concentrate again on the chosen subjectSome people have the quite mistaken idea that practice of this sort must necessarily lead to tranquillity almost at onceThey may be surprised when beginning to practice themselves since they actually experience more troubles than they had previouslyThis is firstly because they never before really looked into their mind to know the state it has always been in and secondly because having taken up a discipline of the mind it is as though one stirs up with a stick a stagnant pond or pokes with a stick a fire smoldering under ashesThe wild elephant of the mind long accustomed to roam in the jungle of desires does not take readily to taming or to being tied to the post of practice with the thongs of mindfulnessHowever diligence and heedfulness will eventually win for one the fruits of tranquillityAll these forty subjects are of this second type in which the calm gained from practice is then used for the arousing of wisdomThey are for this reason called calmleadingtowisdom methods and are very important in the present distracted ageFor their full explanation one should consult the Path of Purification although even the great learning in that book cannot replace the personal contact with a teacherTurning from the psychological to the practical aspect meditation for laypeople may be divided into two categories that which is done intensively and that which one practices while going about ones daily lifeThe meditation practiced intensively is also of two sorts regular daily sitting and occasional retreat practiceWe shall first discuss the regular daily period of intensive sitting which should where possible be made every day at the same timeOne should guard against its becoming a ritual by earnestness and by being intensely aware of why one had undertaken itThe following suggestions may be found helpful as wellAs to material considerations the place for meditation should be fairly quietIf one has a small room which can be used for this purpose so much the better and in any case it is better to meditate alone unless other members of the household also practiceWhere this latter is the case one should make sure that ones mind is pure also in relation to others for otherwise greed hatred and the rest of the robber gang are sure to steal away the fruits of meditationQuietness is best obtained by getting up early before others rise and this is also the time when the mind is clear and the body untiredThe sincere meditator therefore keeps regular hours for he knows how much depends on having just enough sleep to feel refreshedAfter rising and washing one should sit down in clean loose clothing in the meditation placeOne may have a small shrine with Buddhist symbols but this is not essentialSome people find it useful to begin by making the offerings of flowers incense and light carefully reflecting while doing soIt is very common in Buddhist countries to preface ones silent meditation by chanting softly to oneself Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa with the Refuges and PreceptsIf one knows the Pali passages in praise of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha these may also be used at this timeAnother useful preliminary is a reflection a discursive recitation of some truths of the Dhamma such as the passage suggested belowIn looking to the welfare of others I shall not forget my own progress on the path of DhammaMay I indeed come to know how driven here and there by the winds of kamma I have suffered an infinity of lives in all the realms of existenceI must also turn my mind to consider how short and fleeting is this lifeHow mind and body are ever changing arising and declining from moment to momentHow neither mind nor body belongs to me neither of them is mineI must also turn this mind to consider how beset by troubles is this brief lifeHaving been sired by craving and born out of ignorance I must realize that death is inescapable that old age and disease are natural to my conditionI must make efforts to realize for my own good and the good of others that this person called myself is a complex of mentality and materiality wherein no abiding entity such as a soul or self is foundMay I through this practice experience insight into impermanence ill and noselfMay I be one who dwells in the VoidAnd having realized this sublime truth may I show the way to othersWhen sitting care should be taken that the body is kept erect yet relaxedThere should be no strain but neither should the head droop nor the lumbar region sagThe body should feel poised and balanced uprightAlthough the crosslegged positions are best when the meditator is seated on a fairly soft mat a chair may be used by those unaccustomed to the lotus posture or else unable to train themselves to sit in that waySitting in lotus posture or halflotus posture will be found much easier if a rather hard cushion is placed so as to raise the buttocksThe knees will then tend to touch the ground and a firm three pointed sitting is then attainedOne should sit for the same length of time every day until as one becomes more proficient in collecting the mind automatically one will feel like extending the practiceOne widely used method for measuring the meditation period is sitting for the length of time taken for a stick of incense to burn downHaving placed the hands in meditation posture relaxed in the lap the eyes may be closed or left slightly open according to which is found most comfortableMethods used for helping to concentrate the mind are many and the two main streams in classical meditation have been briefly reviewed in the section aboveOther helpful methods include the repetition of a word or phrase and perhaps with it the use of a rosaryIf one practices mindfulness of breathing one may find the use of a word such as Buddho or Araham good for quietening the mindThe first syllable is silently repeated when breathing in and one concentrates on the second during the outbreathingAlso the counting of breath is used as an aid for concentrationBut any such aids should be dropped when concentration improvesWhen the meditation is on a phrase only a rosary may be used in conjunction each repetition being marked by one beadOnes meditation goes well if one finds the mind increasingly absorbed on the chosen meditation subject but one should not assume that meditation is useless just because for a period longer or shorter not much more than sleepiness or distraction is experiencedThese hindrances have to be faced and if they are met not by irritation or despair but by quietly observant mindfulness they can and will be overcomeFor success great persistence and evenness of effort are necessaryThe meditation period may close with some chanting the usual subject being the well being of others and the distribution of merits to themA translation or the original Pali of the Metta Sutta may be chanted at this time and as it is not long can be easily memorizedAs methods of chanting vary it is very helpful if one can obtain recordings perhaps on tape of the passages one wishes to learn recorded by bhikkhusWhile on the subject of chanting it is very useful to know a few discourses of Lord Buddha in one of the Buddhist classical languages and to use these for collecting the mind if there should be an occasion when no concentration at all can be obtainedAt such a time a meditator should not feel depressed but should continue sitting and chant softly to himselfThis is what Buddhist monks do twice a day as part of their mental development and it is useful as well for fostering a more devotional approach necessary as balance with intellectual charactersAnother useful method for the overcoming of distraction is walkingpractice which may be done in any passage of the house or in a secluded walk in the gardenA length of twenty or thirty paces will be sufficient for if longer the mind tends to wander and if shorter distraction may be increasedOne should walk at the speed one feels to be natural with the hands clasped the left in the right and arms relaxed in front of the bodyAt the ends of the walk one should turn in a clockwise directionPerhaps a few words on devotion would not be out of place here for this is very important in meditation practiceNo one who is not a devoted Buddhist takes up Buddhist meditation for the simple reason that he does not have the Buddhist ideals in his heartThe taking to heart of the Triple Refuge and the understanding of the Triple Gem are closely linked with Buddhist meditationA really devoted Buddhist who puts his whole life into the Dhamma will have no insurmountable difficulties in meditation practiceWhatever obstacles he comes to those he leaps over sustained by devotionHe is prepared for the way to be long and hard because he realizes that he has made it like thatIf he finds his way blocked his meditation failing to progress and he himself without a teacher he does not waver or falter on the wayHe thinks I am now experiencing the results of intentional actions made by me in the past And he remembers Lord Buddhas last words Subject to breakingup are all compounded thingsWith mindfulness strive on All difficulties are compounded things and will eventually change meanwhile much may be done with mindfulness vigor and devotionIf one is not too tired after work and if there is opportunity in the evening another period of sitting can be undertaken thenIn any case before sleep it is a wise practice to sit if only for a few minutes so as to purify the mind before lying downOne may consider thus When I lie down there is no certainty that I shall awake One may therefore be lying down to die and this is a good reflection to rouse skillful states of mind and banish sensual unskillful onesIf one practices this the lyingdown to die it will be a very good preparation for the real event which is bound to take place at some time in the unknown futureIt may even generate the right conditions for the arising of insight allowing one to die giving up the grasping at what does not belong to one that is the mind and bodyAt this time also a Dhamma phrase or word may be used repeating which one eventually falls to sleepIn this way one ends and begins the day with practice of Buddhist teachingsAnd apart from devotion of ones whole day to them what could be betterRegarding the second division of intensive practice that is when undertaken in retreat much will depend upon what facilities are available to the earnest studentThere are now a few places in the West where meditation instruction can be soughtThe most important thing is to have direct contact with an able meditation masterAfter satisfying this one condition only one other is necessary one must strive with diligence to practice and realize his teachingsIf these two conditions are fulfilled then one is the most fortunate among human beingsMany will be without access to a teacher and some may like to try a period of solitary meditation in some quiet part of the countryThis should only be attempted if one has already developed a good power of mindfulnessOtherwise what was meant to foster meditation may become a very unprofitable time perhaps accompanied by the seeming intensification of the mental defilementsAs to the other sort of meditation practice which is performed in daily life though much may be written the following few words may serve as a guideFirst one should not deceive oneself regarding concentration of the mindIt is of no use pretending to oneself or to others that ones daily life is meditation  unless of course one has already great powers of concentrationOnly the real adept often one who has sat for many years keeping the monastic discipline can really perceive ordinary life as meditation and such a one would be most unlikely to tell others of this factRefusing to allow pride an opportunity to distort the real state of mental affairs one should take stock with fairness and admit ones limitationsThis is already a great step forwardThe layman who thinks of himself as an arahant already has blocked off very effectively all real progress while the honest man has at least the wisdom to be humbleMuch may be accomplished with mindfulness while without it there is no hope for meditation in daily lifeHow are quite ordinary events capable of being made into meditationBy mindfulness which to begin with may be defined as awareness of the present work in handAt first great effort has to be made in order to remain mindful of what one is supposed to be doing nor can one pretend that such mindfulness is pleasant alwaysTo escape from dull and unliked work and situations we tend to turn either to fantasy worlds hopes or else to memories which are respectively the delusive escapes into the present future or pastBut for one really interested in understanding himself none of these courses is very rewarding since they are compounded of delusion with various ingredients such as fear craving or ignoranceWhile in the practice of strict meditation mindfulness may follow all the wanderings of the mind in daily life it is better that the mind should be constantly returned to the job in handOne should not send ones mind anywhere neither to a dreamworld nor to the past nor to the futureLord Buddha compared these periods of time thusSuch a simile may be useful as the mind darts about between dreams mirages and clouds all insubstantial though the everchanging present so like the clouds in the sky is the only aspect of time compared to things of greater realityOne may also consider meditation as the exercise of mindfulness which keeps the mind inside this body that is always focused upon some aspect of itOf course only the most sincere meditator who sees the advantage in this to be greater than any pleasure offered by the world is likely to practice in this way since this cuts off not only interest in outer objects but also the toying with pleasant or intriguing ideasIndeed with work that is really interesting the way of mindfulness is the only way to convert ones day into something worthwhileDays pass and bring us nearer to death and an unknown rebirth while it is now that one has the chance to practice DhammaInstead of reacting with aversion or deluded fantasies towards what one does not like the Way of Mindfulness constitutes the Middle PracticePath transcending these ancient patterns of reactionThere is no need to be ruled either by greed or by hatred nor to be dominated by delusion but only mindfulness shows the way beyond theseConstantly bringing the mind back and disengaging it from tangles is the basic practice in everyday lifeIt is also wise to take advantage of those odd times during work when one waits for something to do to meet someone for a bus or train or any time when one is alone for a few minutesInstead of turning to a newspaper for distraction to the wireless or to another person for gossip it is more profitable to retire inside oneselfDisengaging attention from exterior objects take up mindfulness of breathing or the repetition of some phrase of Dhamma or significant word such as Buddho or Arahant doing this until one has again to attend to workGoing inwards as often as possible will be found very useful strengthening ones sitting practice just as the latter in turn strengthens the ability to turn withinMindfulness of breathing is especially good as a concentration method for use during travel and during the times when one is restlessly expecting a bus or a trainWhy be agitated or impatientA little mindful breathing is just the practice for these moments since it calms the feverish workings of the mind and the restless movements of the bodyOne does not have to aimlessly stare out of windows while travelingWhy be a slave of the eyedominant when a little useful practice could take its placeOne does not have to listen to the idle chatter of others so why be a slave to the eardominantOne cannot shut ones ears but everyone can withdraw attention to some extent while practicing mindfulnessIt is mindfulness also which helps to bring into focus counteractive contemplationsLust for instance is soon dissipated by thoughts of a decaying corpseThe looks which are bestowed on pretty girls seem ridiculous when it is thought that old ladies and equally ancient men never attract such desirefilled attentionOnly when one sees how lust burns up the one who indulges in it only then does it seem worth relinquishingSimilarly gluttony even in a mild form can be demolished by contemplating the bodily processes connected with foodChewed food looks a good deal less palatable then when the same stuff before mixing with spittle was nicely laid out on platesVomit is just the same substances in the process of change but does not readily arouse greedExcrement even if placed on the finest gold plate fails to become attractive  yet this is the remnants of the food so eagerly gorgedBy the time that one has contemplated food in these three stages greed has quite disappeared and one may take food just as a medicine to preserve the bodyMindfulness is also responsible for becoming sufficiently aware in a moment of anger to turn the mind to other subjects or personsIt is mindfulness that warns one of an approaching situation where anger may arise and makes it possible to turn aside and dwell in equanimity or where the Divine Abidings are well developed in friendlinessWhen envy rears its ugly head mindfulness gives one presence of mind to know envy has arisen and if efforts to arouse gladness with others joy fail it is mindfulness that helps one dwell in equanimity or if all else fails helps turn attention to other objectsLord Buddha has truly said Mindfulness I declare is helpful everywhereThe social implications of meditation should be obvious from the aboveThose who have the strange delusion that Buddhism is a religion of meditative isolation offering society no social benefits should understand that a Buddhist believes society can only be changed for the better and with some degree of permanence by starting work on himselfBuddhist ideals of society are expressed in a number of important discourses addressed by Lord Buddha to lay people and in them the developments of the individual is always stressed as a very necessary factorThe advantages of a society in which there are a large number of those dwelling at peace with themselves need hardly be stressedThe development of wisdom and compassion by one man has its effect in leavening the materialistic dough around himThe Buddhist call is therefore first to gain peace in ones own heart when will follow quite naturally peace in the worldTrying to obtain peace the other way round will never be practical nor produce a lasting peace for the roots of greed hatred and delusion have still a firm grip on the hearts of peopleImpracticalOnly for those who do not practiceThose who take up the cultivation of mindfulness find out for themselves how it helps to solve lifes problemsAlthough many journeys to remote and attractive places are now performed with ease the way leading to Nibbana still needs effortBut if the way is sometimes drear with mindfulness the only guiding light at least from reflection one knows that the goal is glorious and of great worth not only for oneself but for others as wellThe way to that goal leads through what are called the Divine Abidings which train the deeprooted emotions from being unskillful into the skillful way of the DhammaAs had already been emphasized above the aim of oneself as of all beings is to gain happinessproducing conditionsTherefore one must act in such a way that happiness will result from ones actionsOne should in this case treat others as they would wish to be treated for every living being is dear to itself and wishes its own welfare and happinessOne cannot expect to have an isolated happiness arising from no cause or from itself nor can happiness be expected if one maltreats other beings human or otherwiseEvery being desires life and is afraid of death this being as true of ourselves as of other creaturesOnly a man who constantly leads an upright and compassionate life is really dear to himself for he does actions which are of great profit of great happinessOther people although they think that they are dear to themselves are really their own worst enemies for they go about doing to themselves what only an enemy would wish for themGood conduct depends on a welltrained mind which has gradually been freed from the clutches of greed hatred and delusionTo hold ones neighbor as dear as one should truly hold oneself is easily said but with difficulty doneIt is the particular merit of Lord Buddhas teachings that they always point out how a method is to be translated into experience the method here being the mental training of the Divine AbidingsWhen we say mental this word should be understood not in the narrow sense of the intellectual processes but rather to include the full range of the mindandheart intellect and emotionsThere are four states of Divine Abidings friendliness compassion gladness and equanimityThese especially the first are very popular meditations in Buddhist countriesWhat follows is a short explanation of eachFriendliness is an unselfish love which can be extended to everyoneThis becomes easy once one has gained the meditative absorptions when the quality of friendliness becomes an integral part of ones characterIn the normal way of things people only love the few people to whom they are especially attached by ties of family etcSuch is love with sensual attachment a limited love and those outside that love are either ignored or dislikedSensual love then is not only linked to attachment but also to hatred and delusion so that the person who is content with this love pays a heavy price for itA love without attachment is scarcely conceivable to many people but such love is much superior to the former being without attachment it can become infinite and need not be confined to this or that group of beingsAs it can be made infinite leaving none outside it there is no question of the three roots of unskill being linked with itFriendliness can be developed gradually in ones meditation period every day but if it is really effective it must show in ones daily lifeIt makes life easier by turning persons whom one formerly disliked or hated into at the beginning those whom one disregards and then as ones practice becomes stronger into objects for the arising of lovingkindnessIt is Lord Buddhas medicine for the disease of hatred and dislikeFinally one is warned that it has two enemies the near one is sensual attachment often miscalled love while the far enemy to its development is hatredIn the development of friendliness one must beware of these twoCompassion is taking note of the sufferings of other beings in the worldIt overcomes callous indifference to the plight of suffering beings human or otherwiseLikewise it must be reflected in ones life by a willingness to go out of ones way to give aid where possible and to help those in distressIt has the advantage of reducing ones selfishness by understanding others sorrowsIt is Lord Buddhas medicine for cruelty for how can one harm others when one has seen how much they have to suffer alreadyIt has also two enemies the near one is mere grief while its far enemy is crueltyGladness is to rejoice with others over their success gains happinessIt overcomes the grudging attitude to others and the envy which may arise on hearing of others joyIt must show in ones life as a spontaneous joy at the very time when one learns that other people have some gain or other material or immaterialIt has the advantage of making one openhearted towards others and does away with secretivenessA person who develops gladness attracts many friends who are devoted to him and with them and others he lives in harmonyIt is Lord Buddhas medicine for envy and jealousy which it can inhibit completelyThe two enemies of gladness are the merely personal happiness of reflecting on ones own gains  this is the near enemy while the far one is aversion to or boredom with this gladnessEquanimity is to be developed to deal with situations where one should admit that it is beyond ones powers to change themIt overcomes worry and useless distraction over affairs which either do not concern one or else cannot be changed by oneselfIt is reflected in ones life by an ability to meet difficult situations with tranquillity and undisturbed peace of mindThe advantage to be seen in its development is that it makes ones life more simple by disengaging from useless activityIt is Lord Buddhas medicine for distraction and worry and its enemies are mere indifference which is the near one while greed and its partner resentment which involve one unskillfully in so many affairs are its far enemiesThe mind wellpracticed in these four virtues and then welltrained by their use in daily life has already gained very muchThree of the perfections or qualities practiced by many Buddhists who aspire to enlightenment may also be outlined here as they too have an intimate bearing on the practice of meditationPatience is an excellent quality much praised in Buddhist scripturesIt can be developed easily only if restlessness and hatred have already been subdued in the mind as is done by meditation practiceImpermanence which has the tendency to make one rush around and thus miss many good chances results from the inability to sit still and let things sort themselves out  which sometimes they may do without ones meddlingThe patient man has many a fruit fall into his lap which the gogetter missesOne of them is a quiet mind for impatience churns the mind up and brings with it the familiar anxietydiseases of the modern business worldPatience quietly endures  it is this quality which makes it so valuable in mental training and particularly in meditationIt is no good expecting instant enlightenment after five minutes practiceCoffee may be instant but meditation is not and only harm will come of trying to hurry it upFor ages the rubbish has accumulated an enormous pile of mental refuse and so when one comes along at first with a very tiny teaspoon and starts removing it how fast can one expect it to disappearPatience is the answer and determined energy to go with itThe patient meditator really gets results of lasting value the seeker after quick methods or sudden enlightenment is doomed by his own attitude to long disappointmentIndeed it must soon become apparent to anyone investigating the Dhamma that these teachings are not for the impatientA Buddhist views his present life as a little span perhaps of eighty years or so and the latest one so far of many such livesBearing this in mind he determines to do as much in this life for the attainment of Enlightenment as possibleBut he does not overestimate his capabilities he just quietly and patiently gets on with living the Dhamma from day to dayRushing headlong at Enlightenment like a bull in a china shop is not likely to get one very far that is unless one is a very exceptional character who can take such treatment and most important one who is devoted to a very skillful master of meditationWith patience one will not bruise oneself but will go carefully step by step along the wayWe learn that a Bodhisatta is well aware of this and that he cultures his mind with this perfection so that it is not disturbed by any of the untoward occurrences common in this worldHe decides that he will be patient with exterior conditions  not to be upset when the sun is too hot or the weather too coldNot to be agitated by other beings which attack his body such as bugs and mosquitoesNeither will he be disturbed when people utter harsh words lies or abuse about him either to his face or behind his backHis patience is not broken even when his body is subjected to torment blows sticks and stones tortures and even death itself he will endure these steadily so unflinching is his patienceBuddhist monks also are advised to practice in the same wayIn Buddhist tradition the perfection of patience is rather better known than some of the othersThis is because a quite outstanding Birth Story illustrates itThe Khantivadi Birth Story should be read many times and made the object of deep and frequent reflectionsOnly an exceptionally noble person in this case Gotama in a previous life when he was called the Patienceteaching Rishi can gently exhort a raging and drunk monarch who out of his jealous anger is slowly cutting that persons body to piecesSuch nobility did the Bodhisatta have and such nobility steadfast endurance and gentleness is required of all who would try to reach the goal of EnlightenmentJust as Enlightenment is inconceivable unless a person has patience so it is not attainable without effort being madeThe Dhamma never encourages the doctrine of fatalism and true Buddhists never think of events as being rigidly predeterminedSuch fatalism is combated by mindfulness and by energy itselfThis perfection is the counterpart of the previous one and balanced by practice they ensure that the sincere Buddhist neither passively accepts what he should combat nor rushes around to the disturbance of himself and others when he should have patienceBy way of warning it may be mentioned here that in the Buddhist world can be found a number of methods which seem to promise the riches of Dhamma all in no timeOne hears such remarks as Whats the use of books and study Or even The development of calm is a waste of timeOne should only develop insight Such lopsided approaches do not reflect the wisdom of Lord Buddha who taught time and again the necessity of a balanced development of mindBooks and their study are useful to some people who wish to gain a good background of what Lord Buddha really said before taking up more intensive practiceAs for the other assertion no real insight will arise to the person whose mind has no experience of calmSuch views as these which are usually based on some peculiar experience of those teachers who originate them are apt to mislead many since the craving for quick results coupled with the dislike of the necessary hard work are easily stirred upThere must be patience to accept that the conditions required for success of meditation have to be fulfilled and the only result if failing to do so is straying off the WayThe meditator applies himself steadily to whatever task he has in hand and coming to the end of it does not feel tired at all but straightaway takes up a new objectiveIt is interesting in this respect that tiredness is of two kinds that relating to physical exhaustion and the other kind which is mentally induced and involves the unskillful factors of sloth and torporWhile the former is of course unavoidable the latter occurs only when the unskillful root of delusion becomes predominant in the mindThis happens when there is a situation which is unpleasant to me unwanted and from which I want to escapePeople complain that they become much more tired sitting in meditation while practicing intensively than they do when say they do a bit of heavy readingWhen the self feels threatened by a selfrevealing event then this self rooted in unknowing throws up a dense fog of torpor proceeding from the root of delusionOn the other hand many who have practiced much meditation remark that they do not have to sleep so long as they did formerly while energy when it becomes a perfection as practiced by the Bodhisatta is quite natural and unforcedThis perfection is illustrated by the story of the caravanleader who saved the merchants men and animals entrusted to his care by vigorous actionWhen others would have given themselves up to death since the caravan had taken a wrong course in the desert and all supplies were exhausted their leader forced one of them to dig for water which he foundIn this way in a previous life did Gotama as the caravanleader make effort not only for his own life but also for the welfare of othersMonks are also referred to as caravanleaders in several places in Pali scriptures showing that it is not only Lord Buddha or a Bodhisatta who is able to guide othersIf we deal energetically with our own training then we too have energy for the advancement of othersMany other stories like the above could be found in Buddhist works showing how necessary is energy from which spring persistence and determination for the seeing of the truly real NibbanaBearing in mind the meanings of this word together with such specialized terms as development absorption insight onepointedness and meditation exercise we may now examine what constitutes perfected collectednessWhat especially marks off the good Buddhists practice whether he be a Bodhisatta or not from that of an ordinary meditator is that the latter will most likely become firmly attached to the delights occurring in the upper reaches of the sensual realm or to the pure joys of the realm of form and as a result come to birth in one of these heavenly statesIf one gets oneself trapped in one of these bourns where pleasures and joys are great and sufferings but little then it is unlikely that one will be able to generate the energy necessary for the perfection of wisdomTherefore the good meditator tries to become proficient in the absorptions while not being attached to themBut one should note that this applies only to the skilled meditator who has already obtained the absorptionsIf one has not reached to these levels then ardent aspiration not detachment will be the correct attitudeAfter these absorptions have been attained they may be reviewed as impermanent unsatisfactory and devoid of self or soul at which time detachment from them will naturally arise and insight be experiencedThe absorptions are thus in the Buddhist way of training never an end in themselves but are always used to promote insight and wisdom which arise when the collected mind is set the task of examining the mind and body in order to know completely their characteristicsA story which brings out the meaning of this perfection is told of Kuddalamunis lifeHis name means the Mattock sage and he was thus called because of the difficulty he experienced in freeing himself from attachment to his mattockSeveral times leaving his house with intent to meditate in the forest he was dragged back by the memory of his mattock and his old occupation of farmingOne day reflecting on the inconstancy with which he pursued meditation he took his mattock and whirling it round his head sent it spinning into the depths of the nearby GangesHaving done this he burst out in a great cry of joyThe local rajah who was passing that way with his army sent a man to enquire why this farmer was so joyful to which the sage replied by relating his experienceThe rajah and many others were much impressed by his reply and some followed him to take up a meditative life in the forest after which we are told all passed away to experience life in the realm of formThe Mattocksage who was none other than Gotama in a past life exhibited even then another aspect of the perfection of meditation the ability to train others in meditation after gaining proficiency in it oneselfFinally we may add brief notes on some of the dangers to meditation practiceWhile the number of ways a meditator may go astray is legion the few mentioned below deserve a special mention due to their common occurrenceFirst a danger that cannot be stressed enough is the lack of right motivation for the practice of meditationWhen the Eightfold Path is described in its wisdom section standing next to the intellectual right understanding comes right motivation thus emphasizing that the emotional roots underlying practice of the Way must be skillful ones those connected with renunciation goodwill and nonviolence are mentionedIf one approaches Buddhist meditation with neither right understanding regarding dukkha and its cessation nor with right motives then ones meditation is liable to seriously astrayThere have for instance been those who took up meditation as a way to invest themselves with power so that they could easily sway or hypnotize disciplesOthers have seen it as a quick way to gain both disciples and richesFame may also be an unworthy motiveAll these as motives for playing with meditation may easily lead the unwary into illness and sometimes mental unbalanceThere is nothing worse in Buddhist meditation where a persons own sure experience is of paramount importance than a halfbaked disciple who sets himself up as a masterThis obviously leads on to a further danger  that of pride of which there are several formsOne such is the pride of the person who has seen manifestations of light during meditation and supposes this to be the sign preceding mental absorptionThen there is the pride of one who touches on a mental absorption if only for an instant and as a result assumes that he has become a Noble One and this can be a very powerful factor in convincing himself if not othersQuite ordinary people who take up meditation may beware of the common holierthanthou attitudes I make an effort whereas you or I meditate every day whereas you Pride is a great obstacle to any progress and while it is only a Buddha or arahant who is entirely rid of it everyone should have the mindfulness to check itRelated to this is the danger for the person who always looks for socalled progressHe is sure that he is making progress because in meditation he sees lights hears sounds or feels strange sensationsHe becomes more and more fascinated by these as time goes by and gradually forgets that he started with the aspiration to find the way to EnlightenmentHis meditation then degenerates into visions and strange happenings leading him into the realms of occultism and magicThere is no surer way for a meditator to become entangled than this wayFascinating though all such manifestations may be they should be rigorously cut down by resorting to bare attention never permitting discursive thought regarding them and thus avoiding these distractionsAmong visions which one may see whether they be internal or external there may be for some meditators an experience of the fearful such as the sight of ones own body reduced to bones or inflated as a rotting corpseIf such an experience occurs or others of a similar nature one should withdraw the mind from the vision immediately supposing that one has no teacherVisions of the fearful variety which occur to some people may be very useful if rightly employed but without a teachers guidance they should be avoidedAnother danger is trying to meditate while one is still too emotionally insecure unbalanced or immatureAn understanding of the value of meritorious deeds or skillfulness will come in useful hereAs merit purifies the mind it will be an excellent basis for minddevelopment and both the ease with which absorptions are gained and the ease with which insight arises are to some extent dependent upon meritMeritorious deeds are not difficult to find in lifeThey are the core of a good Buddhist life giving and generosity undertaking the precepts help and service to others reverence listening wholeheartedly to Dhamma setting upright ones understanding of Dhamma  all these and more are meritorious deeds which bring happiness and emotional maturityMerit one should always remember opens doors everywhereIt makes possible it makes opportunitiesTo have a mind at all times set upon making merit is to have a mind that may be trained to develop absorptions and insightObviously it follows that to try to practice meditation while all the time retaining ones old cravings likes and dislikes is to say the least making ones path difficult if not dangerousMeditation implies renunciation and no practice will be successful unless one is at least prepared to make efforts to restrain greed and hatred check lust and understand when delusion is clouding the heartHow far one carries renunciation and whether this involves outward changes depends much on a person and his circumstances but one thing is sure inward renunciation an attitude of givingup with regard to both unskillful mental events and bodily indulgence is absolutely essentialOften connected with the above dangers is another to be seen in cases where a man suddenly has an opportunity to undertake a longer period of meditation practiceHe sits down with the firm resolve Now I shall meditate but though his energy is ever so great and though he sits and sits and walks and walks still his mind is disturbed and without peaceIt may well be that his own strong effort has much to do with his distractionsMoreover he has to learn that it is necessary to meditate knowing the limitations of his characterJust as any other worker who knows the limits of his strength and is careful not to exhaust himself so is the able meditator carefulWith mindfulness one should know what are the extremes of laziness and of strain to be avoidedIt is through straining or forcing meditation practice that many emotionally disturbed states ariseSudden bursts of intense anger all over insignificant trifles fierce cravings and lusts strange delusions and even more peculiar fantasies can all be produced from unwisely arduous practiceWith all these dangers it is a skilled teacher who is most necessary to give advice so that these and other wrong turnings are avoided and one keeps straight along the way to NibbanaThose who are without a teacher should proceed with utmost caution making sure that their development of mindfulness is very good indeedIf they are mindful and see that despite their efforts their meditation practice is making no real difference to their lives in terms of greater internal peace or externally in relation to others then it should be apparent that something is wrongMeditation may be laid aside for some time while making efforts to contact a genuine source of information preferably a living meditation master in the meantime giving due attention to unsolved moral problems which until sorted out will not permit the mind to develop and making a great effort to live ones life according to Buddhist standardsWhen quite basic matters of this sort are neglected one cannot hope to make much progress upon the Middle PracticePathIf one has no meditation teacher from whom one may request a meditation subject then one has to rely upon ones knowledge of ones character in order to prescribe for oneself a suitable meditationThere are forty meditation exercises noted by the great teacher Buddhaghosa as being suited to certain types of characterFor the purposes of meditation he considers six characters faithful intelligent and speculative and greedy hating and deludedThe trouble here is twofold firstly very few pure types can be found most people being mixtures of two or more of them  and moreover everchanging mixtures and secondly it is rather difficult to judge which class ones character belongs to since ones own delusion and pride are apt to blur ones judgmentsThis is but one small matter in which the value of the meditation teacher may be discerned very easilyOne may learn much about oneself however by being mindful at the time when some unexpected event takes placeAt that time one can spot ones reaction and the stains which are present in the mindLater judgments are not worth very much since by that time the mind has got round to selfjustifications and other kinds of distortions of the original eventBelow is given the list of the forty meditation exercises with some notes upon their practice the characters which are benefited and the types of stains combated by themThe most widely used meditation exercises are starred recommended for the practice of hate characters because of their pure pleasing colorsApart from the possible exception of  no special moral stain is counteracted by these ten kasinasAs they are to be developed through the eye they will not be very suitable for anyone with weak sightThe only one of the ten kasinas which seems to be practiced much these days is that of light which some people find arises quite naturally when they begin to concentrate the mindWhile Acariya Buddhaghosas explanations in Path of Purification tend to stress the importance of using exterior supports for practice whenever the writer has heard of them being employed they are always in the nature of visions arising internally and being developed from this basisIt appears that contemplations of an exterior earth etckasina is unknown in Thailand recommended for greed charactersThese and similar lists in the Satipatthana Sutta reflect the time when disposal of corpses upon charnelgrounds was commonNow however even in Buddhist lands they are difficult to find let alone in Western countriesTeachers in Thailand at the present time stress that ones own body is to be seen in these ways as a vision arising in the course of minddevelopmentAs these can be fearful one should have the instruction of a skilled teacher for dealing with such visions when they can be of great advantageIt may be stressed here that there is nothing morbid in contemplating such sights interior or exterior as theseThe bodys decay is just something natural but normally it is not seen because people do not like to admit thisInstead of facing bodily decay and bringing it out into the open dead bodies are even made to look attractive by embalmers and cosmeticians and where this cannot be done they are stowed away in beautiful coffins with bright flowers etcBuddhist training makes one look squarely at those aspects of life which normally are not considered nice and makes one calmly face them in respect of ones own mind and bodyThis group of ten has a more miscellaneous character than the previous two groupsIn practicing the first three recollections one recited the lists of qualities of each one of theseOr if the mind does not become concentrated in this way one chooses one particular quality and recites that silently and continuouslyRosaries are used in some places in connection with practice of this sortThe recollections on virtue and generosity are specially good to cultivate in ones old ageOne reviews all the meritorious deeds made by one in the course of life and recollecting them the mind becomes tranquil and happy and having such a mental state at the time of death one is sure to be reborn in very favorable surroundingsOne cannot recollect the celestials except by hearsay unless one has seen themThis practice is suitable for those who have increased the range of their minds and so have made contact with other more subtle beingsDeath may be recollected by intelligent characters since they will not be frightened at the prospects which this practice opens upIt is a great incentive to practice now when one does not know whether even one second from hence one will be aliveThe twentyeighth recollection  on the body  is for greedy characters who need to develop dispassion regarding the bodyThis is achieved by the analysis of the body into thirtytwo unbeautiful parts and then by selecting one or more of these and examining itHowever this practice comes to perfection when with insight the body is illuminated and its various components are clearly seen and their nature understoodThe mindfulness of breathing is recommended for calming and clearing the mind and a person of almost any temperament may practice it with benefit though great care is needed in the subtler ranges of this exerciseThe breathing is never forced but observed constantly with mindfulness the point of concentration being usually the nosetip or nostrilsHowever teachers vary in their practice of itThe recollection of peace says the great Acariya is only of certain benefit to those who have already experienced Nibbana such as streamenterers but others can gain some calm from contemplation of peacefulnessThe peace spoken of here is really Nibbana and as one cannot recollect what one has not known if a worldling this is a practice for the Noble Onesrecommended for hate charactersThese formless absorptions cannot be developed unless one has already perfected the four ordinary absorptions of formIt is said that this group of four may be explored on the basis of the fourth absorptionAs few people are likely to have experienced this we pass on toWhile it is essential for the bhikkhu who has to rely upon collected food lay people can also benefit from this practice which Acariya Buddhaghosa notes is for intelligent characters and is designed to lessen and lead to the destruction of greed and gluttonyThese are earth water fire and air all of which characterize our physical bodiesThese elements may be perceived by an analysis based upon the use of mindfulnessThis practice is also said to be particularly fitted for the intelligent characterThose practices not mentioned in connection with character are suited to anyoneAs all of these practices are aimed at the lessening and eventual destruction of the stains one may appreciate how important they are thought in Buddhist trainingWhere the stains are present there the darkness of unknowing holds sway but where they are not found there shines forth the wisdom and compassion of EnlightenmentThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn the small treatise which follows the good of both bhikkhus and of the lay Buddhist householders has been aimed at and the information presented the writer believes is available in no other bookThe standards of conduct described here are those of the Vinaya wellpracticed and of the laymans discipline wellappliedWhat use indeed is there in presenting other than the high standards laid down by Lord Buddha himself in the Vinaya since falling away from good conduct is all too easy and may all too easily be seen not least in Buddhist landsFor those who follow the training in Buddhist Doctrine and Discipline only the best surely is good enoughAs to terminology the writer has used the Pali word añjali for what is often called placing together the palms of the hands and the fivepointrest for what is commonly called prostrationThis book has greatly benefited from the corrections and additions suggested by my revered upajjhaya VenChao Khun Sasana Sobhana and othersMay this work be for the practical welfare of all who strive on the Path of SaddhammaThe teachings given by Lord Buddha which are preserved and practiced to the present day are known in the ancient texts as the DhammaVinayaAlthough there is a great loss of meaning when translating these two terms into English they may be rendered as Doctrine and aspects of DisciplineNumerous books are given over to explaining aspects of Dhamma but perhaps because of its monastic meaning the Vinaya seems neglected and not given due prominenceIt will be the task of this booklet to examine Vinaya from a particular point of view  that of the Buddhist layman and how a knowledge of some of its rules can be useful to himThis term Vinaya has not only monastic connotationsIt is true that the Vinayacollection contains at great length and in detail the training rules prohibitions allowances and regulations governing a bhikkhus life but there is at least one important instance of the term being applied to the conduct of laypeopleThe subtitle of the famous discourse called the Exhortation to Sigala is Gihivinaya or the Householders Discipline a worthy name for a masterly expositionIn a more narrow sense the laymans Vinaya is his Five Precepts since these have the same function of removing the unskillful as the much greater body of training rules in the Vinayacollection has for a bhikkhuThis is in fact what the word Vinaya means driving out abolishing destruction or removal  that is of all the overt ways of behavior which obstruct progress along the Practicepath of DhammaWhy then were the Vinaya training rules laid downMany times in the Vinayacollection Lord Buddha says On account of O bhikkhus I shall make known the training rule for bhikkhus founded upon these ten reasonsThe great Teacher and Commentator VenBuddhaghosa gives the following versedefinition of the Vinaya in the AtthasaliniThis verse stresses the usefulness of Vinaya in disciplining the body and speech and this again drives home the support given by Vinaya to DhammaTo have one without the other is actually inconceivable from a Buddhist point of viewFor instance a Dhamma taught without Vinaya would be a teaching in which no opening or beginning was shown of a path to be practicedA Vinaya without Dhamma on the other hand would be an empty formalism a discipline bearing little fruit or advantageBoth parts of the Buddhist Dispensation go handinhand whether one considers the bhikkhus or the laymans trainingA good Buddhist layman is one who makes every effort to keep pure the Five Precepts and to practice at least the Dhamma taught in the Exhortation to Sigala In the same way a good bhikkhu strives to train himself without falling into offenses in the training rules of the Patimokkha which at the time of his acceptance as a bhikkhu he has undertaken to observeIt is often said that the laymen keep five while the bhikkhus load is two hundred and twentyseven precepts but for the latter this is only part of the truth since he has besides the fundamental rules in the Patimokkha numerous others to train in these being found scattered throughout the Vinaya CollectionHere we may remark upon one difference between the precepts of a layman and those of a bhikkhuThe former are all of a moral nature such as are esteemed in all religionsFor this reason they fall into the class of natural preceptsBut the bhikkhu besides having precepts of this nature has many more which are special to his mode of lifeThese precepts are called formulatedAlthough they have little or no application in the life of a layman they are very important for the bhikkhu including all sorts of ways of restraint and good conduct proper for himIt should not be thought this latter sort of precept is less important to him than those in the group of natural morality for this would be to apply worldly standards of judgment to a code of discipline designed to promote an unworldly way of lifeThe concern among both bhikkhus and laity for keeping the precepts pure and for not falling into any offense may be called scrupulousnessMany times in the Vinaya is it mentioned that scrupulous bhikkhus would not accept some article until Lord Buddha had made it allowableAgain we find constant references to bhikkhus of few wishes who were ashamed of the unbecoming and unscrupulous behavior of other monksLight is thrown here upon an important connection between precepts generally and the DhammaIn being scrupulous or of few wishes a number of skillful mental factors valuable to ones training are presentAmong these the pair known as shame and fear of blame are actually called by Lord Buddha the guardians of the world Shame is seen when one reproaches oneself for an evil done or about to be done and when one has an inward fear derived from thinking of the unpleasant results to be experienced from that sort of kammaFear of blame is rather the restraint imposed by fear of others censure or by the thought that honorable persons whom one respects such as parents or teachers might get to know of such evilBeing of few wishes is another word for contentment a very valuable quality for a bhikkhuThe other most prominent factor in this scrupulosity and modesty is mindfulness which is indeed at the root of all Buddhist training at whatever levelWhen there is mindfulness however many precepts one keeps it is likely that they will be well and carefully guardedMindfulness makes one careful and skillful even in mental kamma not to mention those involving body and speechIt makes possible that allround restraint often described by the simile of the turtle which creature is immune from danger after having withdrawn its legs and head inside its shellOf the bhikkhu it is saidAll the various rules of the Vinaya might indeed be summed up in these versesFurther we have the famous exhortation of Lord Buddha to the bhikkhus Be perfect in virtue O bhikkhus be perfect in the PatimokkhaDwell restrained according to the PatimokkhaBe perfect in conduct and resort seeing danger even in the slightest faults and train yourselves by undertaking rightly the rules of training It is from such exhortations as this that the scrupulousness of a good bhikkhu is bornHe resolves to make effort to train himself thus I shall be perfect in virtueI shall be perfect in the PatimokkhaI shall dwell restrained perfect in conduct and resort seeing danger even in the slightest faults Unscrupulousness if we consider it in the light of these passages will obviously indicate the presence of unrestraint and lack of mindfulness to say the least and probably the lack of shame and fear of blameQuite often strong currents of craving possibly unrecognized may be involved pride may have a hand and false views so often allied with pride may tangle matters further by throwing out a smokescreen of reasonsHowever this may be the rules of training are praised by Lord Buddha in words which must prevent anyone from regarding them as mere external rules Now all these rules combine together to make up the three trainingsWhat threeThe training in supreme morality the training in supreme collectedness and the training in supreme wisdomHerein are combined one and all of these rules Thus O bhikkhus one who partly fulfills these observances experiences attainment partially while one fulfilling perfectly comes to experience the complete attainmentNot barren of results I declare are these rules of trainingOr we have in Dhammapada verse Reason enough if a bhikkhu has set his heart upon Nibbana to keep the training rules strictlyNow the path of one who has gone forth from home to homelessness and who sincerely tries to train in those rules which he has undertaken is reckoned to lead directly to NibbanaIt is therefore a great evil to obstruct one who has set himself upon this course while it is great puñña to aid such a oneIn the Buddhist dispensation there is mutual help given by bhikkhus to laypeople in the form of Dhamma suitable for their practice and by lay people to bhikkhus when they offer the four supports robes food shelter and medical necessitiesIn this way householders support the community of bhikkhus from among whom those with knowledge and experience support the laity with DhammaJust as no bhikkhu worthy of the robe would cause trouble among lay people but only wish to help them so devoted and knowledgeable householders think only to help bhikkhus and samanerasIn order to do this they must of course have at least some idea of what is and what is not allowable for bhikkhus as laid down by Lord Buddha in the VinayaIt happens that bhikkhus are now traveling more widely and able to visit and live in countries where formerly it was not possible for them to goAlso many people from nonBuddhist lands now travel to and stay in those countries there where is a living tradition of Dhamma some of them becoming interested and wishing to know what should and what should not be done in respect of bhikkhusThere is consequently a need for knowledge among laysupporters and others of some points of VinayaIn this small book the only points dealt with will be those where laypeople are somehow involved while Vinaya matters of concern to bhikkhus alone may be investigated in more comprehensive worksAs the bhikkhus life generally gives many occasions for contact with laypeople and as erring bhikkhus were not absent from the Sangha even in the days of Lord Buddha so there is quite a large body of legislation relating to just these occasionsBecause of the wrong conduct of various bhikkhus Lord Buddha had cause to lay down large numbers of training rules which if infringed would become offenses for the guilty bhikkhuIt sometimes happened that a rule had to be modified and sometimes various allowances proved necessary to qualify the range of the original ruleIn this way many of the training rules were tested in the light of experience until they became perfectly practicalAll these rules fall into seven classes according to the seriousness of the offense involved when they are brokenBriefly these seven classes with some of their characteristics are as followsIn the more detailed considerations below we shall return to some implications of the first and last of theseWe have already seen that Lord Buddha in laying down the training rules for bhikkhus was much concerned with the wellbeing of the laityHe had in mind for instance being in sympathy with householders the pleasing of those not pleased the increase of those pleased alongside more monastic considerationsIn another passage of very frequent occurrence in the Vinaya collection Lord Buddha whenever he rebuked some erring bhikkhu would say It is not foolish man for the pleasing of those not pleased not for the increase of those who are pleased but foolish man it causes displeasure among those who are not pleased as well as in those who are pleased and it causes wavering in someThe very obvious effects which bad conduct by one in robes has upon laypeople is here very strongly emphasizedThe converse is also true since a bhikkhu who has been welltrained under good teachers and learned thoroughly the theory and practice of Dhamma and Vinaya is indeed a great recommendation to the excellence found in the Conquerors dispensationA picture of such a bhikkhu is awakened in the minds eye by Dhammapada verseThe Dhamma which all Buddhists revere as most precious and which is practiced by all who are truly followers of Lord Buddha has been preserved for the people of the present by the SanghaThis community of bhikkhus those who have specialized in Dhamma has been preserved by close adherence to the training rules laid down in the VinayaThat this sequence is true may be seen from several instances in history when bhikkhus no longer paid heed to the Vinaya and so lost the respect and support of the laityNot having this support they drifted towards being householders themselves and having become priests with families they could give less time to learning and practice of DhammaBooks got lost and were not replaced and the tradition became steadily more degenerate until no teaching at all remained  only protectionceremonies and the like often performed in a language not understood even by the priest let alone by the peopleThe present time alas could also show some Buddhist traditions of which these words are trueThis preservation of the Dhamma by Vinaya and hence by the Sangha to whom the Vinaya applies finds expression in a simile in the Vinayaintroduction where it is said Flowers loose upon a flat piece of wood not tied together by thread are scattered about destroyed by the windWhat is the cause of thatSince they were not held together by thread This is said to apply to the teachings of some former Buddhas who gave little of the Dhamma to their disciples and who did not lay down the Vinaya or make known the PatimokkhaIt is a cause for rejoicing that Gotama the Buddha has explained the Dhamma in detail made known the Vinaya and pointed out the fundamental training rules of the PatimokkhaIt is as if Sariputta various flowers placed on a piece of wood tied together by thread are not scattered whirled about or destroyed by the windWhat is the reason for thatThey are well tied together by thread This means simply that the winds of impermanence cannot so easily destroy the various aspects of Dhamma when these are secured by the thread of the VinayaThis brings us to appreciate the reverence which the Vinayacollection is accorded by all true bhikkhus as well as by knowledgeable laymenThis collection is given first place among the three collections of Buddha word a fact which indicates that it is the support and mainstay of the other teachingsAs it is said the Vinaya is the very life of the Teaching so long as the Vinaya endures the Teaching endures therefore let us rehearse the Vinaya firstIf one appreciates that the Vinaya is indeed the mainstay it will not be difficult for Buddhist laity even in nonBuddhist countries to realize that ideas of changing the Vinaya in order as it is said to suit modern conditions find no favor with the Sangha as a wholeThere are many objections to such a course of action in which indeed there would be almost no advantagesIn what follows the writer wishes to examine these objections and to show plainly their dangers and disadvantagesFirstly if one reads through the Vinaya while there are a number of points that apply specially to eastern countries some even being limited to conditions peculiar to ancient India none of these relate to the main principles of the bhikkhulifeThe workings of the Vinaya in the life of the bhikkhu of the present day is not made difficult by obsolete training rulesThose no longer having any application are very few and are really not of great importanceAll the main principles of the bhikkhudiscipline are as valid now as they were when instituted by Lord Buddha two and a half millennia pastThis is indeed a marvelous proof of the wisdom of Lord Buddha who has so well formulated these rulesNor is the structure of the Vinaya absolutely rigid and it does therefore permit necessary adaptations which are still within the spirit of the trainingThe use by bhikkhus of modern methods of transport might be taken as an exampleThis would not have been possible for them if Vinaya was taken as a completely rigid codeSecondly there are the words of Lord Buddha himself So long O bhikkhus as you appoint no new rules and abolish not the existing ones but proceed according to the training rules as laid down so long will bhikkhus be expected to prosper not to decline This statement of the Teacher is always to the fore whenever there are gatherings of senior bhikkhus meeting to determine some Vinaya questions arising out of modern conditionsOr there are such exhortations from sources outside the Pali canon as these words attributed to Lord Buddha O bhikkhus after my Parinibbana you should revere and honor the precepts of the PatimokkhaTreat them as a light which you have discovered in the dark or as a poor man would treat a treasure he had foundYou should know that they are your chief guide and there should be no difference from when I yet remained in the worldThen there is a consideration based upon the events of the First SangayanaIn this great gathering of arahants Venerable Mahakassapa who was its president put forward this motion If it seems right to the Sangha the Sangha should not lay down what has not been laid down nor should it abolish what has been laid downIt should proceed in conformity with and according to the training rules which have been laid downThis is the motionYour reverences let the Sangha listen to meIf it seems right to the Sangha the Sangha should notIt is pleasing to the Sangha therefore it is silentThus do I understand All those who are accepted as bhikkhus in the present day follow this tradition as laid down in the First SangayanaThis is Theravada tradition it is based upon the decision of those great elders who were ennobled with the highest nobilityWho are we indeed to go astray from their wayAlthough the Teacher before his Parinibbana spoke thus After my passing Ananda let the Sangha if it so desires abolish the lesser and minor rules of training no Sangha anywhere actually ventured to do this partly because of the uncertainty in defining the lesser and minor rules and partly because they were constrained out of respect to preserve that which had been instituted by the great TeacherAcariya Nagasena explains that the Tathagata spoke thus testing the bhikkhus Will my disciples on being left by me adhere to the passing or will they repudiate themThere is also the consideration that those of other sects might say While the Teacher was alive his disciples respected and honored his precepts but now that he is no more they throw off the training But principally the reason was devotion arising from the successful practice of Dhamma VinayaSupposing that someone proclaimed that he wished to reform the VinayaIn doing this or in trying to do this he would depart from Theravada tradition and place himself apart from others following Theravada and would in fact only start a new sect and who is in honor of sectarianismIf he were a bhikkhu by his departure from the training laid down in the Vinaya he would only bring upon himself offenses being burdened with which and failing to confess them he would be precluded from making much progress on the practice path of DhammaAgain who will change the VinayaAs the Vinaya is the province of bhikkhus lay people obviously cannot do soOne bhikkhu cannot effect any changes since Vinayadecisions are arrived at after the consultation of a sanghaA sangha of young bhikkhus is not qualified to do so since decisions arrived at by them might well be swayed by preferences or be based upon both lack of learning and lack of purity of heartA sangha of senior bhikkhus competent to decide upon Vinayaquestions will scarcely undertake such a task since their training has imbued them with a deep sense of respect for the VinayaAny decision arrived at by a meeting of less than all bhikkhus in the world would be sectarian in character and be the cause of SanghaschismEven if such a gathering could be contrived not only would respect for the traditions of the arahant elders easily triumph but also the dissident voices would be found to represent somewhat unbalanced individualsActually no one at all can be found who would be competent to undertake changing the Vinaya Another point to consider is that even if changes were agreed upon by all competent authorities and the Sangha therefore unanimous how far are such changes to go and when will this changing ever stopThis question among all other considerations here has always deterred Theravada Elders from effecting any changesVenChao Khun Sasana Sobhana writing in Siam recently says The argument of the Theravada Buddhists against the revision of the Vinaya is that while it is true that towards the end of his life the Buddha did give permission to his disciples to suspend the minor rules the First Council was not able to reach an agreement as to what minor rules signified They have thus remained in the Patimokkha until the present time and have thus ensured that the standard of conduct and the direction of the training have remained the same as they were in the Buddha timeVenPaññavaddho in his review of the Bangkok edition of The Patimokkha has written It has been said by some people that in this modern day and age some or many of the rules are archaic restrictive or otherwise undesirable in the greatly altered circumstances of modern civilizationBut it must be remembered that the Vinaya with the Patimokkha as its basis has maintained stability in the Sangha since the time of Lord BuddhaFinally there is a consideration based upon the nature of the training and the end which it has in viewFrom the Buddhatime down to the present it has been found that a careful application of the Vinayas principles by a bhikkhu in his life promotes his practice and understanding of Dhamma Vinaya leads to restraint restraint to the absence of remorse absence of remorse leads to joy joy to delight delight to tranquility tranquility leads to happiness happiness to collectedness collectedness to knowledge and vision of the truly existent knowledge and vision of the truly existent to revulsion revulsion to dispassion dispassion to freedom freedom to knowledgeandvision of freedom and knowledgeofvision to freedom leads to Nibbana free from substrata When Vinaya has been so formulated as to guide a bhikkhu to the goal of Nibbana who shall entertain thoughts altering itIt is we who have to change by our practice of DhammaVinaya to come up to its level and not to expect it to change for usIn this connection there is a little fableAt one time there was a great and flourishing tree standing as it had stood for many many hundreds of yearsIt was so beautiful that men and women bringing their children would come from scores of miles about to gaze in wonder at its perfect and majestic shapeUnder its mighty spread of branches multitudes could sit down enjoying its cool shadeEven animals would come and delight themselves according to their several habits some upon the grass beneath and some sporting amid the profusion of leaves flowers and fruitsAnd such flowers of such fragrance  no one knew where else their like might be foundAnd such fruits as this tree bore and in such abundanceNo wonder that they are called best highest foremost and supreme among all fruits produced by other treesSo the seasons and the years rolled by and still the mighty tree stood hardly changed for where one branch died off another grew to replace itThe delight of many beings visible and invisible was in the health and long life of this ancient treeThen in accordance with the change inherent in things fashions changed and trees in their natural vigor were no longer praised but trimmed and artificiallyshaped trees were thought more beautifulAgitation began among some men for the tree to be shaped up according to modern tasteEventually due to debased ideas of people by that time loppers and clippers tried their hands upon the millennial giantBranch after branch fell loaded with flowers and bearing fruitsNever mind they said it will look much better when we have finished Before long the tree was pruned into the form of a perfect cube and this was regarded by almost everyone with satisfactionOnly a few ignorant people regretted the sawnoff limbs and bare branches with a few clusters of leaves left here and thereThese illeducated persons were heard regretting the lack of any shadeHow stupid of themIt is needless to say that the venerable tree flowered and bore fruit no more and due to shock died shortly afterwards leaving only its great but dead framework which then became an object for the speculative theses of numerous men of booksThus it is that most bhikkhus generally would not talk of changing but of tampering with the VinayaAfter all when closely examined many proposals to bring about changes in the body of Vinaya are found to be based upon the roots of unskillA simple case will illustrate this A bhikkhu experiences pangs of hunger in the evening which cause him to announce that he does not believe in strictly following Vinaya in this respect since this would be an extreme of selftorture the climate is too cold modern times demand a change I follow Mahayana  or one of a thousand such excusesHe accordingly proposes that the training rule regarding not taking food afternoon and before dawn be abolishedAfter all he reasons it is only a pacittiya offense  nothing much Meanwhile he has a good supper every night not only his belly but also his greed that root of unskill are thoroughly satisfiedIf the former is a little distended the latter is certainly greatly increased while the spirit of renunciation has fled from his dwellingAnd of course where greed is increased so automatically is aversion and dullness and so onAnyone  whether bhikkhu or layman  who holds such a view or reasoning concerning his training rules as the imaginary bhikkhu above actually makes for himself a real stumblingblock upon his own pathThe mental attitude of thinking Oh it does not matter its only a little thing is one to watch since it appears at the gate of the wide and easy path leading downwardsSuch slack ways of thinking really urged on by some hidden craving are just the reverse of the disciplined scrupulousness upon which so much stress is laid in the VinayaSlackness and strictness in regard to the Vinaya are not to be associated in any wholesale fashion with this yana or that vadaIn Theravada as in other Buddhist traditions there are those bhikkhus who are strict as well as those who are slackWherever there is a good Teacher who is concerned with the practical application of the Dhamma there the Vinaya will be carefully followedBut where neither such a Teacher nor a good Vinaya tradition are found there undisciplined behavior will result with a victory for notDhammaOne important principle to remember about the Vinaya is that a life based upon its principles is very different from the ordinary lifeThe Vinaya guides a bhikkhu in conducting himself so as to go against the stream and his life and way of doing things is often opposed to the ways of one who enjoys the five strands of sensepleasures Take food again as an exampleAn ordinary person not undertaking any religious discipline may eat his mind delighted by senseimpressions of taste smell color and so forth and probably therefore overwhelmed with greedHe may chatter with others and if the food is delicious overeatRestraint and mindfulness by contrast are the marks of a good bhikkhu taking his food which he regards as medicine to keep his body going and should greed arise he uses the meditation upon the loathsomeness of food to dissolve itHe talks but little has his senses under control and eats only moderatelyThe reason for this difference of attitude is not hard to seeOne who is blown about by the winds of craving throughout his life not understanding kamma and its fruits and therefore not grasping the meaning of dukkha is set on no sure course and wins little advantage in his or her life as a human beingOne who wishes to become a bhikkhu on the other hand has determined upon a definite course of action which is given guidance by the Vinaya and his practice of it after his acceptanceThe Dhammapada emphasizes thisIt may be that some of the training rules to be dealt with below will seem strange and complicated  even unnecessaryThey are unnecessary for a layman but they have a definite part in the life of a bhikkhu and help him generally in developing that scrupulousness which is so essential to bhikkhulifeFor this reason laypeople who are so fortunate as to be able to invite a good bhikkhu to their towns should be truly pleased to help him keep the VinayaThose who do this which is the doing of what is a little difficult and therefore requires effort but bears splendid fruit are themselves undertaking the training rightlyA bhikkhu such as the verses below depict is really worthy of help and supportIn the following Vinaya information useful to laymen most emphasis will be upon the offenses incurred in certain situations by bhikkhus and how laypeople can help them avoid these together with remarks upon the customary conduct of laypeople in the presence of a bhikkhuAs in Buddhist countries the laypeoples code of manners and conduct is much influenced by the seventyfive trainings a group of rules kept by both bhikkhus and samaneras it seems appropriate to include this matter hereThe writer has for the sake of easy reference gathered the various points some suggested through the kindness of others under five headings Greetings Livingquarters Food and Drink Travel and General ConductIn the Conclusion are set out some observations upon the way bhikkhus are regarded by the laypeople of Siam at the present timeIt is generally felt in Buddhist countries that the common western form of greeting the handshake is unsuitable when greeting bhikkhusThe point here is that a bhikkhu must avoid all body contact with womenSince if lust arose in him he could be embroiled in a heavy offense entailing formal meetingFor these reasons it is obvious that the handshake is not a suitable greeting and in the case of a bhikkhu if one has invited him knowing that he has knowledge and experience of Dhamma which is not ones own then greeting by handshake will not express ones willingness to learn as well as do the traditional gesturesIn a public place a bhikkhu is traditionally welcomed and parted by action of añjali inclining the head and sometimes the bodyThis position of the hands is associated in theistic religions with prayer but its use and meaning in Buddhist tradition is rather differentHere given space one might elaborate a little upon relationships of mentality with materiality and the reverseSuffice it to say that there are certain gestures and positions of the body which lead to the arising maintenance or increase of skillful and concentrated mental statesWe are concerned here with two of them action of añjali and what is usually called prostration but which we prefer to call the fivepointrest or lowering the bodyOf these action of añjali is commonly seen when laypeople greet bhikkhus at stations in the streets within a hall or other public placeThe amount of respect thus accorded to a particular bhikkhu tends to be expressed by the height at which the hands are held and the angle at which the head and body are inclinedHowever any exaggerated form of añjali is disliked and not encouraged since it usually expresses some mental strain in the mind of the persons making itWhat has been said here also applies to all novices and junior bhikkhus when respecting their seniors in the SanghaIt is also widely used by Buddhist lay people when greeting each otherAnother point which should be mentioned and which applies both to action of añjali and fivepoint rest is that the action of respecting one who knows Dhamma by one who wishes to learn is for the benefit of the latterThrough associations with prayer which will be present on many western minds it is often assumed that these actions when performed by Buddhists are act s of propitiation or are somehow for the benefit of whoever is on the receiving endThis is indeed very far from the truth since even when Lord Buddha was teaching he said But also bhikkhus if others should speak in praise of me in praise of the Dhamma or in praise of the Sangha you should not on that account be filled with pleasure and gladness or be lifted up in mind that also would become a danger to your own selvesThis is certainly true of good bhikkhus of the present who will know that to have a mind that is stuck in the desire of praise and honor which is one of the eight worldly conditions is also one of the marks of an ignorant worldly person and far from the ideal of the Noble Disciple to which he aspiresThus a bhikkhu does not teach the advantages of the action of añjali and fivepoint rest because he wants to be honored but because these things are skillful ways of conduct and increase the puñña of those performing themAccording to a famous verse this puñña increases in four waysJust as a bhikkhu will honor the feet by the fivepoint lowering before his preceptor teacher or any elder bhikkhu or at shrines and in temples where there are Buddhaimages so do lay people lower themselves to their bhikkhuteacher of DhammaThis they generally do in a relatively quiet and enclosed space such as temple bhikkhus lodging or in their own houses where they may have invited bhikkhus for teaching chanting or for making puñña by giving giftsAt the time when they respect a Buddhaimage their Teacher or other bhikkhus in either of these ways they encourage their children to do likewise thus early inculcating a sense of respect which is bound to bear good fruits in the futureHappiness and peace characterize the faces of those who perform these acts of reverence with careAfter all is not happiness associated with an absence of mental strainsSome laypeople however do these things carelessly so that they become unmindful of their meaning and benefits but those who really aspire to make progress on the Path never do so unmindfully however often they have cause to greet with the añjali or lower the body in the fivepoint restIn the West where these customs are not established among Buddhists and where bhikkhus are in any case very few in number carelessness is not likely to be a hindrance although there is another one which deserves a little attentionAmong some people one finds what amounts to a strong aversion to the practice of lowering the bodyIt may be that they hold some wrong view perhaps an unconscious trait persisting from Protestant ChristianityPerhaps it may be connected with the idea dealt with above that the other requires or expects to be worshipped or perhaps compounded with some view which is like a smokescreen put out to conceal the true cause for objection  which is prideIt is the head which contains the eyes ears nose tongue many touch organs and that agglomeration of nerve tissue called the brain a circumstance which powerfully reinforces the idea of egoThat this topmost and splendid piece of apparatus should be lowered to the ground at the feet of another will naturally cause the mental strain of pride to object and perhaps to put out a smokescreen Its not part of our culture Its only an eastern custom etcThe modern world manages most successfully to stimulate all the mental stains in manAmong them the mental stain of pride is fostered by such notions as Im as good as any man As far as the training in DhammaVinaya is concerned such ideas do not apply and it is the humble man who goes forward not he who is stiff with pride and therefore has no chance to learnA Tibetan work Trees and Water puts it like this Just as the branch adorned with good fruits is bent down beneath their weight so a wise mans mind adorned with all qualities is bent downwards with humility and calm and knows no pridejust as the fruitless branch of a tree has the nature to grow aloft so the head of the haughty man is always held high for his heart is not humbleThe traditional position of lowering the body cannot be excelled for encouraging humilityIt is known as the fivepoint lowering since in making it five points are on the ground the forehead the two forearms the two kneesIt is common for bhikkhus to acknowledge respectful salutation in either of these ways by saying Sukhi hotu and in Siam often Ayu vañño sukham balamIn English May you be happy seems very suitable since all Dhamma practices undoubtedly bring happinessWhat has been written here has only been set down with a view that laypeople should understand as bhikkhus and samaneras have been taught to understand what is truly beneficialNeither Lord Buddha nor any teacher in Buddhist tradition has ever prescribed that this or that sort of greeting for bhikkhus must be madeThere is actually no rigid formality about this at all and much the same course of individual conduct applies in a Buddhist country like Siam as commonly applies in the days of Lord Buddha Having approached some lowered themselves before the Lord and sat down to one side some greeted the Lord politely and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way sat down to one side some by their action of añjali to the Lord sat down to one side some proclaimed their name and clan and sat down while others without saying anything just sat down likewise The commentary upon this frequently recurring passage in the Suttas makes it quite clear however that those who greeted him with humility reaped ample fruits while those who just sat down were people with minds beset by pride false views and the restThe information gathered here and elsewhere in this book is the writer believes very difficult to come by in other worksYet this is standard practice in the East where it never has to be explained since people are in contact with living traditionAs and when readers also make contact with a living Buddhist tradition it will also be useful for themIn a Buddhist country when a bhikkhu has cause to go to some place where there is no vihara he will probably stay in a house with laypeopleIf they are reasonably wealthy a small room will have been set aside by them as a family shrine and in this the bhikkhu will be invited to stay study meditate and sleepIt is customary that only bhikkhus are invited to sleep in a shrineroom no member of the family doing so that room being reserved at other times for puja and meditationIf Buddhists in other lands are able to set aside such a room for their own special devotion and practice it may prove very useful when they are able to welcome a bhikkhuIts position in the house must of course be decided by circumstances but relative quietness is a consideration and it is preferable to have it upon an upper floorIn houses where gardens contain a small detached outbuilding this will be even more suitableThere are some offenses into which a bhikkhus may fall regarding his place of lodgingThe first is that he cannot sleep in the same room with one who is not fully ordained as a bhikkhu except for a limited period of three nights while a second training rule states should any bhikkhu sleep along with a woman this entails expiation The commentary takes this to mean under the same roof but as this will cause much inconvenience it should rather be taken that he should have a room to himself away from one in which a woman sleepsThere is here the consideration seen in many places in the Vinaya that not only should a bhikkhu be able to maintain his special mode of life with ease but also that his repute the reputation of the Sangha as a whole and of course the good name of the Dhamma should in no way suffer not even from those who might invent and spread malicious gossipFor these reasons strict bhikkhus are most circumspect in their meetings with women while wellinformed women in Buddhist lands help a bhikkhu by their modest and careful behavior to keep to his code of disciplineIn the handling of certain things there are offenses for a bhikkhu these therefore need not be left about in his place of residenceIn this list there are both animate and inanimateThus women and girls however small are included here it being an offense for him to touch one even though his mind is quite free from sensual intentionsThus women keep their distance from the bhikkhu and avoid actions which could lead him to come into contact with themIt may be emphasized once again that this is simply for the good of the bhikkhu concerned who since arahants are not easily met with is still capable of experiencing lustLord Buddhas teachings as one soon sees are always realisticWomens clothes and articles of jewelry and cosmetics also cannot be touched by himNeither can female animals dolls or moneyRegarding money there are some bhikkhus who are of the opinion that this training rule cannot be kept in the modern world they are willing to handle it for their own transportLaypeople are also heard to criticize bhikkhus who do not agree to handle money on the grounds that this impedes the work of spreading DhammaOn the other hand there are traditions where bhikkhus bear in mind that this is an offense of expiation with forfeiture while Lord Buddha has I do not say O bhikkhus that in any way may gold or silver be consented to may be looked about for The Second Sangayana ruled that it was inadmissible for bhikkhus to possess money and referred to the training rule in the PatimokkhaWhere this rule is fully adhered to laypeople do not therefore give money to bhikkhus nor expect them to carry itMoney can be made available for the use of a bhikkhu but not given to himSuch money which is called after that which it purchases the four supports remains the property of the donor but is kept by the bhikkhus steward or attendant to be used whenever this becomes necessaryAt the time when such four supports are made available the donor may say to a bhikkhu I invite you sir with this sum of for the four supports at the same time handing that amount to the bhikkhus stewardOr a bhikkhu may receive from the hand of a layman a slip of paper reading I invite you with the four supports equal in amount to the sum of which has already been handed to the stewardAs you have need of it please request it from him Whatever is needed is then bought by the steward from that moneyIn this tradition a bhikkhu has no money troubles and may leave such affairs to his stewardHe is thus free from thoughts on having only a little and not troubled by thoughts of what he will buy if there be much moneyHe can therefore concentrate on the work of Dhamma and Vinaya which he has chosen as his lifeOther items which it is not allowable for a bhikkhu to touch include fruits weapons poisons nets and snares seeds and musical instrumentsGenerally he will have no need of radio or television eitherPerhaps one of the bestknown training rules of the bhikkhu concerns his not eating between midday and dawn it is an offense for him even to touch food  let alone eat it  during this period which is called the wrongtime Laypeople keeping the eight precepts upon Uposatha days or at other times have basically the same disciplineAs the sixth precept they recite I undertake the training rule refraining from eating at the wrong time A samanera has also to keep this precept every day while he commits himself to observe the ten training rules for novicesIt has many advantages both for the bhikkhu and samanera as well as for laypeopleThe former benefit since they have free time thoughts not concerned with food and lightness of the body which is suitable for study meditation and so onAs for the latter they are not burdened by having to prepare food for bhikkhus at nightAlthough not included among the heavy offenses this training rule will not be broken by the scrupulous bhikkhu since its breaking implies giving way to craving losing the spirit of renunciation encumbering the stomach and hence making minddevelopment more not less difficultThe right time for bhikkhus to eat begins when the day is light enough to see the lines on the palms of ones hand and ends at noonDuring this time a bhikkhu may eat once or twiceIf the former then an adequate quantity of food is needed to last for twentyfour hours while if he eats twice the second meal is usually served about quarter past eleven so as to finish well before noonThere are very few dietary restrictions and these are reasonable ruling out the consumption of certain animals flesh and also that of human beingsHere we may briefly consider the question of meat in relation to the bhikkhuThe word bhikkhu is derived from the root bhikkh  to begAlthough a bhikkhu when he goes out to obtain almsfood does not beg since he is not allowed to ask for food still he is largely dependent upon whatever is put into his bowlAfter he has returned to the vihara he may if he wishes select whatever vegetable foods he has been given and eat only thatIn this respect it is proper to remember that when Devadatta requested Lord Buddha for a ruling that bhikkhus should abstain from flesh the latter did not agree to rule thus saying And the eating of flesh that is pure in three respects that is to say that the eater has not seen heard or suspected that it has been killed is allowable There is also the Discourse to Jivaka on the same subject and the oftquoted Amagandha Discourse in which the evils of illconduct in so many ways are pointed out as much more harmful than the eating of meatWe may summarize by saying that as far as his almsround is concerned a bhikkhu receives whatever is offered without discriminationIf he wishes to be a vegetarian he may choose from among the food placed in his bowl although where he receives only little this will be very difficult for himIn any case whether almsfood or that brought to the vihara by laysupporters he cannot ask for this or that kind of food unless he is ill when it is allowable to do soIn countries where the almsround is not possible a bhikkhu or a sangha of bhikkhus will be dependent upon laypeople who agree to give supportWhere a number of bhikkhus are staying laypeople will organize the buying cooking and offering of food in the way most convenient to them and in accordance with the VinayaThere is no need for food offered by them to be special but it should be nutritiousTherefore laypeople should not ask Do you like or What shall we cook for you today The bhikkhu tradition is to accept whatever laypeople wish to offer from the food they have themselves in this way being as little trouble as possible to householders of whom it is as true now as it was in Lord Buddhas days that they have a lot to doA bhikkhu cannot go to a restaurant or shop and buy or order foodNor can he personally store food overnightOnce food has been formally offered to him it must be consumed by him before noon or else left for laypeople to finishAgain a bhikkhu cannot cook for himselfStoring or cooking may however be done by a samanera or by a laydisciple in the viharaThe principle underlying these three training rules is that greed everready to spring up where food is concerned should of course be discouraged while the bhikkhus dependence upon laypeople is greatly stressedHe is taught to reflect everyday My life is dependent upon others  this should frequently be reflected on by one gone forthWe should now deal briefly with the formal offering of food and other items to bhikkhuIt is a slight offense for a bhikkhu intentionally to touch  let alone consume  food or drinks which have not been offeredThe reason lying behind this rule is not difficult to seeA bhikkhu is always very careful to avoid any act which could even be interpreted as approaching an offense of defeatTaking what is not given with intent to steal is a defeatoffense and even if he has not fallen completely into this he may have a grave offense to confessHence the importance of formal offeringThis offering is done by placing into his hands every item to be consumed except these things be on a tray when this may be offeredA layman raises from the table plates and dishes bearing food with both hands or with the left hand touching the right wrist when the item concerned is a small one and gives each one into the hands of the bhikkhuIf there are a number of bhikkhus the most senior is offered food first and the others in due order afterwardsIt is not necessary to offer food into the hands of samaneras as this training rule does not apply to themHaving completed the offering a layman will usually salute with añjali and then take a seat a little to one side waiting to see whether he can be of any further helpHe should not after having placed the food into the hands of bhikkhus touch it again if he does so that food or drink must be reoffered Should he receive anything from the hands of a bhikkhu whether it is food or such things as paper or books etc it is again skillful training for the layman to salute with añjali before taking itDue to the training rules above bhikkhus cannot share food from the same dishes as those being used by laypeople and it is customary to give them their food apartIn a family this could be just one end of the table while in any lay assembly where many are dining bhikkhus should have a table specially set aside for themSamaneras since they do not have the acceptance into the Sangha as bhikkhus cannot share food with the latter and should be given separate food they traditionally eat sitting elsewhereAs honored guests in the houses of laypeople bhikkhus are offered their food before the family sits down to eat or when there is not time for this their food is first formally offered to them before the others eatSince it is an offense for a bhikkhu to eat or drink standing he should always be offered a seatHe cannot therefore take food buffetstyle since eating is for him a serious matter a meditation and not an occasion for delight or gossipSo far we have referred to a layman offering the food but the case is different when a laywoman makes the offeringA bhikkhu does not receive anything directly from the hands of a woman but she may place whatever is to be offered upon the small receivingcloth which a bhikkhu carriesOnce she has placed it upon this cloth it is considered to be offered into his handsIn formulating such ways of conduct as these the theras of the first Sangayana have been most careful to guard against physical contact between the sexes so that no possibility of slander or of infatuation might ariseOne may here remember the opening suttas of Anguttara Nikaya O bhikkhus I do not perceive at all any other form which thus stands taking hold of the mind of man as does this the form of woman sound scent taste the touch of womanO bhikkhus I do not perceive at all any other form which thus stands taking hold of the mind of woman as does this the form of man sound scent taste touch of man These words of Lord Buddha find practical expression in the Vinaya training rules for both bhikkhus and for bhikkhunisAs regards placing food into a bhikkhus bowl which is in his hands whether he is standing as on the almsround or sitting in a laymans house there is no difference between the way it is done by a layman and a laywomanNor does the bowl have to be offered to him since it is in his handsOther articles besides food and drink which should be offered to him include anything which will go inside the body such as medicinesAlso his bowl robes and other requisites if they are touched by laypeople as these are then considered to be out of his possessionUpon occasions of making puñña when bhikkhus are invited the gifts which are offered to them by the laity such as flowers incense candles medicines and any other items useful for their lives may also be formally offeredIf such an occasion is during the wrongtime and laypeople wish to offer food in tins or jars these things cannot be placed into his hands or accepted by him but intimation is made to the bhikkhus of its offering and it is put aside to be kept by a samanera or laydiscipleSuch small points as these constitute not only a discipline for bhikkhus but also for the laity who may thereby grow in carefulnessIt was emphasized above that offering whether by a layman or laywoman is made with both handsThis is not simply some sort of ritual but has a very good reason behind itWhen one gives something in the ordinary way the giving is done with one hand if the object permits itThis kind of giving may as a fact become habitual in the sense that one is not aware any more of giving and from a Buddhist point of view this shows slackness of mind and lack of careNow bhikkhus who are striving on the Path of DhammaVinaya are said to be a good field for puñña  that is the results to be expected from giving to them as they strive towards Nibbana leading a pure life are great indeed and will result in clarity and peace increasing in the hearts of the donorsThus it becomes important when making offerings to bhikkhus whether of their daily food or upon some special occasion to make the offering consciously with a strong intention of givingThe stronger the intention which is here skillful kamma the greater the fruits of happiness reaped by the donorsSo that laypeople are reminded to make this givingintention strong they are instructed to offer with both hands  an act which requires more forethought than the usual ways of givingRespect is also expressed in this method of offering and it is also used by new bhikkhus and samaneras when presenting anything to their teachers or preceptorsThe meal having been consumed a bhikkhu chants briefly verses of wellwishing for the laityIt is actually an offense of wrongdoing for him not to do so if laypeople are presentThe least which is done will be for a senior bhikkhu to say a few words such as Longlife and beauty happiness and strengthWhether laypeople have also finished eating or whether they have not yet begun at least the donor will sit quietly with folded hands listening to these words or verses of wellwishingEvery word of the Pali verses may not be understood but it is more important that the mind should be concentrated upon the chanting to the exclusion of everything elseA mindful and concentrated mind is always full of skillfulnessFrequently such chants as are translated below form the core of wellwishingAt the close of the chanting it is the custom in many places to say Sadhu sadhu and then to raise the hands in añjali to the forehead to lower the bodySadhu means it is well and is an expression of delighted approval heard everywhere in Buddhist countries when a deed of puñña has been done such as giving helping listening to Dhamma and so forthAs regards drinking a bhikkhu may not drink distilled or fermented intoxicantsBefore noon any other drink may be offered to him with or without milkAfter twelve oclock noon it is not allowable for him to take milk cereals eggs etc nor any kind of soupHe may be offered any fruit juice or any of the bottled soft drinks which are now commonThe five medicines allowable over a period of seven days may also be taken by him if he is indisposedThe first of these ghee is generally not available outside India but the other four are common butter vegetable oil honey molassesIf more of these is accepted by him than he can consume in one evening it may be kept by him for seven days at mostAny remaining after this time he cannot consume without falling into an offenseIt is thus common for these medicines to be kept by a samanera or laydisciple to be offered as they are neededTea coffee and cocoa are also allowable during the afternoon and eveningWith these allowable drinks and fortified in any case by having few desires and some ability to endure bhikkhus sustain themselves for study practice or teachingSince a bhikkhu keeping strictly to the Vinaya will not handle money if he is being invited to teach or to stay it is customary in Buddhist countries for a layman to come and fetch himWhere distance prevents this train tickets may be bought and sent to himIf the journey is a long one he may be accompanied by a laydisciple who will buy tickets and the bhikkhus food at the right timeWhen he is traveling alone it is usual to meet him at the stationA bhikkhu commits an offense if he makes an arrangement to go on a journey with a woman so that if he is accompanied his companion must be a manThis is another provision to prevent offenses and to stop the wagging of slanderous tonguesWhen the bhikkhu travels by car a woman should not sit beside him though of course a man may do soIt is preferable that he does not travel in a car with only a woman who is drivingThere are also several places to which it is not proper to take bhikkhus such as the following which are called the wrong resort for bhikkhus namely crowded places or places of entertainment theaters concert halls cinemas stadiums gamesfields exhibitions fairs casinos nightclubs brothels army parades and even fields of battleIt is commonsense that bhikkhus have no need for the various sorts of sensestimulation provided by such placesIn Buddhist countries such as Siam the general conduct of laypeople in the presence of bhikkhus is molded upon the discipline followed by bhikkhus and samaneras when they are in the presence of therasMuch of this code of good conduct is contained in the articles of the seventyfive Trainings found in the PatimokkhaRather than comment upon all these we may select the most important groups of points for outline explanationBuddhist laypeople living in Siam have a good chance to acquaint themselves with the details of this conduct since they can at any time go to a Wat where Vinaya is well observed and see for themselves how bhikkhus do thingsThey have another chance also not available to most Western Buddhists for the custom here is that most young men ask for temporary ordination over periods of time ranging from one to four monthsWhile they are in the robes they learn among other things how to conduct themselves in the manner proper to those that have gone forthEvery day they receive instruction in the Vinaya which includes of course the seventyfive TrainingsNot only that for these Trainings while they constitute only small offenses when broken actually are very important since they cover events of everyday occurrence such as walking sitting wearing robes eating teaching and listening to DhammaWhen these temporarilyordained monks disrobe and return to their homes they take with them experience of a good discipline and it is this which becomes the basis for lay conduct in the presence of bhikkhusAs this training in good conduct applies to contact between laypeople and bhikkhus almost as much as it does between junior bhikkhus and theras there is a considerable basis for common understanding and hence concordWhat sort of things are included in this trainingFirst we may mention regulation of the body in the four positions the first of these being walkingWhen walking in company with a bhikkhu a layperson will walk somewhat behind him rather than immediately at his side and certainly not push in front always giving way to him where this is necessaryThis is particularly important if the bhikkhu is talking Dhamma when it will be an offense for him to follow behind a layperson or to walk to one side of the path while doing soThe ancient Buddhist tradition from India prescribes that one should as a mark of respect keep ones right side towards ones teacher the right side of the body being symbolically that associated with conscious effort and general skillfulness in conductIf a bhikkhu is sitting and a layman has occasion to pass in front of him it is good training in mindfulness to stoop the body and head and perhaps say something like Excuse me sir Again if a layman or woman should enter a room where a bhikkhu is sitting and perhaps talking Dhamma with others he or she usually performs the action of añjali or lowers the body according to what is suitable before sitting downIn standing one should not stand upon a higher step or level than a bhikkhu and talk to himWe have in the English the phrase to look up to implying respect and if one is learning Dhamma that is what one should do literally as well as figurativelyStanding one does not stand too near or too far but at the right distanceOnes hand should be clasped in front and ones body controlled while talking to a bhikkhuIn Buddhist countries agreement or questions are accompanied by the action of añjali in the case of talking to a senior bhikkhuAll these bodily actions help one to correct the mind and ensure that it is functioning in a way proper for the reception of DhammaShould the bhikkhu be barefooted as is often the case in the East a lay person with shoes on will not talk to him but remove his or her shoes firstThis is because it is an offense for him to talk dhamma to one who is wearing shoes when he is not though this situation is not likely to occur in the cold countries of the WestWhen sitting especially if Dhamma is the subject of a bhikkhus speech one should sit attentively and not sprawling in a chairIt is also against the spirit of the Vinaya for a bhikkhu to teach Dhamma to one who is smokingHowever smoking is bound to distract from listening to Dhamma and is often a sign of unmindful or tense states of mindAll such conditions are opposed to the profitable and attentive hearkening with which Dhamma should be receivedDhamma is so important so valuable that it becomes an offense for a bhikkhu to teach it to anyone who shows by his bodily position that his mind is not concentrated to receive itThe body should be controlled when sitting such that the feet are tucked in under a chair with the back reasonably erect and hands placed comfortably in the lapIn sitting down a layperson is careful to notice whether the chair he is about to sit upon has a bhikkhus robe upon itIf so he will sit elsewhere or else remove the robe offering it to the bhikkhuAs the robe is a symbol of pure life in Dhamma it is never sat upon or leaned against by laypeopleA seat taken by a layman or woman should not be higher than that used by the bhikkhu and if several people are seated on the ground a bhikkhu should be given a separate mat to sit uponAll these sorts of things are also observed by good bhikkhus in the presence of their teachers and other theras and make for a spirit of respect and harmonyThen in lying down laymen if they do so in the same room as a bhikkhu will never point their feet at himNor for that matter will any Buddhist whether in robes or wearing white lie down with his feet pointing towards any respected or sacred object in a room such as Buddhaimages stupas pictures of the Buddha or of any teacher alive or dead Buddhist scriptures and so onThe head is always placed in their direction and usually before lying down a triple lowering is made to any shrine etc which happens to be in the roomOn the same principles as those set out above if a bhikkhu is sitting a layperson does not talk to him standing but after lotussing or lowering the body sits down to talk while if a bhikkhu is standing a layman will stand to talk with himIt is part of the reasonableness of this training that almost none of the usual lay conduct mentioned here is performed if a layperson is illIf one approaches a bhikkhu to give something while he is sitting ones head should not be higher than his own and better lowerThis avoids leaning over him and also helps the donor to give with a humble mind which in itself will bear good fruitsGenerally in talking to bhikkhu one should try to avoid unsuitable subjects of discussionBhikkhus were several times rebuked by Lord Buddha for engaging in animaltalk which is defined by this quite common passage in the discourses Talk about kings and robbers ministers and armies danger and war eating and drinking clothes and dwellings garlands and scents relations vehicles villages and markets towns and districts women and heroes street talk talk by the well talk about those departed in days gone by idle chatter talk upon the world and the sea and also on gain and lossWhen one comes to think about it this list covers most of the subjects to be found in our newspapersA layman may also remember that right speech the third constituent of the Eightfold path is defined as restraint from lying slander rough speech and chatterNor is it suitable to ask a bhikkhu what food and drink he likes unless he is illAgain it is not proper to ask about the attainments which he has won through his DhammapracticeIt is an offense of expiation for a bhikkhu to tell a layman even the truth regarding his own attainments and an offense of Defeat should he be tempted to lie saying that he has won what has not been won by himAlso among requests which are improper as they could embroil a bhikkhu in what is notDhamma are questions upon luck signs stars and palmsAll this is called animalknowledge by Lord Buddha and he has made it an offense of wrongdoing for a bhikkhu to learn or to teach itIn this section also one might mention some special provision regarding the conduct of laywomenFor instance when coming to a bhikkhu for instruction in Dhamma it is proper if a man or boy accompanies the laywomanWhere this is not possible provided that there is another bhikkhu or samanera in the room when the teaching of Dhamma takes place there will be no offense for the bhikkhuBut he should not find himself alone with a woman in a room especially one into which others cannot seeAgain women desirous of Dhammainstruction should not visit a bhikkhu after dusk but do so during the dayAll these provisions are to guard individual bhikkhus against their own mental stains and so help them in their training thus being for the wellbeing of the Sangha and therefore since the Sangha guards and maintains the Dhamma for the good name of Dhamma tooLaywomen when visiting a vihara are therefore very modest whenever they have cause to speak to bhikkhusTheir dress should be modest and their persons devoid of ornaments while they address themselves to bhikkhus with humilityIn so doing they help both themselves and the bhikkhus themselves by following the way of Dhamma which is to realize the impermanent unsatisfactory and unbeautiful nature of the body and the bhikkhus by remembering that most of those in the yellow robe have not yet conquered the mental stainsThose laypeople who are very well practiced and who have seen for themselves the immense value of Dhamma will in the presence of their teacher or other respected bhikkhus sit keeping their hands lotussed all the timeFaith and serene clarity of mind do after all increase in proportion to ones experience of DhammaLaypeople having this sort of deep appreciation of Dhamma after the action of añjali and the triple lowering are also seen to recite when their teacher or other bhikkhus are departing Excuse me venerable sir for all the faults I have committed through the three doors for these please forgive meA second time venerable sir A third time venerable sir please forgive me Only those who have had the blessing of a personal teacher and who feel great reverence for him will feel like making this openingup of faultsIt has been included here just because it is a very good practiceAll who are not arahants have the stain of pride and will therefore grow in the Dhamma as this is lessened and genuine humility increasedThis practice can sometimes be beneficialThe conduct of Buddhist laypeople in the West towards bhikkhus who are their teachers may in these matters vary somewhat with the customs of the country which are accepted as politeIt may be stressed once again that such behavior governed by mindfulness and wisdom is for the welfare of all who practice DhammaFinally a word may be said upon what a bhikkhu may do in connection with lay ceremonies and what he may notWhere there are numerous bhikkhus as in Siam they are frequently invited to the house of people for teaching chanting and upon occasions of making puññaFor instance at the time when a new house is occupied as well as the various anniversaries of birth and deathTheir chanting of the words of Lord Buddha to the listening laypeople who sit with action of añjali and minds concentrated upon the chanting brings in this case peace and happinessBut it should not be thought that without the effort of hearkening on the part of the laypeople that blessing automatically resultsIndeed bhikkhus and their chanting are in no way a vehicle for the bestowal of sacraments or blessingsWhat are sometimes written about as blessings in connection with bhikkhus chanting would accurately be called wellwishingsIn other words a bhikkhus work is not that of a priestBhikkhus may be invited to chant stanzas of wellwishing before or after a marriage an occasion when the engaged or married couple jointly make puñña to ensure the success of their new lifeHowever a bhikkhu cannot marry laypeople as do priests in other faithsShould he do so he stands in danger of falling into a heavy offense the fifth of the formal meetings where acting as a gobetween either for a man to a woman or a woman to a man quite rules out the possibility of bhikkhus marrying othersMarriage in Buddhist countries is purely a laycontract between the parties undertaking it the ceremony being conducted by a senior layman this being ratified in various ways through some government agencyIt now remains only to say a little about how bhikkhus are regarded by laypeople in Siam at the present timeIn this matter as in so many others one may perceive two extremes and a profitable middle courseOne sort of extreme attitude which is sometimes found is that of unqualified praise of certain bhikkhusIn the eyes of those laypeople who follow him he can absolutely do no wrongIt is as though they are bewitched by the yellow robe and out of faith will hear no word against their idol and see no imperfection in himHe is arahant a bodhisattva or by whatever other name they like to glorify himSome amongst them out of delusion imagine that all those who wear the yellow robe are automatically arahants and so lavish a bhikkhu with praise such that if his head is not turned and his heart not corrupted by such flattery it will be a great wonderSuch sweet doses of spiritual praise are very liable to cause a personalitycult rather then devotion to the Triple GemThe other extreme which is much less common is the sort of draininspectors attitude to a bhikkhus lifeIt is the very critical probing examination of a bhikkhu and his way of doing things which springs out of the root of hatredSlander is often employed as well so that small offenses of omission and commission by a bhikkhu become magnified into mountains of iniquityUntrue stories are eagerly chewed over and added to the unwholesomeness and perhaps the people pride themselves upon the benefits which they are bringing about by making public what they regard as hidden crimesIn Siam neither of these two extremes is prevalentPeople tend to be respectful of bhikkhus and samaneras but unless particularly devoted to a teacher do not lavish devotion upon those they do not knowThere are after all about a quarter of a million men and boys wearing robes in Siam the quality of bhikkhus in such a large Sangha very naturally varies considerablyOn the other hand laypeople generally shut their eyes to small faults of bhikkhus and rarely criticizeThis is quite proper since criticism is of no avail unless it can raise the other from unskill to skillA teacher has much power over both his monastic and lay disciples but a layperson rarely possesses such abilityIt is well to reflect about kamma and how each person is  owner of kamma heir to kamma born of kamma bound by kamma determined by kamma  for such reflection cultivates equanimityEach person trains himself a bhikkhu according to his knowledge and ability and a layman likewiseThus we have all bhikkhus and laity alike a great debt of gratitude to Lord Buddha who has made known the training rules for bhikkhus founded upon these ten reasonsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThese words which are the opening lines of the Dhammapada were spoken by Gotama Buddha years agoThey illustrate the central theme of Buddhist teaching the human mindBuddhism is probably the least understood of all major religionsIndeed from an Occidental viewpoint we might well question whether it warrants the title of religionIn the West we are accustomed to thinking of theology in terms of God revelation obedience punishment and redemptionThe themes of creation worship judgment and immortality have been major concerns in the Christian heritage and are virtually inseparable from our concept of religionAgainst such a cultural background Western man views Buddhism and in so doing unconsciously projects his own concepts values and expectationsErroneously he perceives ceremonies and bowing as examples of worship or even idolatryHe may extol its scientific world view or abhor and condemn its atheism The Buddha is vaguely equated with God or Jesus and meditation is suspected of being a hypnotic approach to mysticism or an escape from realityHowever such erroneous notions of the Dhamma the teaching of the Buddha are not entirely the result of Western ignorance and ethnocentrismBefore his demise the Buddha predicted that within a thousand years his doctrine would fall into the hands of men of lesser understanding and would thereby become corrupted and distortedSuch has been the case throughout much if not most of the OrientRitual has replaced selfdiscipline faith has replaced insight and prayer has replaced understandingIf the basis of Christianity is God the basis of Buddhism is mindFrom the Buddhist viewpoint mind or consciousness is the core of our existencePleasure and pain good and evil time and space life and death have no meaning to us apart from our awareness of them or thoughts about themWhether God exists or does not exist whether existence is primarily spiritual or primarily material whether we live for a few decades or live forever  all these matters are in the Buddhist view secondary to the one empirical fact of which we do have certainty the existence of conscious experience as it proceeds through the course of daily livingTherefore Buddhism focuses on the mind for happiness and sorrow pleasure and pain are psychological experiencesEven such notions as purpose value virtue goodness and worth have meaning only as the results of our attitudes and feelingsBuddhism does not deny the reality of material existence nor does it ignore the very great effect that the physical world has upon usOn the contrary it refutes the mindbody dichotomy of the Brahmans and says that mind and body are interdependentBut since the fundamental reality of human existence is the everchanging sequence of thoughts feelings emotions and perceptions which comprise conscious experience then from the viewpoint of early Buddhism the primary concern of religion must be these very experiences which make up our daily livesMost significant of these are love and hate fear and sorrow pride and passion struggle and defeatConversely such concepts as vicarious atonement Cosmic Consciousness Ultimate Reality Buddha Nature and redemption of sins are metaphysical and hypothetical matters of secondary importance to the realities of daily existenceTherefore in Buddhism the most significant fact of life is the first noble truth the inevitable existence of dukkhaDukkha is a Pali word embracing all types of displeasurable experience  sorrow fear worry pain despair discord frustration agitation irritation etcThe second noble truth states that the cause of dukkha is desire or cravingIn various texts this cause is further explained as being threefold  greed hatred and delusionAgain on other occasions the Buddha divided the cause of suffering into five components  sensual lust anger sloth or torpor agitation or worry and doubtOn still other occasions he listed ten causes of dukkha  belief that oneself is an unchanging entity scepticism belief in salvation through rites rules and ceremonies sensual lust hatred craving for finematerial existence craving for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignoranceThe Third Noble Truth states that dukkha can be overcome and the Fourth Truth prescribes the means by which this is achievedThus with the Fourth Noble Truth Buddhism becomes a technique a discipline a way of life designed to free people from sorrow and improve the nature of human existenceThis aspect of the Dhamma is called the Noble Eightfold Path and includes moral teachings selfdiscipline development of wisdom and understanding and improvement of ones environment on both a personal and social levelThese have been dealt with in previous writings and for the sake of brevity will not be repeated hereSuffice it to remind the reader that this essay is concerned with only one aspect of Buddhism the practice of meditationThe ethical practical and logical facets of the Teaching are covered in other publicationsIf the cause of suffering is primarily psychological then it must follow that the cure also is psychologicalTherefore we find in Buddhism a series of mental exercises or meditations designed to uncover and cure our psychic aberrationsMistakenly Buddhist meditation is frequently confused with yogic meditation which often includes physical contortions autohypnosis quests for occult powers and an attempted union with GodNone of these are concerns or practices of the Eightfold PathThere are in Buddhism no drugs or stimulants no secret teachings and no mystical formulaeBuddhist meditation deals exclusively with the everyday phenomena of human consciousnessIn the words of the Venerable Nyanaponika Thera a renowned Buddhist scholar and monkUsing just the conditions of life it finds Satipatthana does not require complete seclusion or monastic life though in some who undertake the practice the desire and need for these may growLest the reader suspect that some peculiarity of the Western mind precludes Occidentals from the successful practice of meditation we should note also the words of Rear Admiral EHShattock a British naval officer who spent three weeks of diligent meditation practice in a Theravada monastery near RangoonReading about meditation is like reading about swimming only by getting into the water does the aspiring swimmer begin to progressSo it is with meditation and Buddhism in generalThe Dhamma must be lived not merely thoughtStudy and contemplation are valuable tools but life itself is the training groundThe following passages are attempts to put into words what must be experienced within oneselfOr in the words of the Dhammapada Buddhas only point the wayEach one must work out his own salvation with diligence Meditation is a personal experience a subjective experience and consequently each of us must tread his or her own path towards the summit of EnlightenmentBy words we can instruct and encourage but words are only symbols for realityBefore discussing the techniques of meditation it is important that we first define its goalsThat is why does one meditateWhat does one hope to achieveThe ultimate goals of meditation are the ultimate goals of Buddhism ie realization of Nibbana and the abolition of dukkha or sufferingNibbana however is beyond the realm of conceptualization and all other forms of normal human experienceTherefore we have no certainty that it exists until we ourselves have progressed to realizing it as a direct experience transcending logic and sense perceptionNibbana can thus be defined as that which is experienced when one has achieved ultimate moral and psychological maturationLittle more can be saidTherefore the Buddha said relatively little about Nibbana and instead directed most of his teachings towards two lesser goals which are empirical realities of readily demonstrable worthThese were first the increase enhancement and cultivation of positive feelings such as love compassion equanimity mental purity and the happiness found in bringing happiness to othersSecondly he advocated the relinquishment and renunciation of greed hatred delusion conceit agitation and other negative unwholesome statesAs we gain in experience and selfunderstanding and as we acquire full appreciation for the nature and quality of our own feelings we find that the positive feelings are satisfying meaningful and wholesome experiences in and of themselvesThat is they have their own inherent worth and intrinsic value independent of any world view or religious dogmaConversely greed hatred lust etc are agitating discomforting experiences which when present preclude a full realization of the happiness born of love and equanimityThus the realization of positive feelings and relinquishment of negative feelings are the major goals and motivations of meditationWhile Nibbana and an end of suffering are the primary goals of meditation and the realization of positive feelings is a secondary goal there are also several tertiary goals which must be achieved before the higher ones can be fully realizedThese are nonattachment insight and concentrationNonattachment is freedom from craving and freedom from infatuation for sensual experienceIt is not a state of chronic apathy nor a denial of sense perception existenceRather it is psychological liberation from our enslaving passions and our addictions to sensual and emotional pleasures Thus nonattachment is akin to freedom equanimity and serenityInsight is a word with two meanings both of which are sought in Buddhist meditationIn its classical Buddhist usage insight means full awareness of the three characteristics of existence ie impermanence suffering and impersonalityOtherwise stated this means full realization of the fact that all things in the universe are temporary and changing the human psyche is no exception and thus is not an immortal soul and as a consequence suffering is always inevitable for no state of mind pleasant or unpleasant can endure foreverThe word awareness is italicized here to distinguish it from mere conceptual knowledge which is usually insufficient to have lasting effect upon ones feelings and valuesIn its psychiatric usage insight means gaining awareness of those feelings motives and values which have previously been unconsciousRepressed feelings of guilt fear lust and hatred may lurk in the hidden recesses of our minds and unconsciously shape our lives until such time as they are brought into awarenessAnd unless they are brought into awareness we cannot effectively deal with themIn Buddhism this version of insight is included under the heading of mindfulness and will be discussed laterConcentration involves the ability to keep ones attention firmly fixed on a given subject for protracted periods of time thus overcoming the minds usual discursive habit of flitting from subject to subjectAs we shall see concentration is one of the earliest goals of Buddhist meditationThe initial endeavor in Buddhist meditation is to quiet the mind and enhance detachment and objectivityFor only when the mind has stilled its perpetual ruminating and has momentarily abandoned its fascination for sensory experience can it readily become aware of the unconscious feelings and motivations which shape our thoughts speech and behaviorFurthermore only with detached objectivity and its ensuing insights can we readily confront and renounce unwholesome feelingsOn the other hand we do not achieve complete calmness and detachment so long as we harbor unwholesome feelings and unconscious emotional conflictsThus the process is reciprocal the more we quiet the mind the more we gain insight and relinquishment of undesirable feelingsThe more we relinquish such feelings and resolve emotional conflicts the more we quiet the mind and approach perfect calmness detachment and objectivityThe obscuring of unconscious feelings by preoccupation with thoughts and actions is demonstrated in a variety of neurotic symptomsMost characteristic are obsessive compulsive reactions these occur in persons who are desperately trying to repress overpowering impulses of fear anger lust or guiltIn order to achieve this repression they divert nearly all their attention to some repetitious mental or physical activity which is conducted in a compulsive ritualistic mannerIf prevented from performing their defensive rituals they often become acutely anxious and even panic as their unconscious feelings begin to come into awarenessLess severe examples of the same defensive phenomena are seen in persons who are chronically anxious and are continuously focusing their worries on minor concerns of exaggerated importance such as unpaid bills social commitments and alleged physical illsThey too rarely relax and are forever busy with petty choresThese neurotic symptoms are strikingly similar to an increasingly common way of life in Western societyOur everexpanding populations with their accompanying advertising mass entertainment socializing industrialization and emphasis upon success sensuality and popularity have produced an environment in which we are forever bombarded with an increasing number of sensory and emotional stimuliThe opportunities for solitude and introspection have diminished to the point that now solitude is often viewed as either depressing or abnormalThis is not to assert that the majority of our citizens are involved in a frantic endeavor to escape from their inner selvesSuch is no doubt the case with many but there still remains a sizeable percentage of people who are involved in the same frenzy only because they have conformed to the social norm and have been lured into a habitual fascination for television jazz sports and the countless other forms of readilyavailable entertainmentSuch persons are not necessarily precluded from relative happiness and emotional wellbeingThe point to be made however is that the conditions of modern living are such as to pose several obstacles to successful meditationThese are threefold psychological material and socialThese same obstacles are present to a lesser degree in traditionally Buddhist cultures and must be considered before discussing meditation itselfIt is virtually impossible for a busy person with manifold worldly ambitions to suddenly and voluntarily quiet his mind to the point of removing all discursive thoughtsIn a matter of minutes if not seconds the meditator will find himself either planning reminiscing or daydreamingTherefore before one begins meditation some amount of moral development and selfdiscipline should be achievedIn the words of one of the Buddhas disciplesWell said brother Bhadda well saidPleasing is your wisdom pleasing your insight excellent is your questionThose salutary rules of morality proclaimed by the Exalted One were proclaimed by him for the sake of cultivating the four foundations of mindfulnessIn every Buddhist country only a minority of devotees undertake regular practiceThe decision to meditate rests with each individualMany wait until their later years when moral development has progressed and family obligations have been fulfilledOn the other hand meditation facilitates wisdom and morality and can be of benefit to the layman as well as the monkIn addition to adjusting ones daily routine and cultivating morality and wisdom it is often profitable to take a few minutes before each meditation to put ones mind in a receptive conditionThis may be done by reflecting upon the goals and advantages of meditation or by reading or reciting some chosen passage of Buddhist literature or other appropriate writingIf drowsy a brisk walk may freshen ones mind and can also allow one to think over and mentally dispense with matters which might otherwise be distractingAlso if one has some necessary chores to perform which can be executed quickly and easily doing these beforehand will reduce their interference with meditationMuch has been written in both ancient and modern literature about the physical and environmental factors conducive to successful meditationMostly these are matters of common sense which each person must determine for himself on the basis of his own individual needs and predispositionsIn the Visuddhimagga we readClimate a cool climate suits one a warm one anotherSo when he finds that by using a certain food or by living in a certain climate he is comfortable or his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind more so then that food or that climate is suitableAny other food or climate is unsuitablePostures Walking suits one standing or sitting or lying down anotherSo he should try them like the abode for three days each and that posture is suitable in which his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or his concentrated mind more soAny other should be understood as unsuitableSeclusion and isolation from noise are important considerations especially for beginnersIn an urban environment complete seclusion is rarely possible but even relative seclusion is of valueHow this is achieved must be determined by the practitioners individual opportunities and circumstancesThe time and duration of meditation will also vary with individual situationsIdeally one should choose a time when ones mind is alertFifteen to fortyfive minutes is recommended for lay beginners and many persons are of the opinion that it should be at the same time each day preferably in the early morningA good nights sleep and moderation in eating are valuable but one should avoid an excess of fasting and sleepThe preferred posture in both Asia and the West is the lotus posture or similar positions of sitting on the ground with legs foldedA cushion or other padding is desirable for comfortThese positions furnish maximum physical stability without the need of a back rest or other devices and are especially suitable if one intends to remain alert and motionless for protracted periods of timeHowever many Occidentals are unaccustomed to this posture and are thus unable to assume it or can do so only with discomfortWith practice this difficulty is usually overcome otherwise one can meditate seated on a chairThe eyes either can be closed or resting on some neutral object such as a blank place on the ground or a simple geometric shape at a distance of three or four feetIn Burma meditation is discussed with interest and enthusiasmMen of national fame will take a leave of absence to further their training and a practitioner is often greeted with the words And how are you progressing in your meditationHave you reached such and such a stage yetThe antithesis is true in America where meditation is poorly understood in fact usually it is misunderstoodFirst of all the relinquishment of worldly pursuits for the sake of spiritual and psychological gain is foreign to the prevailing values of both capitalist and socialist societiesSecondly Americans often equate meditation with hypnotic trance mysticism or the occultConsequently the Occidental practitioner may conceal his practice to avoid social ridicule and religious antagonismThis problem is compounded by the existence of various quasireligious and pseudoscientific cults which often attract neurotics and social misfits with promises of occult powers lasting happiness and physical healthSuch organizations often claim esoteric meditations and speak favorably of Hinduism and BuddhismToo often Western impressions of Buddhism are gained either through these sources and their associated literature or through the unfavorable descriptions given by proChristian books magazines and newspapersAs we shall see there are a variety of different meditation practices each intended for specific individual needIn traditionally Buddhist countries novices often seek a learned monk or meditation master and ask to be assigned a specific meditation subjectIn the Occident this is virtually impossibleCompetent meditation masters are few and far between and those masters who do visit our shores find that linguistic and cultural barriers prevent them from adequately appraising a novices needsThus the Western Buddhist must fend for himself relying on his own judgment and proceeding sometimes by trial and errorHere again we should note the words of the VisuddhimaggaNot only do meditation requirements differ from person to person they also differ for the same person at different timesIn the words of the BuddhaMonks suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire and he put dry grass on it and did not scatter dust on it would that man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire  No venerable sir  So too monks when the mind is agitated that is not the time to develop the investigationofstates enlightenment factor the energy enlightenment factor or the happiness enlightenment factorWhy is thatBecause an agitated mind cannot well be quieted by those statesWhen the mind is agitated that is the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor and the equanimity enlightenment factorWhy is thatBecause an agitated mind can well be quieted by those statesThere is no prescribed duration for the amount of time one should spend in meditationThe popular Western notion of Buddhist monks spending a lifetime with nearly every available moment dedicated to meditative seclusion is not supported by the recorded teachings of the Buddha nor the accounts of the daily activities of the Buddha and his followersNor is this the case with Theravada monks today except during temporary periods of intensive trainingAs with all other aspects of meditation the amount of time must be varied according to individual needs and circumstancesOne final point must be made before proceeding to the techniques of meditationIt is simply this Meditation requires patience persistence and effortFor one who practices less than several hours a day lasting and notable progress can only be achieved by months if not years of endeavorThere are no short cuts or magical formulaeConsequently the aspiring practitioner should not expect quick results and before starting should decide if he sincerely intends to put forth the necessary time and effortA decision not to meditate however in no way precludes one from progressing towards the same goals of insight nonattachment concentration etcTheir full realization requires formal meditation practice but relative success may be acquired at a slower pace through cultivation of ones moral and intellectual facultiesThe seventh step of the Noble Eightfold Path is termed right mindfulness also called the four foundations of mindfulness and SatipatthanaThe three terms are synonymous and encompass not only the most important aspects of Theravada meditation but also one of the most unique and important features of all BuddhismA full explanation of mindfulness or Satipatthana is given in the Satipatthana Sutta which appears twice in the Pali canonThe Buddha begins the discourse as followsThis same message he repeated frequentlyThis same emphasis has persisted even to the present era in some sections of the Buddhist world as described by the Venerable Nyanasatta TheraThus it seems a paradox that most Western texts on Buddhism merely list right mindfulness as one of the steps of the Eightfold Path and say little more except to redefine it by such terms as right contemplation and right reflection The reason is probably twofoldFirst Satipatthana cannot be as concisely explained as the other seven steps for it is not a single step but includes instead several distinct meditation exercisesSecond to be properly understood the Satipatthana Sutta must be examined from a psychological and psychiatric viewpointMost scholars of comparative religion are accustomed to approaching their studies from religious ethical or philosophical frames of reference but none of these orientations apply hereIf this sutta alone was to be filed on the shelves of a public library it would most aptly be placed adjacent to the archives of eclectic psychiatry and would have little in common with the classic writings of religion and philosophyEven psychology would not be an appropriate title for the sutta is not concerned with any theoretical or conceptual interpretation of the mindIt deals only with the empirical facts of conscious experience and prescribes the techniques for mental developmentIt is therefore not surprising that many Occidentals who have scanned the pages of the Satipatthana Sutta have judged it confusing meaningless and sometimes morbidIn addition to the two occurrences of the Satipatthana Sutta condensed versions of the same teaching appear several times in the Sutta PitakaThe four parts of the four foundations of mindfulness are contemplation of the body contemplation of feelings contemplation of mind and contemplation of mental objectsThe body contemplation is itself divided into six parts  breathing postures clear comprehension of action repulsiveness material elements and the cemetery meditationsThe initial endeavor in Buddhist meditation is to calm and quiet the mind so that it is fully alert but has temporarily diminished the quantity of daydreaming planning reminiscing and all other forms of verbal and visual thinkingThis goal can only be approached gradually and therefore the beginner should start his practice by focusing his attention on some quiet readily available rhythmic processRespiratory movements are ideal for this purposeThus the first exercise of the sutta beginsThe practitioner endeavors to keep his mind focused only on the act of breathing itself and not to think about breathing as a subject of intellectual contemplationIn other words one attempts to give full attention to the reality of immediate experience and not become involved in speculations or contemplations about realityThe theory is quite simple but the practice most difficultIn a typical case at the beginning of his meditation the novice directs his attention solely to the process of breathingThen after a few seconds he inadvertently begins to think So far I am doing all rightMy mind hasnt strayed from its subject But at this very moment he has strayed from his subjectFor now he is not concentrating but thinking about concentratingIf he does not catch himself the stream of consciousness will proceed something as follows My mind hasnt strayed from its subjectIm doing better than yesterdayI wonder whyMaybe its because Ive finished all of my letter writingI wonder if Marvin will answer the letter I sent himHe hasnt Oh OhIve gotten off the subjectId better get back to itBut Im not really back Im just thinking about itI wonder how long it will take me And so on it goes day after day week after week until the practitioner begins to wonder if he is not seeking the impossibleYet the fact remains that many thousands living today have achieved this degree of concentrationWith little short of amazement the Western novice reads the Venerable Nyanaponika Theras remarks concerning Burmese Satipatthana training Three to four hours of continuous mindfulness ie without unnoticed breaks are regarded as the minimum for a beginner undergoing a course of strict practiceThe most widely practiced form of the breathing meditation is focusing attention at the nostrils where one feels the faint pressure of the ebb and flow of the breathThis technique is not mentioned in any of the recorded teachings of the Buddha or his disciples but has been popular at least since the time of Buddhaghosa in the fifth century ADIn the words of BuddhaghosaAnd again in the simile of the saw the woodcutters attention is focused only at the point of contact between the saw and the woodModifications of the breathing meditation can be applied to suit individual requirementsIn the early stages of practice many persons find that mentally counting the breaths enhances concentrationIn these instances one is advised not to count less than five or more than tenUpon reaching ten the counting starts overBy going beyond ten the counting rather than the breathing is likely to become the subject of ones attentionBut how long is he to go on countingUntil without counting mindfulness remains settled on the inbreaths and outbreaths as its objectFor counting is simply a device for settling mindfulness on the inbreaths and outbreaths as object by cutting off the external dissipation of applied thoughtsIn the initial stages of practice one merely observes the process of breathing without attempting to change its rate or depthLater as concentration is achieved the breathing is gradually and deliberately slowed in order to further quiet the mindThere is however no attempt to stop respiration as in certain yogic practicesIt was a Burmese meditation teacher Venerable U Narada who in the early part of this century stressed the application of mindfulness of breathing as a means of cultivating direct awarenessIt was he who gave the first strong impetus to the revival of Satipatthana meditation in contemporary BurmaHe passed away in at the age of and is said by many to have realized NibbanaA variation of the breathing meditation was developed by another Burmese monk the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw who was a pupil of the Venerable U NaradaHis technique involves focusing attention upon the respiratory movements of the abdomen instead of the sensation at the nostrilsThis system has become popular in several parts of southern AsiaA revived interest in meditation has developed in that section of the world especially in Burma where numerous training centers have been established and thousands of monks and lay people have received instructionDuring meditation when the practitioner finds that his mind has strayed from its subject there should be no attempt to suppress or forcibly remove the extraneous thoughtsRather he should briefly take mental note of them and objectively label them with some appropriate termThis may be done by thinking to himself planning remembering imagining etc as the case may beThen he should return to his original meditation subjectHowever if after several tries the unwanted thoughts persist he should temporarily take the thoughts themselves as the meditation subjectIn so doing their intensity will diminish and he can then return to his original subjectThis same technique can be used for distracting noisesIt can also be used for feelings of anger or frustration which may develop as the result of unwanted thoughts or distractionsIn these instances the meditator should think to himself noise or irritationAs the mind becomes quiet and verbal thinking begins to diminish other stimuli come into awarenessAmong these are sensations such as itches and minor pains which are always present but go unnoticed because attention is directed elsewhereThe same may occur with emotions such as worry or fear and these we shall discuss in detail laterPictures or visual scenes may arise and are often so vivid as to be termed visions or hallucinationsThey often have the appearance of dreams or distant memories and differ from thoughts in that the meditator usually finds himself a passive spectator not knowing when such scenes will arise or what forms they will takeThe meditator should first attempt to ignore these sensations feelings and picturesThis failing he should label them itching fear picture etc and lastly make them his meditation subject until they diminishTo be successful meditation should not be an unpleasant experienceStrain and tension should be minimizedTherefore if the practitioner finds himself becoming tense irritable or fatigued during meditation he may wish to terminate the practice until he acquires a better state of mindFollowing mindfulness of breathing the next exercise prescribed in the Satipatthana Sutta is the development of the same clear awareness towards ones daily actionsThus the Buddha continuesAnd further monks a monk in going forward and back applies clear comprehension in looking straight on and looking away he applies clear comprehension in bending and in stretching he applies clear comprehension in wearing robes and carrying the bowl he applies clear comprehension in eating drinking chewing and savoring he applies clear comprehension in attending to the calls of nature he applies clear comprehension in walking in standing in sitting in falling asleep in walking in speaking and in keeping silence he applies clear comprehensionHere we note a similarity between early Buddhism and ZenOr as the Zen master would say In walking just walkIn sitting just sitAbove all dont wobbleUsually while dressing eating working etc we act on habit and give little attention to our physical actionsOur minds are preoccupied with a variety of other concernsIn Satipatthana however the practitioner devotes himself entirely to the situation at handPersons interested in meditation are often heard to complain But I dont have time to meditate However the form of mindfulness we are now discussing can be practiced at all times and in all situations regardless of ones occupation or social and religious commitmentsAs with breathing meditation the primary intent of this discipline is to prepare ones mind for advanced stages of psychological developmentHowever a valuable byproduct is that it can greatly increase ones proficiency at physical skillsIn Japan Zen practitioners have utilized it to achieve mastery in swordsmanship archery and judoThe Buddha himself is quoted Mindfulness I declare O monks is helpful everywhere And againFor one engaged in strict monastic training mindfulness of actions becomes a more formalized practiceBreathing and walking meditations often are alternated for periods of about thirty minutes eachIn walking the monk paces slowly along a level stretch of ground and directs his attention fully to the movement of each foot thinking lift  forward  down  lift  forward  down This alternation of breathing and walking practice may last sixteen hours each day for a period of six or more weeksThe last of the body meditations are designed to overcome ones narcissistic infatuation for ones own body to abandon unrealistic desires for immortality and to destroy sensual lustTo achieve these ends two principles are employedFirst is vividly and repeatedly impressing upon ones mind the temporary changing and compounded nature of the bodySecondly one establishes and persistently reinforces a series of negative associations to the usually sensual features of the bodyThis latter process employs the same principles as behavior therapy and Pavlovian conditioningHowever Satipatthana differs from Pavlovian and behavior therapy in that the conditioning is established by the meditator himself instead of an external agentThus the Satipatthana Sutta continuesJust as if there were a doublemouthed provision bag full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy paddy green gram cowpeas sesamum and husked rice and a man with sound eyes having opened that bag were to take stock of the contents thus This is hill paddy this is paddy this is green gram this is cowpea this is sesamum this is husked rice Just so monks a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the head hair down thinking thus There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidney heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva nasal mucus synovial fluid urineAnd further monks a monk reflects on this very body however it be placed or disposed by way of the material elements There are in this body the element of earth the element of water the element of fire the element of airJust as if monks a clever cowbutcher or his apprentice having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions should be sitting at the junction of four high roads in the same way a monk reflects on this very body as it is placed or disposed by way of the material elements There are in this body the elements of earth water fire and airThis last paragraph is explained in the VisuddhimaggaThe last of the body meditations are the nine cemetery meditationsNumbers and respectively are quoted hereThe remaining five are similar and deal with intermediate stages of decompositionAnd further monks as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground being eaten by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or by different kinds of worms he then applies this perception to his own body thus Verily also my own body is of the same nature such it will become and will not escape itAnd further monks as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton without flesh and blood held together by the tendonsAnd further monks as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to bones gone rotten and become dust he then applies this perception to his own body thus Verily also my own body is of the same nature such it will become and will not escape itSimilar meditations on the digestion and decomposition of food are listed in other sections of the Pali scriptures for the purpose of freeing the practitioner from undue cravings for foodWhile these meditations are intended to eliminate passion and craving they carry the risk of making one morbid and depressedTherefore the Buddha recommendedA cartoon in an American medical magazine shows four senior medical students standing togetherThree are engaged in active conversationOnly the remaining one turns his head to take notice of a pretty nurseThe caption beneath the cartoon reads Guess which one has not done twelve pelvic examinations today It is doubtful that many persons outside of the medical profession will appreciate the meaning but to medical students and interns it speaks a realityDuring his months of training in obstetrics and gynecology the medical trainee must spend many hours engaged in examining and handling the most repulsive aspects of female genitalsAs a result he finds the female body becoming less attractive and his sexual urges diminishingDuring my own years as a medical student and intern this observation was repeatedly confirmed by the comments of my coworkers both married and singleAs we have seen the same principle is utilized in the sections of the Discourse on repulsiveness and the cemetery meditationsOther aspects of scientific and medical training can produce results similar to those sought in the latter three body meditationsChemistry biochemistry and histology foster an objective way of viewing the body which is virtually identical to the contemplation of elementsAnatomy of course is similar to the contemplation of repulsivenessAnd in hospital training the persistent encounter with old age debilitation and death continuously reinforces the words of the cemetery meditations Verily also my own body is of the same nature such it will become and will not escape it Similarly in order to acquire a vivid mental image of the cemetery meditations Buddhist monks occasionally visit graveyards to behold corpses in various stages of decayHowever such experiences bear fruit only if one takes advantage of them and avoids the temptation to ignore and forgetSuccessful application of the Satipatthana meditations requires developed concentration which in turn necessitates many hours of practiceThere are however a variety of discursive meditations and related practices which the lay devotee can utilize to notable advantageSome of these are not meditations in the strict sense of the word and are commonplace in virtually all religionsA hymn a poem a passage from the Dhamma or a passage from any inspiring literature can temporarily elevate the mind and serve to cultivate wholesome feelingsMany Buddhists make a habit of setting aside a few minutes each day to reflect upon the Teaching or to either read or recite from memory some favored passage of the DhammapadaFor some similar benefits may be gained from an evening stroll a period of solitude in forest or desert or a pause for contemplative relaxation in the midst of a hurried dayThese latter three serve the added advantage of allowing one to reflect upon ones values and reappraise oneselfPerhaps the most popular discursive meditation practiced by Theravadin Buddhists is the meditation on loveIt is often recited in the morning in order to create a wholesome mood for the rest of the dayThere are several versions one of which is as followsMy mind is pure and cleanLike a polished mirror is my stainless mindAs a clean and empty vessel is filled with pure water I now fill my clean heart and pure mind with peaceful and sublime thoughts of boundless love overflowing compassion sympathetic joy and perfect equanimityI have now washed my mind and heart of anger ill will cruelty violence jealousy envy passion and aversionMay I be well and happyMay I be free from suffering disease grief worry and angerMay I be strong selfconfident healthy and peacefulNow I charge every particle of my system from head to foot with thoughts of boundless love and compassionI am the embodiment of love and compassionMy whole body is saturated with love and compassionI am a stronghold a fortress of love and compassionWhat I have gained I now give unto othersThink of all your near and dear ones at home individually or collectively and fill them with thoughts of lovingkindness and wish them peace and happiness repeating May all beings be well and happy Then think of all seen and unseen beings living near and far men women animals and all living beings in the East West North South above and below and radiate boundless lovingkindness without any enmity or obstruction towards all irrespective of class creed color or sexThink that all are your brothers and sisters fellowbeings in the ocean of lifeYou identify yourself with allYou are one with allRepeat ten times  May all be well and happy  and wish them all peace and happinessAnother useful meditation for laymen is as followsIn the mind of a devout Buddhist Gotama Buddha symbolizes the embodiment of ones highest spiritual idealsConsequently the Buddha is often taken as a meditation subjectWhen a noble disciple contemplates upon the Enlightened One at that time his mind is not enwrapped by lust nor by hatred nor by delusion and at that time his mind is rightly directed towards the TathagataAnd with a rightly directed mind the noble disciple gains enthusiasm for the goal enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains the delight derived from the DhammaIn him thus delighted joy arises to one joyfully minded body and mind become calm calmed in body and mind he feels at ease and if at ease the mind finds concentrationThe hazard in meditating on the Buddha however is that the unsophisticated meditator may not be aware of the psychological reasons for this exerciseIn such a case the practice is likely to become a devotional one similar to those of nonBuddhist religionsSome time ago I became acquainted with a Caucasian Buddhist who for several years had made a daily practice of meditating on loveHe confided that he had chosen this meditation subject because he was prone to frequent outbreaks of anger and chronic resentment a hate problem he termed itBut despite years of meditation the hatred had not diminished the meditation had failedWhyAs our acquaintance broadened the answer became apparentMy friend had several poorlyconcealed intellectual and emotional deficienciesHe never once revealed that he acknowledged these on the contrary he displayed frequent attempts to bolster his selfimageSuch attempts were invariably doomed to frustration especially when his accomplishments and social poise were contrasted with those of othersBy reacting with anger towards others he avoided the unpleasantry of looking at himselfIn other words his anger was a psychological defense through which he sought to maintain an illusion of selfesteemThus unconsciously he did not wish to relinquish his angerTo do so would be too painful and to attack the anger by meditating on love was futile for anger was only a symptomThe real problem lay much deeperTo cure such hatred requires three thingsFirst one must become aware of the existence of ones inadequacies and their accompanying humiliations in other words what is unconscious must become consciousSecond one must totally confront such unpleasant feelings and acknowledge them in their entiretyAnd finally one must relinquish the egotistical desire for selfexaltationThis last requirement is best achieved by objectively analyzing the illusion of self and gaining full appreciation for the changing and compounded nature of the personalityIn other words one must acquire insight of both types discussed above under the goals of meditationHow can this be achievedAwareness of unconscious feelings is rarely obtained through logical deductions or rational explanationsA person who harbors these feelings will either refuse to believe what he is told or will come to accept it only as so much factual information devoid of emotional significanceAn excellent illustration is the case of a fortyyearold woman who sought psychiatric help for severe feelings of fear guilt and depressionOn examining her case it became apparent that her problem was largely due to repressed feelings of hatred for her mother a very dominating and selfish womanAfter much discussion the patient finally deduced that she indeed did hate her mother and for the next two months she spoke knowingly and learnedly about her repressed hatred and resultant symptomsYet she improved not one bitThen one day she entered the office shaking with rage and cried God I hate that witch There was never a more vivid example of the difference between knowing and experiencingImprovement quickly followedThis example is typical of many psychiatric case historiesOne sees patients who speak in the most erudite manner about Freud and Jung and adeptly employ psychiatric terminologyYet this intellectual verbiage is often a subtle defense against facing their true feelingsConversely many unsophisticated and unlearned patients are quick to achieve insight and make rapid progressConsequently the skillful psychiatrist makes limited use of technical jargon and theoretical conceptsHe asks questions often but answers fewThis same technique is employed in Burmese and Zen meditation centersThe student is discouraged from making philosophical inquiries and is told Pursue your meditation and soon you will seeIn his earlier years Sigmund Freud experimented with hypnosisHe found it a useful tool in revealing unconscious feelings and conflicts to the therapist but it was of little value to the patientThe reason was that hypnotic trance precluded the patient from consciously confronting and resolving his problemsTherefore Freud abandoned hypnosis in preference to the now standard procedures of psychiatry and psychoanalysisThese same findings and conclusions have often been repeated by later researchers and cliniciansSimilarly the Buddha rejected the use of trance states so common in yogic practice and developed a means by which people can acquire insight without the aid of a therapist or psychedelic drugsTwo approaches are employedThe easier approach to insight is one which both monks and laymen can use regardless of meditative developmentIt consists in developing the habit of reflecting on ones feelings from time to time and detecting the motives which produce seemingly spontaneous words and deedsWhy did I say that Why am I tense when I meet so and so I find myself disliking such and such a character in this novelWhy is thatOf whom does he remind meFor those who have progressed in the breathing meditation or made similar progress at quieting the mind unconscious feelings become more readily accessibleAs one begins to shut out sensory distractions and halt discursive thinking more subtle sensations come into awarenessAt first there may be only a vague feeling of anxiety some unexplained sense of guilt or a feeling of angerWithout recourse to verbal whys or hows and avoiding any speculative conjecture the meditator directs full attention to the feeling aloneHe brings only the feeling itself into full awareness and allows no interfering thoughts though later he will benefit by reflecting on it in a contemplative mannerIt is at this point that repressed memories and emotional conflicts may come into awarenessHere also meditation can be potentially dangerous for those whose personality structures are loosely constituted or who have repressed emotional problems of severe intensityUsually however in these latter instances ones unconscious defenses will intervene and the meditator will terminate the practice because he feels anxious or cant concentrate or just quit because I felt like itThus the last three sections of the Satipatthana Sutta read as followsMindfulness of feelings  the second of the four foundations of mindfulnessMindfulness of consciousness  the third of the four foundations of mindfulnessMindfulness of mental objects  the fourth of the four foundations of mindfulnessWhen anger is present he knows There is anger in me When sloth and torpor are present When agitation and worry are present When doubt is presentHerein monks when the enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is present the monk knows The enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is in me or when the enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is absent he knows The enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness is not in me and he knows how the arising of the nonarisen enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness comes to be and how the perfection in the development of the arisen enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness comes to beThis paragraph on mindfulness is then repeated in the same wording for the remaining six enlightenmentfactors ie investigation of reality energy happiness tranquillity concentration and equanimityThese seven bear the title enlightenmentfactors as they are said to be the essential states for the realization of NibbanaLeaving the Satipatthana Sutta for a moment we note another of the Buddhas sayingsCertainly not LordAre these not rather ideas to be known after wisely realizing them by experienceThat is so LordThis monks is a way by which a monk without recourse to faith to cherished opinions to tradition to specious reasoning to the approval of views pondered upon may declare the Final KnowledgeThus far we have discussed how one achieves insight as the first step towards eliminating unwholesome feelings and motivationsFollowing insight one must totally confront these newly discovered feelings and acknowledge them fully and impartiallyOne must see their true nature devoid of any emotional reactions and devoid of preconceived notions about their good or evil qualitiesIn other words complete attention is focused on the feeling itself in order that one may examine it objectively in its naked reality free of any cultural and personal assumptions as to its desirabilityThis achievement results from the Satipatthana practices described aboveAs an example in a typical case of anger one is cognizant of being angry yet a much greater amount of attention is directed outwardMost typically the angry mind quickly perceives and dwells upon the objectionable and offensive features of some other personAnd in so doing indignation resentment and anger increaseThese objectionable features of the other person may be fancied exaggerated or real but in any case were it not for the anger such preoccupations would not have arisenThe Buddhist approach is to turn attention to the real problem  the angerOne reflects I am angry I am doing this because I am angry I am having these thoughts because I am angry In so doing one avoids dwelling on alleged injustices etc and thereby does not intensify the hatredThis reflection continues This is anger It is real it is intense It is a feeling It has no reality outside of my own consciousness Like all feelings it will soon diminish I experience it but am not compelled to act on it With practice one finds that though anger still arises its effect is diminishedIts influence is no longer as strongIn the case of painful emotions such as humiliation it is advantageous to also reflect This is most painful I do not like it but I can confront it I can endure it Even though it is unpleasant I can tolerate it In instances of greed and passion it is often fruitful to consider Is this truly pleasurable Is it rewarding Am I now happyIt should be noted that this important technique can also be employed in the course of daily living without unusual powers of concentration or formal meditation practiceIn the words of the BuddhaIn pleasant feelings monks the inclination to greed should be given up in unpleasant feelings the inclination to aversion should be given up in neutral feelings the inclination to ignorance should be given upIf a monk has given up in pleasant feelings the inclination to greed in unpleasant feelings the inclination to aversion and in neutral feelings the inclination to ignorance then he is called one who is free of inclinations one who sees clearlyHe has cut off cravings sundered the fetters and through the destruction of conceit has made an end of sufferingAfter getting rid of sensual cravings and after uncovering confronting and relinquishing unwholesome emotions there remains only one fetter to be resolvedThis is narcissism the infatuation for ones self which results in egotism and an endless quest for social recognition and selfexaltationPerpetuating this fetter is the illusion that one has a true or unchanging self the real me In reality there is no such entity instead there are only feelings sensations and emotions and once we gain full appreciation of this fact once it becomes a living reality to us narcissism diminishesAmong the Buddhas teachings are numerous passages like the followingBetter it would be to consider the body as the ego rather than the mindAnd whyBecause this body may last for ten twenty thirty forty or fifty years even for a hundred years and moreBut that which is called mind consciousness thinking arises continuously during day and night as one thing and as something different again it vanishesSuch statements however are merely philosophical arguments through which one may intellectually accept this factOnly by experiencing it as a living reality and by an impartial analysis of the self do we relinquish egotismThus in the Satipatthana Sutta after each of the six body meditations and after each of the meditations on feeling consciousness and mental objects the following passage occursIn the instance of anger one would reflect This is anger It is a feeling I do not identify with it It will eventually be replaced by another feeling which in turn will be replaced by still another I am a composite of various feelings a changing aggregate of attitudes values and thoughts no one of which is permanent There is no eternal I As such objectivity and detachment increases anger diminishes for no longer is there an ego to be defended and no self which can be offendedExcept for a concluding section on the Four Noble Truths we have now discussed all but two portions of the Satipatthana SuttaThese remaining two are included under the section on mental objects and are primarily intended to free one from sensual craving and the illusion of selfHerein monks a monk knows the eye and visual forms and the fetter that arises dependent on both he knows how the arising of the nonarisen fetter comes to be he knows how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to beThis latter passage is repeated five times with ear and sound nose and smells tongue and flavors body and tactual objects and mind and mental objects respectively substituted where eye and visual forms appears aboveWe have thus completed the Satipatthana SuttaIn summary it first prescribes mindfulness of breathing as a technique for quieting the mind and developing concentrationThis same heightened awareness is then developed for all voluntary physical actionsNext are the meditations on repulsiveness elements and death which are intended to free one from bodily attachment and lust this is done by contemplating the temporary and changing nature of the body and by developing negative and unpleasant associationsThe remaining three sections enable the practitioner to become fully aware of his thoughts feelings and emotions and to confront them impartially in their true natureWith each of these exercises one also objectively notes that each facet of his own mind and body is temporary compounded and changing and therefore there exists no immortal soul unchanging essence or true selfOne important fact should be notedNeither in the Satipatthana Sutta nor in any of the other seven steps of the Eightfold Path is advocated the denial or suppression of feelingsIt is a widely spread and inaccurate belief that Theravada Buddhism attempts to destroy evil thoughts by forcing them from the mindSuppression of undesirable thoughts is advocated in only a few parts of the Pali canon and is to be used only in special cases when other measures failIn southern Asia it is becoming a common practice for both monks and laymen to enter a meditation center for periods of from six to twelve weeksHere one dons the white robe of an upasaka and is removed from all social contacts and material possessionsPrevious social status and identity soon come to have little meaning thus minimizing the effect of established habits and adaptations and thereby enhancing the opportunities for personality growthThe food is palatable but bland and one eats and sleeps in moderation according to a strict schedule and even eating and dressing become routine meditation practicesVirtually every waking moment is dedicated to meditationHere progress is made at a rate impossible to achieve by setting aside an hour or two in the midst of a busy dayAfter his stay is over the layman returns to family life and continues his daily onehour practiceHowever not all meditation centers are of high qualityMany are lax a few are corrupt and a few teach unorthodox meditations which are not truly BuddhistThus a person seeking entry should first make inquiries and would do well to avoid centers which make an effort to recruit Westerners for the sake of publicity and prestigeSatipatthana meditation centers exist in North America and courses are given in EnglandThe last step of the Noble Eightfold Path is termed right concentration and concerns the attainment of the four absorptions or jhanasThese states are achieved by an extreme degree of concentration and mental quietude beyond that usually sought through mindfulness of breathingYet unlike Satipatthana the jhanas are not a prerequisite to EnlightenmentSome teachers say one may obtain Nibbana without reaching the absorptions and they alone will not produce NibbanaAlso there is the danger of one becoming enamoured with them and not striving for further progressHowever achieving the jhanas can facilitate ones progressIn these states all visual tactile auditory and other sense impressions have ceased while the mind remains alert and fully awakeThe first jhana is described as having five qualities absent and five presentAbsent are lust anger sloth agitation and doubtPresent are a mild degree of conceptual thought a mild degree of discursive thinking rapture happiness and concentrationWith the removal of all conceptual thought and discursive thinking one enters the second jhana which has the qualities of concentration rapture and happinessThen with the abandonment of rapture one enters the third jhana in which only equanimous happiness and concentration remainThe distinctive factors of the fourth absorption are equanimity and concentrationThis last jhana is realized after giving up all joy and sorrow and is described as a state beyond pleasure and painThe jhanas are obtained by mindfulness of breathing with a steady progressive quieting of the breathThey may also be realized through the kasina meditations and meditating on equanimityAt this point it is interesting to speculate on the phenomena of parapsychologyDespite the fraudulent and careless investigations which have been done in psychical research there still remains a sizable number of reliable and carefully controlled studies which have demonstrated that people do indeed possess the faculties of telepathy clairvoyance and precognitionIn addition some researchers claim to have established the existence of psychokinesis the power of mind over matter but the evidence for psychokinesis is inconclusive and most experiments have failed to demonstrate its validityOf those parapsychology subjects who have been tested to date even the best guess incorrectly as often as correctly and are unable to determine which of their guesses are correctThat is while being tested the ESP subject is unable to distinguish between guesses and true extrasensory informationOne might wonder if the process of reducing sensory impressions and stilling discursive thoughts would enhance these psychic abilitiesAccording to the Pali texts there are five psychical powers which can be obtained through meditationThese five include psychokinesis telepathy and clairvoyance plus two othersThe additional two are the divine ear or clairaudience and the ability to recall past livesPrecognition itself is not listed among these but is mentioned in other sections of the TipitakaReliable use of these powers is allegedly possessed only by those who have achieved the four jhanas either with or without NibbanaThus like more worldly talents Nibbana alone does not produce themThe most important consideration however is that Buddhism places very little emphasis on paranormal phenomena and regards them as byproducts of spiritual development rather than goalsIn fact the novice is cautioned against experimenting with them since they distract from ones true goals and in some cases can be obstructive or even dangerousThe Satipatthana exercises are by far the most valuable and widely practiced of all the Theravada meditationsThere are however a total of forty meditation subjects listed in the Visuddhimagga including those already mentioned ie Satipatthana practices and meditations on love equanimity repulsiveness of food and the BuddhaThe remaining subjects are the Dhamma the Order of Monks virtue generosity devas peace compassion gladness boundless space boundless consciousness nothingness the base of neither perception nor nonperception and the ten kasinasEach of these subjects is intended for specific individual needs and one should not attempt to undertake all fortyTo do so would only dilute ones energies and retard progressA kasina is an object which the practitioner looks at from a distance of about four feetThe eyes are alternately opened and closed until one has acquired a mental image of the object which is as vivid as the real oneThe ten kasina meditations develop the jhanas and do not enhance insightMeditation is not an exclusively Buddhist traditionIt is equally important in the Hindu religion and because the two schools employ similar techniques they are often confusedThus a comparison is warrantedBoth advocate preparatory moral discipline moderation in eating quieting the mind and abolition of selfish desiresThe postures are similar and the breathing meditation is practiced by many yogisHere however the similarities ceaseBuddhism is concerned with the empirical phenomena of conscious experience and thus its meditations are psychologically orientedHinduism on the other hand is mystically religiously and metaphysically inclinedYogic meditation therefore has devotional aspects often including prayerWhile Buddhism emphasizes motivations and insight Hinduism speaks of Infinite Consciousness Cosmic Reality and oneness with GodTo the Hindu freedom from hatred is not so much an end in itself as it is a step towards ImmortalityThe following typifies Hindu writingsAnother important difference concerns the visions that occur during meditationThe Buddhist regards these as psychological phenomena to be dealt with in the same way as distracting thoughtsThe Hindu often interprets them as psychic experiences indicative of spiritual developmentIn the words of Swami SivanandaA few passages in the TaoTeChing suggest that the Chinese mystics discovered meditation independently of Buddhist and Hindu traditionsThe exact nature of early Taoist meditation will probably remain unknown since later Taoism has intermingled with Mahayana BuddhismMahayana Buddhist meditations include all the above mentioned Theravada practices plus othersThe division of Mahayana into numerous and varied sects precludes any general statement about its practicesIn some forms it bears similarities to Hinduism by virtue of devotional emphasis and prayerIn other schools this similarity is seen in the Mahayana concepts of Universal Mind the Void and Buddha Nature which sometimes take precedence over the Theravada concerns of greed hatred and delusionThe curing of physical illness and the flow of spiritual forces through the body are other features of certain Mahayana practicesOf all the Mahayana schools Zen places the greatest emphasis upon meditationZen practice is much like TheravadaIt focuses on quieting the mind and shuns conceptual thinking in preference to direct experienceThe postures are also similar and the initial Zen practice usually involves attention to breathingIt does not include as wide a variety of different techniquesZen places greater emphasis on the details of correct posture and especially in the Soto school contrasts with Theravada by preferring group meditation to individual practiceIn order to cultivate a suitable state of mind Zen meditation is often followed by chanting and gongsPerhaps the most significant difference is that as compared to Theravada Zen makes little mention of the need and means of dealing with motives feelings and emotionsIt lays great emphasis upon freeing oneself from intellectualizing and conceptualizing in ones quest of the Ultimate But at the same time it offers scant advice on the means by which one overcomes unwholesome impulses or confronts mental hindrances that are emotional or motivational in originThe Venerable Anuruddha a disciple of the Buddha once became ill with a painful diseaseOn that occasion several of the monks visited him and inquiredHe repliedThroughout Buddhist history there have been numerous other testimonies as to the benefits of SatipatthanaYet personal testimonies and case histories are subjective and prone to distortionThe reader may well wonder what if any scientific studies have been conductedTo date there are two areas of investigation which have given some evidence as to the benefits of meditationThe first scientific evidence does not involve meditation per se but concerns an experimental situation which has some similarities to meditation practiceThis is sensory deprivation which has been actively studied sinceThere are two types of sensory deprivationOne reduces sensory input by placing the experimental subject in a totally dark soundproof roomHis hands are encased in soft cotton the temperature is constant and mild and he lies on a soft mattressThe other type does not reduce sensory input per se but does diminish perceptionIn this latter case the subject wears opaque goggles so that he sees only a diffuse white with no forms or colorsA constant monotonous noise is generated and no other sounds are heardApproximately the same results are obtained in either type of experimentIn both kinds the subject lies relatively motionless he is free to think or sleep as he pleases and may terminate the session if he so desiresExperiments have lasted from four hours to five daysThe lack of practice and lack of any attempt at mental discipline makes sensory deprivation a passive procedure notably different from meditationHowever both meditation and sensory deprivation involve a temporary withdrawal from external stimuli without loss of consciousness and thus a comparison is warrantedPerhaps the most characteristic feature of sensory deprivation research to date is the great discrepancies in the findings of different researchersFor example some studies have shown it to impair learning while others find that learning is enhancedMost of the early studies reported that the great majority of experimental subjects had strong visual and sometimes auditory hallucinations beginning from twenty minutes to seventy hours after entering the experimentOther researchers however reported very few hallucinationsSuggestion is a partial though not total explanation for this difference in frequency of hallucinationsOne study found that under identical sensory deprivation conditions a group of subjects which was told that hallucinations were frequent and normal had over three times more than an identical group which was given no such informationThis no doubt explains many of the psychic experiences of those yogi devotees who seek visions while meditating in isolationRecent studies have indicated that the emotional atmosphere created by the experimenters plus the subjects attitudes knowledge and expectations may have greater effect on the results of the experiment than do the physical aspects of sensory deprivationRegarding meditation this fact suggests the importance of moral intellectual and environmental preparationIt also suggests the importance of taking a few moments before meditation to create a wholesome frame of mindWhat is most significant for the purpose of this writing however is whether or not sensory deprivation and its accompanying social isolation facilitate awareness of ones inner emotional conflicts and thereby facilitate personality growthSeveral studies have indicated that such is the caseMost significant was an experiment conducted on thirty white male psychiatric patients in Richmond VirginiaThe group consisted of approximately equal numbers of neurotics schizophrenics and character disorders and all were subjected to a maximum six hours of sensory deprivationEach subject was given a battery of psychological tests the day before the experiment and the same tests were repeated the day after and again one week laterThe tests rated the subjects on twenty items such as anxiety depression hostility memory deficit disorganized thinking etcIt was found that on each of the twenty items some subjects improved some worsened and some revealed no changeHowever the desirable changes outnumbered the undesirable ones by a ratio of two to one and one week after the experiment most of the beneficial changes were found to have persisted while the undesirable ones had mostly subsidedSome subjects showed no desirable changes on any of the twenty items others revealed as many as thirteenThe average subject improved on four of the twenty items and worsened on twoThe experimenters also reported that the subjects displayed increased awareness of inner conflicts and anxieties and heightened perception of the fact that their difficulties stemmed from inner rather than outer factors A second major change observed was a less rigid utilization of repressive and inhibitory defensesThe reduction of incoming stimulation led to recall and verbalization of previously forgotten experiences in many instancesFor some subjects this recall was anxietyinducing Other studies have supported this finding that short term sensory deprivation is psychologically beneficialHowever other carefully conducted investigations have found no such improvements and therefore further studies are indicated before any definite conclusions can be made about the therapeutic value of sensory deprivationIn a fascinating and unique report on Zen meditation was presented by DrAkira Kasamatsu and DrTomio Hirai of the Department of NeuroPsychiatry Tokyo UniversityIt contained the results of a tenyear study of the brain wave or electroencephalographic tracings of Zen mastersThe EEG tracings revealed that about ninety seconds after an accomplished Zen practitioner begins meditation a rhythmic slowing in the brain wave pattern known as alpha waves occursThis slowing occurs with eyes open and progresses with meditation and after thirty minutes one finds rhythmic alpha waves of seven or eight per secondThis effect persists for some minutes after meditationWhat is most significant is that this EEG pattern is notably different from those of sleep normal waking consciousness and hypnotic trance and is unusual in persons who have not made considerable progress in meditationIn other words it suggests an unusual mental state though from the subjective reports of the practitioners it does not appear to be a unique or highly unusual conscious experienceIt was also found that a Zen masters evaluation of the amount of progress another practitioner had made correlated directly with the latters EEG changesAnother finding of the same study concerned what is called alpha blocking and habituationTo understand these phenomena let us imagine that a person who is reading quietly is suddenly interrupted by a loud noiseFor a few seconds his attention is diverted from the reading to the noiseIf the same sound is then repeated a few seconds later his attention will again be diverted only not as strongly nor for as long a timeIf the sound is then repeated at regular intervals the person will continue reading and become oblivious to the soundA normal subject with closed eyes produces alpha waves on an EEG tracingAn auditory stimulation such as a loud noise normally obliterates alpha waves for seven seconds or more this is termed alpha blockingIn a Zen master the alpha blocking produced by the first noise lasts only two secondsIf the noise is repeated at second intervals we find that in the normal subject there is virtually no alpha blocking remaining by the fifth successive noiseThis diminution of alpha blocking is termed habituation and persists in normal subjects for as long as the noise continues at regular and frequent intervalsIn the Zen master however no habituation is seenHis alpha blocking lasts two seconds with the first sound two seconds with the fifth sound and two seconds with the twentieth soundThis implies that the Zen master has a greater awareness of his environment as the paradoxical result of meditative concentrationOne master described such a state of mind as that of noticing every person he sees on the street but of not looking back with emotional lingeringThrough science technology and social organization Western man has built a civilization of unprecedented wealth and grandeurYet despite this mastery of his environment he has given little thought to mastery of himselfIn fact his newlyacquired wealth and leisure have heightened his sensuality and weakened his selfdisciplineIt becomes increasingly apparent however that a stable and prosperous democracy can endure only so long as we have intelligent selfdisciplined and properly motivated citizens legislation and education alone will not ensure thisBuddhism presents a technique by which this can be obtained but the responsibility rests with each individualNo one can cure our neuroses and strengthen our characters except ourselvesIn the Sumbha country in the town of Sedaka the Buddha once saidThe preceding was written in with a few minor revisions and additions made in the latter part ofNow at the start of and after six years in Thailand it seems befitting that I review my own wordsFor the past years have not only added to my own experience with meditation they have also brought me into close and prolonged contact with other meditation practitioners many of whom are more dedicated more skillful and more experienced than IOne is impressed with the variety of personalities who undertake practiceSome are experimental critical and pragmatic others more devotional dedicated and idealisticSome seem well adjusted and at peace with themselves and the world while others seem desperate to find happiness and purpose in lifeSome adhere literally to every detail of the scriptures while some instead are dedicated to the interpretations and methods of their respective teachersStill others attempt to find the ways and means alone by their own individual and unaided effortsLikewise the techniques and methods which these people have undertaken are also highly varied and divergentDuring this period of personal practice and consultation with others I have seen what I believe to be some genuine achievements and also some notable failuresThe question then is What is it that succeeds and what is it that does notAnd whyOr to state the matter more precisely One may succeed in one area of meditative development but not in anotherIn order to evaluate progress at meditation one must have some criteria or standards against which to judgeThus we must ask ourselves what is it that short of Nibbana we expect to find in one who has made genuine progress along the Eightfold PathMomentary periods of euphoria altered perceptions or other transient episodes of unusual states of consciousness are not what we seekLikewise we are not in pursuit of occult powers unusual EEG patterns or control of the autonomic nervous systemWith reference to the Four Noble Truths we note the Buddhas words One thing do I teach suffering and the end of suffering Thus if one has truly progressed we would expect that where previously sad and depressed one is now less so where previously selfish one is now more giving where previously defensive secretive and guarded one is now more open and selfassuredWorry and anxiety should be reducedObjective humility should replace conceitInstead of recurrent thoughts of anger and getting even one is more forgiving and at peace with the worldIt is felt that such attainments have been observed occurring as the result of properly directed Buddhist practiceAgain with reference to the Four Noble Truths it is craving or desire which causes our unhappiness and produces our mental defilementsThus only by attacking the problems of craving wanting and desiring can progress be madeI speak now not so much of the crude and obvious desires such as hunger and sex but of the more subtle ones of egotism emotional dependency and desires for possessionOne may fast for two weeks and yet never once look at the fact that the real reason for fasting is to feed ones ego  to be better more disciplined more pious than ones fellow practitionersOr one may work diligently attempting to win the approval confidence and affection of a stern and aloof teacher and never once realize that one is attempting to compensate for the frustration and lack of love from a stern and aloof parentTo really break through these hang ups one must focus attention not on the sensation of breath at the nostrils but instead focus on the agonizing feelings of inadequacy mediocrity loneliness or rejection in ones heartWhen asked What have you gained from meditation the correct answer should be nothing For meditation is not for acquiring but for giving up  a full and complete giving up of the selfToo often people put in a halfhour each day at meditation in the same way that they put in a halfhour studying FrenchAfter so many months or years one has a new attribute a new skill to add to ones already impressive repertoire of virtues achievements talents and abilitiesI can speak French play the piano ski type sixty words a minute and meditate as well Such a person is either compensating for strong feelings of inadequacy or else is badly afflicted with narcissismAnother way in which meditation becomes misdirected as a result of the very motives which determined it is the quest for new sensations or experiences ie lobhaMany seek from meditation the very same thing they seek from drugs  ie an overwhelming egoimmersing experience of sensations perceptions colors emotions and transcendental states beyond wordsIt is not meant to belittle such experiences and say that they have no significance or no valueBut as with taking LSD or seeing a good motion picture they quickly pass into memoriesAnd once past in a very short time ones old mood changes petty jealousies conceits and irritations are back just as strong and as frequent as everIf there has been no true and lasting personality change then Buddhist meditation has fallen short of its intended goalAt the opposite extreme are persons whose approaches to Buddhism are excessively dogmatic literal orthodox and moralisticThey strongly resist a pragmatic eclectic approach to meditation and are hyperconcerned with the nuances and fine points of Buddhist tradition and decorumFrom these sources one repeatedly hears such statements as To progress at meditation there must be strict moral discipline or You cannot expect fast results but must work for years Now there is truth in both these statementsBut in this context they are really symptoms of extreme rigidity and dogmatism which in principle is no different than the dogmatism of many Christian missionaries or other persons doggedly committed to a given institutionOnes commitment to the tradition and to the letter of the teaching is so strong that one is incapable of truly practicing that very same teaching which advises one to have no prejudices and to see truth as universal and independent of any institutionI feel that this unfortunate phenomenon accounts for several instances of very diligent and dedicated meditation practitioners who despite years of intensive practice reveal little more than chronic mild depression mixed with plodding determinationThe theme of guilt and selfpunishment is one factor which tends to perpetuate the phenomenon of diligent striving with minimal resultsIt usually begins with one taking a highly idealistic moralistic and sometimes devotional approach to DhammaOne tries for onepointed concentration and complete suppression of mental defilementsOne fails and tries again fails and tries againBlaming oneself for ones failure one comes to feel guilty and tries even harder again failingWith this the austerity of ones practice comes to take on a selfpunitive natureAngry with oneself one becomes more severe with oneselfFor those who have some insight into their dilemma there may be the added problem of feeling guilty about feeling guilty or becoming irritated that one gets irritatedBut insight is also the first step to resolutionThe second step is to back off and relax a bitAs the Buddha said the guitar string once too slack has now been wound too tight and to produce harmony the tension must be relievedFor idealistic moralistic personalities letting go and relaxing are the very things that intensify ones guiltYet in principle this is much like what the Buddha did when he renounced austere asceticism and took up the middle wayThe practitioner must stand back and reappraise his whole involvement in Buddhism and examine the matter fully without fearing the consequences of his decisionIn evaluating progress at meditation it is important to distinguish between true Buddhist attainment and adaptationAny human being when placed in a new situation goes through the process of adjusting adapting and growing accustomedThis is true of human life in general and it is true of a man who takes the robes of a Buddhist monkWith the passage of time he grows to accept his role to acclimatize and to learn to work the system he may become contented and happy by virtue of duration and age aloneThis process of adaptation is especially relevant in the case of intensive meditation practice where one may spend weeks or months confined to a small room leaving that room only for brief meetings and instructions from the meditation masterIn such situations the practitioner may get extreme feelings of peace and happiness of clarity and alertness of mind such as never before seen and also he may glimpse what appear to be transcendental statesMany who have completed such training have come away greatly impressed and highly praising this techniqueHowever it appears that all of these impressive subjective experiences vanish as soon as one comes out of cloistered isolation and then much like a drug experience they remain only as memoriesMoreover many people who have finished the course appear to manifest the same selfishness and general human shortcomings as found in human beings picked at randomIn addition there is a hazard in that some graduates have revealed extreme pride relative to their attainmentFrom this it should not be assumed that there is nothing to be gained from such intensive trainingOn the contrary I have frequently suggested it to persons seeking competent meditation instructionHowever I do feel that the empirical evidence shows that for many if not most people this technique alone is insufficientAnd the very facts of the Eightfold Path and the Buddhist scriptures in general support this thesisThus it would be wise to resolve ones mundane problems of social adjustment and other emotional conflicts before attempting more specialized practicesQuite often a cloister which protects one from all forms of insults humiliation irritation and anxiety may induce a false sense of attainment and lull one into complacencyWe can confront and abolish our mental defilements only when they are actively alive in our mindsWe cannot do this when they are but hazy memories or intellectually created notionsConsequently many practitioners have found that their progress is enhanced by having true life situations of social interaction and frustrationOn the other hand an excessive exposure to such interactions and frustrations may exceed ones ability for alert mindfulness and one thereby insidiously becomes involved with the quarrels and fascinations that breed hatred and sorrowWhen living in a cloister where no problems arise ones defensive reactions and dispositions may lie dormant and thus remain hiddenBut in ordinary lay life temptations sensations and problems arise so fast that much of the daily routine is little more than a repeating pattern of perceive react and solve perceive react and solve perceive react and solve and so onThus for many practitioners the solution lies in a middle way between these extremes that is a situation in which one still has a moderate exposure to chores annoyances and social interactions but this is interspersed with intervals of quietude and meditationSuch intervals may be a duration of hours or a duration of weeks depending on individual needs and circumstancesThus by maintaining an optimal amount of involvement with social and sensory arousal such a one does more than just perceive react and solveWith mindfulness he is able to catch the perception and reaction as it arisesHe observes it scrutinizes it and evaluates itIn so doing it may then be modified abandoned or developed as seen fitHe acts with mindfulness instead of on habit or reflex and thus new responses and solutions may be learnedIf ones personality is the sum total of ones perceptions responses and reactions then in this way the growth and development of the personality is possibleThe optimum proportion of time that one should spend in isolated meditation as contrasted with the time spent in more mundane pursuits will vary among different individualsIt will also vary according to the method of practice and with different times and stages of development for a given individualI state these above conclusions not only from a theoretical position and not just because they seem to be revealed in the life pattern of the Buddha and his disciples as portrayed in the suttasMy own limited observations of persons who appear to have progressed at Buddhist practice also fits this conclusionIt is against such a background of observations and considerations that I have reviewed my own earlier writing on meditationIn essence these words still appear to be sound and there are no statements that I would see fit to repudiateHowever I feel one point needs to be more strongly emphasized and that is that a regular daily practice of meditation alone will not be likely to show results unless one is willing to thoroughly scrutinize his or her entire pattern of living and be prepared to revise or abandon this lifestyle if so indicatedIn the same way one who undertakes Buddhist training as either a monk or layman would do well not to set a time limit and should not commit himself too strongly to future plansFor such a one has already decided beforehand just what he will become and thereby has limited the amount of change that he will allow himself to makeAlso I think I have emphasized too strongly the amount of breathing and other bodilydirected concentrations called for in beginning practiceI say this with some hesitation because it has become popular in some circles to completely disown concentration as important to Buddhist practice and I do not agree with this viewBut if one focuses exclusively on breathing walking or whatever to the point of blocking all thoughts and emotions one is thereby turning his attention away from the very mental defilements and neurotic conflicts that must be confronted in order to be overcomeThus it is probably significant that in the Noble Eightfold Path right concentration follows after right mindfulnessOne meets a fair number of people who have made considerable attainment at onepointed concentrationYet with a few notable exceptions they appear to be just as prone to selfishness and petty jealousies as any ordinary persons whom one might meet at randomSome in fact have shown themselves to be very unhappy lonely andor insecureOn the other hand persons who have made only slight progress at sustained concentration have nevertheless in the course of Buddhist practice made considerable progress at diminishing conceit resentment depression and selfishnessThe same is true of the labelling technique which is especially common in some forms of Burmese intensive trainingWith this technique one who in meditation finds himself daydreaming will simply note this and label it imagining imagining or fantasy fantasy and then return to awareness of breathing body sensation or whateverHowever daydreams and fantasies are most often an expression of our desires and emotional conflictsIf one examines the daydream in the frame of mind What does it express What desire is it attempting to satisfy What feeling does it carry then one can gain insight into his emotional needs and at the same time confront those same mental taints which meditation is supposed to overcomeThe labelling technique is of course highly useful in dispensing with physical distractions such as itches pains and noises and with certain types of moods and certain kinds of memoriesBut it must be used judiciously for if used exclusively it can retard progressA general rule of practice which many practitioners have used to advantage is as follows One starts practice by attempting to quiet and concentrate the mindBut after some minutes of finding that the mind repeatedly wanders from its intended object the practitioner then stands back as it were and asks Just what is my present state of mind at this instant What is it that makes my attention wander from its intended object This then is analyzed and confrontedIn principle this is much like another useful technique which is One does not choose any given meditation subject but instead simply sits and takes note What is my mental state nowWhat gross feelingsWhat subtle feelingsWhat memories and expectationsWhat intentions or desires In actual practice this is done not in the form of verbal thoughts as expressed in the preceding sentences but rather as a state of watchful observation with few if any word thoughts presentQuite often at such times one finds a subtle mental defilement which must be examined and discardedThat is the idea Now I am meditating and want to have something to show for itI want something to happen Or it may be I want to confront and overcome my anger but now that Im looking for it it seems to have gone and with this arises a feeling of frustrationHerein one has set a goal and been thwartedThus the desiring of this specific goal and its resultant frustration is the very state of mind that must be dealt withSuccessful meditation requires catching the immediate presentFinally a note about the attainments in meditation unless one is very advanced one does not expect or aspire to any new or unusual experience such as are known in ordinary lifeInstead the attainments are negative ones and thus only seen in retrospectFor example one suddenly reflects A year ago I was chronically depressed unhappy irritable defensiveThat rarely happens nowSuch and such a thing used to upset me greatlyNow it happens and I hardly noticeIt may be stating the case too strongly to say that in meditation one seeks to gain nothingFor there is an increase in happiness and peace of mindBut when asked What have you gained from meditation the answer would be It is not what I have gained that is important but rather what I have diminished namely greed hatred and delusionThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIs mindfulness actually a power in its own right as claimed by the title of this essaySeen from the viewpoint of the ordinary pursuits of life it does not seem soFrom that angle mindfulness or attention has a rather modest place among many other seemingly more important mental faculties serving the purpose of variegated wishfulfillmentHere mindfulness means just to watch ones steps so that one may not stumble or miss a chance in the pursuit of ones aimsOnly in the case of specific tasks and skills is mindfulness sometimes cultivated more deliberately but here too it is still regarded as a subservient function and its wider scope and possibilities are not recognizedEven if one turns to the Buddhas doctrine taking only a surface view of the various classifications and lists of mental factors in which mindfulness appears one may be inclined to regard this faculty just as one among many Again one may get the impression that it has a rather subordinate place and is easily surpassed in significance by other facultiesMindfulness in fact has if we may personify it a rather unassuming characterCompared with it mental factors such as devotion energy imagination and intelligence are certainly more colorful personalities making an immediate and strong impact on people and situationsTheir conquests are sometimes rapid and vast though often insecureMindfulness on the other hand is of an unobtrusive natureIts virtues shine inwardly and in ordinary life most of its merits are passed on to other mental faculties which generally receive all the creditOne must know mindfulness well and cultivate its acquaintance before one can appreciate its value and its silent penetrative influenceMindfulness walks slowly and deliberately and its daily task is of a rather humdrum natureYet where it places its feet it cannot easily be dislodged and it acquires and bestows true mastery of the ground it coversMental faculties of such a nature like actual personalities of a similar type are often overlooked or underratedIn the case of mindfulness it required a genius like the Buddha to discover the hidden talent in the modest garb and to develop the vast inherent power of that potent seedIt is indeed the mark of a genius to perceive and to harness the power of the seemingly smallHere truly it happens that what is little becomes much A revaluation of values takes placeThe standards of greatness and smallness changeThrough the master mind of the Buddha mindfulness is finally revealed as the Archimedean point where the vast revolving mass of world suffering is levered out of its twofold anchorage in ignorance and cravingThe Buddha spoke of the power of mindfulness in a very emphatic wayAll things can be mastered by mindfulnessFurther there is that solemn and weighty utterance opening and concluding the Satipatthana Sutta the Discourse on the Foundations of MindfulnessIn ordinary life if mindfulness or attention is directed to any object it is rarely sustained long enough for the purpose of careful and factual observationGenerally it is followed immediately by emotional reaction discriminative thought reflection or purposeful actionIn a life and thought governed by the Buddhas teaching too mindfulness is mostly linked with clear comprehension of the right purpose or suitability of an action and other considerationsThus again it is not viewed in itselfBut to tap the actual and potential power of mindfulness it is necessary to understand and deliberately cultivate it in its basic unalloyed form which we shall call bare attentionBy bare attention we understand the clear and singleminded awareness of what actually happens to us and in us at the successive moments of perceptionIt is called bare because it attends to the bare facts of a perception without reacting to them by deed speech or mental commentOrdinarily that purely receptive state of mind is as we said just a very brief phase of the thought process of which one is often scarcely awareBut in the methodical development of mindfulness aimed at the unfolding of its latent powers bare attention is sustained for as long a time as ones strength of concentration permitsBare attention then becomes the key to the meditative practice of satipatthana opening the door to minds mastery and final liberationBare attention is developed in two ways as a methodical meditative practice with selected objects as applied as far as practicable to the normal events of the day together with a general attitude of mindfulness and clear comprehensionThe details of the practice have been described elsewhere and need not be repeated hereThe primary purpose of this essay is to demonstrate and explain the efficacy of this method that is to show the actual power of mindfulnessParticularly in an age like ours with its superstitious worship of ceaseless external activity there will be those who ask How can such a passive attitude of mind as that of bare attention possibly lead to the great results claimed for it In reply one may be inclined to suggest to the questioner not to rely on the words of others but to put these assertions of the Buddha to the test of personal experienceBut those who do not yet know the Buddhas teaching well enough to accept it as a reliable guide may hesitate to take up without good reasons a practice that just on account of its radical simplicity may appear strange to themIn the following a number of such good reasons are therefore proffered for the readers scrutinyThey are also meant as an introduction to the general spirit of satipatthana and as pointers to its wide and significant perspectivesFurthermore it is hoped that he who has taken up the methodical training will recognize in the following observations certain features of his own practice and be encouraged to cultivate them deliberatelyWe shall now deal with four aspects of bare attention which are the mainsprings of the power of mindfulnessThey are not the only sources of its strength but they are the principal ones to which the efficacy of this method of mental development is dueThese four areIf anyone whose mind is not harmonized and controlled through methodical meditative training should take a close look at his own everyday thoughts and activities he will meet with a rather disconcerting sightApart from the few main channels of his purposeful thoughts and activities he will everywhere be faced with a tangled mass of perceptions thoughts feelings and casual bodily movements showing a disorderliness and confusion which he would certainly not tolerate in his livingroomYet this is the state of affairs that we take for granted within a considerable portion of our waking life and our normal mental activityLet us now look at the details of that rather untidy pictureFirst we meet a vast number of casual senseimpressions such as sights and sounds passing constantly through our mindMost of them remain vague and fragmentary some are even based on faulty perceptions and misjudgmentsCarrying these inherent weaknesses they often form the untested basis for judgments and decisions on a higher level of consciousnessTrue all these casual sense impressions need not and cannot be objects of focused attentionA stone on the road that happens to meet our glance will have a claim on our attention only if it obstructs our progress or is of interest to us for some reasonYet if we neglect these casual impressions too often we may stumble over many stones lying on our road and also overlook many gemsBesides the casual sense impressions there are those more significant and definite perceptions thoughts feelings and volitions which have a closer connection with our purposeful lifeHere too we find that a very high proportion of them are in a state of utter confusionHundreds of crosscurrents flash through the mind and everywhere there are bits and ends of unfinished thoughts stifled emotions and passing moodsMany meet a premature deathOwing to their innately feeble nature our lack of concentration or suppression by new and stronger impressions they do not persist and developIf we observe our own mind we shall notice how easily diverted our thoughts are how often they behave like undisciplined disputants constantly interrupting each other and refusing to listen to the other sides argumentsAgain many lines of thought remain rudimentary or are left untranslated into will and action because courage is lacking to accept their practical moral or intellectual consequencesIf we continue to examine more closely our average perceptions thoughts or judgments we shall have to admit that many of them are unreliableThey are just the products of habit led by prejudices of intellect or emotion by our pet preferences or aversions by laziness or selfishness by faulty or superficial observationsSuch a look into longneglected quarters of the mind will come as a wholesome shock to the observerIt will convince him of the urgent need for methodical mental culture extending below the thin surface layer of the mind to those vast twilight regions of consciousness we have just visitedThe observer will then become aware that the relatively small sector of the mind that stands in the intense light of purposeful will and thought is not a reliable standard of the inner strength and lucidity of consciousness in its totalityHe will also see that the quality of individual consciousness cannot be judged by a few optimal results of mental activity achieved in brief intermittent periodsThe decisive factor in determining the quality of consciousness is selfunderstanding and selfcontrol whether that dim awareness characteristic of our everyday mind and the uncontrolled portion of everyday activity tends to increase or decreaseIt is the daily little negligence in thoughts words and deeds going on for many years of our life that is chiefly responsible for the untidiness and confusion we find in our mindsThis negligence creates the trouble and allows it to continueThus the old Buddhist teachers have said Negligence produces a lot of dirtAs in a house so in the mind only a very little dirt collects in a day or two but if it goes on for many years it will grow into a vast heap of refuseThe dark untidy corners of the mind are the hideouts of our most dangerous enemiesFrom there they attack us unawares and much too often succeed in defeating usThat twilight world peopled by frustrated desires and suppressed resentments by vacillations whims and many other shadowy figures forms a background from which upsurging passions  greed and lust hatred and anger  may derive powerful supportBesides the obscure and obscuring nature of that twilight region is the very element and mothersoil of the third and strongest of the three roots of evil ignorance or delusionAttempts at eliminating the minds main defilements  greed hate and delusion  must fail as long as these defilements find refuge and support in the uncontrolled dim regions of the mind as long as the close and complex tissue of those halfarticulate thoughts and emotions forms the basic texture of mind into which just a few golden strands of noble and lucid thought are wovenBut how are we to deal with that unwieldy tangled massUsually we try to ignore it and to rely on the counteracting energies of our surface mindBut the only safe remedy is to face it  with mindfulnessNothing more difficult is needed than to acquire the habit of directing bare attention to these rudimentary thoughts as often as possibleThe working principle here is the simple fact that two thoughts cannot coexist at the same time if the clear light of mindfulness is present there is no room for mental twilightWhen sustained mindfulness has secured a firm foothold it will be a matter of comparatively secondary importance how the mind will then deal with those rudimentary thoughts moods and emotionsOne may just dismiss them and replace them by purposeful thoughts or one may allow and even compel them to complete what they have to sayIn the latter case they will often reveal how poor and weak they actually are and it will then not be difficult to dispose of them once they are forced into the openThis procedure of bare attention is very simple and effective the difficulty is only the persistence in applying itObserving a complex thing means identifying its component parts singling out the separate strands forming that intricate tissueIf this is applied to the complex currents of mental and practical life automatically a strong regulating influence will be noticeableAs if ashamed in the presence of the calmly observing eye the course of thoughts will proceed in a less disorderly and wayward manner it will not be so easily diverted and will resemble more and more a wellregulated riverDuring decades of the present life and throughout millennia of previous lives traversing the round of existence there has steadily grown within each individual a closely knit system of intellectual and emotional prejudices of bodily and mental habits that are no longer questioned as to their rightful position and useful function in human lifeHere again the application of bare attention loosens the hard soil of these often very ancient layers of the human mind preparing thus the ground for sowing the seed of methodical mental trainingBare attention identifies and pursues the single threads of that closely interwoven tissue of our habitsIt sorts out carefully the subsequent justifications of passionate impulses and the pretended motives of our prejudicesFearlessly it questions old habits often grown meaninglessIt uncovers their roots and thus helps abolish all that is seen to be harmfulIn brief bare attention lays open the minute crevices in the seemingly impenetrable structure of unquestioned mental processesThen the sword of wisdom wielded by the strong arm of constant meditative practice will be able to penetrate these crevices and finally to break up that structure where requiredIf the inner connection between the single parts of a seemingly compact whole become intelligible they then cease to be inaccessibleWhen the facts and details of the minds conditioned nature are uncovered by meditative practice there is an increased chance to effect fundamental changes in the mindIn that way not only those hitherto unquestioned habits of the mind its twilight regions and its normal processes as well but even those seemingly solid indisputable facts of the world of matter  all will become questionable and lose much of their selfassuranceMany people are so impressed and intimidated by that bland selfassurance of assumed solid facts that they hesitate to take up any spiritual training doubting that it can effect anything worthwhileThe application of bare attention to the task of tidying and regulating the mind will bring perceptible results  results which will dispel their doubts and encourage them to enter more fully a spiritual pathThe tidying or regulating function of bare attention we should note is of fundamental importance for the purification of beings mentioned by the Buddha as the first aim of satipatthanaThis phrase refers of course to the purification of their minds and here the very first step is to bring initial order into the functioning of the mental processesWe have seen how this is done by bare attentionIn that sense the commentary to the Discourse on the Foundation of Mindfulness explains the words for the purification of beings as followsWe said before that bare attention tidies up or regulates the mind by sorting out and identifying the various confused strands of the mental processThat identifying function like any other mental activity is connected with a verbal formulationIn other words identifying proceeds by way of expressly naming the respective mental processesPrimitive man believed that words could exercise a magical power things that could be named had lost their secret power over man the horror of the unknownTo know the name of a force a being or an object was identical with the mastery over it That ancient belief in the magical potency of names appears also in many fairy tales and myths where the power of a demon is broken just by facing him courageously and pronouncing his nameThere is an element of truth in the wordmagic of primitive man and in the practice of bare attention we will find the power of naming confirmedThe twilight demons of the mind  our passionate impulses and obscure thoughts  cannot bear the simple but clarifying questions about their names much less the knowledge of these namesHence this is often alone sufficient to diminish their strengthThe calmly observant glance of mindfulness discovers the demons in their hidingplacesThe practice of calling them by their names drives them out into the open into the daylight of consciousnessThere they will feel embarrassed and obliged to justify themselves although at this stage of bare attention they have not yet even been subjected to any closer questioning except about their names their identityIf forced into the open while still in an incipient stage they will be incapable of withstanding scrutiny and will just dwindle awayThus a first victory over them may be won even at an early stage of the practiceThe appearance in the mind of undesirable and ignoble thoughts even if they are very fleeting and only halfarticulate has an unpleasant effect upon ones selfesteemTherefore such thoughts are often shoved aside unattended to and unopposedOften they are also camouflaged by more pleasing and respectable labels which hide their true natureThoughts disposed of in either of these two ways will strengthen the accumulated power of ignoble tendencies in the subconsciousFurthermore these procedures will weaken ones will to resist the arising and the dominance of mental defilements and strengthen the tendency to evade the issuesBut by applying the simple method of clearly and honestly naming or registering any undesirable thoughts these two harmful devices ignorance and camouflage are excludedThence their detrimental consequences on the structure of the subconscious and their diversion of mental effort will be avoidedWhen ignoble thoughts or personal shortcomings are called by their right names the mind will develop an inner resistance and even repugnance against themIn time it may well succeed in keeping them in check and finally eliminating themEven if these means do not bring undesirable tendencies fully under control at once they will stamp upon them the impact of repeated resistance which will weaken them whenever they reappearTo continue our personification we may say that unwholesome thoughts will no longer be the unopposed masters of the scene and this diffidence of theirs will make them considerably easier to deal withIt is the power of moral shame that has been mustered here as an ally methodically strengthened by these simple yet subtle psychological techniquesThe method of naming and registering also extends of course to noble thoughts and impulses which will be encouraged and strengthenedWithout being given deliberate attention such wholesome tendencies often pass unnoticed and remain barrenBut when clear awareness is applied to them it will stimulate their growthIt is one of the most beneficial features of right mindfulness and particularly of bare attention that it enables us to utilize all external events and inner mental events for our progressEven the unsalutary can be made a starting point for the salutary if through the device of naming or registering it becomes an object of detached knowledgeIn several passages of the Satipatthana Sutta the function of naming or bare registering seems to be indicated by formulating the respective statements by way of direct speechThere are no less than four such instances in the discourseHe knows a lustful mind Mind is lustful etcIf sense desire is present in him he knows Sense desire is present in me etcIf the enlightenment factor mindfulness is present in him he knows The enlightenment factor mindfulness is present in me etcIn concluding this section we briefly point out that the tidyingup and naming of mental processes is the indispensable preparation for fully understanding them in their true nature the task of insightThese functions exercised by bare attention will help dispel the illusion that the mental processes are compactThey will also help us to discern their specific nature or characteristics and to notice their momentary rise and fallBoth the world surrounding us and the world of our own minds are full of hostile and conflicting forces causing us pain and frustrationWe know from our own bitter experience that we are not strong enough to meet and conquer all these antagonistic forces in open combatIn the external world we cannot have everything exactly as we want it while in the inner world of the mind our passions impulses and whims often override the demands of duty reason and our higher aspirationsWe further learn that often an undesirable situation will only worsen if excessive pressure is used against itPassionate desires may grow in intensity if one tries to silence them by sheer force of willDisputes and quarrels will go on endlessly and grow fiercer if they are fanned again and again by angry retorts or by vain attempts to crush the other mans positionA disturbance during work rest or meditation will be felt more strongly and will have a longerlasting impact if one reacts to it by resentment and anger and attempts to suppress itThus again and again we meet with situations in life where we cannot force issuesBut there are ways of mastering the vicissitudes of life and conflicts of mind without applications of forceNonviolent means may often succeed where attempts at coercion internal or external failSuch a nonviolent way of mastering life and mind is satipatthanaBy the methodical application of bare attention the basic practice in the development of right mindfulness all the latent powers of a noncoercive approach will gradually unfold with the beneficial results and their wide and unexpected implicationsIn this context we are mainly concerned with the benefits of Satipatthana for the mastery of mind and for the progress in meditation that may result from a noncoercive procedureBut we shall also cast occasional side glances at its repercussions on everyday lifeIt will not be difficult for a thoughtful reader to make more detailed application to his own problemsThe antagonistic forces that appear in meditation and that are liable to upset its smooth course are of three kindsThese distractions are the great stumbling blocks for a beginner in meditation who has not yet acquired sufficient dexterity to deal with them effectivelyTo give thought to those disturbing factors only when they actually arise at the time of meditation is insufficientIf caught unprepared in ones defence one will struggle with them in a more or less haphazard and ineffective way and with a feeling of irritation which will itself be an additional impedimentIf disturbances of any kind and unskillful reactions to them occur several times during one session one may come to feel utterly frustrated and irritated and give up further attempts to meditate at least for the present occasionIn fact even meditators who are quite well informed by books or a teacher about all the details concerning their subject of meditation often lack instruction on how to deal skillfully with the disturbances they may meetThe feeling of helplessness in facing them is the most formidable difficulty for a beginning meditatorAt that point many accept defeat abandoning prematurely any further effort at methodical practiceAs in worldly affairs so in meditation ones way of dealing with the initial difficulties will often be decisive for success or failureWhen faced by inner and outer disturbances the inexperienced or uninstructed beginner will generally react in two waysHe will first try to shove them away lightly and if he fails in that he will try to suppress them by sheer force of willBut these disturbances are like insolent flies by whisking  first lightly and then with increasing vigor and anger  one may perhaps succeed in driving them away for a while but usually they will return with an exasperating constancy and the effort and vexation of whisking will have produced only an additional disturbance of ones composureSatipatthana through its method of bare attention offers a nonviolent alternative to those futile and even harmful attempts at suppression by forceA successful nonviolent procedure in mindcontrol has to start with the right attitudeThere must be first the full cognizance and sober acceptance of the fact that those three disturbing factors are coinhabitants of the world we live in whether we like it or notOur disapproval of them will not alter the factWith some we shall have to come to terms and concerning the others  the mental defilements  we shall have to learn how to deal with them effectively until they are finally conqueredSince we are not the sole inhabitants of this densely populated world there are bound to be external disturbances of various kinds such as noise and interruptions by visitorsWe cannot always live in splendid isolation from the noise of men and dogs untroubled or ivory towers high above the crowdRight meditation is not escapism it is not meant to provide hidingplaces for temporary oblivionRealistic meditation has the purpose of training the mind to face to understand and to conquer this very world in which we liveAnd this world inevitably includes numerous obstacles to the life of meditationThe Burmese meditation master the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw said In an unliberated worldling mental defilements are sure to arise again and againHe has to face that fact and know these defilements well in order to apply again and again the appropriate remedy of SatipatthanaThen they will grow weaker more shortlived and will finally disappear To know the occurrence and nature of defilements is therefore as important for a meditator as to know the occurrence of his noble thoughtsBy facing ones own defilements one will be stirred to increase the effort to eliminate themOn the other hand if out of a false shame or pride one tries to avert ones glance when they arise one will never truly join issue with them and will always evade the final and decisive encounterBy hitting blindly at them one will only exhaust or even hurt oneselfBut by observing carefully their nature and behavior when they arise in ones own mind one will be able to meet them well prepared to forestall them often and finally to banish them fullyTherefore meet your defilements with a free and open glanceBe not ashamed afraid or discouragedThe third group of intruders disturbing the meditators mind are stray thoughts and daydreamsThese may consist of various memories and images of the past recent or remote including those emerging from subconscious depths thoughts of the future  planning imagining fearing hoping and the casual senseperceptions that may occur at the very time of meditation often dragging after them a long trail of associated ideasWhenever concentration and mindfulness slacken stray thoughts or daydreams appear and fill the vacuumThough they seem insignificant in themselves through their frequent occurrence they form a most formidable obstacle not only for the beginner but in all cases when the mind is restless or distractedHowever when these invaders can be kept at bay even long continuous periods of meditation can be achievedAs in the case of the mental defilements stray thoughts will be entirely excluded only at the stage of Arahatship when the perfect mindfulness thereby obtained keeps unfailing watch at the door of the mindIf they are to shape our attitude all these facts about the three kinds of disturbing factors must be given full weight and be fully absorbed by our mindThen in these three disturbing factors the noble truth of suffering will manifest itself to the meditator very incisively through his own personal experience Not to obtain what one wants is suffering The three other noble truths should also be exemplified by reference to the same situationIn such a way even when dealing with impediments the meditator will be within the domain of SatipatthanaHe will be engaged in the mindful awareness of the Four Noble Truths  a part of the contemplation of mental objectsIt is characteristic of right mindfulness and one of its tasks to relate the actual experiences of life to the truth of the Dhamma and to use them as opportunities for its practical realizationAlready at the preliminary stage devoted to the shaping of a correct and helpful attitude we have the first successful test of our peaceful weapons by understanding our adversaries better we have consolidated our position which was formerly weakened by an emotional approach and by transforming these adversaries into teachers of the truths we have won the first advantage over themIf we are mentally prepared by a realistic view of these three factors antagonistic to meditation we shall be less inclined to react at once by irritation when they actually ariseWe shall be emotionally in a better position to meet them with the nonviolent weapons of which we shall now speakThere are three devices for countering disturbances that arise in meditationThe three should be applied in succession whenever the preceding device has failed to dispose of the disturbanceAll three are applications of bare attention they differ in the degree and duration of attention given to the disturbanceThe guiding rule here is to give no more mental emphasis to the respective disturbance than is actually required by circumstancesFirst one should notice the disturbance clearly but lightly that is without emphasis and without attention to detailsAfter that brief act of noticing one should try to return to the original subject of meditationIf the disturbance was weak or ones preceding concentration fairly strong one may well succeed in resuming contemplationAt that stage by being careful not to get involved in any conversation or argument with the intruder we shall on our part not give it a reason to stay long and in a good number of cases the disturbance will soon depart like a visitor who does not receive a very warm welcomeThat curt dismissal may often enable us to return to our original meditation without any serious disturbance to the composure of mindThe nonviolent device here is to apply bare attention to the disturbance but with a minimum of response to it and with a mind bent on withdrawalThis is the very way in which the Buddha himself dealt with inopportune visitors as described in the Mahasuññata Sutta with a mind bent on seclusion and withdrawn his conversation aiming at dismissing Similar was Shantidevas advice on how to deal with fools if one cannot avoid them one should treat them with the indifferent politeness of a gentlemanIf however the disturbance persists one should repeat the application of bare attention again and again patiently and calmly and it may be that the disturbance will vanish when it has spent its forceHere the attitude is to meet the repeated occurrence of a disturbance by a reiterated No a determined refusal to be deflected from ones courseThis is the attitude of patience and firmnessThe capacity for watchful observation has to be aided here by the capacity to wait and to hold ones groundThese two devices will generally be successful with incidental stray thoughts and daydreams which are feeble by nature but the other two types of disturbances the external ones and defilements may also yield quite oftenBut if for some reason they do not yield one should deliberately turn ones full attention to the disturbance and make it an object of knowledgeThus one transforms it from a disturbance to meditation into a legitimate object of meditationOne may continue with that new object until the external or internal cause for attending to it has ceased or if it proves satisfactory one may even retain it for the rest of that sessionFor instance when disturbed by a persistent noise we should give the noise our undivided attention but we should take care to distinguish the object itself from our reaction to itFor example if resentment arises it should be clearly recognized in its own nature whenever it arisesIn doing so we shall be practicing the contemplation of mindobjects according to the following passage of the Satipatthana Sutta He knows the ear and sounds and the fetter arising through both If the noise is intermittent or of varying intensity one will easily be able to discern the rise and fall in its occurrenceIn that way one will add to ones direct insight into impermanencyThe attitude towards recurrent mental defilements such as thoughts of lust and restlessness should be similarOne should face them squarely but distinguish them from ones reaction to them eg connivance fear resentment irritationIn doing so one is making use of the device of naming and one will reap the benefits mentioned aboveIn the recurrent waves of passion or restlessness one will likewise learn to distinguish gradually phases of high and low their ups and downs and may also gain other helpful knowledge about their behaviorBy that procedure one again remains entirely within the range of Satipatthana by practicing the contemplation of the state of mind and of mindobjectsThis method of transforming disturbances to meditation into objects of meditation as simple as it is ingenious may be regarded as the culmination of nonviolent procedureIt is a device very characteristic of the spirit of satipatthana to make use of all experiences as aids on the pathIn that way enemies are turned into friends for all these disturbances and antagonistic forces have become our teachers and teachers whoever they may be should be regarded as friendsWe cannot forego to quote here a passage from a noteworthy little book The Little Locksmith by Katherine Butler Hathaway a moving human document of fortitude and practical wisdom acquired by sufferingWe said before that the occurrence of the three disturbing elements cannot always be preventedThey are parts of our world and their coming and going follows its own laws irrespective of our approval or disapprovalBut by applying bare attention we can avoid being swept away or dislodged by themBy taking a firm and calm stand on the secure ground of mindfulness we shall repeat in a modest degree but in an essentially identical way the historic situation under the Bodhi TreeWhen Mara the Evil One at the head of his army claimed the soil on which the future Buddha sat the latter refused to budgeTrusting in the power of mindfulness we may confidently repeat the Bodhisattas aspiration on that occasion Ma Mam thana acaviMay he not dislodge me from this placeLet the intruders come and goLike all the other members of that vast unceasing procession of mental and physical events that passes before our observant eyes in the practice of bare attention they arise and having arisen they pass awayOur advantage here is the obvious fact that two thought moments cannot be present at the same timeAttention refers strictly speaking not to the present but to the moment that has just passed awayThus as long as mindfulness holds sway there will be no disturbance or defiled thought This gives us the chance to hold on to that secure ground of an observers post our own potential throne of enlightenmentBy the quietening and neutralizing influence of detached observation as applied in our three devices the interruptions of meditation will increasingly lose the sting of irritation and thereby their disturbing effectThis will prove to be an act of true viraga which literally means decoloring When these experiences are stripped of the emotional tinge that excites towards lust aversion irritation and other defilements of the mind they will appear in their true nature as bare phenomenaThe nonviolent procedure of bare attention endows the meditator with the light but sure touch so essential for handling the sensitive evasive and refractory nature of the mindIt also enables him to deal smoothly with the various difficult situations and obstacles met with in daily lifeTo illustrate the even quality of energy required for attaining to the meditative absorptions The Path of Purification describes a test which students of surgery in ancient days had to undergo as a proof of their skillA lotus leaf was placed in a bowl of water and the pupil had to make an incision through the length of the leaf without cutting it entirely or submerging itHe who applied an excess of force either cut the leaf into two or pressed it into the water while the timid one did not even dare to scratch itIn fact something like the gentle but firm hand of the surgeon is required in mental training and this skillful wellbalanced touch will be the natural outcome of the nonviolent procedure in the practice of bare attentionFor a full and unobstructed unfoldment of the minds capacities the influence of two complementary forces is needed activating and restrainingThat twofold need was recognized by the Buddha the great knower of mindHe advised that the faculties of energy and of concentration should be kept equally strong and well balancedFurthermore he recommended three of the seven factors of enlightenment as suitable for rousing the mind and three for calming itIn both cases among the spiritual faculties and the enlightenment factors it is mindfulness that not only watches over their equilibrium but also activates those that are sluggish and restrains those that are too intenseMindfulness though seemingly of a passive nature is in fact an activating forceIt makes the mind alert and alertness is indispensable for all purposeful activityIn the present inquiry however we shall examine how it makes for disentanglement and detachment and how it positively helps in the development of the mental qualities required for the work of deliveranceIn practicing bare attention we keep still at the mental and spatial place of observation amidst the loud demands of the inner and outer worldMindfulness possesses the strength of tranquillity the capacity for deferring action and applying the brake for stopping rash interference and for suspending judgment while pausing to observe facts and to reflect upon them wiselyIt also brings a wholesome slowing down in the impetuosity of thought speech and actionKeeping still and stopping pausing and slowing down  these will be our key words when speaking now of the restraining effect of bare attentionAn ancient Chinese book statesIn the light of the Buddhas teaching the true end of things is Nibbana which is called the stilling of formations that is their final end or cessationIt is also called the stoppingThe things or formations meant here are the conditioned and impersonal phenomena rooted in craving and ignoranceThe end of formations comes to be by the end of forming that is by the end of worldcreating kammic activitiesIt is the end of the world and of suffering which the Buddha proclaimed cannot be reached by walking migrating or transmigrating but can be found within ourselvesThat end of the world is heralded by each deliberate act of keeping still stopping or pausingKeeping still in that highest sense means stopping the accumulation of kamma abstaining from our unceasing concern with evanescent things abstaining from perpetually adding to our entanglements in samsara  the round of repeated birth and deathBy following the way of mindfulness by training ourselves to keep still and pause in the attitude of bare attention we refuse to take up the worlds persistent challenge to our dispositions for greed or hatredWe protect ourselves against rash and delusive judgments we refrain from blindly plunging into the whirlpool of interfering action with all its inherent dangers Sutta Nipata vHe who keeps still and knows where to stop will not meet danger  TaoTeChing Chapter The Chinese saying quoted earlier states in its second part that there is nothing more glorious in making things start than in keeping stillExplained in the Buddhist sense these things effectively started by keeping still are the things making for decrease of kammic accumulation In dealing with them we may follow the traditional division of mental training into morality concentration and wisdomAll three are decisively helped by the attitude of keeping still cultivated by bare attentionConductHow can we improve our conduct its moral quality and its skill in taking right decisionsIf we earnestly desire such an improvement it will generally be wisest to choose the line of least resistanceIf we turn too quickly against those shortcomings deeply rooted in old habits or in powerful impulses we might suffer discouraging defeatWe should pay attention first to our blemishes of action and speech and our errors of judgment caused by thoughtlessness and rashnessOf these there are manyIn our lives there are numerous instances where one short moment of reflection might have prevented a false step and thereby warded off a long chain of misery or moral guilt that started with a single moment of thoughtlessnessBut how can we curb our rash reactions and replace them by moments of mindfulness and reflectionTo do so will depend on our capacity to stop and pause to apply brakes at the right time and this we can learn by practicing bare attentionIn that practice we shall train ourselves to look and wait to suspend reactions or slow them downWe shall learn it first the easy way in situations of our own choice within the limited field of experiences met with during the periods of meditative practiceWhen facing again and again the incidental sense impressions feelings or stray thoughts which interrupt our concentration when curbing again and again our desire to respond to them in some way when succeeding again and again in keeping still in face of them  we shall be preparing ourselves to preserve that inner stillness in the wider and unprotected field of everyday lifeWe shall have acquired a presence of mind that will enable us to pause and stop even if we are taken by surprise or are suddenly provoked or temptedOur present remarks refer to those blemishes of conduct liable to arise through thoughtlessness and rashness but which may be more or less easily checked through mindfulnessDexterity in dealing with these will also affect those more obstinate deviations from moral conduct rooted in strong passionate impulses or in deeply ingrained bad habitsThe increased tranquillity of mind achieved in keeping still for bare attention will restrain the impetuosity of passionsThe acquired habit of pausing and stopping will act as a brake to the ingrained habits of indulging in unwholesome deedsBy being able to keep still for bare attention or to pause for wise reflection very often the first temptation to lust the first wave of anger the first mist of delusion will disappear without causing serious entanglementAt which point the current of unwholesome thought process is stopped will depend on the quality of mindfulnessIf mindfulness is keen it will succeed at a very early point in calling a stop to a series of defiled thoughts or actions before we are carried along by them too farThen the respective defilements will not grow beyond their initial strength less effort will be required to check them and fewer kammic entanglements or none will followLet us take the example of a pleasant visual object which has aroused our likingAt first that liking might not be very active and insistentIf at this point the mind is already able to keep still for detached observation or reflection the visual perception can easily be divested of its still very slight admixture of lustThe object becomes registered as just something seen that has caused a pleasant feeling or the attraction felt is sublimated into a quiet aesthetic pleasureBut if that earliest chance has been missed the liking will grow into attachment and into the desire to possessIf now a stop is called the thought of desire may gradually lose its strength it will not easily turn into an insistent craving and no actual attempts to get possession of the desired object will followBut if the current of lust is still unchecked then the thought of desire may express itself by speech in asking for the object or even demanding it with impetuous wordsThat is unwholesome mental kamma is followed by unwholesome verbal kammaA refusal will cause the original current of lust to branch out into additional streams of mental defilements either sadness or angerBut if even at that late stage one can stop for quiet reflection or bare attention accept the refusal and renounce wishfulfillment further complications will be avoidedHowever if clamoring words are followed by unwholesome bodily kamma and if driven by craving one tries to get possession of the desired object by stealth or force then the kammic entanglement is complete and its consequences must be experienced in their full impactBut still if even after the completion of the evil act one stops for reflection it will not be in vainFor the mindfulness that arises in the form of remorseful retrospection will preclude a hardening of character and may prevent a repetition of the same actionThe Exalted One once said to his son RahulaAlso while you are performing an action by body speech or mind you should consider that action If in considering it you realize This action which I am performing is harmful to myself or harmful to others or harmful to both it is an unwholesome action producing suffering resulting in suffering  then you should desist from such an actionAlso after you have performed an action by body speech or mind you should consider that action If in considering it you realize This action which I have performed has been harmful to myself or harmful to others or harmful to both it was an unwholesome action producing suffering resulting in suffering  then you should in the future refrain from itTranquillityWe shall now consider how stopping for bare attention also helps one to attain and strengthen tranquillity in its double sense general peace of mind and meditative concentrationBy developing the habit of pausing for bare attention it becomes increasingly easier to withdraw into ones own inner stillness when unable to escape bodily from the loud insistent noises of the outer worldIt will be easier to forego useless reactions to the foolish speech or deeds of othersWhen the blows of fate are particularly hard and incessant a mind trained in bare attention will find a refuge in the haven of apparent passivity or watchful nonaction from which position it will be able to wait patiently until the storms have passedThere are situations in life when it is best to allow things to come to their natural endHe who is able to keep still and wait will often succeed where aggressiveness or busy activity would have been vanquishedNot only in critical situations but also in the normal course of life the experience won by observant keeping still will convince us that we need not actively respond to every impression we receive or regard every encounter with people or things as a challenge to our interfering activityBy refraining from busying ourselves unnecessarily external frictions will be reduced and the internal tensions they bring will loosen upGreater harmony and peace will pervade the life of every day bridging the gap between normal life and the tranquillity of meditationThen there will be fewer of those disturbing inner reverberations of everyday restlessness which in a coarse or subtle form invade the hours of meditation producing bodily and mental unrestConsequently the hindrance of agitation a chief obstacle to concentration will appear less often and will be easier to overcome when it arisesBy cultivating the attitude of bare attention as often as opportunity offers the centrifugal forces of mind making for mental distraction will peter out the centripetal tendency turning the mind inward and making for concentration will gather strengthCraving will no longer run out in pursuit of a variety of changing objectsRegular practice of sustained attention to a continuous series of events prepares the mind for sustained concentration on a single object or a limited number of objects in the strict practice of meditationFirmness or steadiness of mind another important factor in concentration will likewise be cultivatedThus the practice of keeping still pausing and stopping for bare attention fosters several salient components of meditative tranquillity calmness concentration firmness and reduction of the multiplicity of objectsIt raises the average level of normal consciousness and brings it closer to the level of the meditative mindThis is an important point because often too wide a gap between these two mental levels repeatedly frustrates attempts at mental concentration and hinders the achievement of smooth continuity in meditative practiceIn the sequence of the seven factors of enlightenment we find that the enlightenment factor of tranquillity precedes that of concentrationExpressing the same fact the Buddha says If tranquilized within the mind will become concentrated Now in the light of our previous remarks we shall better understand these statementsInsightIt has been said by the Exalted One He whose mind is concentrated sees things as they really are Therefore all those ways by which bare attention strengthens concentration also provide a supporting condition for the development of insightBut there is also a more direct and specific help which insight receives from keeping still in bare attentionGenerally we are more concerned with handling and using things than with knowing them in their true natureThus we usually grasp in haste the very first few signals conveyed to us by a perceptionThen through deeply ingrained habit those signals evoke a standard response by way of judgments such as goodbad pleasantunpleasant usefulharmful rightwrongThese judgments by which we define the objects in relation to ourselves lead to corresponding reactions by word or deedOnly rarely does attention dwell upon a common or familiar object for any longer time than is needed to receive the first few signalsSo for the most part we perceive things in a fragmentary manner and thence misconceive themFurther only the very first phase of the objects lifespan or a little more comes into the focus of our attentionOne may not even be consciously aware that the object is a process with an extension in time  a beginning and an end that it has many aspects and relations beyond those casually perceived in a limited situation that in brief it has a kind of evanescent individuality of its ownA world perceived in this superficial way will consist of shapeless little lumps of experiences marked by a few subjectively selected signs or symbolsThe symbols chosen are determined mainly by the individuals selfinterest sometimes they are even misappliedThe shadowlike world that results includes not only the outer environment and other persons but also a good part of ones own bodily and mental processesThese too become subjected to the same superficial manner of conceptualizationThe Buddha points out four basic misconceptions that result from distorted perceptions and unmethodical attention taking the impure for pure the impermanent for lasting the painful and painbringing for pleasant and the impersonal for a self or something belonging to the selfWhen the seal of selfreference is thus stamped again and again upon the world of everyday experience the basic misconception This belongs to me will steadily put forth roots into all the bodily and mental factors of our beingLike the hairroots of a plant these will be fine but firm and widespread  to such an extent in fact that the notions of I and mine will hardly be shaken by mere intellectual convictions about the nonexistence of selfThese grave consequences issue from that fundamental perceptual situation our rush into hasty or habitual reactions after receiving the first few signals from our perceptionsBut if we muster the restraining forces of mindfulness and pause for bare attention the material and mental processes that form the objects of mind at the given moment will reveal themselves to us more fully and more trulyNo longer dragged at once into the whirlpool of selfreference allowed to unfold themselves before the watchful eye of mindfulness they will disclose the diversity of their aspects and the wide net of their correlations and interconnectionsThe connection with selfinterest so narrow and often falsifying will recede into the background dwarfed by the wider view now gainedThe processes observed display in their serial occurrence and in their component parts a constant birth and death a rise and a fallThereby the facts of change and impermanence impress themselves on the mind with growing intensityThe same discernment of rise and fall dissolves the false conceptions of unity created under the influence of the egocentric attitudeSelfreference uncritically overrides diversity it lumps things together under the preconceptions of being a self or belonging to a selfBut bare attention reveals these sham unities as impersonal and conditioned phenomenaFacing thus again and again the evanescent dependent and impersonal nature of lifeprocesses with and without we will discover their monotony and unsatisfactory nature in other words the truth of sufferingThus by the simple device of slowing down pausing and keeping still for bare attention all three of the characteristics of existence  impermanence suffering and nonself  will open themselves to penetrative insightAn acquired or strengthened habit of pausing mindfully before acting does not exclude a wholesome spontaneity of responseOn the contrary through training the practice of pausing stopping and keeping still for bare attention will itself become quite spontaneousIt will grow into a selective mechanism of the mind that with an increasing reliability and swiftness of response can prevent the upsurge of evil or unwise impulsesWithout such a skill we may intellectually realise those impulses to be unwholesome but still succumb to them due to their own powerful spontaneityThe practice of pausing mindfully serves therefore to replace unwholesome spontaneity or habits by wholesome ones grounded in our better knowledge and nobler intentionsJust as certain reflex movements automatically protect the body similarly the mind needs spontaneous spiritual and moral selfprotectionThe practice of bare attention will provide this vital functionA person of average moral standards instinctively shrinks from thoughts of theft or murderWith the help of the method of bare attention the range of such spontaneous moral brakes can be vastly extended and ethical sensitivity greatly heightenedIn an untrained mind noble tendencies and right thoughts are often assailed by the sudden outbreak of passions and prejudicesThey either succumb or assert themselves only with difficulty after an inner struggleBut if the spontaneity of the unwholesome is checked or greatly reduced as described above our good impulses and wise reflections will have greater scope to emerge and express themselves freely and spontaneouslyTheir natural flow will give us greater confidence in the power of the good within us it will also carry more conviction for othersThat spontaneity of the good will not be erratic for it will have deep and firm roots in previous methodical trainingHere appears a way by which a premeditated good thought may be transformed into a spontaneous good thoughtAccording to the psychology of the Abhidhamma such a thought if combined with knowledge takes the first place in the scale of ethical valuesIn this way we shall achieve a practical understanding of a saying in The Secret of the Golden Flower If one attains intentionally to an unintentional state one has comprehension This saying invites a paraphrase in Pali terms Sasankharena asankharijam pattabbam by premeditated intentional effort spontaneity can be wonIf the numerous aids to mental growth and liberation found in the Buddhas teaching are wisely utilized there is actually nothing that can finally withstand the Satipatthana method and this method starts with the simple practice of learning to pause and stop for bare attentionAgainst the impetuosity rashness and heedlessness of the untrained mind the practice of pausing and stopping sets up a deliberate slowingdownThe demands of modern life however make it impracticable to introduce such a slowdown of function into the routine of the average working dayBut as an antidote against the harmful consequences of the hectic speed of modern life it is all the more important to cultivate that practice in ones leisure hours especially in periods of strict Satipatthana practiceSuch practice will also bestow the worldly benefits of greater calm efficiency and skill in ones daily round of workFor the purpose of meditative development slowingdown serves as an effective training in heedfulness sensecontrol and concentrationBut apart from that it has a more specific significance for meditative practiceIn the commentary to the Satipatthana Sutta it is said that the slowing down of movements may help in regaining lost concentration on a chosen objectA monk so we read had bent his arm quickly without remembering his subject of meditation as his rule of practice demandedOn becoming aware of that omission he took his arm back to its previous position and repeated the movement mindfullyThe subject of meditation referred to was probably clearly comprehending action as mentioned in the Satipatthana Sutta In bending and stretching he acts with clear comprehensionThe slowingdown of certain bodily movements during strict meditative training is particularly helpful in gaining insightknowledge especially the direct awareness of change and nonselfTo a great extent it is the rapidity of movement that strengthens the illusions of unity identity and substantiality in what is actually a complex evanescent processTherefore in the strict practice of Satipatthana the slowing down of such actions as walking bending and stretching so as to discern the several phases of each movement provides a powerful aid for direct insight into the three characteristics of all phenomenaThe meditators contemplation will gain increasing force and significance if he notices clearly how each partial phase of the process observed arises and ceases by itself and nothing of it goes over or transmigrates to the next phaseUnder the influence of pausing for bare attention the average rhythm of our everyday actions speech and thoughts will also become more quiet and peacefulSlowing down the hurried rhythm of life means that thoughts feelings and perceptions will be able to complete the entire length of their natural lifetimeFull awareness will extend up to their end phase to their last vibrations and reverberationsToo often that end phase is cut off by an impatient grasping at new impressions or by hurrying on to the next stage of a line of thought before the earlier one has been clearly comprehendedThis is one of the main reasons for the disorderly state of the average mind which is burdened by a vast amount of indistinct or fragmentary perceptions stunted emotions and undigested ideasSlowingdown will prove an effective device for recovering the fullness and clarity of consciousnessA fitting simile and at the same time an actual example is the procedure called for in the practice of mindfulness of breathing mindfulness has to cover the whole extent of the breath its beginning middle and endThis is what is meant by the passage in the sutta Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in and out Similarly the entire breath or rhythm of our life will become deeper and fuller if through slowingdown we get used to sustained attentionThe habit of prematurely cutting off processes of thought or slurring over them has assumed serious proportions in the man of modern urban civilizationRestlessly he clamors for ever new stimuli in increasingly quicker succession just as he demands increasing speed in his means of locomotionThis rapid bombardment of impressions has gradually blunted his sensitivity and thus he always needs new stimuli louder coarser and more variegatedSuch a process if not checked can end only in disasterAlready we see at large a decline of finer aesthetic susceptibility and a growing incapacity for genuine natural joyThe place of both is taken by a hectic shortbreathed excitement incapable of giving any true aesthetic or emotional satisfactionShallow mental breath is to a great extent responsible for the growing superficiality of civilized man and for the frightening spread of nervous disorders in the WestIt may well become the start of a general deterioration of human consciousness in its qualitative level range and strengthThis danger threatens all those in the East as well as in the West who lack adequate spiritual protection from the impact of technical civilizationSatipatthana can make an important contribution to remedying this situation in the way we have briefly indicated hereThus the method will prove beneficial from the worldly point of view as wellHere however we are chiefly concerned with the psychological aspects of mindfulness and their significance for meditative developmentSustained attention helped by slowingdown will affect the quality of consciousness mainly in three ways in intensifying consciousness in clarifying the objects characteristic features and in revealing the objects relatednessAn object of sustained attention will exert a particularly strong and longlasting impact on the mindIts influence will be felt not only throughout the thoughtseries immediately following the particular perception but may also extend far into the futureIt is that causal efficacy which is the measure of the intensity of consciousnesssustained attention leads to a fuller picture of the object in all its aspectsGenerally the first impression we gain of any new senseobject or idea will be its most striking feature it is this aspect of the object which captures our attention up to the culminating point of the impactBut the object also displays other aspects or characteristics and is capable of exercising other functions than those we initially noticeThese may be less obvious to us or subjectively less interesting but still they may be even more importantThere will also be cases where our first impression is entirely deceptiveOnly if we sustain our attention beyond that first impact will the object reveal itself more fullyIn the downward course of the first perceptual wave the prejudicing force of the first impact lessens and it is only then in that end phase that the object will yield a wider range of detail a more complete picture of itselfIt is therefore only by sustained attention that we can obtain a clearer understanding of an objects characteristic featuresAmong the characteristic features of any object physical or mental there is one class we often overlook due to hasty or superficial attention and therefore needs to be treated separatelyThis is the relatedness of the objectThe objects relatedness extends back to its past  to its origin causes reasons and logical precedents it also extends outward to embrace the total context  its background environment and presently active influencesWe can never fully understand things if we view them in artificial isolationWe have to see them as part of a wider pattern in their conditioned and conditioning nature and this can be done only with the help of sustained attentionThe three ways of heightening consciousness just discussed are evidently of prime importance for the development of insightWhen consciousness is intensified and its objective field clarified and discerned in its relational structure the ground is prepared for seeing things according to reality But besides its obvious direct influence this threefold process also has an indirect influence which is no less powerful and important it strengthens and sharpens the minds subliminal faculties of subconscious organization memory and intuitionThese again on their part nourish and consolidate the progress of liberating insightThe insight aided by them is like the mountain lake of the canonical simile it is fed not only by the outside rains but also by springs welling up from within its own depthsThe insight nourished by these underground subliminal resources of the mind will have deep rootsThe meditative results that it brings cannot be lost easily even with unliberated worldlings who are still subject to relapsePerceptions or thoughts which have been objects of sustained attention make a stronger impact on the mind and reveal their characteristic features more distinctly than when attention is slackThus when they sink into the subconscious they occupy there a special positionThis holds true for all three ways of enhancing the consciousness of an objectIn a process of consciousness if attention is as strong in the end phase as in the earlier phases then when the process is finished and the mind lapses back into subconsciousness the latter will be more amenable to conscious controlIf an impression or idea has been marked by numerous distinct characteristics then when it fades from immediate awareness it will not be so easily lost in the vague contents of the subconscious or dragged by passionate biases into false subconscious associationsThe correct comprehension of the objects relatedness similarly will protect the experience from being merged with indistinct subconscious materialPerceptions or thoughts of enhanced intensity and clarity absorbed into the subconscious remain more articulate and more accessible than contents originating from hazy or stunned impressionsIt will be easier to convert them into full consciousness and they will be less accountable in their hidden effects upon the mindIf through an improvement in the quality and range of mindfulness the number of such matured impressions increases the results might be a subtle change in the very structure of subconsciousness itselfIt will be evident from our earlier remarks that those impressions which we have called matured or more accessible and convertible lend themselves more easily and more correctly to recollection  more easily because of their greater intensity more correctly because their clearly marked features protect them from being distorted by false associative images or ideasRemembering them in their context and relatedness works both ways  it promotes both easier and more correct recollectionThus sati in its meaning and function of mindfulness helps to strengthen sati in its meaning and function of memoryThe influence of sustained attention on the subconscious and on memory brings a deepening and strengthening of the faculty of intuition particularly the intuitive insight which chiefly concerns us hereIntuition is not a gift from the unknownLike any other mental faculty it arises out of specific conditionsIn this case the primary conditions are latent memories of perceptions and thoughts stored in the subconsciousObviously the memories providing the most fertile soil for the growth of intuition will be those marked by greater intensity clarity and wealth of distinctive marks for it is these that are most accessibleHere too the preserved relatedness of the impressions will contribute muchRecollections of that type will have a more organic character than memories of bare or vague isolated facts and they will fall more easily into new patterns of meaning and significanceThese more articulate memory images will be a strong stimulation and aid for the intuitive facultySilently in the hidden depths of the subliminal mind the work of collecting and organizing the subconscious material of experience and knowledge goes on until it is ripe to emerge as an intuitionThe breakthrough of that intuition is sometimes occasioned by quite ordinary happeningsHowever though seemingly ordinary these events may have a strong evocative power if previously they had been made objects of sustained attentionSlowingdown and pausing for bare attention will uncover the depth dimension of the simple things of everyday life and thus provide stimuli for the intuitive facultyThis applies also to the intuitive penetration of the Four Noble Truths that culminates in liberationThe scriptures record many instances of monks who could not arrive at intuitive penetration when engaged in the actual practice of insight meditationThe flash of intuition struck them on quite different occasions when stumbling against a rock or catching sight of a forest fire a mirage or a lump of froth in a riverWe meet here another confirmation of that seemingly paradoxical saying that intentionally an unintentional state may be won By deliberately turning the full light of mindfulness on the smallest events and actions of everyday life eventually the liberating wisdom may ariseSustained attention not only provides the nourishing soil for the growth of intuition it also makes possible the fuller utilization and even repetition of the intuitive momentMen of inspiration in various fields of creative activity have often deplored their common experience the flash of intuition strikes so suddenly and vanishes so quickly that frequently the slow response of the mind hardly catches the last glimpse of itBut if the mind has been trained in observant pausing in slowingdown and sustained attention and if  as indicated above  the subconscious has been influenced then the intuitive moment too might gain that fuller slower and stronger rhythmThis being the case its impact will be strong and clear enough to allow for full use of that flash of intuitive insightIt might even be possible to lead its fading vibrations upward again to a new culmination similar to the rhythmic repetition of a melody rising again in harmonious development out of the last notes of its first appearanceThe full utilization of a single moment of intuitive insight could be of decisive importance for ones progress toward full realizationIf ones mental grip is too weak and one lets those elusive moments of intuitive insight slip away without having utilized them fully for the work of liberation then they might not recur until many years have passed or perhaps not at all during the present lifeSkill in sustained attention however will allow one to make full use of such opportunities and slowingdown and pausing during meditative practice is an important aid in acquiring that skillThrough our treatment of pausing stopping and slowingdown one of the traditional definitions of mindfulness found in the Pali scriptures will have become more intelligible in its farreaching implications that is its function of anapilapanata meaning literally not floating away Like pumpkinpots on the surface of water add the commentators and they continue Mindfulness enters deeply into its object instead of hurrying only over its surface Therefore nonsuperficiality will be an appropriate rendering of the above Pali term and a fitting characterization of mindfulness GLichtenberg In an earlier section we spoke about the impulsive spontaneity of the unwholesomeWe have seen how stopping for bare and sustained attention is able to counter or reduce our rash impulsive reactions thus allowing us to face any situation with a fresh mind with a directness of vision unprejudiced by those first spontaneous responsesBy directness of vision we understand a direct view of reality without any coloring or distorting lenses without the intrusion of emotional or habitual prejudices and intellectual biasesIt means coming face to face with the bare facts of actuality seeing them as vividly and freshly as if we were seeing them for the first timeThose spontaneous reactions which so often stand in the way of direct vision do not derive only from our passionate impulsesVery frequently they are the product of habitIn that form they generally have an even stronger and more tenacious hold on us  a hold which may work out either for our good or for our harmThe influence habit exercises for the good is seen in the power of repeated practice This power protects our achievements and skills  whether manual or mental worldly or spiritual  against loss or forgetfulness and converts them from casual shortlived imperfect acquisitions into the more secure possession of a quality thoroughly masteredThe detrimental effect of habitual spontaneous reactions is manifest in what is called in a derogative sense the force of habit its deadening stultifying and narrowing influence productive of compulsive behavior of various kindsIn our present context we shall be concerned only with that negative aspect of habit as impeding and obscuring the directness of visionAs remarked earlier habitual reactions generally have a stronger influence upon our behavior than impulsive onesOur passionate impulses may disappear as suddenly as they have arisenThough their consequences may be very grave and extend far into the future their influence is in no way as long lasting and deep reaching as that of habitHabit spreads its vast and closely meshed net over wide areas of our life and thought trying to drag in more and moreOur passionate impulses too might be caught in that net and thus be transformed from passing outbursts into lasting traits of characterA momentary impulse an occasional indulgence a passing whim may by repetition become a habit we find difficult to uproot a desire hard to control and finally an automatic function we no longer questionRepeated gratification turns a desire into a habit and habit left unchecked grows into compulsionIt sometimes happens that at an early time we regard a particular activity or mental attitude as without any special personal importanceThe activity or attitude may be morally indifferent and inconsequentialAt the start we might find it easy to abandon it or even to exchange it for its opposite since neither our emotions nor reason bias us towards either alternativeBut by repetition we come to regard the chosen course of action or thought as pleasant desirable and correct even as righteous and thus we finally identify it with our character or personalityConsequently we feel any break in this routine to be unpleasant or wrongAny outside interference with it we greatly resent even regarding such interference as a threat to our vital interests and principles In fact at all times primitive minds whether civilized or not have looked at a stranger with his strange customs as an enemy and have felt his mere unagressive presence as a challenge or threatAt the beginning when no great importance was ascribed to the specific habit the attachment that gradually formed was directed not so much to the action proper as to the pleasure we derive from the undisturbed routineThe strength of that attachment to routine derives partly from the force of physical and mental inertia so powerful a motive in manWe shall presently refer to another cause for attachment to routineBy force of habit the particular concern  whether a material object an activity or a way of thinking  comes to be invested with such an increase of emotional emphasis that the attachment to quite unimportant or banal things may become as tenacious as that to our more fundamental needsThus the lack of conscious control can turn even the smallest habits into the uncontested masters of our livesIt bestows upon them the dangerous power to limit and rigidify our character and to narrow our freedom of movement  environmental intellectual and spiritualThrough our subservience to habit we forge new fetters for ourselves and make ourselves vulnerable to new attachments aversions prejudices and predilections that is to new sufferingThe danger for spiritual development posed by the dominating influence of habit is perhaps more serious today than ever before for the expansion of habit is particularly noticeable in our present age when specialization and standardization reach into so many varied spheres of life and thoughtTherefore when considering the Satipatthana Suttas words on the formation of fetters we should also think of the important part played by habitIn Buddhist terms it is preeminently the hindrance of sloth and torpor which is strengthened by the force of habit and it is the mental faculties such as agility and pliancy of mind that are weakenedThis tendency of habits to extend their range is anchored in the very nature of consciousnessIt stems not only from the aforementioned passive force of inertia but in many cases from an active will to dominate and conquerCertain active types of consciousness possessing a fair degree of intensity tend to repeat themselvesEach one struggles to gain ascendancy to become a center around which other weaker mental and physical states revolve adapting themselves to and serving that central dispositionThis tendency is never quite undisputed but still it prevails and even peripheral or subordinate types of consciousness exhibit the same urge for ascendancyThis is a striking parallel to the selfassertion and domineering tendency of an egocentric individual in his contact with societyAmong biological analogies we may mention the tendency toward expansion shown by cancer and other pathological growths the tendency toward repetition we meet in the freak mutations which loom as a grave danger at the horizon of our atomic ageDue to that will to dominate inherent in many types of consciousness a passing whim may grow into a relatively constant trait of characterIf still not satisfied with its position it may break away entirely from the present combination of life forces until finally in the process of rebirths it becomes the very center of a new personalityThere are within us countless seeds for new lives for innumerable potential beings all of whom we should vow to liberate from the wheel of samsara as the Sixth Zen Patriarch expressed itDetrimental physical or mental habits may grow strong not only if fostered deliberately but also if left unnoticed or unopposedMuch of what has now strong roots in our nature has grown from minute seeds planted in a longforgotten pastThis growth of morally bad or otherwise detrimental habits can be effectively checked by gradually developing another habit that of attending to them mindfullyIf we now do deliberately what had become a mechanical performance and if prior to doing it we pause a while for bare attention and reflection  this will give us a chance to scrutinize the habit and clearly comprehend its purpose and suitabilityIt will allow us to make a fresh assessment of the situation to see it directly unobscured by the mental haze that surrounds a habitual activity with the false assurance It is right because it was done before Even if a detrimental habit cannot be broken quickly the reflective pause will counter its unquestioned spontaneity of occurrenceIt will stamp it with the seal of repeated scrutiny and resistance so that on its recurrence it will be weaker and will prove more amenable to our attempts to change or abolish itIt need hardly be mentioned that habit which has been rightly called the wetnurse of man cannot and should not disappear from our lifeLet us only remember what a relief it is particularly in the crowded day and complex life of a citydweller to be able to do a great number of things fairly mechanically with as it were only halfpowered attention Habit brings considerable simplification to our lifeIt would be an unbearable strain if all our little humdrum activities had to be done with deliberate effort and close attentionIn fact many operations of manual labor much of the technique in art and even standard procedure in complex intellectual work generally bring better and more even results through skilled routine performanceYet that evenness of habitual performance will also reach its end pointUnless enlivened by the creation of new interest it will show symptoms of fatigue and start to declineOf course it would be absurd to advocate that all our little habits be abolished for many are innocuous and even usefulBut we should regularly ask ourselves whether we still have control over them whether we can give them up or alter them at willWe can answer this question for ourselves in two ways by attending to our habitual actions mindfully for a certain period of time and second by actually giving them up temporarily in cases where this will not have any harmful or disturbing effects upon ourselves or othersIf we turn on them the light of direct vision looking at them or performing them as if for the first time these little routine activities and the habitual sights around us will assume a new glow of interest and stimulationThis also holds good for our professional occupation and its environment and for our close human relationships if they should have become stale by habitThe relationship to ones marriage partner to friends to colleagues may thus receive a great rejuvenationA fresh and direct vision will also reveal that one can relate to people or do things in a different and more beneficial way than one did before by force of habitAn acquired capacity to give up minor habits will prove its worth in the fight against more dangerous proclivitiesIt will also come to our aid at times when we are faced with serious changes in our life which forcefully deprive us of fundamental habitsLoosening the hardened soil of our routine behavior and thoughts will have an enlivening effect on our vital energy our mental vigor and our power of imaginationBut what is most important into that loosened soil we shall be able to plant the seeds of vigorous spiritual progressMental Habituation to standard reactions to sequences of activity to judgments of people or things proceeds by way of associative thinkingFrom the objects ideas situations and people that we encounter we select certain distinctive marks and associate these marks with our own response to themIf these encounters recur they are associated first with those marks selected earlier and then with our original or strongest responseThus these marks become a signal for releasing a standard reaction which may consist of a long sequence of connected acts or thoughts familiar through repeated practice or experienceThis way of functioning makes it unnecessary for us to apply new effort and painstaking scrutiny to each single step in such a sequenceThe result is a great simplification of life permitting us to release energy for other tasksIn fact in the evolution of the human mind associative thinking was a progressive step of decisive importanceIt enabled us to learn from experience and thus led up to the discovery and application of causal lawsYet along with these benefits associative thinking can also bring many grave dangers if it is applied faultily or thoughtlessly and not carefully controlledLet us draw up a partial list of these danger pointsIncomplete observations and restricted viewpoints in judgment sufficient to deal with one particular situation may prove quite inadequate and entail grave consequences if mechanically applied to changed circumstancesDue to misdirected associative thinking a strong instinctive dislike may be felt for things places or persons which in some way are merely reminiscent of unpleasant experiences but actually have no connection with themThese brieflystated instances show how vital it is for us to scrutinize from time to time the mental grooves of our associative thoughts and to review the various habits and stereotype reactions deriving from themIn other words we must step out of our ruts regain a direct vision of things and make a fresh appraisal of our habits in the light of that visionIf we look once again over the list of potential dangers deriving from uncontrolled associative thinking we shall better understand the Buddhas insistence upon getting to the bedrock of experienceIn the profound and terse stanzas called The Cave included in the Sutta Nipata the Buddha says that the full penetration of sense impression will make one free from greed and that by understanding perception one will be able to cross the flood of samsaraBy placing mindfulness as a guard at the very first gate through which thoughts enter the mind we shall be able to control the incomers much more easily and shut out unwanted intrudersThus the purity of luminous consciousness can be maintained against adventitious defilementsThe Satipatthana Sutta provides a systematic training for inducing direct fresh and undistorted visionThe training covers the entire personality in its physical and mental aspects and includes the whole world of experienceThe methodical application of the several exercises to oneself to others and alternatingly to both will help uncover erroneous conceptions due to misdirected associative thinking and misapplied analogiesThe principal types of false associative thinking are covered in the terminology of the Dhamma by the four kinds of misapprehension or perverted views which wrongly take what is impermanent for permanent what is painful or conducive to pain for happiness what has no self and is unsubstantial for a self or an abiding substance and what is impure for beautifulThese perverted views arise through a false apprehension of the characteristic marks of thingsUnder the influence of our passions and false theories we perceive things selectively in a onesided or erroneous way and then associate them wrongly with other ideasBy applying bare attention to our perceptions and impressions gradually we can free them from these misapprehensions progressing steadily towards the direct vision of things as they really areOne who has clear and direct vision stirred to a sense of urgency by things which are deeply moving will experience a release of energy and courage enabling him to break through his timid hesitations and his rigid routine of life and thoughtIf that sense of urgency is kept alive it will bestow the earnestness and persistence required for the work of liberationThus said the teachers of oldOur closest surroundings are full of stirring thingsIf we generally do not perceive them as such that is because habit has made our vision dull and our heart insensitiveThe same thing happens to us even with the Buddhas teachingWhen we first encounter the teaching we receive a powerful intellectual and emotional stimulation but gradually the impetus tends to lose its original freshness and impelling forceThe remedy is to constantly renew it by turning to the fullness of life around us which illustrates the Four Noble Truths in ever new variationsA direct vision will impart new lifeblood even to the most common experiences of every day so that their true nature appears through the dim haze of habit and speaks to us with a fresh voiceIt may well be just the long accustomed sight of the beggar at the street corner or a weeping child or the illness of a friend which startles us afresh makes us think and stirs our sense of urgency in treading resolutely the path that leads to the cessation of sufferingWe know the beautiful account of how Prince Siddhattha first came face to face with old age illness and death while driving his chariot through the royal city after a long period of isolation in a makebelieve worldThis ancient story may well be historical fact for we know that in the lives of many great men common events often gain a symbolic significance and lead to major consequences far beyond their ordinary appearanceGreat minds find significance in the seemingly commonplace and invest the fleeting moment with farreaching efficacyBut without contesting the inner truth of that old story we may reasonably believe that the young prince had actually seen before with his fleshly eyes old people sick people and those who had succumbed to deathHowever on all these earlier occasions he would not have been touched very deeply by these sights  as is the case with most of us most of the timeThat earlier lack of sensitivity may have been due to the carefully protected artificial seclusion of his petty though princely happiness the hereditary routine of his life into which his father had placed himOnly when he broke through the golden cage of easygoing habits could the facts of suffering strike him as forcibly as if he had seen them for the first timeThen only was he stirred by them to a sense of urgency that led him out of the home life and set his feet firmly on the road to enlightenmentThe more clearly and deeply our minds and hearts respond to the truth of suffering manifest in the very common facts of our existence the less often shall we need a repetition of the lesson and the shorter will be our migration through samsaraThe clarity of perception evoking our response will come from an undeflected directness of vision bestowed by bare attention and the depth of experience will come from wise reflection or clear comprehensionDirectness of vision is also a chief characteristic of the methodical practice of insight meditationThere it is identified with the direct or experiential knowledge bestowed by meditation as distinguished from the inferential knowledge obtained by study and reflectionIn the meditative development of insight ones own physical and mental processes are directly viewed without the interference of abstract concepts or the filtering screens of emotional evaluationFor in this context these only obscure or camouflage the naked facts detracting from the strong immediate impact of realityConceptual generalizations from experience are very useful in their place but if they interrupt the meditative practice of bare attention they tend to shove aside or dispose of the particular fact by saying as it were It is nothing else but this Generalizing thought inclines to become impatient with a recurrent type and after having it classified soon finds it boringBare attention however being the key instrument of methodological insight keeps to the particularIt follows keenly the rise and fall of successive physical and mental processesThough all phenomena of a given series may be true to type bare attention regards each of them as distinct and conscientiously registers its separate birth and deathIf mindfulness remains alert these repetitions of type will by their multiplication exert not a reduced but an intensified impact on the mindThe three characteristics  impermanence suffering and voidness of selfinherent in the process observed will stand out more and more clearlyThey will appear in the light shed by the phenomena themselves not in a borrowed light not even a light borrowed from the Buddha the peerless and indispensable guide to these experiencesThese physical and mental phenomena in their selfluminosity will then convey a growing sense of urgency to the meditator revulsion dissatisfaction awareness of danger followed by detachment  though certainly joy happiness and calm too will not be absent throughout the practiceThen if all other conditions of inner maturity are fulfilled the first direct vision of final liberation will dawn with the streamwinners indubitable knowledge Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of vanishingThus in the unfoldment of the power of mindfulness Satipatthana will prove itself as the true embodiment of the Dhamma of which it was saidThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Suttanipata or Discoursecollection from which this selection has been compiled contains some of the oldest and most profound discourses of the BuddhaThe complete text has been translated at least three times into English the most recent being by EMHare under the title Woven CadencesThe Pali original consists mainly of verse interspersed with some prose passages and Hare has followed this arrangement by translating it into English blank verseHowever in the selection appearing below the aim has been to keep as near as possible to the original and no attempt has been made to versify itThe first discourse shows the distinction between the mode of conduct of the bhikkhu and the layman both regarded as virtuous or goodFor as it is said elsewhere SnpvvThe layfollower is given the five precepts of abstaining from killing stealing and so forth and then the eight precepts are observed on special occasionsAlso perhaps it is appropriate to commence with Dhammikas praising the Buddha for these two moral discipline and faith in the Buddha are the basic requisites for making further progress on the Buddhist pathThe next two discourses deal with wrong and right conduct pointing out the results both courses lead toOne of the essentials for the practice of the Buddhas teaching is having good friends and the avoidance of those who hinder ones progressThe best friend is He from whom one learns the Dhamma and as such the Buddha is known as the Good Friend to all beingsThe next two give the practical training and the direction one should tend towardsContinuous effort is needed to practice the Dhamma and to inspire one there is no better example than the Buddhas own struggleThen there are two contemplations on the transience of life and the futility of sorrowing over the natural course of events in this worldTwo important discourses follow dealing with the misconception that purity can come from outside without putting forth any effort and with wrongly holding to views and opinions leading to contention and sufferingThese two together with the rest of what follows are regarded as some of the oldest discourses of the Suttanipata and contain much that is difficult to understandIn the Parayanavagga the last chapter of the Suttanipata sixteen brahmanas  famous throughout the world meditators delighting in meditation and wise  come to the Buddha and ask Him various questionsFive of them are included hereNomay be compared with the Sakkapanha Suttanta which contains a closely parallel series of questions and answersNoconsists of the concluding verses of a fairly long discourse and indicates the disparity existing between the realization of the Ariya the Buddhas and their disciples and the way of thinking usual to the ordinary people of this worldA note ought to be included on the term Dhamma an important and frequent word in Buddhist literature and which has in most cases been left untranslated below for the reason that there is no equivalent word in English to cover all its various shades of meaningIt could be rendered by Law Norm Teaching Doctrine Scripture Truth Nature practice method conduct causality etc for these are all meanings of the term Dhamma But they all tend to fall short of a true definitionThe Dhamma is the heart of the Buddhas teaching and without it Buddhism would be something quite dead and yet it is not the exclusive possession of the historical religionIn addition it has another set of meanings and is practically always used in this sense in the plural as mental objects ideas things phenomena elements forces statesetcIn this latter sense however it has not been left untranslated belowIn conclusion I wish to acknowledge the valuable assistance given by the VenNyanaponika Mahathera in correcting several errors in the translation of this short anthology and in supplying much advice and commentarial literature used in formulating the notesThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Grove at Anathapindikas monasteryNow the layfollower Dhammika with five hundred other layfollowers approached the LordHaving drawn near and having saluted the Lord respectfully he sat down at one sideSitting there the layfollower Dhammika addressed the Lord as followsI ask Gotama of extensive wisdom this How acting is a disciple virtuous  both the disciple who has gone from home to the homeless state and the followers who are householdersFor you clearly understand the behavior of the world with the devas and the final releaseThere is none equal to you who are skilled in seeing what is profoundYou are an illustrious Awakened OneHaving investigated all knowledge and being compassionate towards beings you have announced the Dhamma a revealer of what is hidden of comprehensive vision stainless you illuminate all the worldsThis Dhamma subtle and pleasing and taught so clearly by you Lord it is this we all wish to hearHaving been questioned foremost Awakened One tell usAll these bhikkhus and also the layfollowers who have come to hear the truth let them listen to the Dhamma awakened to by the Stainless One as the devas listen to the wellspoken words of VasavaListen to me bhikkhus I will teach you the ascetic practice the mode of living suitable for those who have gone forthDo you all bear it in mindOne who is intent upon what is good and who is thoughtful should practice itA bhikkhu should not wander about at the wrong time but should walk the village for food at the right time as one who goes about at the wrong time is obsessed by attachment therefore Awakened Ones do not walk at the wrong timeSights sounds tastes scents and bodily contacts overwhelm beingsBeing rid of desire for these sense objects at the right time one may enter for the morning mealHaving duly obtained food going back alone and sitting down in a secluded place being inwardly thoughtful and not letting the mind go out to external objects a bhikkhu should develop selfcontrolIf he should speak with a laydisciple with someone else or with another bhikkhu he should speak on the subtle Dhamma not slandering others nor gossipingSome set themselves up as disputants in opposition to others those of little wisdom we do not praise attachments bind them and they are carried away by their emotionsHaving heard the Dhamma taught by the Sugata and considered it a disciple of Him of excellent wisdom should wisely make use of food a dwelling a bed a seat and water for washing the robeBut a bhikkhu should not be soiled by these things as a lotus is not wetted by a drop of waterNow I will tell you the laymans dutyFollowing it a laydisciple would be virtuous for it is not possible for one occupied with the household life to realize the complete bhikkhu practiceHe should not kill a living being nor cause it to be killed nor should he incite another to killDo not injure any being either strong or weak in the worldA disciple should avoid taking anything from anywhere knowing itHe should not steal nor incite another to stealHe should completely avoid theftA wise man should avoid unchastity as a pit of glowing charcoalIf unable to lead a celibate life he should not go to anothers wifeHaving entered a royal court or a company of people he should not speak liesHe should not speak lies nor incite others to do soHe should completely avoid falsehoodA layman who has chosen to practice this Dhamma should not indulge in the drinking of intoxicantsHe should not drink them nor encourage others to do so realizing that it leads to madnessThrough intoxication foolish people perform evil deeds and cause other heedless people to do likewiseHe should avoid intoxication this occasion for demerit which stupefies the mind and is the pleasure of foolish peopleThis is called the eightfactored observance made known by the Awakened One who has reached the end of sufferingWith a gladdened mind observe the observance day complete with its eight factors on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth days of the fortnight and also the special holiday of the half monthIn the morning with a pure heart and a joyful mind a wise man after observing the uposatha should distribute suitable food and drink to the community of bhikkhusHe should support his mother and father as his duty and engage in lawful tradingA layman who carries this out diligently goes to the devas called Selfradiant vv The practice of Dhamma the practice of continence mastery of this is said to be best if a person has gone forth from home to the homeless lifeBut if he is garrulous and like a brute delights in hurting others his life is evil and his impurity increasesA quarrelsome bhikkhu shrouded by delusion does not comprehend the Dhamma taught by the Awakened One when it is revealedAnnoying those practiced in meditation being led by ignorance he is not aware that his defiled path leads to NirayahellFalling headlong passing from womb to womb from darkness to darkness such a bhikkhu undergoes suffering hereafter for certainAs a cesspool filled over a number of years is difficult to clean similarly whoever is full of impurity is difficult to make pureWhoever you know to be such bhikkhus bent on worldliness having wrong desires wrong thoughts wrong behavior and resort being completely united avoid him sweep him out like dirt remove him like rubbishWinnow like chaff the nonreclusesHaving ejected those of wrong desires of wrong behavior and resort be pure and mindful dwelling with those who are pureBeing united and prudent you will make an end to sufferingBy developing what habit what conduct what actions may man be correctly established in and arrive at the highest goalHe should respect his elders and not be envious of themHe should know the right time for seeing his teacherIf a talk on Dhamma has started he should know the value of the opportunity and should listen carefully to the wellspoken wordsWhen the time is right let him go to his teachers presence unassuming putting aside stubbornnessLet him keep in mind and practice the meaning and the text selfcontrol and the Holy LifeDelighting in the Dhamma devoted to the Dhamma established in the Dhamma skilled in investigating the Dhamma let him not indulge in talk harmful to the DhammaLet him be guided by wellspoken truthsAbandoning the uttering of laughter and lamentations giving up anger fraud hypocrisy longing conceit violence harshness moral taints and infatuation let him live without pride self controlledUnderstanding is essential to a wellspoken wordLearning and understanding are essential to meditation but a man who is hasty and heedless does not increase his wisdom and learningThose who are devoted to the Dhamma made known by the Noble Ones are unsurpassed in speech thought and actionThey are established in peace gentleness and concentration and have reached the essence of learning and wisdomOne who overstepping and despising a sense of shame says I am your friend but does not take upon himself any tasks he is capable of doing is to be recognized as no friendOne who speaks amiably to his companions but whose actions do not conform to it him the wise know for certain as a talker not a doerHe is no friend who anticipating conflict is always alert in looking out for weaknessesBut he on whom one can rely like a child sleeping on its mothers breast is truly a friend who cannot be parted from one by othersOne who bears the human burden of responsibility with its fruits and blessings in mind he cultivates a cause of joy and happiness worthy of praiseHaving tasted the flavor of solitude and peace one is free from fear and wrongdoings imbibing the rapture of DhammaHe from whom a person learns the Dhamma should be venerated as the devas venerate Inda their LordHe of great learning thus venerated will explain the Dhamma being welldisposed towards oneHaving paid attention and considered it a wise man practicing according to Dhamma becomes learned intelligent and accomplished by associating himself diligently with such a teacherBut by following an inferior and foolish teacher who has not gained understanding of the Dhamma and is envious of others one will approach death without comprehending the Dhamma and unrelieved of doubtIf a man going down into a river swollen and swiftly flowing is carried away by the current  how can he help others acrossEven so he who has not comprehended the Dhamma has not paid attention to the meaning as expounded by the learned being himself without knowledge and unrelieved of doubt  how can he make others understandBut if knows the method and is skilled and wise by boarding a strong boat equipped with oars and a rudder he can with its help set others acrossEven so he who is experienced and has a welltrained mind who is learned and dependable clearly knowing he can help others to understand who are willing to listen and ready to receiveSurely therefore one should associate with a good man who is wise and learnedBy understanding the meaning of what one has learned and practicing accordingly one who has Dhammaexperience attains happinessRenouncing the five pleasures of sense that entrance and delight the mind and in faith departing from home become one who makes an end of sufferingAssociate with good friends and choose a remote lodging secluded with little noiseBe moderate in eatingRobes almsfood remedies and a dwelling  do not have craving for these things do not be one who returns to the worldPractice restraint according to the Discipline and control the five sensefacultiesPractice mindfulness of the body and continually develop dispassionAvoid the sign of the beautiful connected with passion by meditating on the foul cultivate a mind that is concentrated and collectedMeditate on the Signless and get rid of the tendency to conceitBy thoroughly understanding and destroying conceit you will live in the peaceIn this manner the Lord repeatedly exhorted the Venerable RahulaViolence breeds misery look at people quarrelingI will relate the emotion agitating meHaving seen people struggling and contending with each other like fish in a small amount of water fear entered meThe world is everywhere insecure every direction is in turmoil desiring an abode for myself I did not find one uninhabitedWhen I saw contention as the sole outcome aversion increased in me but then I saw an arrow here difficult to see set in the heartPierced by it once runs in every direction but having pulled it out one does not run nor does one sinkHere follows the trainingWhatever are worldly fetters may you not be bound by themCompletely break down sensual desires and practice so as to realize Nibbana for yourselfA sage should be truthful not arrogant not deceitful not given to slandering others and should be without angerHe should remove the evil of attachment and wrongly directed longing he should conquer drowsiness lassitude and sloth and not dwell in indolenceA man whose mind is set on Nibbana should not be arrogantHe should not lapse into untruth nor generate love for sense objectsHe should thoroughly understand conceit and abstain from violenceHe should not delight in what is past nor be fond of what is new nor sorrow for what is disappearing nor crave for the attractiveGreed I say is a great flood it is a whirlpool sucking one down a constant yearning seeking a hold continually in movement difficult to cross is the morass of sensual desireA sage does not deviate from truth a brahmana stands on firm ground renouncing all he is truly called calmedHaving actually experienced and understood the Dhamma he has realized the highest knowledge and is independentHe comports himself correctly in the world and does not envy anyone hereHe who has left behind sensual pleasures an attachment difficult to leave behind does not grieve nor have any longing has cut across the stream and is unfetteredDry out that which is past let there be nothing for you in the futureIf you do not grasp at anything in the present you will go about at peaceOne who in regard to this entire mindbody complex has no cherishing of it as mine and who does not grieve for what is nonexistent truly suffers no loss in the worldFor him there is no thought of anything as this is mine or this is anothers not finding any state of ownership and realizing nothing is mine he does not grieveTo be not callous not greedy at rest and unruffled by circumstances  that is the profitable result I proclaim when asked about one who does not waverFor one who does not crave who has understanding there is no productionRefraining from initiating he sees security everywhereA sage does not speak in terms of being equal lower or higherCalmed and without selfishness he neither grasps nor rejectsRouse yourselfSit upWhat good is there in sleepingFor those afflicted by disease struck by the arrow what sleep is thereRouse yourselfSit upResolutely train yourself to attain peaceDo not let the king of death seeing you are careless lead you astray and dominate youGo beyond this clinging to which devas and men are attached and they seekDo not waste your opportunityWhen the opportunity has passed they sorrow when consigned to NirayahellNegligence is a taint and so is the negligence growing from itBy earnestness and understanding withdraw the arrowWhen near the river Nerañjara I exerted myself in meditation for attaining to security from bondage there came Namuci speaking words of compassionYou are emaciated and illlooking you are near to deathA thousand parts of you belong to death and only a fraction of you is aliveLive good SirIt is better to liveLiving you may perform meritorious deedsFrom practicing celibacy and tending the sacrificial fire much merit is made but what is obtained from strivingIt is difficult to enter the path of exertion it is difficult to do difficult to maintain Mara spoke these words whilst standing in the presence of the Awakened OneTo Mara speaking thus the Lord repliedYou who are the friend of the negligent O Evil One for what reason have you come hereThose who still have use for merit Mara may consider worthwhile addressingI have faith and energy and wisdomBeing thus bent on striving why do you ask me to liveThis wind will wither the currents of the rivers why should not my exertion dry up even the bloodWhen the blood dries up the bile and phlegm witherOn the wasting away of the flesh the mind becomes more and more serene and my mindfulness wisdom and concentration are established more firmlyIn me who abides enduring such an extreme experience the mind does not long for sensual pleasuresSee the purity of a beingSensual desire is your first army the second is called discontent the third is hunger and thirst the fourth craving the fifth sluggishness and laziness the sixth fear the seventh indecision and the eighth disparagement of others and stubbornness gain fame honor prestige wrongly acquired and whoever praises himself and despises others  these Namuci are your armies the Dark Ones striking forcesA lazy cowardly person cannot overcome them but by conquering them one gains blissI wear muñjagrassShame on life here in this worldIt is better for me to die in battle than to live defeatedSome recluses and brahmanas are not seen here so immersed are theyThey are not aware of that path by which those of perfect conduct walkSeeing the surrounding army ready and Mara mounted I am going out to fight so that he may not shift me from my positionThis army of yours which the world together with the devas is unable to subdue that I will destroy with wisdom like an unbaked claybowl with a stoneHaving mastered the mind and firmly established mindfulness I shall wander from country to country guiding many disciplesAnd they will be diligent and energetic in practicing my teaching the teaching of one without sensual desire and they will go where having gone one does not grieveMara For seven years I followed the Lord step by step but did not find an opportunity to defeat that mindful Awakened OneA crow flew around a stone having the color of fat Can we find even here something tenderMay it be something to eatNot finding anything edible the crow left that placeAs with the crow and the stone we leave Gotama having approached and become disheartenedOvercome by sorrow his lute fell from his arm and thereupon the unhappy spirit disappeared from that placeShort indeed is this life this side of a hundred years one dies whoever lives long even he dies from old agePeople grieve for things they are attached to yet there exist no permanent possessions but just a state of separationSeeing this one should no longer live the household lifeThat which a man imagines to be his will disappear at deathKnowing this a wise man will have no attachmentAs a man awakened from sleep no longer sees what happened in his dream similarly one does not see a loved one who is deadThose people who were seen and heard and called by their names as such and such only their names remain when they have passed awayThose greedy for objects of attachment do not abandon sorrow grief and avarice but sages having got rid of possessions live perceiving securityFor a bhikkhu with a detached mind living in a secluded dwelling it is right they say that he no longer shows himself in the abodesA sage who is completely independent does not make close friends or enemiesIn him sorrow and selfishness do not stay like water on a lotus leafAs a lotus is not wetted by water so a sage is not affected by what is seen or heard nor by what is perceived by the other sensesA wise man is not deluded by what is perceived by the sensesHe does not expect purity by any other wayHe is neither pleased nor is he repelledUnindicated and unknown is the length of life of those subject to deathLife is difficult and brief and bound up with sufferingThere is no means by which those who are born will not dieHaving reached old age there is deathThis is the natural course for a living beingWith ripe fruits there is the constant danger that they will fallIn the same way for those born and subject to death there is always the fear of dyingJust as the pots made by a potter all end by being broken so death is of lifeThe young and old the foolish and the wise all are stopped short by the power of death all finally end in deathOf those overcome by death and passing to another world a father cannot hold back his son nor relatives a relationSeeWhile the relatives are looking on and weeping one by one each mortal is led away like an ox to slaughterIn this manner the world is afflicted by death and decayBut the wise do not grieve having realized the nature of the worldYou do not know the path by which they came or departedNot seeing either end you lament in vainIf any benefit is gained by lamenting the wise would do itOnly a fool would harm himselfYet through weeping and sorrowing the mind does not become calm but still more suffering is produced the body is harmed and one becomes lean and pale one merely hurts oneselfOne cannot protect a departed one by that meansTo grieve is in vainBy not abandoning sorrow a being simply undergoes more sufferingBewailing the dead he comes under the sway of sorrowSee other men faring according to their deedsHence beings tremble here with fear when they come into the power of deathWhatever they imagine it quite different from thatThis is the sort of disappointment that existsLook at the nature of the worldIf a man lives for a hundred years or even more finally he is separated from his circle of relatives and gives up his life in the endTherefore having listened to the arahant one should give up lamentingSeeing a dead body one should know He will not be met by me again As the fire in a burning house is extinguished with water so a wise discriminating learned and sensible man should quickly drive away the sorrow that arises as the wind a piece of cottonHe who seeks happiness should withdraw the arrow his own lamentations longings and griefWith the arrow withdrawn unattached he would attain to peace of mind and when all sorrow has been transcended he is sorrowfree and has realized NibbanaHere I see one who is pure entirely free of sicknessBy seeing him a man may attain to purityConvinced of that and thinking it the highest he believes it to be knowledge when he contemplates the pure one But if by sights man can gain purification or if through such knowledge he could leave suffering behind then one who still has attachments could be purified by anotherHowever this is merely the opinion of those who so assertThe brahmana has said one is not purified by another nor by what is seen heard or perceived nor by the performance of ritual observancesHe is not defiled by merit or demeritHaving given up what he had grasped at he no longer engages in producingHaving left a former they attach themselves to another dominated by craving they do not go beyond attachmentThey reject and seize like a monkey letting go of a branch to take hold of anotherA person having undertaken a ritual act goes this way and that fettered by his sensesBut one with a wide wisdom having understood and gone into the Dhamma with his experience does not go this way and thatFor a person indifferent towards all conditions whatever is seen heard or cognized he is one who sees it as it really is and lives with clarityWith what could he be identified in the worldThey do not speculate nor pursue they do not claim perfect purityLoosening the knot with which they are bound they do not have longing anywhere in the worldThe brahmana who has gone beyond limitations having understood and seen there is no longer any assumption for him he is neither disturbed by lust nor agitated by revulsionFor him there is nothing upheld as the highest  vvA person who associates himself with certain views considering them as best and making them supreme in the world he says because of that that all other views are inferior therefore he is not free from contentionIn what is seen heard cognized and in ritual observances performed he sees a profit for himselfJust by laying hold of that view he regards every other view as worthlessThose skilled say that a bond if relying on it one regards everything else as inferiorTherefore a bhikkhu should not depend on what is seen heard or cognized nor upon ritual observancesHe should not present himself as equal to nor imagine himself to be inferior nor better than anotherAbandoning he had held and not taking up he does not seek a support even in knowledgeAmong those who dispute he is certainly not one to take sidesHe does not recourse to a view at allIn whom there is no inclination to either extreme for becoming or nonbecoming here or in another existence for him there does not exist a fixed viewpoint on investigating the doctrines assumedConcerning the seen the heard and the cognized he does not form the least

question for what reason did sages warriors brahmanas and other men prepare here in this world various sacrificial gifts for the godsI ask the Lord this let him tell me the answerThe Lord Whatever sages warriors brahmanas and other men Punnaka prepared various sacrificial gifts for the gods they did so in the hope of this or that existence being induced by old age and decayPunnaka By preparing various sacrificial gifts for the gods being zealous in sacrificing do they cross beyond birth and decay LordThe Lord They hope and extol pray and sacrifice for things of the senses PunnakaFor the sake of such reward they prayThese devotees of sacrifice infatuated by their passion for existence do not cross beyond birth and decay I sayPunnaka If these devotees of sacrifice do not cross beyond birth and decay through sacrifice Sir then by what practice does one cross beyond birth and decay in this world of gods and menThe Lord He who has comprehended in the world the here and the beyond in

asked me the source of sufferingMettagu I will tell it to you as it has been discerned by meThese many sufferings evident in the world have arisen from worldly attachmentsWhoever ignorantly creates an attachment that stupid person comes upon suffering again and againTherefore a man of understanding should not create attachment seeing it is the source of sufferingMettagu What I did ask you have

so that one is not seen by the King of DeathThe Lord Look upon the world as empty Mogharaja ever mindful uprooting the view of self you may thus be one who overcomes deathSo regarding the world one is not seen by the King of DeathThe world here and elsewhere is not to be understood in the way we usually think of it but is defined as the five aggregates of material form feeling perception activities

what is notselfEnclosed by mindandbody it imagines This is real Whatever they imagine it to be it is quite different from thatIt is unreal of a false nature and perishableNibbana not false in nature that the Noble Ones know as trueIndeed by the penetration of the true they are completely stilled and realize final deliveranceForms sounds tastes scents bodily contacts and ideas which are agreeable pleasant and charming all these while they last are deemed to be happiness by the world with its devasBut when they cease that is agreed by all to be unsatisfactoryBy the Noble Ones the cessation of the existing body is seen as happinessThis is the reverse of the outlook of the whole worldWhat others call happiness that the Noble Ones declare to be sufferingWhat others call suffering that the Noble Ones have found to be happinessSee how difficult it is to understand the DhammaHerein those without insight have completely gone astrayFor those under the veil it is obscured for those who cannot see it is utter darknessBut for the good and the wise it is as obvious as the light for those who can seeEven though close to it the witless who do not know the Dhamma do not comprehend itBy those overcome by attachment to existence those who drift with the stream of existence those in the realm of Mara this Dhamma is not properly understoodWho other than the Noble Ones are fit to fully

of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe following Thai words are used in this bookletCrot an umbrella with an attachable mosquito netNain a novice of under years old undertaking to observe PreceptsA few Pali words are used occasionallySangha the community or order of bhikkhus open to people of all races who desire to lead the holy life in the Dispensation of the BuddhaVihara The Buddhist equivalent of a monastery but this English word conjures up so many misleading ideas that the Buddhist term vihara has been preferred throughoutPuja veneration worshipIn Buddhist practice this is done with the idea of increasing the skillful qualities in ones own mindPropitiation of forces outside oneself is quite foreign to BuddhadhammaKamma intentional action or willed volitional actionIn ruth for all his bosom friendsPoise amity ruth and release Selected verses of the Rhinoceros Sutta from Woven Cadences translated by EMHare and published in Sacred Books of the Buddhists Series by the Pali Text SocietyOther verses are used in this bookletThe Triple Gem or the Three Precious Ones are the highest ideals of the BuddhadhammaTo the Lord Buddha to the Holy Dhamma and to the Noble Sangha are given veneration by all Buddhists since they aspire to mould their lives according to the qualities represented by these three idealsIn the English language there are now a number of books describing the life of the last Buddha Gotama also many explaining what is meant by the ideal of BuddhahoodLikewise we have an evergrowing flood of literature translations commentaries and so forth to help us understand what is DhammaMuch less information however is to be found on the Sangha especially upon the bhikkhulife of the present dayOf course those living in the Buddhist countries where the Sangha is established will know more about it than will those who follow the Buddhas Path in other landsIt is to give the latter a picture of bhikkhulife that this book is written besides keeping before the eyes of those living in Buddhists lands the best traditions of the SanghaWhile Buddhadhamma is a way for everyone bhikkhu or layfollower naturally the bhikkhus since they have fully devoted themselves to its practice have more opportunity to penetrate to the heart of the TeachingTo do this they must as indeed anyone who wishes to do so obtain experience in its three trainings Learning Practice and PenetrationThese lead on one from the other thus making both of the first two necessaryWithout Learning ones Practice is liable to stray away from Correct UnderstandingWithout Practice learning is just barren as far as the fruits of Penetration are concernedCommentaries written later upon the ancient Buddhaword give new names to Learning and Practice calling the former Bookwork and the latter InsightworkIt may have been already in early times that a tendency appeared to concentrate upon either one or the other as though they were alternative ways rather than complementary stepsThis tendency which has persisted into the present seems to be an expression of human frailty for it is much easier to study the scriptures and become learned while largely setting aside the practice especially meditation than it is to get down and practice all that has been learnedThis separation is however far from absolute since many bhikkhus gain a groundwork of Learning and then leave the city temples where they have studied for a Meditation Teachers forest dwelling there to take up the Practice which will lead in due course to Penetration of the DhammaAlthough one may gather something of the life of the Insightwork bhikkhus from ancient sources nothing seems to have been written regarding them in the present dayHence this short account which attempts to outline their life as found in ThailandA bhikkhu undertaking Insightwork bases his life upon the three great foundationsThese are strict observance of the Rules of Training which he has undertaken to keep at the time of his AcceptanceHe is one who takes the earnest exhortation of Lord Buddha to heartSecondly he follows his Meditation Teacher in the application of the Austere Practices being guided by him as to how and to what extent he should practice themThe first foundation above ensures purification and the removal of obstacles while the second gives rise to strong renunciation and to contentment with littleThus both become good indeed necessary bases for the third foundation of his life the actual Meditation PracticeSomething should now be said about these Austere PracticesLord Buddha refused to allow extreme asceticism with which he had experimented before his EnlightenmentHowever he did recognize that a certain degree of austerity would be useful in the training of bhikkhusFor instance we find that in the Four Nissaya recited to a bhikkhu upon the occasion of his ordination he is to wear rag robes eat almsfood dwell at the foot of a tree have fermented cows urine for medicineFurther we see from the lives of many bhikkhus in the time of Lord Buddha that the Dhutangas were widely practiced for the early Sangha was a community in which the wandering meditative life was the normal oneAs examples we have the greatly venerated MahaKassapa who was acclaimed by Lord Buddha as the foremost among those who lead austere lives while the first of his disciples to gain insight into the Dhamma Añña Kondañña dwelt secluded throughout his life in the depths of the forestWith the establishment of permanent viharas which began even in the Lord Buddhas days together with the necessity of preserving the Buddhaword memorizing and learning came to have increased importanceNot all learned bhikkhus practiced and thus Dhutangas were left for those who wished to practice meditationIt was also stressed that for a person whose character was strongly rooted in hatred these Austere Practices would not be appropriate being liable to increase selfhatredOn the other hand with characters rooted in greed faith and mixedrooted characters the dhutangas could help greatly in the cultivation of renunciation and contentmentThe differences between a thudong bhikkhu and one who practices severe asceticism are worth notingThe latter start with some species of view that there is a permanent spiritual entity enclosed in or even imprisoned by the fleshly body begotten of and begetting further the socalled lusts of the flesh Holding to such a view the body becomes something despicable and then hateful as it seems to thwart ones search for the spiritualThen follows mortification of the flesh to quell the evil arising from the possession of such a body related in William James Varieties of Religious ExperienceSuch attempts to control desires are really only extreme examples of repression effected by means of selfinflicted tortureTo begin to do this one must hold a view which hates the body and the outcome of such asceticism will be greatly increased bodyhatredMasochistic tendencies where present will also be gratifiedAll this can hardly be said to indicate a healthy psychological state and Lord Buddha has many times criticized these ways as unskillfulHis words found in the Dhammapada show the insufficiency of exterior asceticism which must fail to accomplish salvationIn Buddhist Teaching the interdependence of mindbody is emphasizedMoreover it is the mind which has charge at the helm while materiality is a passengerAs the Dhammapada stresses in its first and second verses Mind precedes all states and is their chief they are all mindwrought A Buddhist knows that he has acquired his present body through his own craving and that it is in the mind that one must look to find the source of all unskill including all types of greed and all hatred whether for self or otherThe Dhutangas are therefore a mainly physical discipline with a psychological basis and are invaluable as a complement to the greater part of the Dhamma which is a psychological discipline based on materialityThe thudong bhikkhu thus makes use of these practices in so far as they help him to discipline himself in the promotion of skillful mental states like renunciation and contentmentThese thirteen Austere Practices allowed by Lord Buddha have been characterized as a moderate and sane ascesis they are as followsTriplerobewearers Practice  Having and wearing only three robes and not having additional allowable robesAlmsfoodeaters Practice  eating only food collected on pindapata or the almsround while not accepting food in the vihara or offered by invitation in a laymans houseHousetohouseseekers Practice  not omitting any house while going for alms not choosing only to go to rich households or those selected for some other reason as relations etcOnesessioners practice  eating one meal a day and refusing other food offered before middayBowlfoodeaters Practice  eating food from his bowl in which it is mixed together rather than from plates and dishesLaterfoodrefusers Practice  not taking any more food after one has shown that one is satisfied even though laypeople wish to offer moreForestdwellers Practice  not dwelling in a town or village but living secluded away from all kinds of distractionsTreerootdwellers Practice  living under a tree without the shelter of a roofOpenairdwellers Practice  refusing a roof and a treeroot the practice may be undertaken sheltered by a tent of robesCharnelgrounddwellers Practice  living in or nearby a charnelfield graveyard or cremation groundAnybedusers Practice  being satisfied with any dwelling allotted as a sleeping placeSitters Practice  living in the three postures of walking standing and sitting and never lying downIt will be noticed that the dhutangas help a bhikkhu to find contentment with the first three of his Four Requisites Robes Almsfood and Shelter the fourth of his Requisites not covered here is MedicineAs regards their present practice in Thailand III V VI and VII are most commonly found amongst thudong bhikkhusHaving and wearing only three robes is also widely practicedIndividual thudong bhikkhus may gather rags stitch them together dye and then wear them although madeup robes are so plentiful that this not so commonThe fourth practice is the normal kind of almsround in many Thai villages where every house gives a spoonful or so of rice to every bhikkhuIn the towns IV is not practiced it being more usual for bhikkhus to have a few houses where he is invited to call each dayAll thudong viharas comply with The next two are practiced subject to the conditions of the weather for fierce sun or torrential rain make them both impossibleThe eleventh may be recommended by a teacher for the practice of some of his disciples according to character while XII is a special aspect of that contentment which all bhikkhus must cultivateThe last Dhutanga has been mentioned below as a communal practice in some viharas upon UposathadayWhen a bhikkhu practices this individually he will usually only do so after consulting his teacher and lest conceit arise he will take care that others do not know that he practices in this wayIt is likewise true of all these practices that they are to be undertaken in seclusion and a real thudong bhikkhu always shuns the public gazeThe Buddhist Dictionary says quoting the Puggalapaññatti These exercises are however properly observed if they are taken up only for the sake of frugality of contentment of purity etcThe Thai word thudong however has a rather wider connotation than that of these practices themselvesIt is applied to anything connected with them and thus we have thudongvihara thudongbowl thudonglife and so onAs the Dhutangas may be practiced either strictly middlingly or mildly according to the standards laid down in the Visuddhimagga so there are many variations in thudong practice and different teachers place different emphases and therefore different viharas have different conditionsFor years and more this thudong life has been lived by bhikkhus in many different landsNot much can be found to record their life since those who take the thudong way are not usually writers and carry out their practice in seclusionIn Thailand many of the ancient records religious and secular were destroyed in the conflagration of the capital Ayuthaya in CEStill we know that there were before that time many Araññika bhikkhusProbably our oldest records now are the temple wall paintings from the early reigns of the present dynastyThey illustrate thudong bhikkhus undertaking the thirteen practices according to the three grades of strictnessAt the present time there are a good number of viharas where this way of life with its three foundations is taught by experienced teachersMost of them prefer to be well away from the commotion of city life the distractions and luxuries of which are far removed from the thudong idealFinally it is interesting to record that a large stupa with thirteen white pinnacles piercing the blue sky is now being completed in a large thudong vihara named after that great Indian monarch who helped in widely disseminating the Buddhas Teaching the Emperor AsokaIn the topmost cetiya will be enshrined relics of Lord Buddha whose life was this very thudong way while below will be placed the ashes of a famous meditation teacher who had followed his Great Masters way with devotion until his recent deathThe bhikkhu who abides in the Dhamma who delights in the Dhamma meditates on the Dhamma and who bears the Dhamma well in mind does not fall away from the sublime DhammaIt is rather difficult to write about the thudong bhikkhus daily life as the conditions in which they live are so differentHowever there are certain features of this life which are general and these may be taken as a basis for this outlineThe material which is presented in this and succeeding sections is composite in origin some of it being experience heard from others and more again being stories told of othersTherefore we shall speak of the bhikkhu or our thudong bhikkhu and present all these varied sources under this anonymous labelWhile doing this it should be borne in mind that much of what will be said is quite common experience for those following the thudong lifeWherever the thudong bhikkhu is whether in a cave in the forest or in some other solitary place his day begins early and with stirredup vigour he risesAll is quiet except for the nightsounds of some insects and perhaps the swishings of bats  and at such a time long before dawn say two or three oclock conditions are excellent for the practice of meditationOf course our bhikkhu unless he is very skilled will have to shake off Mara in the guise of slothandtorpor for this aspect of the Evil One would urge him to loll abed until daybreakInstead he rises and after refreshing himself fixes his mind upon his meditation subject which he had put down the night before upon going to sleepMaking the triple prostration to the Three Jewels quietly intoning Namo tassa and perhaps the Three Refuges the bhikkhu his mind rightly directed and guarded settles into his meditationThe extent to which he is able to fix his mind upon his subject to prevent the arising of the five hindrances and make it more and more onepointed will depend of course upon his own progress and abilityThe two greatest obstacles which he will encounter will be the slothandtorpor already mentioned above and distraction and between these two his mind is liable to vacillate as Odysseus boat dodging between Scylla and CharybdisBeing wrecked upon one or the other will be a common experience for him in the beginningWhen he finds his mind to be like a fountain bubbling up ideas phantasies memories anticipations and so forth he sits firmly upon his seat unmoving employing mindfulness until the mind becomes quietBut when sleepiness creeps into his mind and interferes with his bodily posture then he gets up and practices his meditation while walking up and downIf he is settled for some time in a cave or in the forest he will have made his walking place even and neither too long nor too shortPacing steadily up and down sleepiness leaves both the mind and body and after some time with the mind made onepointed he may try standing practiceAfter bringing the mind to a fully quiet and onepointed condition in this position he may return to fruitful practice sittingdownHis practice will be concluded when the cockerels birds or alarmclock inform him that daybreak is at handThen if he has them he will offer a candle and a few sticks of incense and having reverently prostrated our bhikkhu will intone his morning puja to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThe standard formulas for this found so many times in the Pali canon gain deeper and deeper meanings which become clear to him as his devotion deepens and as his practice makes progressIndeed when our bhikkhus calm is well established the slowly chanted phrases do not disturb at all and they may even be the basis for insightHe may supplement these standard chants with others selected according to individual preference or tradition among the latter will be the meditation chant upon the Parts of the Body the Pali of each repulsive part being followed by a translation into his own language just to make their significance quite clearThis may well be balanced by the meditation chants of lovingkindness first filling himself with this spirit to get rid of inward conflict and then spreading out his loving kindness to other beingsIt is also usual to chant the Recollectionbeforeuse of the Four Requisites of a bhikkhu The reason for doing this is that the true purposes of the Requisites then readily come to mind during the day when he is actually using themFinally our bhikkhu chants a sincere wish that the merits which have accrued through this chanting be made over for the good of all beingsPerhaps being in Thailand he may use the beautiful Ya devata santi viharavasini even more excellent when intoned in the rising and falling sarabhañña style of chantingThis chant is now beloved in Thailand since apart from the merit of its meaning and the euphony of style it was composed by the greatly respected and deeply religious king Phra Chom Klao known to the West as King MongkutNow is the time for our bhikkhu to prepare himself to obtain that medicine which will allay but not cure the greatest disease  hungerHe will see that his bowl is in order clean and tightly bound in its slingThen rolling his two upper robes together he is ready to set outA few remaining possessions may be secured by him in his bag and hung up in some safe place to await his return however his three robes should go with him since in ancient days cloth was not always easy to obtain and even now the double outer cloak is expensive to make and must thus be guarded carefullyMany things may happen on his almsround the subject of another booklet in this seriesHis almsround is not only to collect food for himself since it serves two other important aspects in Buddhist lifeOn the one hand he gives laypeople a chance to make merit by their acts of giving while on the other he trains himself in many good qualities at this time for as he goes his way collecting food so he cultivates humility lovingkindness and compassion mindfulness and perhaps his meditation subjectHaving taken sufficient food to last the day and knowing at the same time moderation in quantity the bowl has then to be washed and dried carefully so that it will not rust returned to its sling and tied to its stand being then ready to be taken anywhereIf the bhikkhu is temporarily resident in one place he will then engage in some walking up and downThis is in accordance with one of the discourses of Lord Buddha which recommends this form of meditation exercise to ward off sleepiness after having taken what is usually a substantial mealHaving thus established himself once again in mindfulness he may take up any work which has to be doneIt is difficult to list all the possible jobs that he may do at this time but readers should realize that he tries to be as selfsufficient as is practicableEven though he has but few things these have to be kept in good repairFor instance it is important for him to keep his robes mendedGoing through jungles thorns catch and tear and there is always ordinary wear and tear in fact the thudong bhikkhu is well aware of the household truth  A stitch in time saves nine A thudong bhikkhus robes are usually wellpatched and look as though they have seen long serviceOr he may make certain things from bamboo or wood and many a thudong bhikkhu is very skillful at such manufactureA bowlstand is needed or the bamboo shafts of his crot must be replaced or he may make quantities of toothbrushandpicks out of bitter wood to give to other bhikkhusOur bhikkhu may be conversant with the medicinal properties of the herbs trees and climbers which grow all about him and compound from these with honey milk red peppers and fruits medicines for many diseasesThen again he may manufacture out of tins wire and fine white cloth a collapsible candlelamp which no wind can blow out or perhaps he is gifted in the ability to carve and if so he may fashion small pieces of hardwood or ivory into images of Lord BuddhaHe may if he lives in a cave like to adorn the mighty walls of his residence with drawings of the Buddha all executed in simple colors from the earth round aboutIf there were many thudong bhikkhus in this world they would truly be the bane of modern commerce which insists that mans happiness depends on having many things and that he buys them in particular and new brands from othersQuite contrary to all this is the thudong bhikkhu whose ways are directly set against the worldly stream where it is not a multitude of things impermanent which bring happiness  but contentment with littleThus lightened of the clutter of things he goes more swiftly towards his goal of EnlightenmentOr if his pindapata has been long and his food got with difficulty he may feel bodily tiredness and lie down mindfullyThis is usually done by lying on the right side placing a supporting roll of robes under the upper half of the body the head being supported in the palm of the right hand while the elbow of that arm rests on the groundThis was the lying posture recommended by Lord Buddha and balanced thus it is not possible to go to sleep while mindfulness will be maintainedWhenever he feels that his body is light all tiredness gone we should picture our bhikkhu sitting down crosslegged upon his sittingcloth and arousing mindfulness and all the other salutary factors of meditation and then striving to succeed or perhaps succeeding in his subject of meditationHe may sit for many hours at a stretch especially if he is skilled or he may vary his sitting with more walking and even if his back becomes tired with lying downThe latter posture can only be practiced during the day as sleep is liable to overcome him if he lies down during the hours of darknessHe may also find it helpful in moments of mental stress or when he is experiencing too much of the monkeymindHis meditation time will take him round to early evening when the heat of the day over it is the usual time to do the sweepingIf he lives in a meditationvihara there may be large areas to sweepIf in a hut in the forest then only his hut and its surroundingsBut this work is quite unnecessary for one who is living under his crot wherever he has pitched it and he will probably not have a broom anywayGeneral mindfulness at this time is accompanied by the sweeping reflection Just as this broom is sweeping away dust so may this meditation practice sweep away the defilementsThere are some other excellencies to sweeping for instance it is a chance to test the strength of the calm which has been developed mostly in the sitting postureAlso it is good exercise for the body after sitting still most of the dayOur bhikkhu does his sweeping rhythmically and silentlyNext comes the time for bathing perhaps in a forest pool or riverTaking his bathingcloth our bhikkhu goes  not with the worldly idea of enjoying the water but bearing in mind an aspect of his bodys repulsiveness which makes it necessary to batheHe reflects having got this body through craving one has daily to wipe off the sweat which oozes out of it and the dirt which sticks to it otherwise if would quickly become evilsmelling and unbearable both to oneself and to othersThis also applies to his robes which require washing frequently while at this time he may occasionally have to dye his robesReturning still bearing his meditationsubject in mind if he is able there may be some allowable drink awaiting him at his abode to refresh him furtherNains are expert at preparing these from jungle fruits adding sugar or honey while if hunger disturbs him much one of the bitter fruits allowed in the Vinaya may be taken with salt sugar and perhaps some chiliBefore he takes these he will reflect carefully upon the real reason for doing so according to the passage repeated in his morning pujaIf we were watching him we should soon notice the care that he takes so that no small creatures come to destructionBefore he pours out his drink he inspects the glass to see whether ants or other insects are insideIf there are he removes them very gently to a safe placeIn lifting the glass and putting it down he takes the same care and even when a mosquito alights on his body it is not squashed but blown away for even the smallest creatures must not come to death either through his intention or through negligenceHarmlessness has for him many practical applicationsThe time has come now for his evening meditation and taking his seat refreshed in body he makes further endeavors in governing the mindPerhaps before he begins Lord Buddhas oftrepeated exhortation comes to mind What a master can do for his disciples wishing them well out of compassion and sympathy that I have done for youHere O bhikkhus are the roots of trees and secluded placesPractice meditation O bhikkhusBe not negligent lest you regret it laterThis is my exhortation to you And so we may imagine him sitting long into the night as long in fact as he can keep off sleepinessWhen this becomes too pressing he lights a candle and some incense and begins his night chantingIf he knows much Pali this may continue for a long while softly and steadily proceeding with that euphony peculiar to this ancient languageIt is recorded in commentarial stories that the gods came to listen to the Pali chanting of those bhikkhus living in wild places who had pure heartsAt last finishing after again making over all merits for beings happiness he lies down mindfully bearing in mind his meditationsubject and the necessity of arising early to proceed with his practiceLiving in sylvan solitudes is not always alas ideal for dukkha must show its fangs from time to time to remind our bhikkhu if indeed he needs reminding that it is in a world subject to birth and death that he livesHaving got himself into the condition of being born he and all other beings will surely dieThis lesson he learned from close acquaintance for he recently lost a good companionHe was an intelligent young man recently ordained as a nain one who would have been well capable of understanding the DhammaHe was able to live the thudong life and to enjoy it to his profit  a not inconsiderable combination of factorsHis life ended suddenly when he was about twenty years old for he fell over a fortyfoot cliff and dashed his brains upon the rocks belowOur bhikkhu was the first person to reach the nain after having raced down a circuitous pathLittle enough could he doTelling another nain to run into the nearest village for a stretcher he knelt beside his only other companion on the rocky hill where they livedThe nains breathing still functioned but in great irregular gaspsBlood already clotted oozed from the sundered skull and trickled from many other cuts and bruises upon the body arms and legsDeath was near at handTaking a rosary from his bag the bhikkhu opened one of the nains hands and placed it thereIt would thus act as a skillful object of touch if the nains touchconsciousness still functionedAfter sprinkling him with cooling water he began to intone the suttas for protectionThis he did so that there would be a skillful soundobject upon which the nains deathconsciousness could be concentratedThough he tried to chant steadily and evenly to give confidence to the dying nain  if indeed he heard him his voice was not without tremblingThe minutes drew on and after the opening salutation of Namo tassa the Karaniya Metta Sutta the Mahamangala Sutta and the Ratana Sutta followed each otherAs the closing words of the last sutta Sangham namassama suvatti hotu   as these words were softly chanted upon the shimmering air a last breath arose and gaspingly fell  and the body was stillHis good companion had passed on according to his kamma and as the bhikkhu earnestly vowed May it truly be to a better state of affairs than thisAfter that if only to relieve his own mind  and who knows perhaps his erstwhile friend could still hear him in his new condition  he intoned further the Buddha Jayamangala stanzas with their refrain of By the power of this may you be endowed with victory and blessingsIt is widely believed in Buddhist lands that merits are transferable providing that one has a compassion deep enough with others and a wisdom grown greatFor the wellfaring of the dead nain his friend made over to him all and any merits which he might have accumulated including those gathered by the recitation of these hallowed scripturesWe take up the story again three days later when bhikkhus have gathered for reciting the traditional chants for the deadThe father of the dead nain has also arrivedThe chanting is solemn indeed and rolls on sonorously through the tropic night spreading its peaceful sound far beyond the range of the pressure lamps which light up but a small circle in the bamboo forestSeated upon mats covering the ground laypeople listen reverently with joined palms while the chanting proceedsOur bhikkhu seated with others upon some more mats concentrates all his attention upon the chanting making it proceed not from the throat but deep down from the heartAt its conclusion there is some informal talk upon Dhamma especially regarding death and kamma and then more general conversation opens concerning what arrangements should be madeA westerner might notice if one had been present that although this ceremony roughly corresponded to a funeral service no one was weeping or even looking particularly sad  and certainly not the father of the late nainWhatever tears there had been over his death they were long since over and quickly stopped by such Buddhist recollections as the fact that rebirth takes place according to kamma and that nothing of this can be changed by weepingAnd again the injunction to live in the present without attachment to the past which is irreclaimably goneAnd the reflection that rebirth may already be accomplished and be superior in happiness to this state would it not be strange to be miserable because someone else was now more happy than he was in this lifePutting aside all selfpity which makes for most of the tears at death a good Buddhist concentrates upon the situation now and sees what can best be accomplished in the presentThe conversation has turned to the customary presentation in this case by the father of robes upon the death of a relativeSometimes readymade robes are laid upon the coffin and received by bhikkhus as pamsukula at other times white cloth is similarly given to be made up into robesThe strictest practice and one which is followed by a few thudong bhikkhus is to take cloth which has been used as a corpsewrapping and make this into robes  this is a practice from the time of the Lord Buddha and such robes may truly be called ragrobes Our bhikkhu wishes to benefit from the present circumstances so as to obtain such a robeThe father of the dead nain has already bought about twenty yards of white cloth for pamsukula robesThis has then to be inserted into the coffin and then to be extracted at the time of burningLater our bhikkhu will cut it up and sew it to make traditional patchwork pattern and the robes that he makes from this cloth will ever remind him of death by stains and smell for some time and for longer by the memory of how they were obtainedThe next day food being finished our bhikkhu turns his attention to the large coffin which rests under some treesCandles and incense the Buddhist symbols respectively of Enlightenment and of the perfume of strict morality are burning round aboutAs he approaches the coffin the smell grows stronger  the peculiarly repulsive smell of a human bodys decay which spreads its sweetly sickening odors for many yards aboutIt is not without some apprehension of what he will see upon raising the lid that he proceeds for he has read the descriptions of bodily decay as used for meditation purposes but reading does not satisfy him the bhikkhu wishes to see for himselfLifting the lid he gazes within and is immediately and deeply impressed that these descriptions as found for instance in the Satipatthana Sutta are but poor substitutes for beholding the real thingHis companion in life was a handsome young man even with his hair shaved off this body which lay before him was quite as hideous as temple wallpaintings sometimes show and emphasized for him that words are quite inadequate for portraying such sightsSo the young nain with unblemished body and pleasing face died but three days before and now what does our bhikkhu perceiveHis companion is certainly not thereThis puffed distorted oozing mass blueish in color is not the man he knewNothing resembles himThree days have sufficed to change everythingGaining this insight and the perception of impurity in even living bodies  what to speak of dead ones  he continues with the work he has set out to doThe body is already covered by the stained robes of the late nain and the white cloth is laid over thisHaving completed his work he reseals the coffin to await the time of cremationAs the lid is replaced so the stench grows less but the whole experience has burned itself deep into his mind and will not lessenIndeed he may develop it into a fruitful meditation when he sees with inward sight his own body not only as liable to such a condition but actually experiences the body as being in such a stateClimbing back to his dwelling high above the forest he muses Where such a terrible sight as this can be found so soon originating from apparently pleasing conditions  where such and worse can be found what sort of world is thisWho will waste their lives after such a perceptionWho will longer be deluded by the sugarcoating of the worlds senseattractions after seeing thusWill they not rather sense the bitter pill beneathIs this not the time to turn away from those conditions giving rise to the bitternessIs it not the time to devote oneself to that Dhamma which is lovely at its beginning lovely in its middle course and lovely at its endingSome such thoughts as these our bhikkhu thinksFor those who can do more this is the time to join those millions who have gone forth like our bhikkhu with robes and bowl rejecting all that the world values and seeking to reject both ignorance and craving those twin conditions for bitterness to win in the Dispensation of the Conqueror that Enlightenment which he also wonSo urges the Enlightened OneOur bhikkhu will live anywhere that is conducive to his practice of meditation and to winning insight but certain types of abode are generally more suitable for him than othersFrom ancient times a favorite dwellingplace of the thudong bhikkhu has been a cave indeed this is really the best environment providing that a suitable one can be foundNot all are good for meditation and our bhikkhu upon arriving at a cave new to him would inspect it with the following points in mindPeople are very fond of making caves into shrines  and some of these are very beautiful with hundreds or thousands of Buddhafigures of different sizes ranged about the cave sitting on blocks of stone and stalagmite near to the floor and gazing down compassionately from apparently inaccessible niches near the lofty roofSuch caves and others more rustic acquire fame as places of pilgrimage in proportion to their beauty and ease of approachNow if our bhikkhu were to make his sitting place in some such cave he would surely be disturbed by the people visiting the shrineApart from the noise that they make some would certainly approach him perhaps trying to engage him in ordinary conversation or coming to ask for charms or blessings since popular ideas of holiness are rather less exacting or more vague than the freedom from the fetters which mark a Noble One according to the Pali canonTherefore if he does not wish to instruct in Dhamma much less to engage in worldly matters he will avoid all such cavesApart from people bats are also fond of caves in the dark depths of which they live in their thousandsThey also make their noises cheeping and swishing about but their noises are much less objectionable than is the smell of their dungThis is very good for growing plants but less agreeable to a meditators noseUsually they will not live near to the cave entrance especially if the sun comes in and so other conditions being favorable our bhikkhu may live thereOther conditions include sound and heatIn this noisy age rackety iron boxes of various shapes travel over land water and through the air and their sound is surprisingly hard to escape fromIt is understandable therefore that caves adjacent to airfields motorways or railways will also be avoidedThe great advantage of a cave in a tropical country is its equable temperatureCool even on the hottest days of the hot season and warm in the coldest nights of the cold weather it is very favorable for a meditating bhikkhuCaves which have wide openings to the south or west are therefore less suitable for the hot weatherOther inconveniences to consider are the danger of falling rocks and the presence of carbon dioxideAlso it sometimes happens that earth godlings take up their residence in caves and not all of them will welcome a bhikkhu staying there as this will interfere with their pleasuresIndeed there are stories of bhikkhus being evicted by spirits but there is at least one instance of an experienced bhikkhu who sat night after night in a cave defeating all the efforts of godlings to oust himOur bhikkhu if he is wise seeks for the protection of any gods there abiding when he first arrives at a caveWith gods giving their blessing to his efforts meditation certainly becomes easier while if the opposite should occur it may be impossibleFinally a consideration of great importance its distance from the nearest villageAs most thudong bhikkhus go to collect alms every day and as bhikkhus are not allowed to store food so a village must be within walking distanceHow far this is depends upon the vigour and age of our bhikkhuHalf a mile or a miles distance is desirable in any case being thus beyond village noises but it does happen that a cave otherwise ideal may be too far from the village for the bhikkhu to walk there and backIn this case the villagers will help the bhikkhu by taking their food out halfwayHe may find that living in a cave is a little eerie at first and should any fear trembling or hairraising take place no doubt he will at least remember the Metta SuttaAlso wellfitted for recitation at such a time is the Discourse on the Flags where the medicines recommended for fear are the Recollections of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaIf our bhikkhu is still better read in the Pali canon he will remember the Discourse on Fear and Dread where Lord Buddha describes the way in which he trained himself to be mindful of fear while he was yet a BodhisattaWhat sort of picture do we get of our bhikkhu in his caveIf he is staying long he will probably have built himself a bamboo or wooden pallet above which will hang his crotTo one side somewhere hang his bag and candlelampNear to him will be a waterflask and if it is dark possibly a torchHis bowl is placed securely on a flat rock while any robes which he is not using are folded up neatly upon his palletHe is sitting quietly facing the direction of his head when laying downIf one were to watch intently it would be difficult to detect even breath movements in his body swathed as it is in rather shabby patched robes of folded ochreAbove him the roof vaults in great arches and mysterious hollows halflit by the dim lightSteady and distant is the dripping of water which makes through long ages great columns slowly joining roof and floorSunlight filters through a leafy screen for a few minutes and is gone and perhaps a bee drones in but finding little of interest soon finds its way outAll is very still very silentCaves are by far the best abode but they especially ideal ones are rare so that we should go on to describe something of the more common home of thudong bhikkhus  the forestThe advantages of dwelling in the forest are severalFirst there is much of it in many Buddhist countriesThen as it is the sort of place where most men do not like to live the thudong bhikkhu is not likely to be disturbed not at any rate by his fellowmenLike other thudong abodes it conduces to contentment with little also it makes very necessary the development of metta or lovingkindnessBesides advantages there are quite a number of possible hindrances to practice while forestdwellingFor instance metta is made rather essential by the presence of all sorts of potentially antipathetic creatures the most dangerous of which are snakesThis is certainly emphasized in the Pali canon by the presence of a special chant the Khanda Paritta in which the person chanting stresses that he has metta towards and does no harm to all creatures including four species of snakesThere is a little story to illustrate thisAn old Buddhist nun was living in a small hut close to the jungleHer hut had one doorway and she usually sat on the bamboo floor for meditation against the opposite wallShe was quite accustomed to see the tails of large lizards appear out of the thatch overhead where they livedOccasionally they fell out but being quite harmless they would scamper away quicklyOne day hearing such a bump on her floor she opened her eyes but instead of seeing a lizard there was an angry snake of the poisonous species coiling and uncoiling itselfInstantly recollecting the meditation on metta she pervaded herself and the whole hut with this spiritThe snake which lay between her and the door and had been threatening to strike her now quietly coiled up and after a few minutes slithered out of the doorwayThis anecdote illustrates quite a common occurrence for one dwelling in the jungle how a meditator can be brought into close proximity with the untamed animal worldIs it necessary to stress further the value of metta in such surroundingsWhile the power of Lord Buddhas metta was so great that he could calm the rutting wild elephant Nalagiri there have been many thudong bhikkhus up to modern times who have lived continuously in the forest developing the Brahmaviharas and with whom forest animals become friendsFor the man who has love  and no fear because no hatred  of other creatures those creatures will not fear himIn this connection there are a number of Jataka stories which tell of the Bodhisattas life in the forest when living in a hermitage all manner of animals became his companionsStill there do seem to be some creatures which do not respond so well to metta and therefore returning to the case of our thudong bhikkhu he will be wise not to spread his sitting cloth over the entrance to an ants nest nor to pitch his crot near places where stagnant water liesRegarding the latter he would be courting the attentions of vast numbers of hungry mosquitoesThe crot is an effective protection against but it can be hot inside while cooler air blows withoutSo if a place can be found fairly free of mosquitoes at least during the day our bhikkhu will abide more happilyAs to ants they come in all shapes and colors and a good range of sizes and mill about everywhere and our bhikkhu knows that it is safe to assume that all bite so it is well to stay away from their roads tunnels and doorwaysA few drops of paraffin sprinkled round his sittingcloth will ensure that he is fairly secure against invasionUnless the forest is really ancient with dense shade our bhikkhu will experience extremes of heat and cold unknown to the cavedwellerIn the hot season the sun blazes down from out of the cloudless sky overhead and the small shade of his crot will be insufficientEven under a tree at least in open forest hot winds are liable to blow and make life less pleasantThe conditions in denselyshaded rain forest rather resemble cavedwelling but there is an increase of biting life to reckon with as well as the rainfallForestdwelling is only possible for the thudong bhikkhu all the year round if he has a small hut to supplement the protection of his crotDuring the three months of the Rains Retreat he must in any case dwell with a roof over his headIt is quite common for thudong bhikkhus to have a small wood and bamboo hut built by a supporter in some favorable place in the forest and to dwell there either alone or with a nain or boy to assist himForest life is very far from silent for quite apart from the occasional noises of the larger animals smaller ones especially insects keep up an almost continuous racketCicadas and grasshoppery creatures although small manage to produce incredible volumes of sound sometimes resembling that of railway trainsThe only times when they are silent is when presumably they are sleepingThis is during the heat of midday and afternoon and during the middle watch of the nightUnfortunately this quietness coincides with the times when human beings also are most inclined to sleepHowever forest conditions vary very much and our bhikkhu will not find all the unfavorable conditions together but since this world is one level of samsara there are bound to be one or more flies in the ointmentWe may think of him on a moonlit night in the hot weatherA cooling wind blows stirring the trees many of which are leafless while filling the air with the fragrance of some trees blossomsA little bamboo hut stands raised upon wooden legs and upon its open platform a boy sleepsThe bhikkhu paces up and down his walk which is some thirty feet long and made under tall treesThe dark end of it is lit by his candlelamp hanging from a tree while the moon lights up the restLight is necessary since thick tubular millipedes have their homes on either side of his walk and also like to wander upon its smooth and freshly swept surfaceOur bhikkhu finishes his walking and contemplatively returns to his hutMounting the bamboo ladder to the platform he stops before the door to his tiny roomOver the door is fixed a polished wooden board upon which the following words are cut and coloredThese are the last recorded words of Lord Buddha his final exhortation to the thudong bhikkhus of those daysFor our thudong bhikkhu now they not only have the significance of being the last instructions since his own practice  and perhaps realization  accord well with themLet him admonish instruct and shield one from evil a dear one is he to the good detestable to the wickedThe greatest teachers of the thudong tradition have very often wandered all their lives never settling down long in any one place except for the annual Rains Retreat or when extreme old age forced them to do soSome have never founded viharas leaving this to those of their disciples who had an aptitude for such workOur bhikkhu however especially if he still requires guidance may live in a thudong viharaThis will be rather different from the ordinary run of viharas where bhikkhus usually live two or three together in large huts or even if they live singly their residences will be crowded closely together being built about an open hallA thudong vihara is distinguished by having the huts set so that from one another cannot be seenThis is not difficult as wood bamboo and thatch blend easily into the jungleIn each hut one bhikkhu lives and orders his time according to his practice and abilityOur bhikkhu will not often meet others resident there once or twice a day at mostThe first time is when all gather in the hall to prepare themselves for pindapata while the second may be in the evening when some fruit drink is servedAt this time also the venerable teacher of meditation may give some instruction as he sees fitGeneral instructions for instance on matters of Vinaya will be given to the community of resident bhikkhus every Holy Day after the recitation of the PatimokkhaIf our bhikkhu wishes for individual instruction in some matter he will approach his teacher after the evening instruction has been given and after saluting him with the triple prostration he will question him respectfullyIf we were present in the hall pillared with roughly shaped tree trunks and lit by candles burning before the gilded and painted shrine of Lord Buddha we should notice the great respect which he pays to his teacherHe sits in a respectful position never pointing his feet towards the teacher and he always raises his joined palms when speaking to the teacher while when the latter speaks to him he places them clasped together in his lap and listens attentivelyOur bhikkhus teacher is for him one who has experienced some degree of the Dhamma in his own heart and not merely read about it out of booksSuch teachers are therefore accorded great veneration and anyone going to such a teacher yet not making the usual salutations would probably be regarded as being difficult to teach  because of the presence of strong conceitIn some thudong viharas usually those inclined to less strict observance there is communal meditation and puja in the morning before pindapata and again in the eveningSome teachers favor this while others prefer their disciples to lead a more solitary lifeBoth may be valuable to our bhikkhu according to his character and progressUpon uposathanights it is also a feature in some thudong viharas to chant Lord Buddhas discourses all through the night the bhikkhus not sleepingThis may be interspersed with some instructions from the meditation master and perhaps by the individual practice of walkingWhere practice already goes deep this chanting slow and rhythmic may well be an aid to attainment in meditationRegarding this there was once a twelve year old boy who sat down one evening with other pious laypeople who were practicing meditation while the bhikkhus chantedHe knew nothing about how to practice nor had he ever sat in meditation posture beforeBut a very great meditationmaster lived there at that time and was leading the bhikkhus in chantingThese factors all combining led that boy through successive stages of mental concentration until he reached complete meditationHe was still sitting rapt in stillness when the bhikkhus prepared to go collecting pindapataThe meditationmaster upon seeing him decided not unnaturally that the boy would make a good discipleAfter rousing him and giving him the precepts the boy lived in that vihara learning the way from his masterOne bhikkhu wellpracticed in meditation was famous for the easy control he had over his bodySitting down in the temple at eight oclock upon uposathanights he would not find it necessary to change his posture until six oclock the next morningHe never got up from his seat his gaze never wandered anywhere he just concentrated upon chanting from the heart being completely absorbed in thisOur bhikkhu will be encouraged by his teacher to live with him until such times as the latter feels that he has sufficient knowledge of the Dhamma and strong enough meditation to go off on his own to practice in a cave or forestThere are disciples who like to stay with their teachers until death parts themThere are others who want to go off quickly and practice aloneIt sometime happens that the latter experience one of the ecstatic absorptions and conclude from this since they lack sufficient Dhammaknowledge and the guidance of their teacher that they have won a noble attainmentSometimes such bhikkhus proclaim this out of ignorance and gain quite a following however their fame soon dwindles for one cannot pretend intentionally or otherwise to be an arahant or even to have reached one of the lower stages of ariyan attainmentA famous teacher once had a pupil who esteemed himself to be an arahant but the former knew that he was not so but that his mind was really overcome by the perversionsNow this teacher had another pupil who although he could neither read nor write had such experience of Dhamma that many consider that he was really an arahantHe lived alone in a cave and seldom spoke and when he did so he uttered only words of Dhamma never mere pleasantriesThe famous teacher was in the habit of sending any of his pupils who became deluded to this great pupil of whom he thought very highlySo he sent his deluded disciple to himThe first and only words which the great pupil spoke to the deluded one were Sit here The former gave the latter no instruction he only sat in meditation with him day and night only rarely breaking off for the barest necessitiesAfter two weeks of this rigorous treatment the deluded one at least gained the insight that he was not after all an arahant and then returned to live with his teacherIn this way he was cured of this manifestation of the perverted mindLiving in a vihara at least for some time will enable the thudong bhikkhu to make his meditation practice grow strongly and that fear trembling and hairraising which he might easily experience in other more remote surroundings are less likely to arise thereHe has the guidance of the Good Friend and the companionship of the good that is of fellowbhikkhus and nains who are likewise striving to accomplish the goal of complete liberation of the mindIn this way he has the best possible environment for progress in his meditation and may stay with his teacher for many yearsThis is particularly true if the pupil finds just the right teacher who can instruct him in the right way to goFor just as pupils vary as to the proportions of differing defilements in their characters so teachers vary with regard to different attainments and abilityWhat can we say of other bhikkhu abodesGenerally the thudong bhikkhu looks with disfavor upon living on a mountain  unless that is there happens to be a village near and at approximately the same altitudeOur bhikkhu knows that his bowlful of rice is quite heavy enough especially after a long walk without having to haul it up a mountain pathWhenever bhikkhus ceased to rely on pindapata as for instance in China they were able to live upon mountain heights in peace and solitudeAmong abodes recommended in the Path of Purification is the charnelfield or boneyardThis is said to be an excellent abode for greed charactersIt appears to have been a common custom in ancient India to take corpses to a special part of the forest and to leave them there to go to their dissolutionThus a thudong bhikkhu lighting upon such a place might be able to see all the various stages of decay of the body  as they are described in detail in the above workSuch was of course an unforgettable lesson upon the fate of his own bodyNowadays in this country boneyards like this cannot be found for burning the body sooner or later has taken the place of the natural process of its return to the component elementsTherefore it is now almost impossible to live in this environment and the best that can be done is to dwell near a burning groundUsually there will not be much of bones remaining only piles of ashes still there is for many the fear of spirits to overcomeIt is commonly assumed that such a birth follows a human one and that the hungry ghost or spirit lurks about near its former body sometimes with evil intent while others are supposed to be more kindly disposedThis may sometimes happen when petabirth actually follows the human one because of petalike kamma but popular belief assumes that this is invariableHowever this may be a certain amount of caution is required before dwelling in such a placeIf our bhikkhu is of imaginative disposition he must have his imagination well under control before dwelling in a burninggroundAn uncontrolled imagination coupled with loneliness the natural noises of the night and the dimly lighted surroundings can result in an unbalanced mindA good many years ago now there was a nain recently ordained and fifteen years of ageHis meditation master sent him to dwell overnight in the local burninggroundcumgraveyard which was well out of the village in the jungleNot knowing that it is proper to inspect such a place in full daylight first noting how all the rocks trees tombs etcare placed  he arrived there only at duskAfter laying a cloth to sit upon and hanging up his crot he began to look aroundFinding a suitable place to walk up and down he decided to begin his meditations in this wayAs he was turning round at one end out of the corner of his eye he saw a great black phantom looming up its jagged arms outstretched the clawlike fingers ready to seize himIn fear and trembling he continued his walking and so great was his terror of the unknown thing that he did not sit or lie down all that night but walked and stood meditatingWhen dawn came the thing became less black and menacing slowly resolving itself into a stricken treetrunkAs custom has changed so much that the boneyard is no longer to be found there was in this country many years ago a senior bhikkhu who decided to remedy this lackThis teacher dwelt in a little vihara in a patch of woodland outside a small town and near the old capital of AyuthiaVery few bhikkhus stayed in this vihara for after they had seen what they came to see he sent them away to practice on their ownAnd what did they seeThis teacher had constructed a flower garden and all round it he had built a high wall pierced by only one door and that was padlockedThe flowers that grew in this garden were very special ones special bhikkhu flowersThe flowers of laymen are of gorgeous colors entrancing shapes and subtle perfumes but these flowers for bhikkhus although they had their colors shapes and perfumes were rather differentInside the garden there were constructed a number of open troughs covered by glass frames from one end of which rose a long pipeWhen a man died in the town the teacher would go and personally carry away the body slinging it over his shoulderTaking it to his garden he would lay it in a trough and cover it with a frameWhen a bhikkhu desiring a subject of meditation came to him he would be told by the teacher that he only instructed in the Cemetery ContemplationsAt first the teacher would go with him into the garden during daylight and let him select a suitable flower for his meditationsThen he let the bhikkhu go in there alone to fix the subject in his mindFinally he was permitted to go in at night and spend the hours of darkness meditating upon his flower Then having settled the meditation subject firmly in his mind the teacher would tell the bhikkhu to go and to meditate aloneBefore he went he would receive instructions upon a further aspect of the meditation which emphasized that it was not a body out there which was to be seen even in the mindIt was his own body which had to be seen with insight as bloated festering or just dry bones according to the stage of the decay selectedThus were bhikkhus of that time enabled to free themselves from the deluded identification of this body as being myself or as mine  by the special exertions of this teacherEvery teacher as we have mentioned before has his own characteristic ways both of instruction and of conductIf our bhikkhu went to a certain teacher a disciple of a yet more famous master he would have to put forth energy if he wished to live with himThis teacher lived in a little ramshackle hut  he would not let laypeople build him anything else in a small jungle vihara  and was about eightyfive years oldIt was his practice to begin his working day at five oclock when he would vigorously start to sweep the vihara groundsThen when it was light he went out to collect foodReturning he ate a single meal of small quantity and for the rest of the day drank only waterBesides the two normal pujas he made a third one in the middle of the nightTo do this he slept from ten oclock until midnight  and never used a mosquitonet  and then got up for puja after which he slept again for another two hoursArising vigorous he would sit in meditation until the sweepingtimeHis appearance was hale and it appeared that he might very well carry on with his way of life for another twenty years at leastStories about teachers are endless and this short account could never contain a tithe of themSo we must let these few suffice as examples and close this section on thudong abodesToday when it is possible to go quickly everywhere by some conveyance or other why wanderWhat is the purpose of the thudong bhikkhu who alone or with one or two companions prefers to go his way on footThere are quite a lot of reasons why wandering in this manner is preferredFor example the wanderer goes quietly and at whatever speed he wishesHe is not brought into contact with others who might disturb his contemplative way and he may stay at a place just as long as it pleases him  and leave it when he wishesAlso he is uninvolved with other people no arrangements has he to make for them while he gives trouble to noneIn fact his is the way of freedomThen again he reflects that this way of travel was used by his great Master in the fortyfive years of his teaching in India and has been that of countless other bhikkhus seeking EnlightenmentThe modern ways of traveling are good for getting to places quickly but not so good for gaining EnlightenmentThere is distraction enough in the mind without churning it up still further  some such thoughts he thinksReasons for wandering are also rather various and we are only concerned with those motivated by the search for EnlightenmentThe real purposes are threefold to be able to dwell in solitary places for meditation to visit meditationmasters who often stay far into the country or forest or to go on pilgrimage to some famous shrineWhile the first and second have already been touched upon the third needs a few more wordsBy pilgrimage to a shrine is meant the desire that arises in some bhikkhu who has taken to thudong life to visit and make his puja at a great stupa where are enshrined some remains of Lord Buddha or the arahantsOr perhaps to go to some famous temple where an exceptionally beautiful image of the Enlightened One is enshrinedAll this he does with the idea that merit is gained from such actions and indeed if our thudong bhikkhu or anyone else goes on such pilgrimages singlemindedly and in deep devotion the results for his own development in the Dhamma are bound to be fruitfulIf he wanders every day especially if the weather is hot the way rough or both his power of meditation must be very strong indeed or it will suffer from the impact of these external conditionsTiredness of the body after walking only four or five hours can be a great obstacle in the way of peaceful practiceTherefore either he will walk one day and then finding a suitable place stop there for three or four days or if he wishes to reach a definite place by a certain time then he puts by his practice of mental calm and takes up the full time application of mindfulness in its various aspectsBesides the necessity of strong samadhi it is quite sure that he must have a strong body able to endure blazing sun heat sweat rough ways insects and cuts and bruisesThese latter together with blisters are not infrequent in thudong life and can make his way very difficultIf he goes without sandals rocks will cut and thorns pierce his feet or going with them the feet must be very hard or they will surely be chappedStrength of body is required so that he can carry comfortably his few essentialsWhat does a wandering thudong bhikkhu carryFirst of all there are his eight essentials which are a bhikkhus only possessionsThey are three robes a waistband to secure the waistcloth a needle and thread razor and lastly a waterstrainerThese items he must take with him or if he loses any of them at any time they should be made good as soon as possibleIn the thudong life all these things have their relevance  including the water strainer which is a very important piece of equipmentBesides these there will be certain other things which he is sure to have a waterflask or kettle his crot a sitting cloth and one for bathing and probably a bhikkhubag containing a few additional articlesAmong these may be a candlelamp one or two medicines toothpickcumbrushes perhaps a small folding clock and a penknifeHe may also carry a copy of the Patimokkha in Pali with a translation into his own language and some small book on the teaching such as the DhammapadaAll these together make up a good weight and generally he will only want to carry them before the sun gets too high and the late afternoon or evening when it is settingHow then should we picture our bhikkhu as he makes his way by footpaths and stony tracks through deep forest or open ricefieldsHe wears two of his robes the doublethick one being usually wrapped and stowed inside his bowl unless it is very coldHis bowl is secured in its sling and tied tight to its stand while the strap of the sling passes over one shoulderHis sitting cloth and a few other things may also be put inside while the bathingcloth forms an additional outer protection for the bowlHis bag the crot in its sling and the waterflask hang from the other shoulderA thudong bhikkhu does not wear his robes long but hitches them rather high and so passes more easily through streams and over mountainsIf he is in open country and the sun is shining he may place any handy piece of cloth on his head although this is always removed in accordance with the Vinayas injunctions when passing by houses or through villagesThe sandals on his feet are stout ones  they have to be to take all the knocks that his feet would otherwise sufferIn this way he goes mindful of and joyful in the DhammaHe may go alone or with a nain or small boy following or he may be with one or two other bhikkhusProbably they will not be walking very close together but prefer to be rather wellspaced so that mindfulness does not suffer nor conversation tend to break up their silenceEvery so often at least in forests one of the bhikkhus will spot some refreshing fruit tree and then they may turn in that direction and after gathering the wild fruits  providing that it is not yet twelve oclock  sit eating them while taking a wellearned restCertain bitter fruits such as the emblic myrobalan may be taken after midday as they have medicinal properties and our bhikkhu will be glad of these to help quench his thirst in the heat of the afternoonA few thudong bhikkhus en marche in some ways resemble a small detachment of soldiersThey both have uniforms they both carry all their needs along with them and in both cases the senior leads and the juniors follow but here the resemblance endsThe former wear the robe of peace of harmlessness towards all living beings and all their possessions speak of a pacific way of lifeNo guns do they carry but crots no grenades but almsbowlsThe wandering bhikkhu has conquered eastern Asia by these means without dissension without resort to violence without wars but with lovingkindness and compassionAnd those mighty empires which ambitious and victorious men have raised one after the other by the use of force shattering opponents by wars innumerable  all this might and glory has passed away has crumbled to defaced stones and timesmoothed coins found in distant junglesBut the Dispensation of the Conqueror who practiced and preached a morality based upon nonviolence this empire of peace has enduredWhat is the message here for the empiremakers political or economic of the present dayWhat has this Dhamma to say to those who think of their lives as a fight against othersUpon this matter the Dhammapada has the following verseOur wandering bhikkhu may decide at the end of his day whether he will stay the night in the forest or cave or other suitable place or whether the country proving unfavorable he will go to the nearest villageIf he elects in favor of the latter it may well be that in approaching the village in the evening light some villagers will see himThen some pious laymen will approach him and saluting him respectfully relieve his shoulders of bowl and crot and invite him to stay for the night in the village vihara or where there is no established residence for bhikkhus in the hallWord will soon get round the village that a venerable thudong bhikkhu has arrived and people will then come to the hall bringing with them things for his comfort  a pillow mat and of course teaIn Thailand at any rate this means watertea or as westerners would say Chinese teaHe may also be offered honey or sugar to refresh himself and while he does this people will sit upon a lower level of the hall and respectfully enquire where he has come from whereto he will be going how long has he been a bhikkhu  and so forthIf our bhikkhu wishes or has the gift of teaching the general conversation may well be turned towards Dhamma and the laypeople will sit listening intently and perhaps putting a question now and then upon some point which they do not understandWhenever there is time during the informal gathering or when people have departed our bhikkhu will have to see about patching up his skin bag which is so liable to become punctured even though he takes great careVillagers will give him more medicines often of their own manufacture if those he carries do not sufficeHis various wounds usually very small matters may nevertheless give him plenty of room for reflection upon the nature of the bodyA small pimple soon grows into a large sore and an insignificant cut quickly pulsates with oozing pus and he remembers that each day he chants There are in this body  kesa  hair of the head loma  hair of the body and so forth to taco  skin mamsam  flesh pubbo  pus lohitam  bloodHis cuts and blisters are reminders for him that the bag of skin holds much which although usually hidden from ordinary sight is liable to erupt and compel attentionThe thudong bhikkhu gives attention here willingly whereas the worldly attitude is to turn away from and try not to consider such nasty thingsOur bhikkhu however knows that the seeing of all these parts of the body traditionally thirtytwo in number as they really are that is as a danger as repulsive and as liable to decay leads him towards freedom from the own bodyview and towards that state where the body is viewed quite impersonally and as a collection of processes acting and reactingAt best it will be seen after insight into its nature has been experienced as an instrument of the DhammaTowards such insight and mature understanding our bhikkhu strives and he will if he has still energy enough sit in meditation after the last villager has departed and attaining calm shift his attention to these thirtytwo messy parts or some one or two of them endeavoring to develop insightPerhaps he may vow before taking his rest Oh may this body be devoted to the Dhamma may it become a Dhammainstrument And his night will be spent peacefully no dreams will disturb him and he will awake refreshed the body ready for active service in the Dhamma when he takes up his meditationsubject again in the cool of the morningWhen it is fully light many villagers will come to the hall to make merit which means that our bhikkhu will not have to go out for pindapataEvery house will send a bowl of rice and some other food to accompany it and perhaps he may get sweets and fruits as wellOne person from each house will place one or two spoons of rice into his bowl as it stands upon the raised platformfloorWhen they have finished the other food together with his bowl will be reverently given into his hands  for a bhikkhu should not take any food which has not actually been offered in this wayThe senior layman may well ask him for the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts and the giving of these being completed our bhikkhu will intone a chant whereby the merits made by the laity are formally dedicated to the happiness and comfort of the hungry ghostsBefore he begins his meal he remembers that this food is one of the four requisites and the proper reason why he will eat itHis meal over and his bowl washed he sets out again upon his wayGenerally however the serious wanderer will prefer wherever conditions permit to spend his nights in the forest where his own quiet of mind will be better company for him than many peopleOf course he will not get good tea nor honey  nor the other comforts of the village hall but if he has practiced diligently he will have comforts enough and far superior to those who have not sat in meditationHe will be able to sit as long as he can in the cool of the night without interruption if he has chosen a site far enough removed from the villageSo our bhikkhu stays out of sight and hearing until he appears the next morning in the village upon his round for pindapataOf course there will be no special food for him as there would be if he had stayed in the hallHe will just get the ordinary fareAs he has cultivated contentment he will not care whether it is finest culinary art or plainest village rice  it is all the same to himHe will find a considerable difference in the villages along his way some will be prosperous while others are poor some tidy and others uncared for and so onAnd he will not always be welcome and though this will be very unusual it does happen especially where villagers are for some reason without bhikkhus to guide their livesWhen he chances upon such a village if he is an ordinary bhikkhu he will have a good opportunity to test the strength of his patienceWhile if he is a teacher he may stop there for some time and using all his skill teach the people what is wrong with the way that they are going and what is the right way to fare through lifeTurning now to another matter we should mention here the custom among thudong bhikkhus of making certain vowsIt may be that the vow is made to observe a definite practice among the thirteen ascetic modes such as refraining from lying down for a certain number of days weeks or monthsA wandering bhikkhu may vow never to stay in a hall such as we have described or to go on some pilgrimage by foot all the way not accepting proffered transport  and so forthRegarding this last vow there is a storyA few years ago a Thai bhikkhu of about fifty years of age made a vow to walk from Bangkok to the holiest place for Buddhists the Diamond Throne at Buddha Gaya in IndiaSo he set off with bowl and robes and a few other things such as we have describedHe took no money upon his pilgrimage neither did he worry about such modern encumbrances as passports and visasFalling in with a party of Mon bhikkhus going to make their puja at the Shwe Dagon Pagoda in Rangoon he went with them and from there made his slow progress up the length of BurmaTwo rains retreats he spent upon the way and still he had not reached IndiaFinally he crossed the IndoBurmese border in the wild hills of Nagaland and there some Nagas who had probably never seen a bhikkhu before and took him for a spy severely beat him taking away even his robes and bowlFortunately he was able to recover these although his few other things were gone and so limping he made his way down the Assamese plainKnowing not a word of any Indian language and having to rely on pindapata which is not so easily got in India his first concern was to get someone to write on a piece of paper in Hindi and Bengali I am a Buddhist bhikkhuI collect cooked food which is to be placed in this bowlMay you be well and happy This piece of paper he showed everywhere he went so that people would understand what he requiredLuckily he was a vegetarian and not troubled regarding foodAfter many months of walking he came to Buddha GayaHis vow was fulfilled after two and a half years he had wandered to good purposeThere is wandering in this way with some profitable end in view and there is also an aimless wanderingThe thudong bhikkhu wanders in order to put an end to wanderingHe wanders purposefully in the Dhammafaring so as to come to an end of the infinitely long wandering in birthanddeathHe has taken up this way of life that of a homeless one because he sees the dangers which beset all who drift in the currents of samsaraBirth and death aging and disease afflict all beings who are like so many pieces of driftwood dashed about by the ocean waves first this way and then that  but never getting anywhere and forever at the mercy of wind and waterAs driftwood so beings do not know why they are here and instead of trying to probe this matter they invent all sorts of fanciful explanationsOur bhikkhu sees if only to some extent and for part of the time that beings are overcome by the poisons of the three roots of unskill and that these blind them and make them the prey of all the worldly conditions which they experienceAnd so they go pulled this way and that by the results of their own actions leaping from birth to birthHe knows that beings do not always spiritually evolve but that devolution is always possible  into states where darkness is complete the black night of ignorance where the lamp of the Dhamma is no longer discernibleWhy wander blindly in this round of woes thinks our bhikkhuWhy wander on and on to such states as will be difficult to escape fromPerhaps he calls to mind a picture painted by a master of old which shows a long long track a winding from the distance into the foreground and from thence out of our kenThis track so tortuous passes through an unbeautiful landscape of shattered spiky rocks smitten stormstruck trees fireblackened grass and earth and here and there lying about are bones  a skull bone here a leg bone thereAlong this dreadful track there comes a man his clothes all in tatters a widebrimmed pilgrims hat upon his head and a staff held skewwise in one handHis face bears all the marks of foolishness from his eyes which are wandering and not fixed upon his way before him to his mouth set in the most imbecile smile imaginableHe has wandered all down that long way grinning foolishly at the bones which would warn him if only he would heed themHe has wandered long infinitely long and he will wander longer  uncomprehendingHe sees no other way to go but the dreary track in front of himOur bhikkhu is one who is determined no longer to wander aimlessly but to be one who marches along the high road to freedom that glorious blissbestowing Way the Noble Eightfold PathA good deal has already been written upon companionship while leading the holy life and this need not be repeatedThe point that is really important is whether one makes progress best in the Dhammacompany of others or whether ones mentality and progress are sufficiently strong and mature to fare lonely as rhinocerosOne who has the company of others has many chances to learn from themNot only from his teacher but from other bhikkhus and not only from them from nains in fact from everyone with whom he has contactEvery person is ones teacher if only there is the facility and humility to learn from them and in all situationsFrom the wise our thudong bhikkhu upon his Dhammapilgrimage learns wisdomBut also from those lacking in good qualities he learns how not to behave he learns through their mistakes and reflects upon himself Now is this unskillful way of speech or bodily action to be found in me or notHe also learns more humility from this mindfulness of others action for while perceiving some fault of others he does not make this an opportunity for the arising of prideWhen noting greed in someone else besides the above reflection upon his own behavior perhaps he can add the thought But he has a very strong devotion In other words he learns through his contact with fellow Dhammafarers to see their good qualities also and to strive to bring those excellencies to perfection in his own personalityThrough the effort that he makes we should note certain qualities which being present to the extent that his training has been successful mark him out as one who has indeed taken the following to heartGood is restraint in action good is restraint in speech good is restraint in thought restraint everywhere is goodThe bhikkhu restrained in every way is freed from all sufferingWe should notice that all his actions were marked by this moderationIf we saw him in company he would be one who laughed but little for he will have to some extent perceived the truth in the followingBut we should not from this gain the impression of a gloomy saintliness or that his face would be forbiddingly harsh for our bhikkhu has made lovingkindness and compassion grow and will upon occasion smile gentlyLikewise his speech is marked by a softness of expression and lack of rough wordsHe would be inclined to speak to others upon the Dhamma and be little attracted to other subjects except where they touched upon what for him is allimportant the Way to EnlightenmentBesides contact with teachers and other bhikkhus he may have a nain as his companion or perhaps a boy who wishes to train for ordination laterIf a suitable boy can be found and is given the goingforth to become nain then he will be of great help to the thudong bhikkhuSuitable here means that he feels a genuine urge to live not only the holy life but also to live it in the sort of places where thudong bhikkhus livehe must also be devoted to the bhikkhu with whom he lives looking upon him as his teacherSuitability includes as well the ability of the nain or boy to practice meditation for living in the wilds with few or no books and out of range of the sensedistractions of the towns such boys must be able to employ themselves through at least part of the day without disturbing the bhikkhusThere are in Buddhist countries particularly numbers of boys who one supposes have practiced meditation in past lives and who take to it in this one as ducklings to waterThe nain or boy helps in so many ways that it would not be possible to list them allHe is eversolicitous for the wellbeing of bhikkhus and never loses an opportunity for doing them some serviceIn particular this applies to the teacher of the nain and to any other bhikkhus whom he particularly respects  for their wisdom patience gentleness learning energetic striving or whichever other fine qualities are manifest in themIn the training of the nain helpfulness towards others and humility to learn from them are prime qualitiesWhenever our thudong bhikkhu finds the occasion proper to instruct or correct he will find if he has a really good nain that he will listen with ears open wide to the former while accepting the correction humbly and with a good heartIt does happen even with the best of nains that he will make some mistake particularly regarding carelessnessThen the bhikkhu will quietly admonish the nain and perhaps prescribe some punishmentwork for him to do  and the nain gently smiling accepts his work which is often sweeping and sets about it with a right good willSuch a novice keen for the training is positively avid for Dhamma and listens particularly to stories with great attentionAs there is no lack in Buddhist literature of stories to illustrate points of training nains soon come to have a fund of such material both of the Buddhatime and from later Buddhist historyThus begins the Dhammaeducation of what will probably be a good thudong bhikkhuWhat then of one who chooses to live aloneTwo points stand out Positively his character must be deep and resourceful enough to surmount all the obstacles he may encounter while on the negative side his defilements must be sufficiently held in check by his culture of mindfulness and meditationIt is no good living in the wilds boorishly unrestrained as in the case of venerable GulissaniOn the contrary our bhikkhu knows that the greatest restraint is needed as there is no longer any companion to upbraid or advise him whenever this is necessaryHe has then to be his own instructor and this is plainly impossible unless such excellent qualities as mindfulness shame and fear of blame are welldevelopedOur bhikkhu who wishes to taste solitude must also be sure that he does so for the right reasonsThere are those people who like to live by themselves simply because they cannot bear their fellowmenTheir solitary life is thus based upon the root of hatredFar different must be the thudong bhikkhus reason for desiring lonelinessHe wishes to course deep in the Dhamma and have no drags no ties whatever which might prevent his increasing perception of its truthHis whole life revolves around the Dhamma and he has or wishes to develop the central thought of Dhamma that is of the Three Signata of ExistenceTo do this his emotional nature must be mature and this in Buddhist practice means the development of the Divine Abidings each one of which replaces a certain aspect of emotional instabilityThus hatred is replaced by lovingkindness indifference to others sufferings is remedied by compassion envy by sympathetic joy with others happiness while involvement with and attachment to others is in maturity replaced by equanimityEven if our bhikkhu cannot yet reach to the heights of equanimity at least his gentleness and compassion must have grown to some degreeHe has almost placed himself outside the world of men and he is sure therefore to have greater contact with animals than do most men and he may especially if in him purification is well advanced have visions of the godsMany are the stories of old told about both sorts of contactFrom the context of stories in which the gods appear to bhikkhus it is apparent that they do so because the latters spiritual development has approached or surpassed that of those godsIt is these Divine Abidings which make possible this meeting of worldsStories of extraordinary affection between thudong bhikkhus and animals are also frequentIn this country at the end of the Ayuthia period there were numbers of forestdwelling bhikkhus who like the sages of old would dwell hermitlike surrounded by animals and birdsDeer in particular came to love the companionship of these hermits who could only attract animals thus because of the lovingkindness which they had made grow in their hearts and the consequent absence of hatred and fearTwo other qualities are necessary for the solitary dweller patience and energyHe will hardly be a thudong bhikkhu at all if he has not the formerLivingconditions for him are many and not all of them are perfect all the timeAlthough he has backed out of the rough waters of attachments to persons places and things he still lives in this world imperfect and must patiently cope with whatever trials he encountersWith patience he trains his mind so difficult to bring under control and with patience he notes the gradual relaxation of the defilementsHe comes to know that his Dispensation is as Lord Buddha instructedHe has patience in seeing that his efforts are gradually rewardedEfforts means energy rather necessary for many aspects of strenuous thudong life as our bhikkhu knowsIf he did not make any effort in his chosen way of life then a speedy decline would follow in which the defilements for the weakening and ultimate breaking of which he was leading this life would reassert themselves and once more close their stranglehold upon himThe thudong bhikkhu makes efforts too to maintain his observance of the Vinaya and in particular of the Fundamental Precepts pure and unbrokenEven more diligent must be the observance of the solitary bhikkhu who can ill afford to let slide any of the preceptsIf he does so he will find that his meditation is disturbed by thoughts of the broken precepts and to mend matters he must go and obtain purification of his fault through confession of it to another bhikkhuHe has to stir up energy to maintain and develop further his meditative practiceWithout effort instead of going from strength to strength in meditative calm and insight he would be liable to slip backwards practicing less and less every dayWith patience to hold in check agitation and energy to ensure that slothfulness does not lay on its benumbing touch our solitary thudong bhikkhu has a good chance of making balanced progress along the wayPali Scriptures mention another kind of solitariness and after his practice of bodily seclusion together with the mental withdrawal experienced in deep meditation he may come to possess this lasting solitudeThe man with craving present is said to be accompanied by a second one whereas one in whom craving is absent having been totally eradicated through insight is an arahant who abides in the ultimate solitude from all substrates producing continued existenceOur thudong bhikkhu strives to use his solitude in forest or cave in order to be rid of his companion in all samsaric wandering  craving and being without this second one to know the true solitude of DhammatruthWhen he has achieved this then indeed he may abide anywhere and whether forest or city it will make no difference to himThis was the pattern in Lord Buddhas life first the long meditative seclusion followed by his carrying of the torch of Enlightenment for all to seeSometimes in those long years of teaching the Enlightened One would betake himself to the forests for a timeThen he would return to the viharas quite near to the important towns of those days or wander among the villages meeting kings and outcastes priests and princes and discoursing to all without exception for the potential of Enlightenment lay within all men having no regard whether he was estranged from society and labelled an outcaste or esteemed by people as a priest of pure lineageThus in following the thudong life our bhikkhu is making his efforts however small to follow in the Way his Master trodTo him the life of the Enlightened One is not something remote for it is illuminated to some extent by his own experience and is always a great source of precious inspiration and guidanceIt shows him what can be achieved and gives him the courage to face all dangers and go forth to make the attempt for this highest achievementAs Lord Buddha assures all peopleAs much as can easily be written of the thudong bhikkhus life is contained in these sketchesJust as the flavor of soup is not to be told even in one thousand pages so the real flavor of this Ancient Way cannot be conveyed by wordsSoup is to be tasted the thudong life is to be livedIf it sounds hard one must remember that its rewards are great and in the field of Dhammaendeavor nothing is gained without effortThe world wants everything quickandeasy but the fruits of the holy life are thus only for those who have already put forth their energy already striven hard for the goalTruly Lord Buddha promises in the Discourse on Mindfulness that the noble attainment of the arahant may be experienced within seven daysThere is also the phrase found Instructed in the morning he attains in the evening Such promise and statements depend upon individual capacities and whether the practice of mindfulness is strong and complete enough and moreover they only apply providing that there is the ability to renounce this world completelyNibbana the supreme goal is not to be got at while anything even the most subtle dhamma is still clung toBehold says the Exalted OneThe thudong bhikkhu makes efforts to be among the wise who have cast aside all embroilments with things people and the three periods of timeHe has few things among which he can flounder and he tries vigorously to cut off all that might tie him to peopleHe strives also to win for his own his Masters realization regarding the three timesAll bonds however arising he tries to shatterHe is inspired by the Enlightened Ones exhortations that a mortal disease requires a drastic remedyhe has gone forth from home and family from all the dear decorations of life to don the ancient yellow robe of patches to have little and want less to pursue the sublime Way shown by the Buddha with every energy he possessesWhile unenlightened he wants only one thing  EnlightenmentWhen he wishes to take the step of Goingforth he thrice utters these words Give leave Venerable Sir and having given me these robes out of compassion let me go forth for the extinction of suffering and the realization of NibbanaIf he is serious in his quest he tries even amid lifes diffusion not to forget these words not to forget the reason why he is wearing the three robesThey are a great reminder that Enlightenment is his aim and that the wellbeing of others is best upheld by penetration of Enlightenment by oneselfThis thudong way although it seems to be devoted only to the good of the bhikkhu undertaking it actually stands at the beginning of his progress along the wayLord Buddha emphasized Who stuck in the mud can pull out another stuck in the mud Later when some mastery is gained in the Dhamma then is the time to aid others and only then can one actually help them effectivelyIt is this straightforward attitude to the Dhamma among members of the Sangha and devoted laypeople which has been responsible for the spread of the Dhamma in Eastern Asia from Sri Lanka to Siberia from Afghanistan to JapanAnd to spread the Dhamma outwardly it must first be spread inwardly in ones own heartThe Sangha unencumbered by worldly lumber has just this workIt is the Sangha in fact which has everywhere in the past been the backbone of the Buddhist religionIt is the mainstay of knowledge of the Dhamma and it is the spearhead of applying that Dhamma to the living of the holy lifeEfforts made to spread Buddhism in the present must therefore take account of these two factors the necessity of having those who have experienced Dhamma for themselves as guides as meditation masters also the importance of the Third Jewel the Sangha which must be made to grow strongly since it provides the opportunity for devoted effort to win the Dhamma and the subsequent teaching of others which may followSuch effort is made particularly by the thudong bhikkhu as we have tried to showThis is not to say that others having practices different from those outlined here do not make efforts toward EnlightenmentOf course they do but here we have only been concerned with this particular aspect of bhikkhu lifeStill from the high esteem in which the genuine thudong bhikkhu has always been held in Buddhist lands and the fact that his life most nearly approaches that of the original Sangha it would not seem a mistake to regard the thudong way as being first among other modes of bhikkhu lifeAmong the bhikkhus it is those who have realized for themselves the truth of the Dhamma and who are therefore qualified to teach others it is they who are the electOf course they do no write books and are often difficult to find but certainly they are the heartwoodWhere they are to be found in whatever Buddhist land or anywhere else there the Buddhadhamma truly lives for the light of that Dhamma burns brightly in their heartsWherever they are there Dhamma not only lives but can also growFor the Dhamma does not grow by the numbers of its adherents according to governments statistics nor by the number of its temples not yet even by the quantities of yellow robes worn no it grows heartwise from teacher to pupil through the formers instructions and the latters applicationThe thudong life is one way to this growthThe Dhamma is not secret for it is open to all who have ears to hear and the Sangha exists for all those who would devote their lives to DhammaThe Way is there the Way is always there  but who will tread it Venerable Nagasenas reply to King Menander in Milindas Questions  p translated by IBHornerThere follows a translation which is based on the Pali text Woodwards translation in Gradual Sayings II and the Thai translation of the Anguttara NikayaIn this retranslation great help has been given by VenNagasena Bhikkhu of Wat Benchamabopitr in BangkokThis sutta which we call the Discourse on the Noble Lineages has a very celebrated historyIt will be immediately obvious that its content is an inspiration for the thudong bhikkhu and for those who are neither thudong nor bhikkhu it has as its message that of contentment with a sufficiency of this worlds goods while warning any who cultivate this attitude to guard against pride arisingThe Commentary states that under the first three of the Noble Lineages all of the Vinaya Collection may be expoundedUnder the fourth heading which concerns mental development by way of meditation and the subsequently arising desire to relinquish all states connected with the unskillful factors under this Lineage may be explained all the Discourses and Buddhist psychologyThat such expositions actually took place is attested by many references in the history of CeylonIt seems that such was the fame of this Discourse that thousands would flock from near and far to hear skilled bhikkhus expound itAs the reader will see it is a short sutta but evidently during its preaching practically all topics in the vast range of the Pali canon could be brought under the headings which it givesSuch preaching sometimes continued for many days and was a popular subject for exposition during the rains retreatSome traces of this tradition are still to be found in Sri LankaLong before the days of the Commentaries there is another possible reference to this suttaIt occurs in the list of seven Dhamma passages recommended for study by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis upasakas and upasikas by the Emperor Asoka in his Bhabru EdictThere it is called the Aliyavasani which many scholars equate with the Ariyavamsa SuttaThat the great Emperor should have singled out this text for the study of those who follow the Buddha Way is indeed fitting and it is as appropriate for their study now as it was over two thousand years agoIn Thailand at the present time it is one of a selection of Discourses and other chants which come up regularly each month for chanting in temples after the evening pujaNeedless to say it is highly esteemed by thudong bhikkhus many of whom know it by heartIn the translation following passages in brackets are explanations drawn from the Commentary or from the Thai translation which somewhat enlarges upon the Pali textIt is hoped that this most ancient teaching upon the thudong life will be of some interest after the preceding account of the Noble Lineages in the present timeThus have I heard At one time the Lord was dwelling near Savatthi at the Jeta Wood in Anathapindikas ParkThen the Lord addressed the bhikkhus saying O bhikkhusYes Lord responded those bhikkhusThen the Lord said Here O bhikkhus are these Four Lineages of the Noble Ones  foremost days of old

gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say as far as the last flight of stairs so too good Gotama for these brahmans there can be seen a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say in the study so too good Gotama for these archers there can be seen a gradual practice that is to say in archery so too good Gotama for us whose livelihood is calculation there can be seen a gradual training a gradual practice that is to say in accountancyFor when we get a pupil good Gotama we first of all make him calculate One one two twos three threes four fours five fives six sixes seven sevens eight eights nine nines ten tens and we good Gotama also make him calculate a hundredIs it not possible good Gotama to lay down a similar gradual training gradual doing gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and disciplineIt is possible brahman to lay down a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline Brahman even a skilled trainer of horses having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred first of all gets it used to the training in respect of wearing the bitThen he gets it used to further training  even so brahman the Tathagata having taken on a man to be tamed first of all disciplines him thusCome you monk be of moral habit live controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them train yourself in the rules of training As soon brahman as the monk is of moral habit controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training the Tathagata disciplines him further sayingCome you monk be guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans having seen a material shape with the eye do not be entranced with the general appearance do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow inSo fare along controlling it guard the organ of sight achieve control over the organ of sightHaving heard a sound with the ear Having smelt a smell with the nose Having savored a taste with the tongue Having felt a touch with the body Having cognized a mental state with the mind do not be entranced with the detailFor if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow inSo fare along controlling it guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of mindAs soon brahman as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be moderate in eating you should take food reflecting carefully not for fun or indulgence or personal charm or beautification but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it going for keeping it unharmed for furthering the Brahmafaring with the thought Thus will I crush out an old feeling and I will not allow a new feeling to arise and then there will be for me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in comfortAs soon brahman as a monk is moderate in eating the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk dwell intent on vigilance during the day while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states during the middle watch of the night lie down on the right side in the lion posture foot resting on foot mindful clearly conscious reflecting on the thought of getting up again during the last watch of the night when you have arisen while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental statesAs soon brahman as a monk is intent on vigilance the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or departing acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking round acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the outer cloak the bowl or robe acting with clear consciousness whether you are eating drinking munching savoring acting with clear consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature acting with clear consciousness whether you are walking standing sitting asleep awake talking or being silentAs soon brahman as he is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a glen a hill cave a cemetery a woodland grove in the open or on a heap of straw On returning from almsgathering after the meal the monk sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of himHe getting rid of covetousness for the world dwells with a mind devoid of covetousness he cleanses the mind of covetousnessGetting rid of the taint of illwill he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate and merciful towards all creatures and beings he cleanses the mind of illwillGetting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells without sloth or torpor perceiving the light mindful and clearly conscious he cleanses the mind of sloth and torporGetting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind inward tranquil he cleanses the mind of restlessness and worryGetting rid of doubt he dwells doubtcrossed unperplexed as to the states that are skilled he cleanses his mind of doubtHe by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and deleterious to intuitive wisdom aloof from pleasures of the senses aloof from unskilled states of mind enters and abides in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought is born of aloofness and is rapturous and joyfulBy allaying initial thought and discursive thought his mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point he enters and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyfulBy the fading out of rapture he dwells with equanimity attentive and clearly conscious and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful and he enters and abides in the third meditationBy getting rid of anguish by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulnessBrahman such is my instruction for those monks who are learners who perfection being not yet attained dwell longing for the incomparable security from the bondsBut as for those monks who are perfected ones the cankers destroyed who have lived the life done what was to be done shed the burden attained to their own goal the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed and who are freed by perfect profound knowledge  these things conduce both to their abiding in ease here and now as well as to their mindfulness and clear consciousnessWhen this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the LordNow on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama do all the good Gotamas disciples attain the unchanging goal  nibbana or do some not attain itSome of my disciples brahman on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain itWhat is the cause good Gotama what the reason that since nibbana does exist since the way leading to nibbana exists since the good Gotama exists as adviser some of the good Gotamas disciples on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama attain the unchanging goal  nibbana but some do not attain itWell then brahman I will question you on this point in replyAs it is pleasing to you so you may answer meWhat do you think about this brahmanAre you skilled in the way leading to RajagahaYes sir skilled am I in the way leading to RajagahaWhat do you think about thisA man might come along here wanting to go to RajagahaHaving approached you he might speak thus I want to go to Rajagaha sir show me the way to this Rajagaha You might speak thus to him Yes my good man this road goes to Rajagaha go along it for a whileWhen you have gone along it for a while you will see a village go along for a while when you have gone along for a while you will see a market town go for a whileWhen you have gone along for a while you will see Rajagaha with its delightful parks delightful forests delightful fields delightful pondsBut although he has been exhorted and instructed thus by you he might take the wrong road and go westwardsThen a second man might come along wanting to go to Rajagaha you will see Rajagaha with its delightful ponds Exhorted and instructed thus by you he might get to Rajagaha safelyWhat is the cause brahman what the reason that since Rajagaha does exist since the way leading to Rajagaha exists since you exist as adviser the one man although being exhorted and instructed thus by you may take the wrong road and go westwards while the other may get to Rajagaha safelyWhat can I good Gotama do in this matterA shower of the way good Gotama am IEven so brahman nibbana does exist the way leading to nibbana exists and I exist as adviserBut some of my disciples on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain itWhat can I brahman do in this matterA shower of the way brahman is a TathagataWhen this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the LordGood Gotama as for those persons who in want of a way of living having gone forth from home into homelessness without faith who are crafty fraudulent deceitful who are unbalanced and puffed up who are shifty scurrilous and of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are not guarded who do not know moderation in eating who are not intent on vigilance indifferent to recluseship not of keen respect for the training who are ones for abundance lax taking the lead in backsliding shirking the burden of seclusion who are indolent of feeble energy of confused mindfulness not clearly conscious not concentrated but of wandering minds who are weak in wisdom drivelers  the good Gotama is not in communion with themBut as for those young men of respectable families who have gone forth from home into homelessness from faith who are not crafty fraudulent or deceitful who are not unbalanced or puffed up who are not shifty scurrilous or of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are guarded who know moderation in eating who are intent on vigilance longing for recluseship of keen respect for the training who are not ones for abundance not lax shirking backsliding taking the lead in seclusion who are of stirred up energy selfresolute with mindfulness aroused clearly conscious concentrated their minds onepointed who have wisdom are not drivelers  the good Gotama is in communion with themAs good Gotama black gum is pointed to as chief of rootscents as red sandalwood is pointed to as chief of the pithscents as jasmine is pointed to as chief of the flower scents  even so is the exhortation of the good Gotama highest among the teachings of todayExcellent good Gotama excellent good GotamaAs good Gotama one might set upright what had been upset or disclose what had been covered or show the way to one who had gone astray or bring an oillamp into the darkness so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so in many a figure is dhamma made clear by the good GotamaI am going to the revered Gotama for refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks May the good Gotama accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from today forth for as long as life lastsI shall fasten you mind like an elephant at a small gateI shall not incite you to evil you net of sensual pleasure bodybornWhen fastened you will not go like an elephant not finding the gate openWitchmind you will not wander again and again using force delighting in evilAs the strong hookholder makes an untamed elephant newly taken turn against its will so shall I make you turnAs the excellent charioteer skilled in the taming of excellent horses tames a thoroughbred so shall I standing firm in the five powers tame youI shall bind you with mindfulness with purified self shall cleanseRestrained by the yoke of energy you will not go far from here mind Theragatha vv Vijitasenas verses Translated KRNorman The Elders Verses I PTSThus have I heard At one time the Lord was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels feeding placeNow at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in the Forest HutThen prince Jayasena who was always pacing up and down always roaming about on foot approached the novice Aciravata having approached he exchanged greetings with the novice Aciravata having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy he sat down at a respectful distanceWhile he was sitting down at a respectful distance Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the novice AciravataI have heard good Aggivessana that if a monk is abiding here diligent ardent selfresolute he may attain onepointedness of mindThat is so prince that is so princeA monk abiding here diligent ardent selfresolute may attain onepointedness of mindIt were good if the reverend Aggivessana were to teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered itI prince am not able to teach you dhamma as I have heard it as I have mastered itNow if I were to teach you dhamma as I have heard it as I have mastered it and if you could not understand the meaning of what I said that would be weariness to me that would be a vexation to meLet the reverend Aggivessana teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered itPerhaps I could understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana saysIf I were to teach you dhamma prince as I have heard it as I have mastered it and if you were to understand the meaning of what I say that would be good if you should not understand the meaning of what I say you must remain as you are you must not question me further on the matterLet the reverend Aggivessana teach me dhamma as he has heard it as he has mastered itIf I understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana says that will be good if I do not understand the meaning of what the good Aggivessana says I will remain as I am I will not question the reverend Aggivessana further on this matterThen the novice Aciravata taught dhamma to Prince Jayasena as he had heard it as he had mastered itWhen this had been said Prince Jayasena spoke thus to the novice AciravataThis is impossible good Aggivessana it cannot come to pass that a monk abiding diligent ardent selfresolute should attain onepointedness of mind Then Prince Jayasena having declared to the novice Aciravata that this was impossible and could not come to pass rising from his seat departedAnd soon after Prince Jayasena had departed the novice Aciravata approached the Lord having approached and greeted the Lord he sat down at a respectful distanceAs he was sitting down at a respectful distance the novice Aciravata told the Lord the whole of the conversation he had with Prince Jayasena as far as it had goneWhen this had been said the Lord spoke thus to the novice AciravataWhat is the good of that AggivessanaThat Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures enjoying sensepleasures being consumed by thoughts of sensepleasures burning with the fever of sensepleasures eager in the search for sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known by renunciation seen by renunciation attained by renunciation realized by renunciation  such a situation does not existIt is as if Aggivessana among elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed two elephants two horses or two oxen are well tamed well trained and two are not tamed not trainedWhat do you think about this AggivessanaWould these two elephants or horses or oxen that were to be tamed and that were well tamed well trained  would these on being tamed reach tamed capacity would they being tamed attain a tamed stageYes revered sirBut those two elephants or horses or oxen that were to be tamed but that were neither tamed nor trained  would these not being tamed attain a tamed stage as do the two elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed that were well tamed well trainedNo revered sirEven so Aggivessana that Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known and realized by renunciation  such a situation does not existIt is as if Aggivessana there were a great mountain slope near a village or a markettown which two friends coming hand in hand from that village or markettown might approach having approached the mountain slope one friend might remain at the foot while the other might climb to the topThen the friend standing at the foot of the mountain slope might speak thus to the one standing on the top My dear what do you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope He might reply As I stand on the top of the mountain slope I my dear see delightful parks delightful woods delightful stretches of level ground delightful ponds But the other might speak thus This is impossible it cannot come to pass my dear that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful ponds Then the friend who had been standing on top of the mountain slope having come down to the foot and taken his friend by the arm making him climb to the top of the mountain slope and giving him a moment in which to regain his breath might speak to him thus Now my dear what is it that you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope He might speak thus I my dear as I stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds He might speak thus Just now my dear we understood you to say This is impossible it cannot come to pass that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful pondsBut now we understand you to say I my dear as I stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds He might speak thus That was because I my dear hemmed in by this great mountain slope could not see what was to be seenEven so but to a still greater degree Aggivessana is Prince Jayasena hemmed in blocked obstructed enveloped by this mass of ignoranceIndeed that Prince Jayasena living as he does in the midst of sensepleasures enjoying sensepleasures being consumed by thoughts of sensepleasures eager in the search for sensepleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known seen attained realized by renunciation  such a situation does not existHad these two similes occurred to you Aggivessana for Prince Jayasena Prince Jayasena naturally would have acted in the manner of one having trust in youBut how could these two similes for Prince Jayasena have occurred to me revered sir seeing that they are spontaneous that is to say to the Lord and have never been heard beforeAs Aggivessana a noble anointed king addresses an elephant hunter saying You good elephant hunter mount the kings elephant and go into an elephant forestWhen you see a forest elephant tie him to the neck of the kings elephant And Aggivessana the elephant hunter having answered Yes sire in assent to the noble anointed king mounts the kings elephant and goes into an elephant forestSeeing a forest elephant he ties him to the neck of the kings elephantSo the kings elephant brings him out into the openBut Aggivessana the forest elephant has this longing that is to say for the elephant forestBut in regard to him the elephant hunter tells the noble anointed king that the forest elephant has got out into the openThe noble anointed king then addresses an elephant tamer saying Come you good elephant tamer tame the forest elephant by subduing his forest ways by subduing his forest memories and aspirations and by subduing his distress his fretting and fever for the forest by making him pleased with the villages and by accustoming him to human waysAnd Aggivessana the elephant tamer having answered Yes sire in assent to the noble anointed king driving a great post into the ground ties the forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways and accustom him to human waysThen the elephant tamer addresses him with such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear affectionate going to the heart urbane pleasant to the manyfolk liked by the manyfolkAnd Aggivessana the forest elephant on being addressed with words that are gentle liked by the manyfolk listens lends ear and bends his mind to learningNext the elephant tamer supplies him with grassfodder and waterWhen Aggivessana the forest elephant has accepted the grassfodder and water from the elephant tamer it occurs to the elephant tamer The kings elephant will now live Then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying Take up put down When Aggivessana the kings elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to take up and put down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying Get up sit down When Aggivessana the kings elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to get up and sit down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task known as standing your ground he ties a shield to the great beasts trunk a man holding a lance is sitting on his neck and men holding lances are standing surrounding him on all sides and the elephant tamer holding a lance with a long shaft is standing in frontWhile he is doing the task of standing your ground he does not move a foreleg nor does he move a hindleg nor does he move the forepart of his body nor does he move the hindpart of his body nor does he move his head nor does he move an ear nor does he move a tusk nor does he move his tail nor does he move his trunkA kings elephant is one who endures blows of sword axe arrow hatchet and the resounding din of drum and kettledrum conch and tamtam he is purified gold purged of all its dross and impurities fit for a king a royal possession and reckoned as a kingly attributeEven so Aggivessana does a Tathagata arise here in the world a perfected one fully SelfAwakened One endowed with right knowledge and conduct wellfarer knower of the worlds the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed the Awakened One the LordHe makes known this world with the devas with Mara with Brahma the creation with its recluses and brahmans its devas and men having realized them by his own superknowledgeHe teaches dhamma which is lovely at the beginning lovely in the middle lovely at the ending with the spirit and the letters he proclaims the Brahmafaring wholly fulfilled quite purifiedA householder or a householders son or one born in another family hears that dhammaHaving heard that dhamma he gains faith in the TathagataEndowed with this faith that he has acquired he reflects in this way The household life is confined and dusty going forth is in the open it is not easy for one who lives in a house to fare the Brahmafaring wholly fulfilled wholly pure polished like a conchshellSuppose now that I having cut off hair and beard having put on saffron robes should go forth from home into homelessness After a time getting rid of his wealth be it small or great getting rid of his circle of relations be it small or great having cut off his hair and beard having put on saffron robes he goes forth from home into homelessnessTo this extent Aggivessana the ariyan disciple gets out into the openBut Aggivessana devas and mankind have this longing that is to say for the five strands of sensepleasuresThe Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be moral live controlled by the control of the Obligations possessed of behavior and posture seeing danger in the slightest faults undertaking them train yourself in the rules of trainingAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moral lives controlled by the control undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be guarded as to the doors of the senseorgansHaving seen a material shape with the eyeHaving cognized a mental state with the mind be not entranced by the general appearance be not entranced by the detailFor if you dwell with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind might flow inSo fare along with its control guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of the mindAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be moderate in eating abiding in comfortWhen Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moderate in eating the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk abide intent on vigilance you should cleanse the mind of obstructive mental statesAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is intent on vigilance then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousnessBe one who acts with clear consciousness talking silentAnd when Aggivessana the ariyan disciple is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness then the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a wilderness in a hillcave a cemetery a forest haunt in the open or on a heap of straw He chooses a remote lodging in the forest or on a heap of strawReturning from almsgathering after the meal he sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of him he by getting rid of coveting for the world dwells with a mind devoid of coveting he purifies the mind of covetingBy getting rid of the taint of illwill he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings he purifies the mind of the taint of illwillBy getting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells devoid of sloth and torpor perceiving the light mindful clearly conscious he purifies the mind of sloth and torporBy getting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind subjectively tranquilized he purifies the mind of restlessness and worryBy getting rid of doubt he dwells doubtcrossed unperplexed as to the states that are skillful he purifies the mind of doubtHe by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly conscious mindful so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the worldHe fares along contemplating the feelings the mind the mental states in mental states ardent clearly conscious mindful so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the worldAs Aggivessana an elephant tamer driving a great post into the ground ties a forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways so as to subdue his forest aspirations and so as to subdue his distress his fretting and fever for the forest so as to make him pleased with villages and accustom him to human ways  even so Aggivessana these four applications of mindfulness are ties of the mind so as to subdue the ways of householders and to subdue the aspirations of householders and to subdue the distress the fretting and fever of householders they are for leading to the right path for realizing nibbanaThe Tathagata then disciplines him further saying Come you monk fare along contemplating the body in the body but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with the body fare along contemplating the feelings in the feelings the mind in the mind mental states in mental states but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with mental statesHe by allaying initial thought and discursive thought with the mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyfulBy the fading out of rapture he dwells with equanimity attentive and clearly conscious and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful and he enters and abides in the third meditationBy getting rid of joy by getting rid of anguish by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulnessThen with the mind composed thus quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge and recollection of former habitation he remembers a variety of former habitations thus one birth two births three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births and many an eon of integration and many an eon of disintegration and many an eon of integrationdisintegration Such a one was I by name having such a clan such and such a color so was I nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life endPassing from this I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name having such and such a clan such and such a color so was I nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life endPassing from this I arose here Thus he remembers divers former habitations in all their modes and detailsThen with the mind composed quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing hence and the arising of beingsWith the purified devavision surpassing that of men he sees beings as they pass hence or come to be he comprehends that beings are mean excellent comely ugly wellgoing illgoing according to the consequence of their deeds the he thinks Indeed these worthy beings who were possessed of wrong conduct in body who were possessed of wrong conduct in speech who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought scoffers at the ariyans holding a wrong view incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a sorrowful state a bad bourn the abyss Niraya hellBut these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body who were possessed of good conduct in speech who were possessed of good conduct in thought who did not scoff at the ariyans holding a right view incurring deeds consequent on a right view  these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a good bourn a heaven worldThen with the mind composed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankersHe understands as it really is This is anguish this is the arising of anguish this is the stopping of anguish this is the course leading to the stopping of anguishHe understands as it really is These are the cankers this is the arising of the cankers this is the stopping of the cankers this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankersKnowing thus seeing thus his mind is freed from the canker of sense pleasures is freed from the canker of becoming freed from the canker of ignoranceIn freedom the knowledge came to be I am freed and he comprehends Destroyed is birth brought to a close is the Brahmafaring done is what was to be done there is no more of being such or suchThat monk is able to endure head cold hunger thirst the touch of mosquitoes gadflies wind sun and creeping things abusive language and unwelcome modes of speech he has grown to bear bodily feelings which as they arise are painful acute sharp severe wretched miserable deadlyPurged of all the dross and impurities of attachment aversion and confusion he is worthy of oblations offerings respect and homage an unsurpassed field of merit in the worldIf Aggivessana a kings elephant dies in old age untamed untrained the kings old elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed And so Aggivessana of a kings elephant that is middleagedAnd too Aggivessana if a kings elephant dies young untamed untrained the kings young elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamedEven so Aggivessana if a monk who is an elder dies with the cankers not destroyed the monk who is an elder that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamedAnd so of a monk of middle standingAnd too Aggivessana if a newly ordained monk dies with the cankers not destroyed the newly ordained monk that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamedIf Aggivessana a kings elephant dies in old age well tamed well trained

trained the kings young elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamedEven so Aggivessana if a monk who is an elder dies with the cankers destroyed the monk who is an elder that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamedAnd so Aggivessana of a monk of middle standingAnd too Aggivessana if a newly ordained monk dies with cankers destroyed the newly ordained monk that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamedThus spoke the LordDelighted the novice Aciravata rejoiced in what the Lord had said Verses of the Nun Dantika Psalms of the Sisters Translated by CAFRhys DavidsMonks these four goodly thoroughbred steeds are found existing in the worldWhat fourIn this case monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which at the very sight of the shadow of the goadstick is stirred feels agitation What task I wonder will the trainer set me todayWhat return can I make him Here monks we may have such a steed and this is the first sort of goodly thoroughbred steed found existing in the worldThen again monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which is not stirred at the mere sight of the goadsticks shadow feels no agitation but when his coat is pricked with the goad he is stirred feels agitation What task I wonder This is the second sortThen again monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which is not stirred at

sortThus monks there four goodly thoroughbred steeds are found existing in the worldJust in the same way monks these four goodly thoroughbred men are found existing in the worldWhat fourIn this case monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred man who hears is said that in such and such a village or township is a woman or man afflicted or deadThereat he is stirred he feels agitationThus agitated he strictly applied himselfThus applied he both realized in his own person the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdomJust as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on seeing

fletcher straightens an arrow so does the wise man straighten his mind which is fickle and unsteady and difficult to guard and difficult to restrainJust as a fish taken out of its watery abode and cast on the land quivers and throbs so does the mindshould the realm of Passions be shunnedIt is good to restrain the mind which is difficult to subdue and is swiftmoving and which seizes whatever it desiresA mind thus tamed brings happinessDifficult to grasp and extremely subtle is the mind seizing on whatever it desires let the wise guard itA guarded mind brings happinessThis mind wanders afar is solitary formless and rests in the caveThose who subdue it are freed from the bonds of MaraHe whose mind is not steadfast and who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers the wisdom of such a man never becomes perfectHe whose mind remains untouched by lust and unaffected by hatred and who has discarded both good and evil for such a vigilant one there is no fearKnowing this body to

Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAfter listening to the Buddhas Discourse called Fear and Dread the Brahman Jaanussoni becomes a lay follower of the Buddha by taking the Threefold RefugeThe words used by him differ slightly from the usual formula in so far as in the latter the words the Lord Gotama are replaced by the Buddha Buddhaghosas comment here slightly abridged runs as followsI go for refuge to the Lord GotamaThis means The Lord Gotama is my refuge and my guiding idealI am going for refuge to the Lord GotamaI resort to him follow and honor him in the sense of his being the Destroyer of Affliction and the Provider of WealOr I know and understand him to be of such a natureThis last explanation is based upon the fact that in the Pali language the verbal roots denoting going may also have the meaning of knowingTherefore the words I go for refuge to the Buddha may also be taken to express the idea I know and understand him to be the refugeI go for refuge to the Dhamma The word dhamma ie the Doctrine or the Law is derived from the verb dhareti to keep or to bearIn accordance with that derivation the Dhamma may be regarded as refuge because it keeps upholds and supports the beings by way of preventing their fall into the states of woe by way of enabling a life according to instruction by way of attainment of the Path and by realization of the extinctionAccordingly the Dhamma is the Noble Path as well as NibbanaBesides it is the attainment of the noble fruitions and also the Dhamma of LearningI go for refuge to the Sangha The Sangha is the community of monks which is united by the communion of right view and virtueThat is to say the Sangha is the group of the eight noble beings the path of streamentry  the fruition thereof etcIn order to gain proficiency with regard to this subject of refuge one should be acquainted with the following method of exposition dealing with  the word sarana  the going for refuge  Who is going for refuge  the divisions  the results  the defilements  the breachThe going for refuge has two main divisions it may be mundane or supramundaneThe supramundane refuge is taken by those who have a vision of the Noble TruthIn the pathmoment the supramundane refuge succeeds in exterminating any blemish that may still attach to the going for refugeIt has Nibbana as its object and in its function it comprises the entire Triple GemThe mundane refuge is taken by worldlingsIt succeeds in effecting a temporary repression of the blemishes attaching to their going for refugeIts objects are the noble qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaIt consists in the acquisition of faith in these three objectsIt is this faith in the Triple Gem that is referred to when among the ten meritorious acts the straightening of views is defined as Right Understanding rooted in faithThis mundane refuge is of four kinds the surrender of self acceptance as ones guiding ideal acceptance of discipleship homage by prostrationThe surrender of self is expressed as followsFrom today onward I surrender myself to the Buddha to the Dhamma to the SanghaAjja aadim katvaa aham attaanam Buddhassa niyyaatemi Dhammassa SanghassatiThis is the giving over of ones self to the Triple GemIt may also be done in this wayTo the Exalted One I am giving my self to the Dhamma I am giving my self to the Sangha I am giving my selfI am giving them my lifeGiven is my self given my lifeUntil my life ends I am taking refuge in the BuddhaThe Buddha is my refuge my shelter and my protectionBhagavato attaanam pariccajaamiDhammassa Sanghassa attaanam pariccajaami jiivitañca pariccajaamiPariccatto yeva me attaa pariccattam yeva me jiivitamJiivita pariyantikam Buddham saranam gacchaamiBuddho me saranam lenam taanantiThe acceptance of the guiding idealFrom today onward the Buddha is my Guiding Ideal the Dhamma and the SanghaThus may you know meAjja aadim katvaa aham Buddhaparaayano Dhammaparaayano SanghaparaayanoIti mam dhaarethaIt is illustrated by the following verse spoken by AlavakaFrom village to village from town to town Ill wend my way lauding the Enlightened One and the perfection of His LawThus the acceptance of the guiding ideal by Alavaka and others has to be understood as equaling their going for refugeThe acceptance of discipleshipFrom today onward I am the Disciple of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThus may you know meAjja aadim katvaa aham Buddhassa antevaasiko Dhamassa SanghassaIti mam dhaarethaThis is illustrated by the following passage expressing Kassapas acceptance of discipleship that has to be understood as equaling his going for refugeFain would I see the Master The Exalted One him I would wish to seeFain would I see the Blessed OneThe Exalted One him would I wish to seeFain would I see the Enlightened OneThe Exalted One him I would wish to seeThen I prostrated myself before the Exalted One and addressed him thus The Exalted One O Lord is my Master and I am his discipleHomage by prostrationFrom today onward I shall give respectful greeting devoted attendance the añjalisalutation and homage only to those three the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThus may you know meAjja aadim katvaa aham abhivaadanapaccutthaanaañjalikammasaamiicikammam Buddhaadiinam yeva tinnam vatthuunam karomiItii mam dhaarethaThis way of going for refuge consists in showing deep humility towards the Buddha Dhamma and the SanghaHomage by prostration may be of four kinds being paid towards relatives out of fear towards ones teacher and towards those deserving highest venerationOnly the latter case  ie the prostration before those worthy of highest veneration  is to be regarded as going for refuge the three other cases do not count as suchOnly if referring to the highest refuge is taken or broken respectivelyTherefore if a member of the Sakya or Koliya clan worships the Buddha thinking He is our relative no refuge is taken in that caseOr one may think The recluse Gotama is honored by kings and has great influenceIf he is not worshipped he might do me harm If thinking thus one worships out of fear no refuge is taken in that caseFurthermore a person remembers to have learned something from the Blessed One while he was a Bodhisatta an aspirant to Buddhahood or after his attaining Buddhahood one has received from the Master advice relating to worldly knowledgeIf for these reasons one regards the Buddha as ones teacher and worships him no refuge is taken in that case tooBut if one pays worship to the Buddha in the conviction This is the most venerable being in the world only by such a one is refuge takenOn the other hand the going for refuge remains unbroken in the following situationsA male or female lay devotee who has taken refuge in the Triple Gem worships a relative thinking He is my kinsman Even if that relative is a recluse of another faith the refuge in the Triple Gem is unbroken still less can it be said to be broken if it is not a recluse or a priestWhen prostrating before a king out of fear If he who is honored by the whole country is not worshipped he will do me harm  in that case too the refuge is unbrokenIf one has learned any science art or craft even from a nonBuddhist and one worships him in his capacity as ones teacher in that case too the refuge remains unbrokenResultsThe fruit of the supramundane refuge in the sense of being its karmic result is the four fruitions of monkhood vizthe fruition of streamentry etcThe fruit in the sense of advantage or blessing is the destruction of suffering further the blessings mentioned in the following scriptural passageIt is impossible O monks that a person endowed with insight should regard any conditioned thing as permanent enjoyable or an ego that he should take the life of his mother his father or a saint that with a thought of hate he should shed the blood of the Blessed One that he should cause a split in the community of monks that he should choose another teacherThere is no possibility of thatBut the fruit of the mundane refuge is only the attainment of favorable rebirth and the attainment of property and enjoymentDefilementsIn three cases the mundane refuge is defiled and without great brightness and radiating influence if connected with ignorance doubt and wrong viewsThe supramundane refuge is free from any defilementsA breach of the mundane refuge might be blameable or blamelessIt is blameable when occurring as a going for refuge by selfsurrender etc to other religious masters in that case the breach will have undesirable resultsThe breach is blameless at the time of death as it will not cause any karmic resultThe supramundane refuge is without breachEven in another existence a holy disciple will not turn to another masterIn all Buddhist lands the followers of the Enlightened One profess their allegiance to him and his liberating doctrine by the ancient simple and yet so touching formula of taking refuge or more literal and more expressive by going for refuge to the Triple GemThe going for refuge as this figurative expression itself suggests should be a conscious act not the mere profession of a theoretical belief still less the habitual rite of traditional pietyThe protecting refuge exists but we have to go to it by our own effortIt will not come to us by itself while we stay putThe Buddha as He repeatedly declared is only the teacher pointing out the WayTherefore the going for refuge expressive of Buddhist faith is in the first place a conscious act of will and determination directed towards the goal of liberationHereby the conception of faith as a mere passive waiting for saving grace is rejectedIn the Commentary translated above there is the remarkable statement that the expression going for refuge is meant to convey in addition the idea of knowing and understanding This points to the second aspect of going for refuge namely as a conscious act of understandingHereby unthinking credulity and blind faith based on external authority are rejectedThe commentator emphasizes this aspect by describing the going for refuge as a state of mind not relying on othersOn many occasions the Master warned his disciples not to accept his teachings out of mere trust in him but only after personal experience practice and reflectionHere it may suffice to remember the famous Sermon to the KalamasDo not go by hearsay nor by tradition nor by peoples tales nor by the authority of ScripturesDo not go by reasoning nor by logic and methodical investigations nor by approval of speculative views nor moved by reverence nor by the thought The Recluse is my teacherIt is a threefold knowledge that is or should be implied in the act of going for refugeIt is a knowledge answering the following questions Is this world of ours really such a place of danger and misery that there is a need for taking refugeDoes such a refuge actually existAnd what is its natureThere are many who do not see any need for a refugeBeing well pleased with themselves and with the petty momentary happiness of their life they are fully convinced that all is well with the world They do not wish or are not able to look beyond their narrow horizonFor them neither the Buddha nor any other great religious teacher has yet appearedBut the majority of men know very well by their own bitter experience the hard and cruel face of the world which is only temporarily hidden by a friendly maskThere are some others who sufficiently aware of a fellow beings actual existence add to that personal experience by observation of other livesAnd there is a still smaller number of people who are able to reflect wisely on both experience and observationParticularly to those latter ones whose eyes are less covered by dust life will appear as a vast ocean of suffering of unfathomable depth on the surface of which beings swim about for a little while or navigate in their fragile nutshells of which they are very proudTrue there are spells of calm on the waters when it is pleasant to float upon a smooth sea or to prove and to enjoy the strength of ones body by a long swimBut those with open eyes and minds are not deceived by these short moments of respite they know the overpowering fierceness of a stormswept sea they know the dangerous currents and whirlpools in it and the demons and monsters of the deepThey know that even under the most favorable conditions the feeble strength of man will soon be exhausted by the impact of lifes elemental forcesThe vicissitudes of life give no chance of maintaining permanently during the unlimited sequence of transformations even the lowest degree of happiness even the lowest standard of moral worthThere is nothing to gain by traversing ever anew the infinite expanse of lifes ocean in any of its regionsThere is only the same senseless repetition of the ups and downs of ebb and tideFaced by the everpresent perils of life and by its essential monotony there will be only the one cry for refuge in a heart and mind that has truly grasped its situation within the worldA refuge is the one great need of all life and going to it the one sane act demanded by that situationBut granting its necessity does a refuge from the worlds ills actually existThe Buddhist affirms it and proves by that affirmation to be anything but a pessimistThe refuge to which he turns his steps is the triad of the Buddha his Doctrine and the Fraternity of holy disciplesBeing what is most precious and most pure it has been called The Triple Gem But the fact that it provides the final refuge and not only a temporary shelter cannot otherwise be proved than through the actual attainment of that refuge by those who are going to itThe Triple Gem has objective existence as an impersonal idea or ideal as long as it is known and cherishedIn so far it is doubtlessly a still persisting and active source of energy for the worldBut it is transformed from an impersonal idea to a personal refuge only to the extent of its being realized in ones own mind and manifested in ones own lifeTherefore the existence of the Triple Gem in its characteristic nature as a refuge cannot be proven to others than those who find this refuge in themselves by their own effortsThe refuge becomes and grows by the process of going to itThe refuge exists for us only in so far as something within ourselves responds and corresponds to itTherefore the Sixth Zen Patriarch saidLet each of us take refuge to the Triple Gems within our mindWith regard to the first refuge in the Buddha the Master himself said shortly after His Enlightenment MN AriyapariyesanasuttaConcerning the second refuge in the Dhamma the Buddha said shortly before his deceaseBe ye islands unto yourselves be ye a refuge unto yourselvesTake no other refugeThe Dhamma be your island the Dhamma be your refuge Take no other refuge DN MahaparinibbanasuttaIn the commentarial literature it is saidThe Dhamma is called self because in the case of a wise one the Dhamma is not different from himself and because it pertains to his personal existence Tika to MahaSatipatthanaSuttaThe third refuge the Sangha being the community of holy disciples is the great and inspiring model for emulationThe actual foundation of that refuge is the capacity inherent in all beings to become one of the eight noble beings who form the Sangha of the refugeWe turn now to the third subject of the knowledge implied in taking refuge ie to the ultimate nature of the threefold refugeWe have seen that the refuge becomes attainable and even perceptible only by way of the living roots by the actual foundations it has within the average mindLike the lotus it arises within the waters of worldly existence there it develops and from there it takes its nourishmentBut what is still immersed in the ocean of worldliness and suffering cannot be the ultimate refuge the place of safety and blissIt must not only assuage but finally transcend the world of danger fear and ill like the lotus that rises above the surface of the water and remains unsullied by itTherefore the consummate refuge meant in the traditional formula is of supramundane nature  lokuttara ie worldtranscendingConsequently the first refuge is not the recluse Gotama but the Buddha as the personification of worldtranscending enlightenmentIn the Vimamsaka Sutta it is said of the Noble Disciple He believes in the Enlightenment of the Exalted OneThe Dhamma of the second refuge is not the faint fragmentary or even distorted picture of the Doctrine as mirrored in the mind of an unliberated worldlingIt is the supramundane Eightfold Path and its consummation in NibbanaThe commentator underlines the supramundane nature of the second refuge by saying that the Dhamma as an object of learning is only in so far included in the refuge as it arises in the Holy Disciple together with the fruition of streamentry etc ie only in so far as it is a formulation of that consummate knowledge acquired on the four stages of sanctityThe Sangha of the third refuge is not the allinclusive congregation of monks having all the weaknesses of its single members and sharing in the shortcomings attaching to any human institutionIt is rather the fraternity of holy disciples not necessarily monks who are united by the invisible tie of common attainment to the four stages of sanctityIn other words it is likewise of supramundane natureIt is the assurance of possible progress to the worldtranscending heights of a mind made holy and pureBy this threefold knowledge about the need existence and nature of the refuge the Going to that refuge becomes a conscious act of understandingThis knowledge and understanding forms the firm basis of the third the emotional aspect of taking refuge having as it were three facets confidence devotion and loveThe knowledge of the existence of a refuge provides the basis for a firm and justified confidence for the calmness of inner assurance and the strength of convictionThe knowledge of the need for a refuge instills unswerving devotion to it and the understanding of its sublime nature fills the heart with love towards the highest that can be conceivedConfidence is the firmness in faith devotion is the patient endurance in loyal service and effort and love adds the element of ardor warmth and joyIn the sense of these three constituents the going for refuge is also a conscious act of wise faithWe may now define the going for refuge as a conscious act of will directed towards liberation based upon knowledge and inspired by faith or briefly a conscious act of determination understanding and devotionThese three aspects of taking refuge have their counterparts in the volitional rational and emotional sides of the human mindTherefore for a harmonious development of character the cultivation of all three is requiredWill understanding and faith support each other in their common task will transformed into purposive action frees faith from the barrenness and dangers of emotional selfindulgence it prevents intellectual understanding from stopping short at mere theoretical appreciationWill harnesses the energies of both emotion and intellect to actual applicationUnderstanding gives direction and method to will it provides a check to the exuberance of faith and gives to it its true contentsFaith keeps will from slackening and is the vitalizing and purposive factor in intellectual understandingThe presence of these three aspects is the distinguishing feature of true Buddhist faithIn the conception of faith as found in all other world religions only the emotional aspect is stressedThe two other aspects will and understanding are absent or in an undeveloped state being impeded by the dictates of the creedThe element of selfresponsible will is supplanted by the postulate of obedience by authoritarian guidance and by submission to the will of a GodUnderstanding is replaced by dogmatic belief demanding or implying a sacrifice of intellectAgainst such a onesided emphasis on emotional faith Buddhism moves from the very beginning of its spiritual training towards wholeness and completeness ie towards a harmonious development of mental facultiesTherefore the act of going for refuge in its true sense is accomplished only if there is connected with it at least a minimal degree of purposeful will and genuine understandingOnly in that case faith will have the quality of a seed attributed to it by the Buddha ie of a seed productive of further growthThe element of will in that seed of faith will grow until maturing into the irrepressible desire for liberation which is one of the advanced stages of InsightThe element of initial understanding in true faith will grow into penetrative wisdom that will finally transform the assurance of faith into the inner certitude conferred by realizationTaking refuge by way of thoughtless recital of the formula is a degradation of that venerable ancient practiceIt deprives it of its true significance and of its efficacyGoing for refuge should be the expression of a genuine inner urge in the same way as in ordinary life one may be urged by the awareness of a great danger to seek without delay the refuge of a place of safetyWhen taking refuge one should always keep in mind the implications of this act as outlined aboveThis will be at the same time a beneficial training in right mindfulnessOne should always ask oneself how the presently undertaken act of going for refuge could be translated into terms of will and understandingSeeing that the house of our life is ablaze it will not do merely to worship the safety and freedom that beckons outside without making an actual move to reach itThe first step in that direction of safety and freedom is taking refuge in the right way ie as a conscious act of determination understanding and devotionIn the commentarial passage translated above a precious document of ancient Buddhist practice is preserved showing the thoughtful and discriminating way in which the devotees of old took refuge in the Triple GemFour different formulas are mentioned given in what seems to be a descending order beginning from the highest form the complete selfsurrender and ending with the lowest the homage by prostrationIt is greatly to be regretted that the information we can derive from the commentarial passage in which these formulas are embedded is rather scantyMany questions that come to mind are left unanswered as for instance Have these four formulas been used instead of the traditional one or in addition to itBy whom and on which occasions have the three lower kinds been usedHave they been administered to the devotees in a similar fashion as it is done today in the case of the traditional formulaThose three lower kinds namely have in common the last sentence being a call to witness Thus may you know meDoes the plural form used in the Pali sentence refer to an assembly of devotees that witnessed the act or what seems to be more probable was it merely a respectful way of addressing the spiritual teacher or the monk who may have administered that special formula of refuge perhaps as a kind of initiationIn any case the concluding call to witness gives to those utterances a strong emphasis and the solemnity of a vow distinguishing it from the general formula of refugeThe commencing words too are stressing that character of a definite and personal dedication as distinguished from an impersonal ritualThey mark the day of the first utterance as initiating a new period in the life of the devoteeBoth the beginning and the end of these three modes of refuge are an echo of the earliest formulas of conversion reported in the Suttas I take refuge in the Lord Gotama the doctrine and the community of monksMay the Lord Gotama know of me as an upasakaFrom today as long as life lasts I have taken refuge The commentator explains the three lower modes of refuge merely by reference to scriptural passages which do not enlighten us very muchFrom this fact we may conclude that in Buddhaghosas time and environment those modes of refuge were no longer a living practice but only a reminiscence for which explanation had to be sought in literatureOtherwise the commentator would certainly have dealt with them in greater detail and probably illustrated them by some stories which he is usually so fond of relatingThe fourth and highest mode of refuge has obviously been more familiar at that time and was probably still in use by those undergoing strenuous meditative practice as evinced by a passage in the Visuddhimagga which we shall quote laterBut despite the lack of authentic information the following facts become sufficiently clear from the formulae themselvesThe ancient devotees who coined and used them have been obviously very sensitive as to the deep significance of that act of going for refuge perceiving it as a most momentous step decisive for lifeBy making a fourfold distinction demanding a definite and personal choice they made provision for saving the performance of that act from becoming a soulless habitThe ancient devotees knew well the implication of that apparently simple act and have been aware of the sacred responsibilities resulting from itThey knew that taking refuge is actually consummated only by a complete selfsurrender to the Triple Gem without any reservationsIn the lesser modes of the act there is still something of the presumed self that is kept back it is a going for refuge with reservationsNevertheless these lesser modes too are definite steps towards the Highest and should be consciously cultivatedAs in any harmonious mental development here too the higher level will not exclude the lower one but absorb it into its wider compassIn trying to obtain a clearer picture of those four modes we shall therefore start not from the highest but from the lowest levelHomage is the mental attitude and the bodily and verbal expression of reverence resulting from the recognition and appreciation of something higher than oneselfIt breaks through the first and hardest shell of pride and selfcontented ignorance that knows of nothing better than ones own petty selfWhen encountering something higher animals and undeveloped men  primitive or civilized  will mostly react by distrust fear flight attack resentment hostility persecution etc because they can view that higher form of life only as something different alien and therefore suspectIt is the sign of a truly developed human mind that it meets the higher with due respect with admiration and the wish to emulateRecognition and appreciation of something higher is therefore the preliminary condition of spiritual growth and true respect resulting from it forms the basis of moral education tooKungfutse names respect as the first of qualities of human heartednessTherefore in mans relation to the Highest ie the Triple Gem true homage comes firstAs a way of taking refuge homage is the spontaneous expression of the deep emotion felt when becoming aware of the existence and significance of the supreme refugeIt is the emotional reaction in gratitude veneration and joy when feeling the full weight of the tremendous fact that there is actually a refuge from this universe of sufferingTherefore the commentators illustration of this mode of taking refuge is not the habitual act of worship by confirmed devotees but the highly emotional conversion of an aged brahman who deeply stirred prostrates himself before the Exalted One embracing and kissing his feetHomage represents the emotional side of taking refuge being its aspect as a conscious act of faithThrough its singleheartedness and humility the act of doing homage by body speech and mind prepares the disciple emotionally for complete selfsurrenderIt is an indispensable step to it but being deficient with regard to understanding and determination it requires the supplementation by the following two stagesWhile homage is still a distant and onesided relationship to the Supreme the devotee still being in the outer court of the sanctuary the acceptance of discipleship is a direct approach to itThrough the process of learning a mutual relationship is established or we may even say a gradual and partial identification of teacher teaching and pupil takes placeHere the mind of the disciple goes for refuge to supreme wisdom and becomes gradually permeated by itThrough respect and humility acquired by true homage the disciple has earned for himself the right of entry into the sanctuary of wisdomOnly if approached in that attitude of respect and humility the guru the spiritual teacher of the East will impart his knowledge as these qualities are the first indication that the disciple is ready to receiveIf refuge is taken in the sense of discipleship life becomes a constant act of learning ie of adapting the mind to the standards set by the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaIt is the character of the wise man that he is always willing and anxious to learnThe acceptance of discipleship represents the rational side of taking refuge which is here a conscious act of understandingIt supplies the full and satisfying reasons for the act of homage and adds in that way to the strength and loyalty of devotionBut man is not always devotee or learnerThere remains much in life that cannot be mastered easily by faith and understanding aloneIt requires a strong will and determination as well as the skill of long experience to change the course of the manifold habitual activities of life into the direction of the refugeThis task of making the refuge gradually the center of ones life is performed by the third mode of taking refugeIn accepting the Triple Gem as his guiding ideal the disciple pledges himself to subordinate gradually all the essential activities of his life to the ideals embodied in the Triple GemHe vows to give all his strength to the task of impressing this sacred threefold seal upon his personal life and upon his environment too as far as he is able to overcome its resistanceThe threefold refuge in its aspect as the guiding ideal or as the determining factor of life calls for complete dedication in the sphere of external activitiesThis at least is what we tentatively suggest as the meaning of this third variety of taking refuge called in Pali tapparayanataIn putting forward this suggestion we followed the trend of our previous thoughts about the three constituents of Buddhist faith and we took up in addition the hint given in the illustrative passage quoted by the commentary in this connectionThe canonical text to which that quotation belongs tells of two deities who after their conversion vow to go through the world as divine missionaries of the DhammaThis example given by the commentary may be taken as representative of the general task of establishing the sovereignty if the Triple Gem in ones own and in others heartsBut this dedication to the service of the Triple Gem is still not the highest form of taking refuge to which the disciple should aspireStill there exists in the disciples mind a difference between the noble objective and the person working for itThe delusive ego has been retained it rejoices at the success of the work and grieves when it failsIn a subtle way the work instead of the Triple Gem becomes the refugeIf identification of self and work is not complete the ego as it were hides in the work and evades the call for full surrender to the true refugeProgress beyond this step is possible only if the service of the guiding ideal is done in a highly detached way without looking for any rewardThis detached attitude towards work will be one of the many fruits of complete selfsurrender to the Triple GemThis last and highest form of refuge taken by the worldling is without reservationsIf true understanding has told us before that nothing can be gained in samsara then consequently nothing can be lost by the surrender of selfThough this surrender of self is only the surrender of a delusion it is a very hard sacrifice as all of us knowBut if ever we wish to be free of the bonds of samsara this selfsurrender has to be done at one time or another and therefore it may as well be done today as tomorrowThe highest prize is won only by the highest stake by the sacrifice of that illusive self that has assumed so much power that it requires the highest effort to break itIn taking refuge by way of selfsurrender the disciple in his modest way will follow the example of the Exalted One who in his last great struggle before Enlightenment addressed his inner opponent personified as Mara with the following words Its Muñja grass I wearShame be on lifeFain in the battle I would die than to live further as a vanquished oneThe Muñja grass was the crest of those ancient Indian warriors who entered battle with the vow to do or to die It should be the symbol of the spiritual warrior tooIf any reservations regrets or reluctances are retained there will be merely a halfhearted attempt instead of a singleminded effort which alone can bring victoryIf the grave step of taking refuge by selfsurrender has once been taken a feeling of lightness unconcernedness and fearlessness will enter the heart of the discipleA self that has been renounced cannot and need not have any fear for a life that has been surrendered and that is kept now only on trust for the definite purpose of being used for the highest realizationTherefore in the early days of the Dhamma those of determined mind who entered the field of spiritual action  ie who took up a subject of meditation to be cultivated up to sainthood  they used to start their work by taking the vow of selfsurrender as advised by the following passage of the Visuddhi MaggaHaving approached his noble friend the meditator should first surrender himself to the Buddha the Exalted One or to his teacher and then possessed of a strong desire and a high resolve he should ask for the subject of meditationHis surrender of self to the Buddha should be as follows This personal existence of mine I offer to thee O Exalted OneBecause one who without such a surrender of self lives in lonely places will be unable to stand firm against fearful objects that approach himHe might return to the village and associated with lay folk might take up a search that is wrongful and come to distressBut to one who has surrendered his self no fear arises even when approached by fearful objectsOnly gladness will arise in him when he reflects Hast thou not O wise man on that earlier day surrendered thyself to the BuddhaAnd again in surrendering himself to his teacher he should say This personal existence of mine reverend sir I offer to thee Because without such a surrender of self he will be unruly stubborn unwilling to accept advice he will go about at his own will without asking the teachers leaveAnd the teacher will favor him neither with material nor with spiritual help and will not instruct him in difficult booksNot receiving this twofold favor he will become unvirtuous or return to lay lifeThis way of taking refuge by selfsurrender is of course still far from the complete abolishing of egotism and selfdelusion but it is a powerful means to that endIt may mark the transition from the worldly or mundane refuge to which it still belongs to the supramundane refuge at which it aimsThe formulae of selfsurrender as given in our commentarial text differ even in their external form from the three lesser modes of refuge in so far as they lack that concluding call to witness characteristic of the other modesFrom that we may conclude that this gravest of all vows was to be taken in the secrecy of ones heart as befits the sacredness of that resolveHere the presence of a witness as a kind of moral support for keeping the vow should no more be required such a requirement would only prove that it is premature to take this stepAny publicity to it would only detract from the supreme dignity of the vow and would render its observance more difficult by making the disciple too selfconscious or even proudNeedless to say a deliberate parading of the vow would defeat its very purpose by reinstating the self that was to be surrenderedThe longer formula of selfsurrender enlarging upon the short sentence in the Visuddhimagga has been rendered here into a Western language for the first time and also its Pali original seems to have evoked little attention in our dayIf we reproduce that formula here we do it in the hope that it will be received with the reverence due to that precious document of ancient devotion hallowed by the efforts and achievements of those who may have practiced in accordance with itWe add the earnest request not to make use of it lightly for the purpose of ordinary devotion and not to take the vow rashly on the spur of a moments enthusiasmThis solemn pledge should be taken only after having tested ones strength and perseverance for a long time by minor observances and renunciationsWe should beware of making those highest things of the spirit cheap and common by approaching them in too facile a way by talking too glibly about them or by taking them into our hands and dropping them again when interest fades or our feeble fingers get tiredTherefore if we are not sure of our strength we should not take upon ourselves the severe demands of Selfsurrender but take our refuge by way of those lesser modesFor these will likewise prove to be powerful helpers to high spiritual achievementsIn making an actual and intelligent use of that fourfold devotional Road of the Ancients we shall preserve the most popular religious practice in the Buddhist world the going for refuge from becoming stale and ineffectiveWe shall be able to turn it into a strong lifegiving current of devotion that will carry us one day to the Isle of Final Peace to Nibbana where the refugee and refuge are merged into oneThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard

the mind from all limitations fetters and bonds that tie it to the Wheel of Suffering to the Circle of RebirthIt means the cleansing of the mind of all defilements that mar its purity the removing of all obstacles that bar its progress from the mundane to the supramundane consciousness that is to ArahatshipMany are the obstacles which block the road to spiritual progress but there are five in particular which under the name of hindrances are often mentioned in the Buddhist scripturesThey are called hindrances because they hinder and envelop the mind in many ways obstructing its developmentAccording to the Buddhist teachings spiritual development is twofold through tranquillity and through insightTranquillity is gained by complete concentration of the mind during the meditative absorptionsFor achieving these absorptions the overcoming of the five hindrances at least temporarily is a preliminary conditionIt is especially in the context of achieving the absorptions that the Buddha often mentions the five hindrances in his discoursesThere are five mental constituents which are chiefly representative of the first meditative absorption and are therefore called the factors of absorptionFor each of these there is according to Buddhist commentarial tradition one of the five hindrances that is specifically harmful for it and excludes its higher development and refinement to the degree required for jhana and on the other hand the cultivation of these five factors beyond their average level will be an antidote against the hindrances preparing the road to jhanaThe relationship between these two groups of five is indicated in this anthology under the heading of the respective hindranceNot only the meditative absorptions but also lesser degrees of mental concentration are impeded by these five hindrancesSo is the neighborhood concentration being the preliminary stage for the fully absorbed concentration reached in jhanaLikewise excluded by the presence of the hindrances is the momentary concentration which has the strength of neighborhood concentration and is required for mature insightBut apart from these higher stages of mental development any earnest attempt at clear thinking and pure living will be seriously affected by the presence of these five hindrancesThis widespread harmful influence of the five hindrances shows the urgent necessity of breaking down their power by constant effortOne should not believe it sufficient to turn ones attention to the hindrances only at the moment when one sits down for meditationSuch lastminute effort in suppressing the hindrances will rarely be successful unless helped by previous endeavor during ones ordinary lifeOne who earnestly aspires to the unshakable deliverance of the mind should therefore select a definite workingground of a direct and practical import a kammatthana in its widest sense on which the structure of his entire life should be basedHolding fast to that workingground never losing sight of it for long even this alone will be a considerable and encouraging progress in the control and development of the mind because in that way the directive and purposive energies of mind will be strengthened considerablyOne who has chosen the conquest of the five hindrances for a workingground should examine which of the five are strongest in ones personal caseThen one should carefully observe how and on which occasions they usually appearOne should further know the positive forces within ones own mind by which each of these hindrances can best be countered and finally conquered and one should also examine ones life for any opportunity of developing these qualities which in the following pages have been indicated under the headings of the spiritual faculties the factors of absorption and the factors of enlightenmentIn some cases subjects of meditation have been added which will be helpful in overcoming the respective hindrancesBy the worldling however only a temporary suspension and partial weakening of the hindrances can be attainedTheir final and complete eradication takes place on the stages of sanctityHence the reward of the fight against the hindrances is not only the limited one of making possible a shorter or longer spell of meditation but every step in weakening these hindrances takes us nearer to the stages of sanctity where deliverance from these hindrances is unshakableThough most of the following texts translated from the Discourses of the Buddha and the commentaries are addressed to monks they are likewise valid for those living the worldly lifeAs the Old Masters say The monk is mentioned here as an example of those dedicated to the practice of the TeachingWhosoever undertakes that practice is here included in the term monk There are five impediments and hindrances overgrowths of the mind that stultify insightWhat fiveSensual desire is an impediment and hindrance an overgrowth of the mind that stultifies insightIllwill Sloth and torpor Restlessness and remorse Sceptical doubt are impediments and hindrances overgrowths of the mind that stultify insightWithout having overcome these five it is impossible for a monk whose insight thus lacks strength and power to know his own true good the good of others and the good of both nor will he be capable of realizing that superhuman state of distinctive achievement the knowledge and vision enabling the attainment of sanctityBut if a monk has overcome these five impediments and hindrances these overgrowths of the mind that stultify insight then it is possible that with his strong insight he can know his own true good the good of others and the good of both and he will be capable of realizing that superhuman state of distinctive achievement the knowledge and vision enabling the attainment of sanctityOne whose heart is overwhelmed by unrestrained covetousness will do what he should not do and neglect what he ought to doAnd through that his good name and his happiness will come to ruinOne whose heart is overwhelmed by illwill by sloth and torpor by restlessness and remorse by sceptical doubt will do what he should not do and neglect what he ought to doAnd through that his good name and his happiness will come to ruinBut if a noble disciple has seen these five as defilements of the mind he will give them upAnd doing so he is regarded as one of great wisdom of abundant wisdom clearvisioned well endowed with wisdomThis is called endowment with wisdomThere are five impurities of gold impaired by which it is not pliant and wieldy lacks radiance is brittle and cannot be wrought wellWhat are these five impuritiesIron copper tin lead and silverBut if the gold has been freed from these five impurities then it will be plaint and wieldy radiant and firm and can be wrought wellWhatever ornaments one wishes to make from it be it a diadem earrings a necklace or a golden chain it will serve that purposeSimilarly there are five impurities of the mind impaired by which the mind is not pliant and wieldy lacks radiant lucidity and firmness and cannot concentrate well upon the eradication of the taintsWhat are these five impuritiesThey are sensual desire illwill sloth and torpor restlessness and remorse and sceptical doubtBut if the mind is freed of these five impurities it will be pliant and wieldy will have radiant lucidity and firmness and will concentrate well upon the eradication of the taintsWhatever state realizable by the higher mental faculties one may direct the mind to one will in each case acquire the capacity of realization if the conditions are fulfilledHow does a monk practice mindobject contemplation on the mental objects of the five hindrancesHerein monks when sensual desire is present in him the monk knows There is sensual desire in me or when sensual desire is absent he knows There is no sensual desire in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen sensual desire comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen sensual desire comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected sensual desire comes to beWhen illwill is present in him the monk knows There is illwill in me or when illwill is absent he knows There is no illwill in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen illwill comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen illwill comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected illwill comes to beWhen sloth and torpor are present in him the monk knows There is sloth and torpor in me or when sloth and torpor are absent he knows There is no sloth and torpor in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen sloth and torpor comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen sloth and torpor comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected sloth and torpor comes to beWhen restlessness and remorse are present in him the monk knows There are restlessness and remorse in me or when agitation and remorse are absent he knows There are no restlessness and remorse in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen restlessness and remorse comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen restlessness and remorse comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected restlessness and remorse comes to beWhen sceptical doubt is present in him the monk knows There is sceptical doubt in me or when sceptical doubt is absent he knows There is no sceptical doubt in me He knows how the arising of nonarisen sceptical doubt comes to be he knows how the rejection of the arisen sceptical doubt comes to be and he knows how the nonarising in the future of the rejected sceptical doubt comes to beTo note mindfully and immediately the arising of one of the hindrances as recommended in the preceding text is a simple but very effective method of countering these and any other defilements of the mindBy doing so a brake is applied against the uninhibited continuance of unwholesome thoughts and the watchfulness of mind against their recurrence is strengthenedThis method is based on a simple psychological fact which is expressed by the commentators as follows A good and an evil thought cannot occur in combinationTherefore at the time of knowing the sense desire that sense desire no longer existsJust as monks this body lives on nourishment lives dependent on nourishment does not live without nourishment  in the same way monks the five hindrances live on nourishment depend on nourishment do not live without nourishmentThere are beautiful objects frequently giving unwise attention to them  this is the nourishment for the arising of sensual desire that has not arisen and the nourishment for the increase and strengthening of sensual desire that has already arisenThere are impure objects frequently giving wise attention to them  this is the denourishing of the arising of sensual desire that has not yet arisen and the denourishing of the increase and strengthening of sensual desire that has already arisenSix things are conducive to the abandonment of sensual desire Commentary to the Satipatthana SuttaIn him who is devoted to the meditation about impure objects repulsion towards beautiful objects is firmly establishedThis is the resultImpure object refers in particular to the cemetery meditations as given in the Satipatthana Sutta and explained in the Visuddhimagga but it refers also to the repulsive aspects of sense objects in generalHerein monks a monk reflects on just this body confined within the skin and full of manifold impurities from the soles upward and from the top of the hair down There is in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines bowels stomach excrement bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears lymph saliva mucus fluid of the joints urine Sutta Nipata vSense objects give little enjoyment but much pain and much despair the danger in them prevailsThe unpleasant overwhelms a thoughtless man in the guise of the pleasant the disagreeable overwhelms him in the guise of the agreeable the painful in the guise of pleasureHow does one guard the sense doorsHerein a monk having seen a form does not seize upon its appearance as a whole nor on its detailsIf his sense of sight were uncontrolled covetousness grief and other evil unwholesome states would flow into himTherefore he practices for the sake of its control he watches over the sense of sight he enters upon its controlHaving heard a sound smelt an odor tasted a taste felt a touch cognized a mental object he does not seize upon its appearance as a whole he enters upon its controlThere are forms perceptible by the eye which are desirable lovely pleasing agreeable associated with desire arousing lustIf the monk does not delight in them is not attached to them does not welcome them then in him thus not delighting in them not being attached to them and not welcoming them delight ceases if delight is absent there is no bondageThere are sounds perceptible by the ear odors perceptible by the mind if delight is absent there is no bondageHow is he moderate in eatingHerein a monk takes his food after wise consideration not for the purpose of enjoyment of pride of beautifying the body or adorning it but only for the sake of maintaining and sustaining this body to avoid harm and to support the holy life thinking Thus I shall destroy the old painful feeling and shall not let a new one riseLong life will be mine blamelessness and wellbeing MN MN Reference is here in particular to such friends who have experience and can be a model and help in overcoming sensual desire especially in meditating on impurityBut it applies also to noble friendship in generalThe same twofold explanation holds true also for the other hindrances with due alterationsThe entire holy life Ananda is noble friendship noble companionship noble associationOf a monk Ananda who has a noble friend a noble companion a noble associate it is to be expected that he will cultivate and practice the Noble Eightfold PathReference is here in particular to conversation about the overcoming of sensual desire especially about meditating on impurityBut it applies also to every conversation which is suitable to advance ones progress on the pathWith due alterations this explanation holds true also for the other hindrancesIf the mind of a monk is bent on speaking he Talk which is low coarse worldly not noble not salutary not leading to detachment not to freedom from passion not to cessation not to tranquillity not to higher knowledge not to enlightenment not to Nibbana namely talk about kings robbers and ministers talk about armies dangers and war about food and drink clothes couches garlands perfumes relatives cars villages towns cities and provinces about women and wine gossip of the street and of the well talk about the ancestors about various trifles tales about the origin of the world and the ocean talk about what happened and what did not happen  such and similar talk I shall not entertain Thus he is clearly conscious about itBut talk about austere life talk suitable for the unfolding of the mind talk which is conducive to complete detachment to freedom from passion to cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment and to Nibbana namely talk about a life of frugality about contentedness solitude aloofness from society about rousing ones energy talk about virtue concentration wisdom deliverance about the vision and knowledge of deliverance  such talk I shall entertain Thus he is clearly conscious about itThese things too are helpful in conquering sensual desireIf there is water in a pot mixed with red yellow blue or orange color a man with a normal faculty of sight looking into it could not properly recognize and see the image of his own faceIn the same way when ones mind is possessed by sensual desire overpowered by sensual desire one cannot properly see the escape from sensual desire which has arisen then one does not properly understand and see ones own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into ones mind not to speak of those not memorizedThere are objects causing aversion frequently giving unwise attention to them  this is the nourishment for the arising of illwill that has not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of illwill that has already arisenThere is the liberation of the heart by lovingkindness frequently giving wise attention to it  this is the denourishing of the arising of illwill that has not yet arisen and the decrease and weakening of illwill that has already arisenCultivate the meditation on lovingkindnessFor by cultivating the meditation on lovingkindness illwill disappearsCultivate the meditation on compassionFor by cultivating the meditation on compassion cruelty disappearsCultivate the meditation on sympathetic joyFor by cultivating the meditation on sympathetic joy listlessness disappearsCultivate the meditation on equanimityFor by cultivating the meditation on equanimity anger disappearsSix things are helpful in conquering illwillThus one should consider Being angry with another person what can you do to himCan you destroy his virtue and his other good qualitiesHave you not come to your present state by your own actions and will also go hence according to your own actionsAnger towards another is just as if someone wishing to hit another person takes hold of glowing coals or a heated ironrod or of excrementAnd in the same way if the other person is angry with you what can he do to youCan he destroy your virtue and your other good qualitiesHe too has come to his present state by his own actions and will go hence according to his own actionsLike an unaccepted gift or like a handful of dirt thrown against the wind his anger will fall back on his own head Commentary to Satipatthana SuttaThese things too are helpful in conquering illwillIf there is a pot of water heated on the fire the water seething and boiling a man with a normal faculty of sight looking into it could not properly recognize and see the image of his own faceIn the same way when ones mind is possessed by illwill overpowered by illwill one cannot properly see the escape from the illwill which has arisen then one does not properly understand and see ones own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into ones mind not to speak of those not memorizedThere arises listlessness lassitude lazy stretching of the body drowsiness after meals mental sluggishness frequently giving unwise attention to it  this is the nourishment for the arising of sloth and torpor that have not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of sloth and torpor that have already arisenThere is the element of rousing ones energy the element of exertion the element of continuous exertion frequently giving wise attention to it  this is the denourishing of the arising of sloth and torpor that have not yet arisen and of the increase and strengthening of sloth and torpor that have already arisenMay nothing remain but skin and sinews and bones may flesh and blood dry up in the bodyNot before having achieved what can be achieved by manly strength manly energy manly exertion shall my energy subsideSix things are conducive to the abandonment of sloth and torporThese things too are helpful in conquering sloth and torporThe recollection of DeathPerceiving the suffering in impermanenceIn a monk who is accustomed to see the suffering in impermanence and who is frequently engaged in this contemplation there will be established in him such a keen sense of the danger of laziness idleness lassitude indolence and thoughtlessness as if he were threatened by a murderer with drawn swordSympathetic joyCultivate the meditation on sympathetic joyFor by cultivating it listlessness will disappearContemplation of the spiritual journeyI have to tread that path which the Buddhas the Paccekabuddhas and the Great Disciples have gone but by an indolent person that path cannot be trodden VismIVContemplation of the Masters greatnessFull application of energy was praised by my Master and he is unsurpassed in his injunctions and a great help to usHe is honored by practicing his Dhamma not otherwiseContemplation on the greatness of the HeritageI have to take possession of the Great Heritage called the Good DhammaBut one who is indolent cannot take possession of itHow to stimulate the mindHow does one stimulate the mind at a time when it needs stimulationIf due to slowness in the application of wisdom or due to nonattainment of the happiness of tranquillity ones mind is dull then one should rouse it through reflecting on the eight stirring objectsThese eight are birth decay disease and death the suffering in the worlds of misery the suffering of the past rooted in the round of existence the suffering of the future rooted in the round of existence the suffering of the present rooted in the search for food VismIVHow to overcome sleepinessOnce the Exalted One spoke to the Venerable MahaMoggallana thus Are you drowsy MoggallanaAre you drowsy Moggallana  Yes venerable sirWell then Moggallana at whatever thought torpor has befallen you to that thought you should not give attention you should not dwell on it frequentlyThen it is possible that by so doing torpor will disappearBut if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should think and reflect within your mind about the Dhamma as you have heard and learned it and you should mentally review itThen it is possible that by so doing torpor will disappearBut if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should learn by heart the Dhamma in its fullness as you have heard and learned itThen it is possibleBut if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should shake your ears and rub your limbs with the palm of your handThen it is possibleBut if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should get up from your seat and after washing your eyes with water you should look around in all directions and look upwards to the stars in the skyThen it is possibleBut if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should firmly establish the perception of light as it is by day so also by night as it is by night so also by dayThus with a mind clear and unobstructed you should develop a consciousness which is full of brightnessThen it is possibleBut if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you should conscious of that which is before and behind walk up and down with your senses turned inwards with your mind not going outwardsThen it is possibleBut if by so doing that torpor does not disappear you may lie down on your right side taking up the lions posture covering foot with foot  mindful clearly conscious keeping in mind the thought of risingHaving awakened again you should quickly rise thinking I wont indulge in the enjoyment of lying down and reclining in the enjoyment of sleepThus Moggallana you should train yourselfThe five threatening dangersIf monks a monk perceives these five threatening dangers it is enough for him to live heedful zealous with a heart resolute to achieve the unachieved to attain the unattained to realize the unrealizedWhich are these five dangersHere monks a monk reflects thus I am now young a youth young in age blackhaired in the prime of youth in the first phase of lifeBut a time will come when this body will be in the grip of old ageBut one who is overpowered by old age cannot easily contemplate on the Teachings of the Buddha it is not easy for him to live in the wilderness or a forest or jungle or in secluded dwellingsBefore this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in old ageAnd further monks a monk reflects thus I am now free from sickness free from disease my digestive power functions smoothly my constitution is not too cool and not too hot it is balanced and fit for making effortBut a time will come when this body will be in the grip of sicknessAnd one who is sick cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the Buddha it is not easy for him to live in the wilderness or a forest or jungle or in secluded dwellingsBefore this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in sicknessAnd further monks a monk reflects thus Now there is an abundance of food good harvests easily obtainable is a meal of alms it is easy to live on collected food and offeringsBut a time will come when there will be a famine a bad harvest difficult to obtain will be a meal of alms it will be difficult to live on collected food and offeringsAnd in a famine people migrate to places where food is ample and there habitations will be thronged and crowdedBut in habitations thronged and crowded one cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the BuddhaBefore this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in a famineAnd further monks a monk reflects thus Now people live in concord and amity in friendly fellowship as mingled milk and water and look at each other with friendly eyesBut there will come a time of danger of unrest among the jungle tribes when the country people mount their carts and drive away and fearstricken people move to a place of safety and there habitations will be thronged and crowdedBut in habitations thronged and crowded one cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the BuddhaBefore this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even in time of dangerAnd further monks a monk reflects thus Now the Congregation of Monks lives in concord and amity without quarrel lives happily under one teachingBut a time will come when there will be a split in the CongregationAnd when the Congregation is split one cannot easily contemplate upon the Teachings of the Buddha it is not easy to live in the wilderness or a forest or jungle or in secluded dwellingsBefore this undesirable condition so unpleasant and disagreeable approaches me prior to that let me muster my energy for achieving the unachieved for attaining the unattained for realizing the unrealized so that in the possession of that state I shall live happily even when the Congregation is splitThese things too are helpful in conquering sloth and torporWhen the mind is sluggish it is not the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment tranquillity concentration and equanimity because a sluggish mind can hardly be aroused by themWhen the mind is sluggish it is the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment investigation of reality energy and rapture because a sluggish mind can easily be aroused by themIf there is a pot of water covered with moss and water plants then a man with a normal faculty of sight looking into it could not properly recognize and see the image of his own faceIn the same way when ones mind is possessed by sloth and torpor overpowered by sloth and torpor one cannot properly see the escape from sloth and torpor that have arisen then one does not properly understand ones own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into ones mind not to speak of those not memorizedThere is unrest of mind frequently giving unwise attention to it  that is the nourishment for the arising of restlessness and remorse that have not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of restlessness and remorse that have already arisenThere is quietude of mind frequently giving wise attention to it  that is the denourishing of the arising of restlessness and remorse that have not yet arisen and of the increase and strengthening of restlessness and remorse that have already arisenSix things are conducive to the abandonment of restlessness and remorseKnowledge of the Buddhist scripturesAsking questions about themFamiliarity with the VinayaAssociation with those mature in age and experience who possess dignity restraint and calmNoble friendshipSuitable conversationThese things too are helpful in conquering restlessness and remorseWhen the mind is restless it is not the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment investigation of the doctrine energy and rapture because an agitated mind can hardly be quietened by themWhen the mind is restless it is the proper time for cultivating the following factors of enlightenment tranquillity concentration and equanimity because an agitated mind can easily be quietened by themIf there is water in a pot stirred by the wind agitated swaying and producing waves a man with a normal faculty of sight could not properly recognize and see the image of his own faceIn the same way when ones mind is possessed by restlessness and remorse overpowered by restlessness and remorse one cannot properly see the escape from restlessness and remorse that have arisen then one does not properly understand ones own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into ones mind not to speak of those not memorizedThere are things causing doubt frequently giving unwise attention to them  that is the nourishment for the arising of doubt that has not yet arisen and for the increase and strengthening of doubt that has already arisenThere are things which are wholesome or unwholesome blameless or blameworthy noble or low and contrasts of dark and bright frequently giving wise attention to them  that is the denourishing of the arising of doubt that has not yet arisen and of the increase and strengthening of doubt that has already arisenOf the six things conducive to the abandonment of doubt the first three and the last two are identical with those given for restlessness and remorseThe fourth is as followsFirm conviction concerning the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaIn addition the following are helpful in conquering DoubtReflection of the factors of absorptionIf there is a pot of water which is turbid stirred up and muddy and this pot is put into a dark place then a man with a normal faculty of sight could not properly recognize and see the image of his own faceIn the same way when ones mind is possessed by doubt overpowered by doubt then one cannot properly see the escape from doubt which has arisen then one does not properly understand ones own welfare nor that of another nor that of both and also texts memorized a long time ago do not come into ones mind not to speak of those not memorizedBeing endowed with noble mindfulness and clear comprehension and endowed with noble contentedness the monk resorts to a lonely place to a forest the foot of a tree a mountain a cleft a rock cave a cemetery a jungle an open space a heap of strawAfter the meal having returned from the almsround he sits down crosslegged keeping his body erect and his mindfulness alertHaving given up covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with a heart free of covetousness he cleanses his mind from covetousnessHaving given up the blemish of illwill he dwells without illwill friendly and compassionate towards all living beings he cleanses his mind from the blemish of illwillHaving given up sloth and torpor he dwells free from sloth and torpor in the perception of light mindful and clearly comprehending he cleanses his mind from sloth and torporHaving given up restlessness and remorse he dwells without restlessness his mind being calmed within he cleanses it from restlessness and remorseHaving given up sceptical doubt he dwells as one who has passed beyond doubt being free from uncertainty about salutary things he cleanses his mind from sceptical doubtJust as when a man taking a loan engages in a trade and his trade succeeds he now not only disposes of his old debt but he has also beyond that a surplus for maintaining a wifeAnd at that he rejoices is glad at heartJust as when a man is sick and in pain suffering from a grave disease his food does not agree with him and he has no strength left in his bodyBut some time later he recovers from that sickness he can again digest his food and he regains his strengthAnd at that he rejoices is glad at heartJust as when a man has been thrown into prison but some time later he is released from prison he is safe and without fears and he did not suffer any loss of propertyAnd at that he rejoices is glad at heartJust as when a man is a slave not independent but dependent on others unable to go where he likes but some time later he is set free from slavery is now independent no longer dependent on others a freeman who can go where he wantsAnd at that he rejoices is glad at heartJust as when a man rich and prosperous travels through a wilderness where there is no food and much danger but some time later he has crossed the desert and gradually reaches safely the vicinity of a village a place of safety free from dangerAnd at that he rejoices is glad at heartSimilarly so long as these five hindrances are not abandoned in him a monk considers himself as indebted as ailing as imprisoned as enslaved as traveling in a wildernessBut when these five hindrances are abandoned he considers himself as free from debt rid of illness emancipated from the prisons bondage as a free man and as one arrived at a place of safetyAnd when he sees himself free of these five hindrances joy arises in him who is joyful rapture arises in him whose mind is enraptured the body is stilled the body being stilled he feels happiness and a happy mind finds concentrationThen detached from sensual desires detached from unwholesome states he enters into and dwells in the first absorption which is accompanied by applied thought and reflection born of detachment and filled with joy and raptureHe enters into and dwells in the second third fourth absorptionThe text of the discourse says Similarly so long as these five hindrances are not abandoned in him a monk considers himself as indebted as ailing as imprisoned as enslaved as traveling in a wildernessHereby the Blessed One shows the unabandoned hindrance of sensual desire as similar to being in debt and the other hindrances as similar to being ill and so onThese similes should be understood as followsThere is a man who has incurred a debt but has become ruinedNow if his creditors when telling him to pay back the debt speak roughly to him or harass and beat him he is unable to retaliate but has to bear it allIt is his debt that causes this forbearanceIn the same way if a man is filled with sensual desire for a certain person he will full of craving for that object of his desire be attached to itEven if spoken to roughly by that person or harassed or beaten he will bear it allIt is his sensual desire that causes this forbearanceIn that way sensual desire is like being in debtIf a man suffers from a bilious disease and receives even honey and sugar he will not enjoy its flavor owing to his bile sickness he will just vomit it complaining It is bitter bitterIn the same way if one of angry temperament is admonished even slightly by his teacher or preceptor who wishes his best he does not accept their adviceSaying You harass me too much he will leave the Order or go away and roam aboutJust as the bilious person does not enjoy the flavor of honey and sugar so one who has the disease of anger will not enjoy the taste of the Buddhas Dispensation consisting in the happiness of the meditative absorptions etcIn that way illwill resembles illnessA person has been kept in jail during a festival day and so could see neither the beginning nor the middle nor the end of the festivitiesIf he is released on the following day and hears people saying Oh how delightful was yesterdays festivalOh those dances and songs he will not give any replyAnd why notBecause he did not enjoy the festival himselfSimilarly even if a very eloquent sermon on the Dhamma is going on a monk overcome by sloth and torpor will not know the beginning middle or endIf after the sermon he hears it praised How pleasant was it to listen to the DhammaHow interesting was the topic and how good the similes he will not be able to say a wordAnd why notBecause owing to his sloth and torpor he did not enjoy the sermonIn that way sloth and torpor are comparable to imprisonmentA slave who wants to enjoy himself at a festival is told by his master Go quickly to such and such a placeThere is urgent work to doIf you dont go I shall have your hands and feet cut off or your ears and nose Hearing that the slave will quickly go as ordered and will not be able to enjoy any part of the festivalThis is because of his dependence on othersSimilarly it is with a monk not well versed in the Vinaya who has gone to the forest for the sake of solitudeIf in any matter down to the question of permissible meat he gets the idea that it was not permissible he has to interrupt his solitude and to purify his conduct has to go to one skilled in the VinayaThus he will not be able to enjoy the happiness of solitude because of his being overcome by restlessness and remorseIn that way restlessness and remorse are like slaveryA man traveling through a desert aware that travelers may be plundered or killed by robbers will at the mere sound of a twig or a bird become anxious and fearful thinking The robbers have come He will go a few steps and then out of fear he will stop and continue in such a manner all the way or he may even turn backStopping more frequently than walking only with toil and difficulty will he reach a place of safety or he may not even reach itIt is similar with one in whom doubt has arisen in regard to one of the eight objects of doubtDoubting whether the Master is an Enlightened One or not he cannot accept it in confidence as a matter of trustUnable to do so he does not attain to the paths and fruits of sanctityThus as the traveler in the desert is uncertain whether robbers are there or not he produces in his mind again and again a state of wavering and vacillation a lack of decision a state of anxiety and thus he creates in himself an obstacle for reaching the safe ground of sanctityIn that way sceptical doubt is like traveling in a desertThe text of the Discourse says But when these five hindrances are abandoned the monk considers himself as free from debt rid of illness emancipated from the prisons bondage as a free man and as one arrived at a place of safetyA man having taken a loan uses it for his business and comes to prosperityHe thinks This debt is a cause of vexation He returns the loan together with the interest and has the promissory note torn upAfter that he neither sends a messenger nor a letter to his creditors and even if he meets them it depends on his wish whether he will get up from his seat to greet them or notAnd whyHe is no longer in debt to them or dependent of themSimilarly a monk thinks Sensual desire is a cause of obstruction He then cultivates the six things leading to its abandonment and removes the hindrance of sensual desireJust as one who has freed himself of debt no longer feels fear or anxiety when meeting his former creditors so one who has given up sensual desire is no longer attached and bound to the object of his desire even if he sees divine forms passions will not assail himTherefore the Blessed One compared the abandonment of sensual desire to freedom from debtJust as a person suffering from a bilious disease having been cured by taking medicine will regain his taste for honey and sugar similarly a monk thinking This illwill causes much harm develops the six things leading to its abandonment and removes the hindrance of illwillJust as the cured patient partaking of honey and sugar appreciates the taste so also this monk receives with reverence the rules of training and observes them with appreciationTherefore the Blessed One compared the abandonment of illwill to the recovery of healthThere is a person that once had been in jail on a festival dayBut when freed and celebrating the festival on a later occasion he will think Formerly through the fault of my heedlessness I was in prison on that day and could not enjoy this festivalNow I shall be heedful And he remains heedful of his conduct so that nothing detrimental finds entry into his mindHaving enjoyed the festival he exclaims Oh what a beautiful festival it wasSimilarly a monk perceiving that sloth and torpor do great harm develops the six things opposed to them and so removes the hindrance of sloth and torporJust as the man freed from prison enjoys the whole length of the festival even for seven days so this monk who has given up sloth and torpor is capable of enjoying the beginning the middle and the consummation of the Festival of the Dhamma and finally attains to Arahatship together with the fourfold discriminating knowledge Therefore the Blessed One spoke of the abandonment of sloth and torpor as being comparable to release from imprisonmentThere is a slave who with the help of a friend pays money to his master becomes a free man and is henceforth able to do what he likesSimilarly a monk perceiving the great obstruction caused by restlessness and remorse cultivates the six things opposed to them and thus gives up restlessness and remorseAnd having given them up he is like a truly free man able to do as he wishesJust as no one can forcibly stop a free man from doing what he likes so can restlessness and remorse no longer stop that monk from walking the happy path of renunciationTherefore the Blessed One declared the abandonment of restlessness and remorse as being similar to winning freedom from slaveryThere is a strong man who with his luggage in hand and well armed travels through a wilderness in companyIf robbers see him even from afar they will take flightCrossing safely the wilderness and reaching a place of safety he will rejoice in his safe arrivalSimilarly a monk seeing that sceptical doubt is a cause of great harm cultivates the six things that are its antidote and gives up doubtJust as that strong man armed and in company taking as little account of the robbers as of the grass on the ground will safely come out of the wilderness to a safe place similarly a monk having crossed the wilderness of evil conduct will finally reach the state of highest security the deathless realm of NibbanaTherefore the Blessed One compared the abandonment of sceptical doubt to reaching a place of safetyThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn many temples of Sri Lanka you will find on either side of the Buddha image the statues of two monksTheir robes are draped over one shoulder and they stand in the attitude of reverence with joined palmsQuite often there are a few flowers at their feet laid there by some pious devoteeIf you ask who they are you will be told that they are the Enlightened Ones two Chief Disciples the Arahats Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaThey stand in the positions they occupied in lifeSariputta on the Buddhas right Maha Moggallana on his leftWhen the great stupa at Sanchi was opened up in the middle of the last century the relic chamber was found to contain two stone receptacles the one to the north held the body relics of Maha Moggallana while that on the south enclosed those of SariputtaThus they had lain while the centuries rolled past and the history of two thousand years and more played out the drama of impermanence in human lifeThe Roman Empire rose and fell the glories of ancient Greece became a distant memory new religions wrote their names often with blood and fire on the changing face of the earth only to mingle at last with legends of Thebes and Babylon and gradually the tides of commerce shifted the great centers of civilization from East to West while generations that had never heard the Teaching of the Buddha arose and passed awayBut all the time that the ashes of the saints lay undisturbed forgotten in the land that gave them birth their memory was held dear wherever the Buddhas message spread and the record of their lives was passed down from one generation to another first by word of mouth then in the written pages of the Buddhist Tripitaka the most voluminous and detailed scripture of any religionnext to the Enlightened One himself it is these two disciples of his who stand highest in the veneration of Buddhists in the Theravada landsTheir names are as inseparable from the annals of Buddhism as that of the Buddha himselfIf it has come about that in the course of time many legends have been woven into the tradition of their lives this is but the natural outcome of the devotion that has always been felt for themAnd that high esteem was fully justifiedFew religious teachers have been so well served by their immediate disciples as was the BuddhaThis you will see as you read these pages for they tell the story of one of the two greatest of them Sariputta who was second only to the Buddha in the depth and range of his understanding and his ability to teach the Doctrine of DeliveranceIn the Tripitaka there is no connected account of his life but it can be pieced together from the various incidents scattered throughout the canonical texts and commentaries in which he figuresSome of them are more than incidents for his life so closely interwoven with the life and ministry of the Buddha that he plays an essential part in it and on a number of occasions it is the Sariputta himself who takes the leading role  as skilled preceptor and exemplar as kind and considerate friend as guardian of the welfare of the bhikkhus under his charge as faithful repository of his Masters doctrine the function which earned him the title of Dhammasenapati Marshal of the Dhamma and always as himself a man unique in his patience and steadfastness modest and upright in thought word and deed a man to whom one act of kindness was a thing to be remembered with gratitude so long as life enduredEven among the Arahats saints freed from all defilements of passion and delusion he shone like the full moon in a starry skyThis then is the man of profound intellect and sublime nature a true disciple of the Great Teacher whose story we have set down to the best of our ability in the pages that followIf you the reader can gather from this imperfect record something of the qualities of man perfected of man fully liberated and raised to the highest level of his being of how such a man acts and speaks and comports himself towards his fellows and if the reading of it gives you strength and faith in the assurance of what man may become then our work has been worthwhile and is fully rewardedThe story begins at two brahmanical villages in India called Upatissa and Kolita which lay not far from the city RajagahaBefore our Buddha had appeared in the world a brahman lady named Sari living in Upatissa village conceived and also on the same day at Kolita village did another brahman lady whose name was MoggalliThe two families were closely connected having been friends with one another for seven generationsFrom the first day of their pregnancy the families gave due care to the motherstobe and after ten months both women gave birth to boys on the same dayOn the namegiving day the child of the brahman lady Sari received the name Upatissa as he was a son of the foremost family of that village and for the same reason Moggallis son was named KolitaWhen the boys grew up they were educated and acquired mastery of all the sciencesEach of them had a following of five hundred brahman youths and when they went to the river or park for sport and recreation Upatissa used to go with five hundred palanquins and Kolita with five hundred carriagesNow at Rajagaha there was an annual event called the Hilltop FestivalSeats were arranged for both youths and they sat together to witness the celebrationsWhen there was occasion for laughter they laughed when the spectacles were exciting they became excited and they paid their fees for the extra showsIn this manner they enjoyed the festival for a second day but on the third day their understanding was awakened and they could no longer laugh or get excited nor did they feel inclined to pay for extra shows as they had done on the first daysEach of them had the same thought What is there to look at hereBefore these people have reached a hundred years they will all have come to deathWhat we ought to do is to seek for a teaching of deliveranceIt was with such thoughts in mind that they took their seats at the festivalThen Kolita said to Upatissa How is this my dear UpatissaYou are not as happy and joyous as you were on the other daysYou seem now to be in a discontented mood What is on your mindMy dear Kolita to look at these things here is of no benefit at allit is utterly worthlessI ought to seek a teaching of deliverance for myselfThat my Kolita is what I was thinking seated hereBut you Kolita seem to be discontented tooAnd Kolita replied Just as you have said I also feel When he knew that his friend had the same inclinations Upatissa said That was a good thought of oursBut for those who seek a teaching of deliverance there is only one thing to do to leave home and become asceticsBut under whom shall we live the ascetic lifeAt that time there lived at Rajagaha an ascetic of the sect of the Wanderers called Sañjaya who had a great following of pupilsDeciding to get ordination under him Upatissa and Kolita went there each with his own following of five hundred Brahman youths and all of them received ordination from SañjayaAnd from the time of their ordination under him Sañjayas reputation and support increased abundantlyWithin a short time the two friends had learned Sañjayas entire doctrine and they asked him Master does your doctrine go so far only or is there something beyondSañjaya replied So far only it goesYou know allHearing this they thought to themselves If that is the case it is useless to continue the Holy Life under himWe have gone forth from home to seek a teaching of deliveranceUnder him we cannot find itBut India is vast if we wander through villages towns and cities we shall certainly find a master who can show us the teaching of deliverance And after that whenever they heard that there were wise ascetics or brahmans at this or that place they went and discussed with themBut there was none who was able to answer their questions while they were able to reply to those who questioned themHaving thus traveled through the whole of India they turned back and arriving at their old place they agreed between them that he who should attain to the Deathless State first should inform the otherIt was a pact of brotherhood born of the deep friendship between the two young menSome time after they had made that agreement the Blessed One the Buddha came to RajagahaIt was when he had delivered the Fire Sermon at Gaya Peak that he remembered his promise given before his Enlightenment to King Bimbisara that he would come to Rajagaha again when he had attained his goalSo in stages the Blessed One journeyed from Gaya to Rajagaha and having received from King Bimbisara the Bamboo Grove Monastery he resided thereAmong the sixtyone Arahats whom the Master had sent forth to proclaim to the world the virtues of the Triple Gem there was the Elder Assaji who belonged to the group of five ascetics the Buddhas erstwhile companions before his Enlightenment and afterwards his first disciplesThe Elder Assaji had returned to Rajagaha from his wanderings and when one morning he was going for alms in the city he was seen by Upatissa who was on his way to the Paribbajaka ascetics monasteryStruck by Assajis dignified and serene appearance Upatissa thought Never before have I seen such a monkHe must be one of those who are Arahats or on the way to ArahatshipShould I not approach him and ask Under whom have you been ordainedWho is your teacher and whose teaching do you profess But then he thought It is not the proper time now for putting questions to this monk as he is going for alms through the streetsI had better follow behind him after the manner of supplicants And he did soThen when the Elder had gathered his almsfood and Upatissa saw him going to another place intending to sit down and take his meal he prepared for him his own ascetics seat that he carried with him and offered it to the ElderThe Elder Assaji took his meal after which Upatissa served him with water from his own watercontainer and in that way performed towards Assaji the duties of a pupil to a teacherAfter they had exchanged the usual courteous greetingsUpatissa said Serene are your features friendPure and bright is your complexionUnder whom friend have you gone forth as an asceticWho is your teacher and whose doctrine do you professAssaji replied There is O friend the Great Recluse the scion of the Sakyas who has gone forth from the Sakya clanUnder that Blessed One I have gone forthThat Blessed One is my teacher and it is his Dhamma that I professWhat does the venerable ones master teach what does he proclaimQuestioned thus the Elder Assaji thought to himself These wandering ascetics are opposed to the Buddhas dispensationI shall show him how profound this dispensation is So he said I am but new to the training friendIt is not long since I went forth from home and I came but recently to this teaching and disciplineI cannot explain the Dhamma in detail to youThe wanderer replied I am called Upatissa friendPlease tell me according to your ability be it much or littleIt will be my task to penetrate its meaning by way of a hundred or a thousand methods And he addedIn response the Elder Assaji uttered this stanzaUpon hearing the first two lines Upatissa became established in the Path of streamentry and to the ending of the last two lines he already listened as a streamwinnerWhen he become a streamwinner and before he had achieved the higher attainments he thought Here will the means of deliverance be found and he said to the Elder Do not enlarge upon this exposition of the Dhamma venerable sirThis will sufficeBut where does our Master liveIn the Bamboo Grove Monastery wandererThen please go on ahead venerable sirI have a friend with whom I agreed that he who should reach the Deathless State first should tell the otherI shall inform him and together we shall follow on the road you went and shall come into the Masters presence Upatissa then prostrated himself at the Elders feet saluted him and taking the Elders leave went back to the park of the Wandering AsceticsKolita saw him approaching and thought Today my friends appearance is quite changedSurely he must have found the Deathless StateAnd when he asked him about it Upatissa replied Yes friend the Deathless State has been found and he recited to him the stanza he had heardAt the end of the verse Kolita was established in the Fruition of streamentry and he asked Where my dear does the Master liveI learned from our teacher the Elder Assaji that he lives at the Bamboo Grove MonasteryThen let us go Upatissa and see the Master said KolitaBut Sariputta was one who always respected his teacher and therefore he said to his friend First my dear we shall go to our teacher the Wanderer Sañjaya and tell him that we have found the DeathlessIf he can grasp it he will penetrate to the TruthAnd even if he does not he may out of confidence in us come with us to see the Master and hearing the Buddhas teaching he will attain to the penetration of the Path and FruitionSo both of them went to Sañjaya and said Oh our teacherWhat are you doingA Buddha has appeared in the worldWell proclaimed is his Teaching and in right conduct lives his community of monksLet us go and see the Master of the Ten PowersWhat are you saying my dear Sañjaya exclaimedAnd refusing to go with them he spoke to them of the gain and fame they would enjoy if they would share his the teachers placeBut they said Oh we should not mind always remaining in the state of pupilsBut you O teacher you must know whether to go or notThen Sañjaya thought If they know so much they will not listen to what I say And realizing that he replied You may go then but I cannotWhy not O teacherI am a teacher of manyIf I were to revert to the state of a disciple it would be as if a huge water tank were to change into a small pitcherI cannot live the life of a pupil nowDo not think like that O teacher they urgedLet it be my dearYou may go but I cannotOh teacherWhen a Buddha has appeared in the world people flock to him in large crowds and pay homage to him carrying incense and flowersWe too shall go thereAnd then what will happen to youTo which Sañjaya replied What do you think my pupils are there more fools in this world or more wise peopleFools there are many O teacher and the wise are fewIf that is so my friends then the wise ones will go to the wise recluse Gotama and the fools will come to me the foolYou may go now but I shall notSo the two friends left saying You will come to understand your mistake O teacher And after they had gone there was a split among Sañjayas pupils and his monastery became almost emptySeeing his place empty Sañjaya vomited hot bloodFive hundred of his disciples had left along with Upatissa and Kolita out of whom two hundred and fifty returned to SañjayaWith the remaining two hundred and fifty and their own following the two friends arrived at the Bamboo Grove MonasteryThere the Master seated among the fourfold assembly was preaching the Dhamma and when the Blessed One saw the two coming he addressed the monks These two friends Upatissa and Kolita who are now coming will be two excellent disciples to me a blessed pairHaving approached the friends saluted the Blessed One reverentially and sat down at one sideWhen they were seated they spoke to the Blessed One saying May we obtain O Lord the ordination of the Going Forth under the Blessed One may we obtain the Higher OrdinationAnd the Blessed One said Come O bhikkhusWell proclaimed is the DhammaNow live the Life of Purity to make an end of suffering This alone served as the ordination of these venerable onesThen the master continued his sermon taking the individual temperaments of the listeners into consideration and with the exception of the two chief disciples all of them attained to ArahatshipBut the two chief disciples had not yet completed the task of attaining to the three higher paths of sanctityThe reason for this was the greatness of the knowledge pertaining to the perfection of a disciple which they had still to reachUpatissa received the name of Sariputta on becoming a disciple of the Buddha while Kolita became known as Maha MoggallanaNow the Venerable Maha Moggallana went to live at a village in Magadha called Kallavala on which he depended for almsfoodOn the seventh day after his ordination when he was doing the recluses work fatigue and torpor fell upon himBut spurred on by the Master he dispelled his fatigue and while listening to the Master expounding to him the meditation subject of the elements he completed the task of winning to the three higher paths and reached the acme of a disciples perfectionsBut the Venerable Sariputta continued to stay near the Master at a cave called the Boars Shelter depending on Rajagaha for his almsfoodHalf a month after his ordination the Blessed One gave a discourse on the comprehension of feelings to the Venerable Sariputtas nephew the wandering ascetic DighanakhaThe Venerable Sariputta was standing behind the Master fanning himWhile following with his thoughts the progress of the discourse as though sharing the food prepared for another the Venerable Sariputta on that occasion reached the acme of knowledge pertaining to a disciples perfection and attained to Arahatship together with the fourfold analytical knowledge And his nephew at the end of the sermon was established in the Fruition of streamentryNow it may be asked Did not the Venerable Sariputta possess great wisdom and if so why did he attain to the disciples perfections later than the Venerable Maha MoggallanaThe answer is because of the greatness of the preparations necessary for itWhen poor people want to go anywhere they take to the road at once but in the case of kings larger preparations are required as for instance to get ready the elephants and chariots and so onThus it was in this caseOn that same day when the evening shadows had lengthened the Master caused his disciples to assemble and bestowed upon the two Elders the rank of Chief DisciplesAt this some monks were displeased and said among themselves The Master should have given the rank of Chief Disciples to those who were ordained first that is the Group of Five disciplesIf not to them then either to the group of two hundred and fifty bhikkhus headed by Yasa or to the thirty of the Auspicious Group or else to the three Kassapa brothersBut passing over all these Great Elders he has given it to those whose ordination was the very last of allThe Master inquired about the subject of their talkWhen he was told he said I do not show preference but give to each what he has aspired toWhen for instance Kondaññathe Knower in a previous life gave almsfood nine times during a single harvest he did not aspire to Chief Discipleship his aspiration was to be the very first to penetrate to the highest state ArahatshipAnd so it came aboutBut when Sariputta and Maha Moggallana many aeons ago at the time of the Buddha Anomadassi were born as the brahman youth Sarada and landowner Sirivaddhaka they made the aspiration for Chief DiscipleshipThis O bhikkhus was the aspiration for these my sons at that timeHence I have given them just what they aspired to and did not do it out of preferenceThis account of the beginning of the Venerable Sariputtas career is taken from the Commentary to the Anguttara Nikaya Etadagga section with some passages from the parallel version in the Dhammapada CommentaryFrom it some of the principal traits of the Venerable Sariputtas character are already discernibleHis capacity for deep and constant friendship showed itself while he was still a worldling a youth nurtured in luxury and pleasure and it persisted after he had abandoned the household lifeOn receiving his first insight into the Dhamma and before proceeding any further his first thought was for his friend Kolita and the vow they had sworn togetherHis penetrating intellect is revealed in the promptness with which he grasped the essence of the Buddhas teaching from a few simple wordsAnd most rare of all he combined that intellectual power with a modesty and sweetness of nature that expressed itself in gratitude and reverence for anyone even the misguided Sañjaya who had taught him things of valueIt was no wonder therefore that throughout his life he continued to show respect for the Venerable Assaji from whom he had gained his introduction to the Buddhas TeachingWe are told in the Commentary to the Nava Sutta and also in the Commentary to vof the Dhammapada that whenever the Venerable Sariputta lived in the same monastery as the Elder Assaji he always went to pay obeisance to him immediately after having done so to the Blessed OneThis he did out of reverence thinking This venerable one was my first teacherIt was through him that I came to know the Buddhas Dispensation And when the Elder Assaji lived in another monastery the Venerable Sariputta used to face the direction in which the Elder Assaji was living and to pay homage to him by touching the ground at five places and saluting with joined palmsBut this led to misunderstanding for when other monks saw it they said After becoming a Chief Disciple Sariputta still worships the heavenly quartersEven today he cannot give up his brahmanical views Hearing these remarks the Blessed One said It is not so bhikkhusSariputta does not worship the heavenly quartersHe salutes him through whom he came to know the DhammaIt is him he salutes worships and reveres as his teacherSariputta is one who gives devout respect to his teacher It was then that the Master preached to the monks assembled there the Nava Sutta which starts with the wordsAnother example of the Venerable Sariputtas gratitude is given in the story of Radha TheraThe Commentary to verse of the Dhammapada relates that there was living at Savatthi a poor brahman who stayed in the monasteryThere he performed little services such as weeding sweeping and the like and the monks supported him with foodThey did not however want to ordain himOne day the Blessed One in his mental survey of the world saw that this brahman was mature for Arahatshiphe inquired about him from the assembled monks and asked whether any one of them remembered to have received some help from the poor brahmanThe Venerable Sariputta said that he remembered that once when he was going for alms in Rajagaha this poor brahman had given him a ladle full of almsfood that he had begged for himselfThe Master asked Sariputta to ordain the man and he was given the name RadhaThe Venerable Sariputta then advised him time and again as to what things should be done and always Radha received his admonitions gladly without resentmentAnd so living according to the Elders advice he attained Arahatship in a short timeThis time the bhikkhus remarked on Sariputtas sense of gratitude and said that he who himself willingly accepts advice obtains pupils who do the sameCommenting on this the Buddha said that not only then but also formerly Sariputta had showed gratitude and remembered any good deed done to himAnd in that connection the Master told the Alinacitta Jataka the story of a grateful elephantIf Sariputta was notable for his lasting sense of gratitude he was no less so for his capacity for friendshipWith Maha Moggallana the friend and companion of his youth he maintained a close intimacy and many were the conversations they held on the DhammaOne of these which is of special interest as throwing light on the process of Venerable Sariputtas attainment is recorded in the Anguttara Nikaya Catukkanipata NoIt relates that once the Venerable Maha Moggallana went to see the Elder and said to himThere are four ways of progress brother SariputtaBy which of these four ways of progress brother was your mind freed from the cankers without remnants of clinging To which the Venerable Sariputta replied By that of those four ways of progress brother which is easy and has swift directknowledgeThe explanation of this passage is that if the suppression of the defilements preparatory to absorption or insight takes place without great difficulty progress is called easy in the reverse case it is difficult or painfulIf after the suppression of the defilements the manifestation of the Path the goal of insight is quickly effected the directknowledge is called swift in the reverse case it is sluggishIn this discourse the Venerable Sariputtas statement refers to his attainment of arahantshipHis attainment of the first three Paths however was according to the commentary to the above text connected with easy progress and sluggish directknowledgeIn such ways as this did the two friends exchange information about their experience and understanding of the DhammaThey were also frequently associated in attending to affairs of the SanghaOne such occasion was when they combined in winning back certain monks who had been led astray by DevadattaThere is an interesting passage in this connection which shows that the Venerable Sariputtas generous praise of Devadattas achievements before the latter brought about a schism in the Sangha was the cause of a slight embarrassmentIt relates that when the Buddha asked Sariputta to proclaim in Rajagaha that Devadattas deeds and words should no longer be regarded as connected with the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha the Venerable Sariputta said Formerly I spoke at Rajagaha in praise of Devadattas magical powers Yes Lord the elder repliedSo you will now speak truthfully also Sariputta when you make this proclamation about Devadatta So after receiving the formal approval of the Sangha the Venerable Sariputta together with many monks went to Rajagaha and made the declaration about DevadattaWhen Devadatta had formally split the Sangha by declaring that he would conduct Sanghaacts separately he went to Vultures Peak with five hundred young monks who through ignorance had become his followersTo win them back the Buddha sent Sariputta and Maha Moggallana to the Vultures Peak and while Devadatta was resting the two Chief Disciples preached to the monks who attained to streamentry and went back to the MasterAnother time when the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Maha Moggallana worked together to restore order in the Sangha was when a group of monks led by Assaji and Punnabbassu living at Kitagiri were misbehavingIn spite of repeated admonitions these monks would not mend their ways so the two Chief Disciples were sent to pronounce the penalty of pabbajaniyakamma on those who would not submit to the disciplineVenerable Sariputtas devotion to his friend was fully reciprocated we are told of two occasions when Sariputta was ill and Maha Moggallana attended to him and brought him medicineYet there was nothing exclusive about the Venerable Sariputtas friendships for according to the commentary to the MahaGosinga Sutta there was also a bond of mutual affection between him and the Elder AnandaOn the part of Sariputta it was because he thought He is attending on the Master  a duty which should have been performed by me and Anandas affection was due to the fact that Sariputta had been declared by the Buddha as his foremost discipleWhen Ananda gave Novice Ordination to young pupils he used to take them to Sariputta to obtain Higher ordination under himThe Venerable Sariputta did the same in regard to Ananda and in that way they had five hundred pupils in commonWhenever the Venerable Ananda received choice robes or other requisites he would offer them to Sariputta and in the same way Sariputta passed on to Ananda any special offerings that were made to himOnce Ananda received from a certain brahman a very valuable robe and with the Masters permission he kept it for ten days awaiting Sariputtas returnThe subcommentary says that later teachers commented on this There may be those who say We can well understand that Ananda who had not yet attained to Arahatship felt such affectionBut how is it in the case of Sariputta who was a cankerfree arahant To this we answer Sariputtas affection was not one of worldly attachment but a love for Anandas virtues The Buddha once asked the Venerable Ananda Do you too approve of Sariputta And Ananda replied Who O Lord would not approve of Sariputta unless he were childish corrupt stupid or of perverted mindLearned O Lord is the Venerable Sariputta of great wisdom O Lord is the Venerable Sariputta of broad bright quick keen and penetrative wisdom is the Venerable Sariputta of few wants and contented inclined to seclusion not fond of company energetic eloquent willing to listen an exhorter who censures what is evilIn the Theragatha we find the Venerable Ananda describing his emotion at the time of Sariputtas deathWhen the Noble Friend had gone he declares the world was plunged in darkness for me But he adds that after the companion had left him behind and also the Master had passed away there was no other friend like mindfulness directed on the bodyAnandas sorrow on learning of the Venerable Sariputtas death is also described very movingly in the Cunda SuttaSariputta was a true friend in the fullest sense of the wordHe well understood how to bring out the best in others and in doing so did not hesitate sometimes to speak straightforwardly and critically like the ideal friend described by the Buddha who points out his friends faultsIt was in this way that he helped the venerable Anuruddha in his final breakthrough to Arahatship as recorded in the Anguttara NikayaFriend Anuruddha said the Venerable Sariputta that you think thus of your divine eye this is conceit in youThat you think thus of your firm energy your alert mindfulness your unperturbed body and your concentrated mind this is restlessness in youThat you think of your mind not being freed from the cankers this is worrying in youIt will be good indeed if the Venerable Anuruddha abandoning these three states of mind and paying no attention to them will direct the mind to the Deathless ElementAnd the Venerable Anuruddha later on gave up these three states of mind paid no attention to them and directed his mind to the Deathless ElementAnd the Venerable Anuruddha living then alone secluded heedful ardent with determined mind before long reached in this very life understanding and experiencing it by himself that highest goal of the Holy Life for the sake of which noble sons go forth entirely from home into homelessnessAnd he knew Exhausted is rebirth lived is the holy life the work is done nothing further remains after this Thus the Venerable Anuruddha became one of the ArahatsSariputta must have been stimulating company and sought after by manyWhat attracted men of quite different temperament to him and his conversation can be well understood from the incident described in the MahaGosinga SuttaOne evening the Elders Maha Moggallana Maha Kassapa Anuruddha Revata and Ananda went to Sariputta to listen to the DhammaThe Venerable Sariputta welcomed them saying Delightful is this Gosinga Forest of Sala trees there is moonlight tonight all the Sala trees are in full bloom and it seems that heavenly perfume drifts aroundWhat kind of monk do you think Ananda will lend more luster to this Gosinga Sala ForestThe same question was put to the others as well and each answered according to his individual natureFinally Sariputta gave his own answer which was as followsThey then went to the Buddha who approved of all their answers and added his ownWe see from this episode that Sariputta with all his powerful intellect and his status in the Sangha was far from being a domineering type who tried to impose his views on othersHow well did he understand how to stimulate selfexpression in his companions in a natural and charming way conveying to them the pensive mood evoked by the enchanting sceneryHis own sensitive nature responded to it and drew a similar response from his friendsThere are many such conversations recorded between Sariputta and other monks not only the Venerables Maha Moggallana Ananda and Anuruddha but also Maha Kotthita Upavana Samiddhi Savittha Bhumija and many moreIt seems that the Buddha himself liked to talk to Sariputta for he often did so and many of his discourses were addressed to his Marshal of the Law to use the title he gave himOnce Sariputta repeated some words the Master had spoken to Ananda on another occasionThis is the whole of the Life of Purity namely noble friendship noble companionship noble associationThere could be no better exemplification of that teaching than the life of the Chief Disciple himselfAmong the bhikkhus Sariputta was outstanding as one who helped othersWe find a reference to this in the Devadaha SuttaSome visiting monks about to return to their own places took formal leave of the BuddhaHe then advised them to see the Venerable Sariputta and take leave of him also telling them Sariputta O bhikkhus is wise and a helper of his fellow monksThe Commentary in explanation of these words says Sariputta was a helper in two ways by giving material help and the help of the DhammaThe Elder it is said did not go on almsround in the early morning hours as the other bhikkhus didInstead when they had all gone he walked around the entire monastery grounds and wherever he saw an unswept place he swept it wherever refuse had not been removed he threw it away where furniture such as beds chairs etc or earthenware had not been properly arranged he put them in orderHe did that lest other nonBuddhist ascetics visiting the monastery might see some disorderliness and speak in contempt of the bhikkhusThen he used to go to the hall for the sick and having spoken consoling words to the patients he would ask them about their needsTo procure their requirements he took with him young novices and went in search of medicine either by way of the customary almsround or to some appropriate placeWhen the medicine was obtained he would give it to the novices saying Caring for the sick has been praised by the MasterGo now good people and be heedful After sending them back to the monastery sick room he would go on the almsround or take his meal at a supporters houseThis was his habit when staying for some time at a monasteryBut when going on a journey on foot with the Blessed One he did not go with the very first of the monks shod with sandals and umbrella in hand as one who thinks I am the Chief Disciple But letting the young novices take his bowl and robes sending them with the others he himself would first attend to those who were old very young or unwell making them apply oil to any sores they might have on their bodiesThen either later on the same day or on the next day he would leave together with themOnce when for that reason the Elder Sariputta had arrived particularly late at the place where the others were resting he did not get proper quarters for the night and seated himself under a tent made from robesThe Master saw this and next day he caused the monks to assemble and told them the story of the elephant the monkey and the partridge who after deciding which was the eldest of them lived together showing respect for the seniormostHe then laid down the rule that lodgings should be allocated according to seniorityIn this way the Venerable Sariputta was a helper by giving material helpSometimes he would give material help and the help of the Dhamma together as when he visited Samitigutta who suffered from leprosy in the infirmaryThe Theragatha Commentary tells us that he said to Samitigutta Friend so long as the aggregates continue all feeling is just sufferingOnly when the aggregates are no more is there no more suffering Having thus given him the contemplation of feelings as subject of meditation Sariputta went awaySamitigutta following the Elders instruction developed insight and realised the six supernormal powers as an arahantAgain when Anathapindika was lying on his deathbed Sariputta visited him accompanied by AnandaSariputta preached to the dying man on nonattachment and Anathapindika was greatly moved by the profound discourseAnother sickbed sermon given by the Elder to Anathapindika is preserved in the SotapattiSamyuttaIn this discourse Anathapindika is reminded that those things which lead to rebirth in states of woe are no longer in him but that he possesses the four basic qualities of streamentry and the eight path factors in considering this his pains would subsideAs the result his pains did subsideOnce the Elder Channa was lying ill and in great painThe Venerable Sariputta paid him a visit in company with the Elder Maha CundaSeeing the sick monks agonies Sariputta at once offered to go in search of medicines and suitable food for himBut Channa told them he had decided to take his life and after they had left he did soAfterwards the Buddha explained that the Elder Channas act was without demerit and blameless since he had attained Arahatship while dyingThis story is found in the Channovada SuttaIt is said that whenever Sariputta gave advice he showed infinite patience he would admonish and instruct up to a hundred or a thousand times until his pupil was established in the Fruition of streamentryOnly then did he discharge him and give his advice to othersVery great was the number of those who after receiving his instruction and following it faithfully attained to ArahatshipIn the Saccavibhanga Sutta the Buddha says Sariputta is like a mother who brings forth while Moggallana is like a nurse of that which has been brought forthSariputta trains to the Fruit of streamentry and Moggallana trains to the highest goalExplaining this passage the Commentary says When Sariputta accepted pupils for training whether they were ordained by him or by others he favored them with his material and spiritual help looked after them in sickness gave them a subject of meditation and at last when he knew that they had become streamwinners and had risen above the dangers of the lower worlds he dismissed them in the confident knowledge that Now they can by their own manly strength produce the higher stages of Saintship Having thus become free from concern about their future he instructed new groups of pupilsBut Maha Moggallana when training pupils in the same way did not give up concern for them until they had attained ArahatshipThis was because he felt as was said by the Master As even a little excrement is of evil smell I do not praise even the shortest spell of existence be it no longer than a snap of the fingers But although the Majjhima Commentary says that Sariputta used to lead his regular pupils only up to streamentry in individual cases he helped monks to attain the higher stagesThe Udana Commentary for example says that at that time bhikkhus in higher training often used to approach the Venerable Sariputta for a subject of meditation that could help them to attain the three higher Paths It was after taking instruction from Sariputta that the Elder Lakuntika Bhaddiya attained Arahatship having been a streamwinner at the timeThere is also the case of the Venerable Anuruddha referred to on pIt was in this manner that the Venerable Sariputta gave the help of the DhammaHe was a great leader of men and an outstanding spiritual adviserTo the latter task he brought not only a keen and perceptive understanding of the human mind but also a warm human interest in others which must have been a great encouragement to those under his spiritual guidanceWe have already seen how ready he was to give generous praise where it was due he was also keen at all times to meet noble monks particularly those whom the Master had commendedOne such was the Elder Punna Mantaniputta when Sariputta learned that he had come on a visit he went to meet himWithout telling him who he was he listened to Punnas great discourse the Stage Coach simile and when it was ended gave it high praiseAdministering to the physical as well as the spiritual needs of the monks under his charge restraining them with kindly admonitions and encouraging them with the praise their efforts deserved guiding them on the path showing in all he did that vital sympathetic interest which draws forth the best from a pupil Sariputta combined the qualities of a perfect teacher with those of a perfect friendHe was ready to help in every way in small things as in greatFilled with the virtue of the Holy Life himself he was quick to see virtue in others expert in developing it in those in whom it was latent and among the first to extol it where it was in full flowerHis was no cold aloof perfection but the richest intermingling of spiritual exaltation with the qualities that are finest and most endearing in a human beingTwo stanzas in the Theragatha relate in words ascribed to the Venerable Sariputta himself the way in which he attained ArahatshipThere he tells usIn the next two verses the Elder declares that he felt no inclination to develop the five supernormal powersHowever the IddhividhaKatha of the Patisambhida Magga credits him with possessing the intensive degree of meditative concentration called the power of intervention by concentration which is capable of intervening in certain normal physiological processes or other natural eventsThis is illustrated by the anecdote in the Visuddhimagga ChXII which records that once when the Venerable Sariputta was living with the Elder Maha Moggallana at Kapotakandara he was sitting meditating in the open with his hair freshly shaved when he was given a malicious blow on the head by a mischievous spiritThe blow was a very severe one but at the time it was given the Elder was absorbed in meditative attainment consequently he suffered no harm The source of this story is the Udana which continues the account as followsI am comfortable brother Moggallana said the Venerable SariputtaI am doing well brother MoggallanaOnly my head troubles me a littleWhereupon the Venerable Maha Moggallana said O wonderful is it brother SariputtaO marvelous is it brother SariputtaHow great is the psychic power and how great is the might of the Venerable SariputtaFor just now brother Sariputta a certain demon gave you a blow on the headAnd a mighty blow it wasWith such a blow one might fell an elephant seven or seven and a half cubits high or one might split a mountain peakBut the Venerable Sariputta says only this I am comfortable brother MoggallanaI am doing well brother MoggallanaOnly my head troubles me a little Then the Venerable Sariputta replied O wonderful is it brother MoggallanaO marvelous is it brother MoggallanaHow great is the psychic power and how great is the might of the Venerable Moggallana that he should see any demon at allAs for me I have not seen so much as a mudspriteThe Anupada Sutta contains a description of Sariputtas attainments given by the Buddha himselfIn it the Blessed One declares that the Venerable Sariputta had mastered the nine meditative attainments that is the four finematerial and four immaterial jhanas and the cessation of perception and feelingAnd in the Sariputta Samyutta the Venerable Elder mentions the fact himself in speaking to Ananda adding that in all the stages he was free of any selfreference I had no such thoughts as I am entering the jhana I have entered it I am rising from it And on another occasion he describes to Ananda how he attained to such developed concentration of mind that with regard to the earth element he was without perception of earth and so also in regard to the other three elements the four immaterial states and everything else pertaining to this world or even the world beyondYet it seems that he was not entirely without perception of another kind his only perception being that Nibbana is ceasing of comingtobeThis detached attitude to the jhanic attainments may have been due to the meditative abiding in voidness which the Venerable Sariputta cultivatedWe read in the Pindapataparisuddhi Sutta that the Buddha once remarked on the Venerable Sariputtas radiant features and asked him by which state of mind this radiance had been causedThe Venerable Sariputta replied that he frequently practiced the abiding in voidness upon which the Buddha said that this was the abode of great men and proceeded to describe it in detailThe Udana records that on three occasions the Master saw the Venerable Sariputta seated in meditation outside the monastery and uttered verses in praise of a firm and calm mindWe may perhaps imagine the Venerable Sariputta seated in meditation in a bower such as that mentioned in the Devadaha Sutta where it is said Once the Blessed One lived in the Sakya country at Devadaha a market town of the Sakyas At that time the Venerable Sariputta was seated not far from the Blessed One under an Elagala bush The Commentary to the text tells us At Devadaha there was a bower under an Elagala bushThis bush grows where there is a constant supply of flowing waterPeople had made a bower with four posts over which they let the bush grow forming a roofUnder it they made a seat by placing bricks there and strewing it with sandIt was a cool place for the daytime with a fresh breeze blowing from the water It may well have been in some such rustic shelter as this that the Buddha saw Sariputta deep in meditation on those occasions when he extolled his disciples tranquillity and detachmentConcerning his attainment to analytical knowledge the Venerable Sariputta speaks of it in the Anguttara Nikaya where he saysFrom all of this it is evident that the Venerable Sariputta was a master of all the stages of attainment up to and including the highest insightknowledgeWhat could be more aptly said of him than this in the Buddhas own wordsIf one could ever say rightly of one that he is the Blessed Ones true son born of his speech born of the Dhamma formed of the Dhamma heir to the Dhamma not heir to worldly benefit it is Sariputta that one could thus rightly declareAfter me O monks Sariputta rightly turns the supreme Wheel of Dhamma even as I have turned it Majjh Anupada SuttaThe discourses of Sariputta and the books attributed to him form a comprehensive body of teaching that for scope and variety of exposition can stand beside that of the Master himselfSariputta understood in a unique way how to organize and present the rich material of the Dhamma lucidly in a manner that was intellectually stimulating and also an inspiration to practical effortWe find this exemplified in two classic discourses of the Majjhima Nikaya the Sammaditthi Sutta and the Greater Sutta on the Elephant Footprint SimileThe Greater Discourse on the Elephant Footprint Simile is a masterpiece of methodical treatmentIt begins with the statement that the Four Noble Truths comprise everything that is salutary then singles out the Truth of Suffering as being identifiable with the five aggregates of personalityFrom these the aggregate of corporeality is chosen for detailed investigation it is shown to consist of the four great elements each of which is said to be internal and externalThe bodily parts and functions belonging to the internal element are stated in detail and it is said of both the internal and external elements that they neither belong to a self nor constitute a selfThis insight leads to disgust and detachment regarding the elementsThe discourse then goes on to show the impermanence of the mighty external elements when they are involved in great upheavals of nature and against that background it is stressed that this tiny body the product of craving can never be regarded as I or mine or considered in the sense of I am And when a monk who has this firm and deeply rooted insight meets with abuse blame and hostility on the part of others he is able to analyze the situation soberly and so remain master of itHe recognizes that the painful feeling that has arisen in him is produced by earcontact which is in itself no more than a conditioned phenomenon and of all the constituent parts of the situation he knows that they are impermanentThis he discerns with reference to contact feeling perception formations and consciousnessAt this point of the discourse we see that the other four aggregates the mental components of personality are introduced in an organic context together with the already mentioned factor of contactThe discourse then continues Then his mind just by taking only the elements as its object becomes elated gladdened firm and intent and even if he is beaten and injured he will think This body is of such a nature that is liable to such injuries Thereupon he recollects the Masters Simile of the Saw and will resolve to follow the Buddhas injunction to suffer all injuries in patience whatever may happen to himBut the sermon continues if when thus remembering the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha the monks equanimity does not endure he will be stirred by a sense of urgency and feel ashamed that in spite of that recollection of the Triple Gem he could not remain constantOn the other hand if his endurance persists he will experience happinessEven to this extent much has been achieved by that monk says the suttaHere all the four elements are treated identicallyThe concluding section starts by comparing the body and its constituent parts with a house which is made up of its various componentsAfter that follows an exposition of the conditioned arising of the sixfold perceptual consciousnessIn mentioning the five senseorgans and senseobjects as the basic conditions for the arising of fivesense consciousness derived corporeality is here introduced by means of a prominent part of it thus completing the treatment of the corporeal aggregateWith the state of consciousness having thus arisen all five aggregates are given and in that way their conjunction can be understood as well as their dependent originationAnd in this connection Sariputta quotes the Master He who understands dependent origination understands the Dhamma and he who understands the Dhamma understands dependent origination Desire inclination and attachment in regard to the five aggregates is the origin of sufferingRemoval of that desire inclination and attachment is the cessation of sufferingAnd of the monk who has understood this it is said Even to this extent much has been achieved by that monk Thus the exposition is rounded off with the Four Noble TruthsThis discourse is indeed like an intricate and beautifully constructed piece of music ending on a solemn and majestic chordAnother model exposition of the Venerable Sariputtas is the Sammaditthi SuttaThis is a masterpiece of teaching which also provides a framework for further elaboration such as given in the extensive commentary to itThe Commentary says In the Buddha Word as collected in the five great Nikayas there is no discourse other than the Discourse on Right Understanding wherein the Four Noble Truths are stated thirtytwo times and thirtytwo times the state of Arahatship The same discourse also gives us an original exposition of dependent origination with slight but very instructive variationsEach factor of dependent origination is used as are also the additional sections to illustrate the right understanding of the Four Noble Truths the comprehension of which is thus greatly enhanced broadened and deepenedThis discourse has been widely used for instructional purposes throughout the centuries down to the present dayAnother of the Venerable Sariputtas discourses is the Samacitta Sutta which was listened to by the devas of tranquil mind It is concerned with the first three stages of sanctitude the streamwinner the oncereturner and the nonreturnerIts purpose is to clarify the question of their residuum of rebirths in the fivesense world or in the finematerial and nonmaterial worlds which depends upon their mode of practice and on the fetters of existence still remainingIt is a very short discourse but had a singular impact on the huge assembly of devas who according to tradition assembled to hear itIt is said that a very large number of them attained Arahatship and innumerable were those who reached streamentryThis discourse of the Venerable Sariputta is in fact counted among the few which had unusually farreaching results among beings of the higher worlds and although it is a very brief text rather cryptic without the commentarial explanation it had a high reputation in succeeding centuriesIt is the sermon that was preached by the arahant Mahinda on the evening of his arrival in Ceylon and the Mahavamsa Ceylons famous chronicle relates that on this occasion also numerous devas listened and achieved penetration of the DhammaThe high regard in which the discourse is held and the strong impact ascribed to it may be attributed to the fact that it helps those on the Path to define their position as to the kind of rebirths still to be expected by themDevas on higher levels of development are sometimes inclined to regard their heavenly status as final and do not expect to be reborn in the fivesense world as may sometimes be the caseThe Great Elders discourse gave them a criterion by which to judge their positionFor worldlings still outside the Paths as well it must have offered valuable orientation for the direction of their effortsThe Sangiti Sutta and Dasuttara Sutta two more of the Venerable Sariputtas sermons are the last two texts of the Digha Nikaya the Collection of Long DiscoursesBoth these texts are compilations of doctrinal terms in which a large number of topics are classified as falling into groups of from one to ten membersThe reason for bringing the compilation only up to ten may have been that there are only very few groups of doctrinal terms extending beyond ten members and these could be supposed to be well known and easily rememberedThe Sangiti Sutta was preached in the presence of the Buddha and at its conclusion received his express approvalWhile in the Sangiti Sutta the doctrinal terms are arranged solely in numerical groups of one to ten in the Dasuttara Sutta each of these ten groups has tenfold subdivision which serves to bring out the practical significance of these groups for exampleThese texts must have been compiled at a fairly late period of the Buddhas and the Venerable Sariputtas life when there was already in existence a large body of doctrine and carefully transmitted discourses which required organizing for ready use and also anthologies of salient features of the Dhamma became a useful aid in a comprehensive study of the TeachingThe Sangiti Sutta was delivered at the time of Nigantha Nataputtas death on the date of which however scholars differIt was in fact this event that occasioned the preaching of the sutta for it speaks of the dissensions schisms and doctrinal disagreements that arose among the Jains immediately after the death of their Master Nigantha Nataputta otherwise MahaviraThis was taken as a warning example by the Venerable Sariputta who in his discourse stresses that this text should be recited by all in concord and without dissension so that the Holy Life should last long for the welfare and happiness of gods and men The commentators say that the Sangiti Sutta is meant to convey the flavor of concord in the Teaching which is strengthened by doctrinal proficiencyThe practical purpose of the Dasuttara Sutta is indicated in the Venerable Sariputtas introductory versesDasuttaram pavakkhami dhammam nibbanappattiya dukkhas antakiriyaya sabbaganthapamocanamIt seems likely that these two suttas served as a kind of index to selected teachingsThey may have been useful also to those monks who did not memorize a great many texts to them they may have been helpful in presenting numerous aspects of the Teaching in a form that was easily memorized and assimilatedBoth of these discourses admirably illustrate the Venerable Sariputtas concern with the preservation of the Dhamma and his systematic way of ensuring that it was transmitted intact in all its detailsIt was for that purpose that he provided study aids such as these and other discourses together with works like the NiddesaA summary of other discourses given by the Venerable Sariputta is included at the end of this bookWe shall now turn to a consideration of larger canonical works attributed to himThe first is the Niddesa which belongs to the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitakait is the only work of an exclusively commentarial character included in the Pali TipitakaOf its two parts the Maha Niddesa is a commentary to the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipata while the Cula Niddesa comments on the Parayanavagga and the Khaggavisana Sutta likewise of the Sutta NipataThe Atthakavagga and the Parayanavagga are the last two books of the Sutta Nipata and doubtlessly belong to the oldest parts not only of that work but of the entire Sutta PitakaThey were highly appreciated even in the earlier days of the Sangha and of the Buddhist laity as well as is testified by the fact that the Udana records a recital of the Atthakavagga by Sona Thera and the Anguttara Nikaya a recital of the Parayanavagga by the female lay disciple NandamataOn at least five occasions the Buddha himself has given explanations of verses contained in these two parts of the Sutta NipataApart from the high esteem in which they were evidently held the fact that these two verse collections contain numerous archaic words and terse aphoristic sayings makes it understandable that in very early days a commentary on them was composed which was later included in the canonical scripturesThe traditional attribution of it to the Venerable Sariputta must be regarded as highly plausibleIt is quite in character with the great Elders concern with the methodical instruction of bhikkhus that the Niddesa contains not only word explanations clarifications of the context and supporting quotations from the Buddha Word but also material obviously meant for linguistic instruction such as the addition of many synonyms of the word explainedOn this subject ProfEJThomas writes as followsThe Venerable Sariputta states that he attained to the four kinds of analytical knowledge two weeks after his ordination that is on attaining ArahatshipThis fact and the extensive application of niruttipatisambhida grammatical analysis in the Niddesa make it quite probable that he was actually the author of both the Niddesa and the Patisambhida MaggaThe Maha Niddesa contains also the commentary on the Sariputta Sutta which forms the last text of the AtthakavaggaThe first part of this text with verses in praise of the Master and questions put to him is ascribed to SariputtaThe Maha Niddesa explains the opening stanza as referring to the Buddhas return from Tavatimsa heaven after he had preached the Abhidhamma thereApart from that it contains only his questions the essential part of the text being the Buddhas repliesThe Patisambhida Magga has the appearance of a manual of higher Buddhist studies and its range is as broad as that of the mind of its reputed authorAt the beginning it presents treatises on types of knowledge and on the types of wrong speculative views both of which show the methodical and penetrative mind of the Venerable SariputtaIn the Treatise on Knowledge as well as in other chapters of the work there are found a large number of doctrinal terms appearing for the first time and only in the Patisambhida MaggaIt also contains elaborations of terms and teachings that are mentioned only briefly in other and older parts of the Sutta PitakaIn addition to this it contains material on meditation of great practical value as for example on mindfulness of breathing mettabhavana and numerous insightexercisesThere is also to give variety to the subject matter a passage of hymnic character and great beauty on the Great Compassion of the TathagataMahanama Thera of Ceylon who wrote the Saddhammappakasini the commentary to the work confidently ascribes it to the Venerable Sariputta and in the introductory stanzas gives eloquent praise of the great ElderIn the Patisambhida Magga itself Sariputta is mentioned twice once as being one who possesses samadhivippharaiddhi and again in the Mahapaññakatha Solasapaññaniddesa where it is said Those whose wisdom is equal to that of Sariputta they partake to some extent of the BuddhaknowledgeWe come now to one of the most important contributions made by the Venerable Sariputta to Buddhist teachingAccording to tradition the Buddha preached the Abhidhamma in the Tavatimsa heaven to his mother Queen Maya who had been reborn as deva in that worldHe did this for three months and when returning daily to earth for his meals he gave to the Venerable Sariputta the method of that portion of Abhidhamma he had preachedThe Atthasalini says Thus the giving of the method was to the Chief Disciple who was endowed with analytical knowledge as though the Buddha stood on the edge of the shore and pointed out the ocean with his open handTo the Elder the doctrine taught by the Blessed One in hundreds and thousands of methods became very clear Thereafter the Elder passed on what he had learned to his five hundred disciplesFurther it is said The textual order of the Abhidhamma originated with Sariputta the numerical series in the Great Book was also determined by himIn this way the Elder without spoiling the unique doctrine laid down the numerical series in order to make it easy to learn remember study and teach the LawThe Atthasalini the Commentary to the Dhammasangani also ascribes to Sariputta the following contributions to the canonical Abhidhamma
