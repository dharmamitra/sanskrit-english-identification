Even so for a Bodhisattva which trains in perfect wisdom any unwholesome dharmas are stopped as only noncognition is stopped and all these perfections are included in this and automatically revealed and realized Merit from Perfect Wisdom Here and now Subhuti a Bodhisattva which has aspirations to reveal and realize all perfections trains in this perfection of wisdom As one single Bodhisattva during ones entire life furnishes all these beings with robes alms bowl lodging medicinal appliances for use in sickness and all which brings these happiness  does such a Bodhisattva on the strength of this beget a great deal of merit One does O Lord Yet Subhuti a different and unthinkable merit still does this Bodhisattva beget as a result of developing this perfection of wisdom of buddhanature for even the duration of a fingersnap So greatly profitable is this perfection of wisdom of Bodhisattvas as she feeds these revelations of this supreme enlightenment A Bodhisattva here now trains in perfecting wisdom as this aspiration to full realization revealed as this supreme position common to all beings as a protector of any which are helpless and helps these to reach this sphere of the Buddha to emulate the humaness of the Buddha to sport as a Buddhas sport to roar a Buddhas lion roar to reach the accomplishment of a Buddha and to explain this dharma in this great trichiliocosm As a Bodhisattva trains in this perfection of wisdom I do not see the accomplishment in which one does not train Bodhisattvas and Disciples Subhuti Is now a Bodhisattva also trained in this accomplishment of a Sravaka a Disciple As one trains thus a Bodhisattva is revealed in a condition here as one worthy of receiving gifts from the world with its Gods beings and Asuras As one trains thus a Bodhisattva does not part from this perfection of wisdom but courses in this is not lacking in the dwelling of this perfection of wisdom As one courses thus a Bodhisattva is known as unfailing definitely unfailing with regard to allknowledge and does not settle on any level of a Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha As however such may occur to this one this is the perfection of wisdom which brings this allknowledge now one which has such a notion does not course in this perfection of wisdom On the contrary any such as this have no notion whatsoever of perfecting wisdom Do not perceive or review this is the perfection of wisdom or this is the perfection of wisdom or this feeds allknowledge As one courses thus a Bodhisattva courses in this perfection of wisdom Sakra Praises the Bodhisattvas So now it occurs to Sakra Chief of Gods A Bodhisattva even as one courses only just so far surpasses all how much more so as one knows full enlightenment To be emulated are these the very cream of all beings which realize full enlightenment So here Sakra Chief of Gods conjured up Mandarava flowers saluted these reverently scattered these over Tathagata and said May any persons who are avowed to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas and who have revealed and realized thoughts to full enlightenment succeed in their resolve to know full enlightenment and beyond this to transfer any and all beings which are borne along by the great flood of birthanddeath to the smooth yonder shore May this thought of enlightenment which these wish for think over and take hold of bring to fulfillment any dharmas of a Buddha and dharmas in accord with allknowledge dharmas of the SelfExistent insuperable dharmas On the contrary I am sure this resolve to reveal and realize full enlightenment increases more and more in these as these survey the ills which afflict beings on the plane of birthanddeath For through great compassion these desire the welfare of this world with its Gods beings and Asuras are of an aspiration to benefit this are full of pity for this these who are endowed with this attitude of mind dwell in the attitude of mind which is expressed in this resolutionwe have crossed over we help beings to cross over Gone to Nirvana we lead these to Nirvana Gat Gat Paragat Parasamgat Bodhi Svaha Jubilation Turning Over and Merit Any son or daughter of good family who rejoice at this production of thought of any Bodhisattvas who are just now set out in the vehicle as well as at this production of thought of any which realize progression as always on course as well as at this irreversible nature of any which realize irreversibility as well as at this nature of any which inevitably realize one birth only to what extent is their merit a different one The Lord One might be able Kausika to grasp the measure of Sumeru king of mountains or of a world system up to a great trichiliocosm with the help of a tip of straw but one can not possibly grasp any measure of merit coming to these sons or daughters of good family or to a Bodhisattva from the production of this thought connected with that jubilation Seen as and thought of as beset by Mara are any beings which do not hear of this immeasurable merit of jubilation over the career of a Bodhisattva which begins with the first thought of enlightenment  and which ends with full enlightenment  which do not know it which do not see it which do not bring this jubilation to mind These are seen as partisans of Mara deceased in Maras realms For any which bring to mind these thoughts which turn these over into the supreme enlightenment rejoice at these such do so in order to bring to realization Maras realm as this truly is So it is Kausika And sons or daughters of good family who have rejoiced in the stages of the thought of enlightenment these do  whether these belong to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas or of the Pratyekabuddhas or of the Disciples  soon please the Tathagatas and not displease such as these Here and now these are reborn as a result of the wholesome roots  as hearts are filled with jubilation here these are treated with respect revered worshipped and adored These never see any unpleasant sights nor hear any unpleasant sounds nor smell any unpleasant smells nor taste any unpleasant tastes  nor come into contact with anything unpleasant to the touch One realizes these things to be reborn in the wholesome roots of countless beings roots which bring happiness to all beings The thoughts of jubilation of any beings which as producing an aspiration towards enlightenment rejoice over the successive stages of the thought of enlightenment  in persons who aspire to the vehicle of Bodhisattvas as these thoughts increase are nourishers of full enlightenment So it is Kausika as you say through Tathagatas might The wholesome roots of countless beings are rejoiced over planted and consummated as a consequence of these actions of sons or daughters of good family who rejoice over the successive stages of the thought of enlightenment in these persons who belong to this vehicle of the Bodhisattvas But how can a thought which is like illusion know full enlightenment Subhuti do you see the thought which is like illusion as a separate real entity So as you see neither illusion nor the thought which is like illusion as a real separate entity do you now perhaps see this dharma which knows full enlightenment as something other than illusion or as something other than the thought which is like illusion In consequence to which dharma can I point and say it is or it is not To a dharma which is absolutely isolated one cannot attribute it is or it is not Also any absolutely isolated dharma can not know full enlightenment But any dharma which is absolutely isolated this is not a dharma which can be developed nor does this bring about or remove any dharma So how can a Bodhisattva by resorting to an absolutely isolated perfection of wisdom know full enlightenment Even full enlightenment is absolutely isolated As O Lord the perfection of wisdom is absolutely isolated and as full enlightenment is absolutely isolated how can the isolated become known through the isolated So it is Subhuti It is just as this perfection of wisdom is absolutely isolated that absolutely isolated full enlightenment is known  But as a Bodhisattva forms such a notion as the perfection of wisdom is absolutely isolated this is not the perfection of wisdom It is thus certain thanks to perfecting wisdom a Bodhisattva can know full enlightenment and one cannot know this without resorting to this A doer of what is hard is the Bodhisattva which courses in an unfathomable object and which yet does not realize such object or Subhuti As I understand the meaning of the Lords teaching here is in this way no Bodhisattva at all which is any doer of what is hard As this very dharma is not got at which is realized nor anything whatsoever which can be revealed or realized nor anything whatsoever by means of which one can realize So as this is being taught as a Bodhisattva is not despondent cowed or stolid does not turn back and remains unafraid this one courses in perfect wisdom As one does not review this as a real fact one is near to full enlightenment one such as this courses in perfect wisdom This does not occur to space I am near to this or I am far from that for space can not make such discriminations just so it can not in truth occur to a Bodhisattva which courses in perfect wisdomfull enlightenment is near to me the level of Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha is far from me The perfection of wisdom does not make any discriminations It is as with a man created by magical illusion to which  it does not occur the conjurer is near to me but this assembled crowd of spectators is far from me For illusory men make no such discriminations It is as with the reflection of an object in a mirror or in water to which it does not occur the object which produces the reflection is near to me but these who come along and cast the reflection in the mirror or in water are far from me For this reflection of an object makes no discrimination Just as Tathagata is one which forsakes all constructions and discriminations even so perfect wisdom forsakes all constructions and discriminations It does not occur to a fictitious creature which Tathagata magically conjures up the level of Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas is far from me full enlightenment is near to me for any fictitious creature can not make any discriminations In the same way a Bodhisattva which courses in perfect wisdom does not think the level of Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas is far from me full enlightenment is near to me and this simply due to an absence of any and all discrimination on the part of the perfection of wisdom A fictitious creature  to do a certain work  performs this work but remains without discrimination just due to being so constituted as it lacks all discrimination Just so a Bodhisattva performs the work for the sake of which one develops this perfection of wisdom but this perfection of wisdom remains without discrimination due to the fact as it is so constituted it lacks all discrimination An expert mason or masons apprentice makes of wood an automatic man or woman a puppet which can be moved by pulling the strings Whatever action it is made to perform this action it performs yet this wooden machine has no discrimination Just due to the fact as it is so constituted that it lacks all discrimination Just so a Bodhisattva performs this work for the sake of which one develops this perfection of wisdom but this perfection of wisdom remains without discrimination just due to the fact as this perfection of wisdom is so constituted it lacks all discriminations This is not hard for these Bodhisattvas that these do not realize any realitylimit This however is hard for these this is most hard for these  as these put on this armor of this resolution to lead countless beings to Nirvana but now absolutely such beings do not exist And since these do not exist these cannot be got at Owing to isolatedness of beings these who are disciplined thus absolutely do not exist It is in this spirit the Bodhisattva set out toward revealing full enlightenment and decides to discipline beings For isolatedness of beings is known only as is the design of isolatedness of space  In this way also Bodhisattvas are doers of what is hard as these put on this armor for the sake of beings who do not exist who cannot be got at But this nonapprehension of beings in  absolute reality is taught by Tathagatas For from the isolatedness of a being is known the isolatedness of form feeling perception impulse and consciousnessand this the same of all dharmas Thus is the isolatedness of all dharmas viewed For what reason does a Bodhisattva not lose heart as the isolatedness of all dharmas is thus taught The Lord So it is Subhuti The Bodhisattva Protected by the Gods and against Mara Subhuti So it is And with the Buddhaeye Tathagatas within any present moment residing in countless world systems behold these Bodhisattvas thus coursing in perfect wisdom and these help such a one and bring one to mind This is quite certain Subhuti these Bodhisattvas coursing in perfect wisdom and being helped and brought to mind by Tathagatas are borne in mind as irreversible from full enlightenment being revealed and realized as such Even as all beings in the great trichiliocosm are seen as being evil Maras and each one of these conjure up just as many diabolic armies  even these all together have not the strength to obstruct on ones way to full enlightenment any Bodhisattva brought to mind by the Buddhas and coursing in perfect wisdom And this remains true even as all the beings in all the countless trichiliocosms are seen as evil Maras and as each one of these conjures up just as many diabolic armies The endowment with these two dharmas safeguards a Bodhisattva against all attacks which are seen and thought of as coming from the Maras or their hosts  One can not abandon any being and  One surveys all dharmas as reflected from emptiness Two other dharmas have this same effect  As one speaks so one acts and  One is brought to mind by the Buddhas the Lords As a Bodhisattva courses thus the Gods also decide to go up to one such as this Thus you offer safety to the helpless defense of the defenseless a refuge to these without refuge a place of rest to these without resting place the final relief of these who are without this an island to any without one a light to the blind a guide to the guideless a resort to any without one and you guide to the path any who have lost this herein you become a support to ones who are without support The Buddhas Praise the Bodhisattva The Buddhas Lords who reside in countless worldsystems and who demonstrate dharma surrounded by a congregation of monks and attended by a multitude of Bodhisattvas proclaim the name clan power appearance and form of a Bodhisattva which courses and dwells in perfect wisdom and is endowed with the virtues of roaming in perfect wisdom perfecting wisdom And these demonstrate Dharma and exult over this Bodhisattva proclaiming name clan power color and form Just here and now I demonstrate dharma and I proclaim the name etc of the Bodhisattva Ratnaketu and of the Bodhisattva Sikhin I exult over these and also over the other Bodhisattvas which just now lead the holy life with Tathagata Akshobhya Do the Buddhas honor all Bodhisattvas in such a manner Apart from the irreversible Bodhisattvas do the Buddhas in such a manner honor any other Bodhisattvas These are persons belonging to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas who are strong in assimilating what may be seen as an enemy These are  just now engaged in learning this course of a Bodhisattva under Tathagata Akshobhya and the Bodhisattva Ratnaketu courses here on the pilgrimage of a Bodhisattva and dwells engaged in learning it In addition these Bodhisattvas which course in perfect wisdom and resolutely believe all dharmas fail to be produced without however so far acquiring definitely the patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced as well as these which resolutely believe all dharmas are calmly quiet without however having entered into accord with the irreversible domain over all dharmas any Bodhisattvas which dwell in this dwelling are honored by the Buddhas in the above manner Bodhisattvas of whom the Buddhas proclaim the name etc and over whom these exult have forsaken the level of the Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas and one can well see these come to be on the level of the Buddha For Bodhisattvas of whom the Buddhas proclaim the name etc and over whom these exult also stand in irreversibility Enlightenment and Suchness In addition to this Subhuti Bodhisattvas stand in irreversibility as upon hearing this deep perfection of wisdom being taught these resolutely believe in this are not stupefied do not hesitate or doubt as in this resolute belief so it is as Tathagata teaches these go on listening to this in greater detail and as these make up their minds to listen in still greater detail to this perfection of wisdom in the presence of Tathagata Akshobhya and as these resolutely believe from just hearing this perfection of wisdom in the presence of persons avowed to this vehicle of the Bodhisattvas which in this Buddhafield lead the holy life As O Lord one cannot get at any different dharma distinct from Suchness what is this dharma which stands firmly in Suchness or which knows full enlightenment or which even can demonstrate this dharma One cannot get at any different dharma distinct from Suchness which stands firmly in Suchness This very Suchness to begin with is not apprehended how much less one which stands firmly in Suchness Suchness does not know full enlightenment and no dharma is got at which knows full enlightenment can do so or does do so You say Kausikadoers of what is hard are Bodhisattvas which as dharmas as deep as these are being taught feel neither hesitation nor stupefaction But as all dharmas are empty who can herein feel hesitation or stupefaction Now perhaps O Lord I as I take into consideration Subhuti the Elder and teach as he thus teaches and expounds may be one who correctly preaches Tathagatatruth a preacher of Dharma and one who declares also the logical sequence of dharma So it is Kausika As you come to teach and expound as he does you come to be one who correctly preaches Tathagatatruth a preacher of dharma and one who declares also the dharmas logical sequence For whatever  the Elder Subhuti makes clear this he makes clear with reference to emptiness As the Elder Subhuti does not to begin with even review or apprehend perfection of wisdom how much less one coursing in perfection of wisdom Enlightenment even to begin with he does not get at how much less at one who knows full enlightenment Even all knowledge he does not get at how much less at one who reaches unto allknowledge Even Suchness he does not get at how much less at one who becomes a Tathagata Even nonproduction he does not get at how much less at one who fully has awoken to enlightenment Even the powers Subhuti does not get at how much less at one who possesses the powers Even the grounds of selfconfidence he does not review how much less at one who is selfconfident Even the dharma he does not get at how much less at one who demonstrates dharma And this is quite certain this dwelling in isolatedness and baselessness of all dharmas on the part of Subhuti the Elder is of infinitesimal value compared with the dwelling of a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom perfecting herein and dwelling in this You see Kausika except for the dwelling of Tathagata this dwelling of a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom which dwells in it surpasses all other dwellings This dwelling is described as the foremost of all dwellings as the best the choicest the most excellent the most sublime the highest the supreme the unequalled the incomparable It surpasses the dwellings of all Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas The Prediction of Avakirnakusuma So at this time one of the Gods of the Thirtythree seized Mandarava flowers magnificent Mandarava flowers and comes here to the Lord And just at this time six thousand monks are assembled and seated in this assembly They rise from their seats put their upper robes over one shoulder place their right knees on the earth and salute the Lord with their hands together Through the Buddhas might their hands are now filled Mandarava flowers with magnificent Mandarava flowers They scatter these flowers over the Lord and speak These rays illuminate endless and boundless world systems with their luster rising right up even to this world of Brahma again returning from this world to the Lord circulate thrice round the Lord and now vanish again into the head of the Lord Here and now the venerable Ananda rises from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder placed his right knee on the earth placed his hands together and offered them and his entire being to the Lord and said It is not without reason the Tathagata manifests a smile What is the reason for your smile O Lord The Lord now speaks and says These six thousand monks Ananda in a future period in the Starlike aeon do finally come to know full enlightenment and within this demonstrate dharma to beings These all bear the same name With Avakirnakusuma for their name these Tathagatas are teachers in the world These all live the same length of time ie twenty thousand aeons Each one of these have an extensive holy writ which spreads widely among Gods and beings In each case their good law abides for the same length of time for twenty thousand aeons And showers of flowers of all the five colors descends upon all of these  wherever they may leave a home which they had in a village town or marketplace or wherever they may turn once again the wheel of dharmas wherever they may dwell wherever they may appear  With any Bodhisattvas coursing in perfecting this wisdom within and actually becoming this and adapting this as oneself ones such as these can be quite certain of having before one is reborn here among people deceased among people or among the heavenly hosts of the Tushitas For it is among people and Tushita Gods this perfection of wisdom circulates to this full extent One can be certain Tathagatas behold such Bodhisattvas as course in this perfection of wisdom learn this bear this in mind study speak of repeat or merely write this and also instruct any other Bodhisattvas admonish instigate and encourage these These do not only in the presence of Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas plant wholesome roots so as to train self and others in perfect wisdom but without any doubt these Bodhisattvas training in this perfection of wisdom and remaining unafraid plant wholesome roots with Tathagatas Any taking up this perfection of wisdom bear this in mind study speak of repeat and write this which pursue this  in its meaning contents and method  one can be quite certain these have been face to face with Tathagatas As Bodhisattvas do not revile this perfection of wisdom neither oppose deny nor reject this one can know these fulfill their inclinations indicated under Jinas these Buddhas of this past As a rule as a matter of imperishable principle struck by the complete interdependence of any and all dharmas such Bodhisattvas are grateful and practice this perfection of wisdom with no stopping whatsoever even beyond these forms feelings perceptions impulses or any consciousness of such dharmas Transmission of the Sutra to Ananda So here now Ananda again and again I entrust and transmit to you this perfection of wisdom laid out in letters so this is available for learning bearing in mind discoursing studying and spreading wide so this lasts long so this does not disappear As Ananda you forget all the demonstrations of dharma which you learn directly from me  the perfection of wisdom being this lone exception  as you cast these away and allow these to be forgotten this is but a slight offence against Tathagatas But consider as you forget cast away and allow to be forgotten only one verse of this perfection of wisdom or merely a part of a verse this is a serious  offence against Tathagatas and this displeases me And as you learn this perfection of wisdom and you forget this cast this away allow this to be forgotten you fail in the respect reverence and worship afforded Tathagatas past future and present all together For Tathagatas say this perfection of wisdom is mother this sourceless source the generatrix of past future and present Tathagatas the nurse in allknowledge Here and now Ananda do I entrust and transmit to you this perfection of wisdom so it does not disappear And as one learns this one carefully analyzes this grammatically letter by letter syllable by syllable word by word As the dharmabody of past future and present Tathagatas is this dharmatext authoritative This is a way for you or any to worship this is a way to show affection serene faith and respect for the past future and present Buddhas and Lords As I a Tathagata am dear and pleasant to you Ananda and you do not abandon me here and now may this perfection of wisdom be dear and pleasant to you and may you not abandon this may you not forget even one single word of this so this does not disappear For long I speak to you about this bestowal of perfection of wisdom for one kalpa or for the remainder of a kalpa for one hundred kalpas for up to hundreds of thousands of kotis of kalpas and more In this same way in which the past future and present Buddhas and Lords are teachers of the world with its Gods beings and Asuras just so is this perfection of wisdom Here and now Ananda  with a measureless bestowal I entrust and transmit to you this perfection of wisdom which is beyond any measure whatsoever for the benefit and happiness of the world with its Gods beings and Asuras And here is this further admonition  as these who learn this perfection of wisdom bear this in mind study repeat write and develop this these assist in enlightenment of the past future and present Buddhas and Lords For whoever assists this perfection of wisdom as it is either thought to be or seeming to crumble away such a one assists in enlightenment of the past future and present Buddhas and Lords From this perfection of wisdom does enlightenment of Buddhas and Lords come forth And this holds good of all Tathagatas whether past future or present Here and now a Bodhisattva which has aspiration to know full enlightenment and to train in the six perfections listens to this perfection of wisdom studys repeats and writes this  and one trains in this very perfection of wisdom and makes endeavours around about and within this This perfection of wisdom is mother this sourceless source and generatrix of Bodhisattvas It is due to this perfection of wisdom any Bodhisattvas ever train in the six perfections and at any time progress to full enlightenment It is due to just this perfection of wisdom Bodhisattvas progress in the six perfections as all these perfections come to nourish this which provides dissolution of defilements and revelations toward supreme enlightenment as these are indicated and revealed from this perfection of wisdom Here and now Ananda again and again for a second time for a third time do I entrust and transmit this perfection of wisdom to you so it does not disappear For this perfection of wisdom is the inexhaustible storehouse of the dharma of Tathagatas The dharma which Buddhas and Lords demonstrate to beings in this past period in these worlds of birthanddeath with no beginning or end all this is indicated and revealed from just this storehouse of dharma from this perfection of wisdom As well this dharma which the Buddhas and Lords demonstrate to beings reveals also full enlightenment in any future period for any such as have a view which leads beyond these measureless worlds of birthanddeath also as is indicated and revealed from just this storehouse of dharma this perfection of wisdom And also the Buddhas and Lords just now residing in countless world systems and demonstrating dharma these also derive revelation from just this storehouse of dharma this perfection of wisdom As inexhaustible here and now is this storehouse of dharma this perfection of wisdom still and after all As Ananda you demonstrate dharma on the Disciplelevel to persons who take vows to the vehicle of the Disciples and as a result of your demonstration of dharma all the beings in the great trichiliocosm realize Arhatship you do not do your duty as my disciple as in this way you keep moving as I the wheel of dharma and demonstrate dharma As you consider this demonstration of dharma of yours through which the beings in this great trichiliocosm all are induced to attain Arhatship and of these Arhats the meritorious work founded on giving on morality and on meditational development continues does all this constitute a great heap of merit It would O Lord A person who has taken vows to the vehicle of the Disciple begets a different and immeasurable merit as this one demonstrates to Bodhisattvas the dharma associated with the perfection of wisdom This merit is different as it is a Bodhisattva who demonstrates to another Bodhisattva  dharma associated with this perfection of wisdom for even one single day only for a morning for an hour for half an hour for a minute nay for a second for a moment or for an incidence of a single moment For this gift of dharma on the part of any Bodhisattva is different from all the wholesome roots of all who avow to the vehicle of the Sravakas Disciples or Pratyekabuddhas It is quite impossible for a Bodhisattva who is thus endowed as a Bodhisattva with wholesome roots who thus brings to mind this wholesome root to turn away from full enlightenment The entire assembly  monks nuns laymen and lay women Gods Nagas Yakshas Gandharvas Asuras Garudas Kinnaras Mahoragas humans and ghosts  these all through the Buddhas might  see this Tathagata Akshobhya surrounded by the congregation of monks accompanied by a retinue of Bodhisattvas demonstrating dharma in an assembly vast like the ocean deep and imperturbable surrounded and accompanied by Bodhisattvas which are endowed with unthinkable qualities all of these Arhats with outflows exhausted undefiled fully controlled quite freed in their hearts well freed and wise thoroughbreds great Serpents their work done their task accomplished their burden laid down their own weal accomplished with the fetters which bound these to become extinguished their hearts well freed by right understanding in perfect control of their entire hearts Here and now the Lord again withdrew his wonderworking power The Lord said to Ananda In this same way Ananda all dharmas do not come within the range of vision Dharmas do not come within the range of vision of dharmas dharmas do not see dharmas dharmas do not know dharmas All dharmas are of such a nature as these can be neither known nor seen and are incapable of doing anything All dharmas are inactive these cannot be grasped as these are as inactive as space All dharmas are unthinkable similar to illusory men All dharmas are unfindable as these in a state of nonexistence As one courses thus a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom and does not settle down in any dharma As a Bodhisattva aspires to reveal to realize great enlightenment which is perfection of all training one thus trains in and as perfecting wisdom As the training in perfect wisdom is described as the foremost of all trainings as the best the choicest the most excellent the most sublime the highest the utmost the unequalled the incomparable this is said to bring benefit and happiness to all the worlds this is described as a protector of the helpless it is ordained and extolled by the Buddha It does not occur to Buddhas and Lords that this great trichiliocosm has been lifted up has been dropped again for the perfect wisdom is endowed with immeasurable and incalculable qualities As a result of training in this training of perfect wisdom the Buddhas and Lords reach a state of nonattachment to past future and present dharmas Extinction NonExtinction and Perfect Wisdom Perfect wisdom is unlimited inexhaustible and boundless  for limits exhaustion and bounds are absent in perfect wisdom As this perfection of wisdom is unlimited inexhaustible and boundless I do not teach anything such as this perfection of wisdom has any limits can be exhausted or that this has any bounds As one cannot apprehend any isolatedness of any isolated dharma how much less can one here apprehend any definite circumference to any or all of this Thus beyond any and all measurement this perfection of wisdom is unlimited without any limits whatsoever The Tathagatas throughout and beyond all time draw strength from just this perfection of wisdom  and yet this is neither exhausted nor does this become extinct This also means Tathagatas of any future also draw strength from just this perfection of wisdom and yet this is neither exhausted nor does this become extinct These Tathagatas also just now residing in countless world systems these also draw strength from just this perfection of wisdom and yet it neither becomes exhausted nor extinct I also as a Tathagata just now also draw my strength from just this perfection of wisdom and yet this neither becomes exhausted nor extinct One can exhaust this perfection of wisdom no more than one can exhaust space And Subhuti said to the Lord How does a Bodhisattva consummate this perfection of wisdom Through nonextinction of ignorance of karmaformations of name and form of the six sensefields of contact of craving of grasping and attachments of becoming of birth of decay and death of grief lamentation pain sadness and despair In this manner the Bodhisattva surveys conditioned coproduction in such a way as one avoids any duality of the extremes For a Bodhisattva which while coursing in perfect wisdom through this consummation of nonextinction and surveying conditioned coproduction cannot stand on the level of Sravaka Disciple or Pratyekabuddha but must stand in allknowledge Some Bodhisattvas turn away from supreme enlightenment as due to not having resorted to these mental activities  and to skill in means these do not know how a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom consummates perfect wisdom through the consummation of nonextinction  nor how conditioned coproduction is surveyed in this perfection of wisdom through consummation of nonextinction Any Bodhisattvas at any time turning away from full enlightenment do so as these do not resort to skill in means Any Bodhisattvas at any time not turning away from full enlightenment do so due to this perfection of wisdom In this way a Bodhisattva which courses in perfection of wisdom consummates perfect wisdom through consummation of nonextinction A Bodhisattva which thus surveys conditioned coproduction does certainly not review any dharma as is being produced without a cause nor does one review any dharmas as permanent stable eternal not liable to reversal nor does one review any dharmas as a doer or a feeler At the time a Bodhisattva consummating the perfection of wisdom through the consummation of nonextinction surveys conditioned coproduction at this time one does not review form as a real separate entity nor feelings perceptions impulses or consciousness nor ignorance karmaformations etc to decay and death  sorrow lamentation pain sadness and despair nor does one review any fact this is my Buddhafield as real nor the fact that is another Buddhafield nor does one review as real any dharma by which one distinguishes between this and other Buddhafields This Subhuti is the perfection of wisdom of the Bodhisattvas the great beings Subhuti At any time as Bodhisattvas dwell in the dwelling of perfect wisdom all the Maras in the great trichiliocosm are thought of as feeling struck with the dart of great sorrow and these cannot sit still on their respective thrones So now Subhuti a Bodhisattva which aspires to reveal and realize full enlightenment of self and others as already in place courses in perfect wisdom In a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom the perfection of giving arrives at its most perfect development and so do perfections of morality patience vigour and concentration In such a one all six perfections arrive at the most perfect development and also all varieties of skill in means A Bodhisattva aspiring to acquire all the varieties of skill in means courses in perfect wisdom and develops this At any time in which a Bodhisattva courses in perfect wisdom and continuously aspires for this one brings to mind not only the Buddhas and Lords residing in countless world systems but also allknowledge which comes forth from perfection of wisdom But a Bodhisattva which even for one day or even for the duration of a fingersnap aspires for this perfection of wisdom begets different merit indeed receives winds other than a Bodhisattva which leans on a basis and for countless aeons gives gifts What future destiny can one expect a Bodhisattva to have which Tathagatas have brought to mind These are the qualities and advantages of a Bodhisattva coursing in perfection of wisdom and aspiring for perfect wisdom and raising such thoughts  even for the length of a finger snap What is more Subhuti a Bodhisattva approaches the perfection of wisdom as follows From the nondifferentiatedness of any and all dharmas In the conviction any and all talk about dharmas  consists in mere words mere conventional expressions  but these conventional expressions do not refer to anything real are not derived from anything real nor are these conventional expressions anything real In this conviction any and all dharmas lie outside conventional expression and discourse and it is not these which are conventionally expressed or uttered The Bodhisattva approaches the perfection of wisdom from unlimitedness of any and all dharmas From the fact any and all dharmas are perfectly pure in their original nature Suchness is everywhere sameness since any and all dharmas are already realized Nirvana In this conviction any and all dharmas do not come nor do these go these cannot be generated these are unbornthis nonbirth being absolute One such as this observes neither oneself nor others In this conviction any and all dharmas are holy Arhats perfectly pure in this original nature In this conviction any and all dharmas laid down this burden as no burden has ever been taken on by these Such ones approach prefection of wisdom from the fact any and all dharmas have neither place nor locality For form feeling perception impulses and consciousness are without place and locality in accordance with the ownbeing of original nature which is nobeing For form etc in their nature reality in their ownbeing are not either impassioned or dispassioned In the conviction the original nature  is perfectly pure In the conviction all dharmas are nonattached free from both attachment and nonattachment  In the conviction any and all dharmas are essentially enlightenment as these are equally understood by Buddhacognition From the Emptiness Signlessness and Wishlessness of all dharmas In the cognition any and all dharmas are essentially a healing medicine as controlled by friendliness and accord In the conviction all dharmas are dwellers in friendliness dwellers in compassion dwellers in sympathetic joy dwellers in impartiality In the conviction all dharmas are identified as this supreme universal spirit as in simply being no faults can arise as in essential being all faults remain unproduced In the conviction all dharmas are equally neither hopeful nor hostile One approaches this boundlessness of perfection of wisdom through  boundlessness of the ocean through  multicolored brilliance of Meru One approaches boundlessness of perfection of wisdom from boundlessness of form feeling perception impulses consciousness through  boundless illumination shed by the circle of the suns rays from boundlessness of all sounds from boundlessness of the final achievement of any and all dharmas of a Buddha from boundlessness  of the equipment of any worlds of limitless beings with merit and cognition from boundlessness of element earth and so from boundlessness of elements water fire air space and consciousness One approaches unlimitedness of perfection of wisdom from unlimitedness of the collection of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas from unlimitedness of the collection of all dharmas One approaches boundlessness of perfection of wisdom through acquisition of boundlessness of concentration on all dharmas from boundlessness of all Buddhadharmas from boundlessness of all dharmas from boundlessness of emptiness from boundlessness of thought and constituents from boundlessness of thoughts and actions One approaches measureless perfection of wisdom from measureless wholesome and unwholesome dharmas One approaches resounding declarations of perfection of wisdom through the  roaring of the lions roar One approaches the fact that perfection of wisdom cannot be shaken by outside factors from the fact that any and all dharmas cannot be shaken by outside factors For form etc is like the ocean Form and each skandha is like firmament like brilliant and multicolored Meru like production of the rays of the disk of the sun boundless like all sounds boundless like the whole world of beings boundless like final achievement of the dharmas of a Buddha boundless like equipment with merit and cognition of all beings in all worlds  this is like earth like water fire air space and consciousness this has no definite boundary like collection of all wholesome and unwholesome dharmas this has no definite boundary like collection of all dharmas Form is departure  the ownbeing of form is Buddhadharma which is essentially Suchness of form etc to consciousness is departure  the ownbeing of consciousness is the Buddhadharma which is essentially Suchness of consciousness Form and each skandha is boundless true nature of any and all dharmas Suchness as empty boundless true nature  boundlessness of thought and constituents which merely appears to give rise to thought and action which is apprehended as wholesome or unwholesome until nonapprehension it is as the lions roar it cannot be shaken by outside factors As the Bodhisattva approaches perfect wisdom in this way apperceives this enters into this understands this reflects on this examines investigates and develops this with acts of mind which abandon any and all deception and deceit any and all conceit any exaltation of self any and all laziness any deprecation of others notion of self any notion of a being gain honor and fame the five hindrances envy and meanness and any and all vacillation  so this is not hard for one to gain full perfection of all virtues of the Buddhafield and of supreme dharmas of a Buddha Subhuti How does Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita search for perfection of wisdom In the seclusion of a remote forest a voice in the air said to him In the East son of good family hear the perfection of wisdom And on your way do not pay attention to weariness of your body do not give in to any fatigue pay no attention to food or drink day or night or to cold or heat Do not make any definite plans either about inward or about outward things As one is turned away from Buddhadharmas one wanders in birthanddeath And as one wanders in birthanddeath one does not course in perfect wisdom and cannot reach perfection of wisdom Sadaprarudita said to the voice This is how from this point on I am and act accordingly As I aspire to indicate light to all beings as I aspire to procure the dharma of a Buddha Son of good family this search for perfect wisdom takes place as you produce the firm conviction all dharmas are void signless and wishless Treat as the Teacher any person from whom you come to hear perfection of wisdom be grateful and thankful and think  This is my good friend As I hear this perfection of wisdom from this one I gradually come to realize irreversibility from full enlightenment I draw nearer to Tathagatas and come to be reborn in Buddhafields in which Tathagatas are not lacking and avoiding unfortunate rebirths I accomplish auspicious rebirth As you weigh up such advantages you are bound to treat a monk speaking dharma as the Teacher Do not follow this one with motives of worldly gain but for love of dharma out of respect for dharma and the benefit of any and all beings Also see through things which are thought of or seen as Maras deeds for here always is appearing Mara the Evil One who may seem to suggest your teacher tends enjoys and honors things which are seen heard smelled tasted or touched while in actual fact the teacher does so from skill in means and has really risen above these Here now do not lose confidence in the teacher but say to yourself As all dharmas are empty of ownbeing  such can have no properties as appear to be these attributes of a living being such can have no life no individuality no personality such are as illusion a dream an echo a reflected image As you thus contemplate this true reality of all dharmas and follow what is spoken of Dharma you go forth in and as perfection of wisdom But watch out for seeing yet another deed of Mara As you may be disheartened at what the preacher of dharma has said let this not make you averse to perfection of wisdom but with a mind which desires only dharma which respects only dharma may you unwearied follow any monk which preaches Dharma After receiving this admonition from this voice the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita now journeys East Before long it occurs to him that he had not asked the voice how far he ought to go He stands still just at this crying sorrowful and lamenting For seven days he stays in this very spot waiting to be told how far to go to hear this perfection of wisdom and all this time he pays no attention to anything else and takes no food but simply pays homage to perfect wisdom waiting to be toldhow far he needs to go and how to do this Any person Subhuti who loses their only child are very sad and unhappy  and can think of one thing only the child and the sorrow felt due to this Even so this Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita can at this time think of nothing else except when then shall I hear this perfection of wisdom Description of Gandhavati and of Dharmodgatas Life As Sadaprarudita thus sorrows and pines away a Tathagataframe  stands here before him gives his approval and says Well spoken son of good family The Tathagatas of these three times while these are still Bodhisattvas as you are now also search for perfect wisdom in the same spirit in which you just now search for this Five hundred leagues away from here is a town called Gandhavati It is built of seven precious things It is twelve leagues long and twelve leagues broad and enclosed by seven walls seven moats and seven rows of palm trees It is prosperous and flourishing secure from attack contains abundant provisions and is full of beasts and beings And on each coping grows a tree made of the seven precious things laden with various fruits also made of precious things A network of small bells is fastened on strings and thus surrounds the entire city When stirred by the wind the small bells give out a sweet charming and delightful sound just like the sound from five musical instruments when they are played in harmony by the Gandharvas skilled in songs And this sound causes beings to divert enjoy and amuse themselves The moats all around the city are full of water which flows gently along neither too cold nor too hot The boats on this river are brilliant with the seven precious things beautiful to behold and existence is a reward of past deeds of inhabitants who aboard these divert enjoy and amuse themselves The water is everywhere covered with blossoms of the blue lotus of the pink lotus of the white lotus and with other most beautiful and fragrant flowers Here is not any species of flowers in the great trichiliocosm which is not found All around this city are five hundred parks beautiful to behold brilliant with the seven precious things Each park has five times five hundred large lotus ponds covered with beautiful blossoms each of the size of a cartwheel fragrant blue yellow red and white The sounds of geese cranes ducks curlews and other birds fill the air over the ponds And the existence of these parks which none regard as their own private property is a reward for past deeds of these beings for these have coursed for a long time in perfection of wisdom their minds faithfully devoted to this Guide of the Buddhas and bent on listening to her and understanding her and for a long time these remain intent on deep and even truly fathomless dharmas And here in this city of Gandhavati at a place four roads meet is the house of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata  one league all round with the seven precious things beautiful to behold enclosed by seven walls and seven rows of palm trees Here are four parks near the house for the enjoyment of these who live in it These are called Nityapramudita Asoka Sokavigata and Pushpacitra Each park has eight lotus ponds called Bhadra Bhadrottama Nandi Nandottama Kshama Kshamottama Niyata and Avivaha One side of each pond is gold the second of silver  the third of vaidurya the fourth of crystal The ground at the bottom consists of quartz with golden sand over it Each pond has eight stairs to it decorated with steps made of variegated jewels In the gaps between the steps inside the golden river Jambu grows a plantain tree The ponds are covered with various kinds of water flowers and the air above these is filled with the sounds of various birds Round these ponds grow various flowering trees and as these are stirred by the wind their flowers drop into the ponds The water in the ponds has the scent color taste and feel of sandalwood In this mansion lives Bodhisattva Dharmodgata with his retinue among these sixtyeight thousand women He diverts enjoys and amuses himself he feels and tastes the five kinds of sensepleasure All the inhabitants of this city both women and men divert enjoy and amuse themselves these have constant joy in the parks and on the ponds and feel and taste the five kinds of sensepleasure The Bodhisattva Dharmodgata however with his retinue diverts enjoys and amuses himself only for a certain time and so now also he always demonstrates perfection of wisdom And the citizens of this town built a pulpit for the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata in the central square of the town It has a golden base a cotton mattress is spread on this and a woolen cover a cushion and a silken cloth are put on top of this High up in the air half a Kos high here an awning shining with pearls even and firm All  round this pulpit flowers of the five colors are strewed and scattered and the pulpit itself is scented with various perfumes Seated on the pulpit the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata demonstrates perfection of wisdom Some of these explain perfection of wisdom some repeat it some copy it some follow it with wise attention Son of good family go to Bodhisattva Dharmodgata From him you hear perfection of wisdom For he is for a long time your good friend he summons you and even now instigates and encourages you to realize full enlightenment Before long you hear perfection of wisdom As the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita hears this he is contented elated joyful overjoyed and jubilant A man hit with a poisoned arrow can not think of anything else except Where do I find a surgeon a skilled physician who can pull out this arrow and free me from this suffering Just so Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita at this time pays no attention to any dharma except This surveys ownbeing of any and all dharmas The nonapprehension of ownbeing of any and all dharmas Nondifference of any and all dharmas Spectator of unchangeability of any and all dharmas Illuminator of any and all dharmas From any and all dharmas darkness vanished This shatters cognition of any and all dharmas This tosses any and all dharmas about The nonapprehension of any and all dharmas Bedecked with flowers Within this body this consummates any and all dharmas Having abandoned illusion Calling forth images reflected in a mirror Calling forth sounds of all beings Without any dirt Gladdening all beings A follower of vocal sounds of all beings from skill in means  Consummation of the whole variety of letters words and vocal sounds This state which comes from feeling no rigidity Inexpressible in essential nature Realization of unobstructed emancipation Visit from the king Grammatical analysis of speech into words and letters Insight into any and all dharmas This leaves the sphere of any and all dharmas beyond Unobstructed limit of any and all dharmas Fashioned as a firmament As a thunderbolt The king is near The unrivalled king Victorious One cannot avert this eye Fixed on this element of dharma Come out of this element of dharma Granter of consolation This roars like a lion No world for beings to be reborn in Free from dirt Undefiled Lotusarray Annihilation of hesitation Follower of any and all substantial excellence Situated beyond any and all dharmas Attainment of superknowledges powers and the grounds of selfconfidence Piercer of any and all dharmas Seal of desisting from becoming on the part of any and all dharmas The ocean in which any and all dharmas lose any becoming Spectator of any and all dharmas without distinction This leaves behind this jungle of any and all views and actions Without darkness Without a sign of any and all dharmas  Free from any and all attachment Without a trace of laziness This sheds light on deep dharmas Fashioned like Meru Irresistible This shatters what is seen as the circle of Maras army No inclination for anything in the triple world Emission of rays Sight of the Tathagata Spectator of all Tathagatas Established in these concentrations he now sees Buddhas and Lords in the countless world systems in the ten directions as these reveal this very perfection of wisdom to Bodhisattvas And these Tathagatas applaud and comfort him and these say to him We also in these three times as Bodhisattvas search for perfection of wisdom in just this same way We also as we search come to acquire by revelation these concentrations which you acquire just now Even after we acquire these we go on our route established in and transmitting perfection of wisdom and irreversible dharmas of a Buddha This absence of imaginings about any dharma whatsoeverthis is perfection of wisdom As we stand in firm absence of any and all selfconceited imaginings we naturally reveal our bodies of golden color these thirtytwo marks of Tathagatas these eighty accessory marks and these splendid haloes around us and reveal of us this unthinkable and yet supreme cognition of Buddhas this wisdom of Buddhas this supreme concentration of Buddhas and this perfection of all these dharmas and qualities of Buddhas and quite simply as all in allthis nature of Buddhas Even Tathagatas cannot grasp any measure nor define any boundary of this perfection of qualities how much less Sravakas Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas Here and now fill your mind with respect for these dharmas of Buddhas so you increasingly aspire toward these so you become more and more zealous for these For the good friend also arouses intense respect and affection and to be sure serenely keep your confidence in such For it is as we are taken hold of by these good friends Bodhisattvas quickly come to reveal realize and know full enlightenment Sadaprarudita asked the Tathagatas Who is our good friend A Tathagata replied The Bodhisattva Dharmodgata for a long time matures you toward this supreme enlightenment he upholds you he is your preceptor in perfecting this perfect wisdom in skill in means and in these dharmas of Buddha It is he who has upheld you and for this friendly deed you honor him in gratitude and thankfulness and bear in mind what he does for you As son of good family you for one aeon or for two aeons or for up to one hundred thousand aeons or more carry about the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata like a turban on your head furnish him with everything which makes beings happy and present him with as many forms sounds smells tastes and touchables as are in the great trichiliocosm   even so you can not have repaid this son of good family for what he does for you This has happened through his might as you have acquired these concentrations that you hear of perfection of wisdom and of skill in means and that you gain this perfection of wisdom Sadaprarudita and the Merchants Daughter As these Tathagatas comfort Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita they again disappear But Sadaprarudita emerged from his concentrations and asked himself whence do these Tathagatas come and whither do these go Since he no longer sees these Tathagatas he worries and pines away for these The holy Bodhisattva Dharmodgata has acquired the revelations of these dharanis in awareness and realization and likewise he possesses the five superknowledges he has performed his duties under the Jinas of these three times he is my patron and good friend who for a long time has done good all about me When I come to him I must ask him about this matter ask him to explain whence these Tathagatas come and whither these go Sadaprarudita here nursed affection and confidence esteem and respect for Bodhisattva Dharmodgata But I am poor and this now makes me sad and regretful Such are these feelings such these attitudes of reverence with which this Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita proceeded on his journey In due course he reaches a town goes to the midst of the marketplace and decides to sell his own body and with the price hereof do honor to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata As through the long night of past time in this measureless cycle of birthanddeath thousands of bodies of mine are shattered wasted destroyed and sold again and again I experience measureless pains in the hells for the sake of sense pleasures as a result of sense pleasures but never yet on behalf of dharmas of this kind never yet for this purpose of doing honor to beings of such a kind Sadaprarudita now goes to the middle of the marketplace lifted up his voice and cried Who wants a man Who wants a man For as he succeeds in selling himself out of concern for dharma and as he goes on to honor the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata and to ask him with regard to perfection of wisdom and skill in means just how a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom realizes full enlightenment he is bound to reach this ocean of sacred knowledge and become inaccessible to Mara and his host  and reaches the perfection of all qualities as he works the weal of all beings and takes these away from my sphere and others again he takes away as he realizes full enlightenment Mara the Evil One is thought of and seen to so dispose the Brahmins and householders in this town so that these can not hear the voice of Sadaprarudita As Sadaprarudita can not find a buyer for himself he goes to one side wailed shed tears and said Alas it is hard on us this as we do not find a buyer even for our body so we could by selling our body honor the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata  So now Sakra Chief of Gods thinks to himself Let me weigh up the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita Does he now filled with earnest intention renounce his body out of concern for dharma or does he not Sakra conjured up the guise of a young man goes to the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and says to him Why do you son of good family stand here dejected pining away and shedding tears  Sadaprarudita replied I want to sell myself but I cannot find anyone to buy my body Sakra in the form of the young man said On behalf of what do you want to sell yourself Sadaprarudita replied From love for Dharma I sell myself so as to worship Dharma and to honor the holy Bodhisattva Dharmodgata For this I require a mans heart his blood and the marrow of his bones These you give me and I shall pay for these Sadaprarudita now thinks to himself Give me whatever you do  Sadaprarudita took a sharp sword pierced his right arm and made the blood flow Let me go to him and ask him She goes to Sadaprarudita and said Why do you inflict such fatal treatment on yourself What do you do with this blood and with this marrow of your bones Sadaprarudita said As I have sold them to this young man I go to worship perfection of wisdom and to do honor to the holy Bodhisattva Dharmodgata The merchants daughter said Dharmodgata now explains to me perfection of wisdom and the skill in means In these I train myself and as a result I become a refuge to all beings and as I at this point realize full enlightenment I acquire a body of golden color thirtytwo marks of the Tathagata eighty accessory marks the splendor of a halo the rays of which extend throughout infinitude great friendliness great compassion great sympathetic joy great impartiality four grounds of selfconfidence four analytical knowledges eighteen special dharmas of a Buddha and I acquire five superknowledges an unthinkable purity of conduct and unthinkable purity of concentration an unthinkable purity of wisdom and ten powers of a Tathagata I fully awake to the supreme cognition of a Buddha and acquire the supremely precious jewel of Dharma which I share with all beings The merchants daughter replied For the sake of even one of these dharmas should one be willing to renounce ones bodies even for countless aeons how much more so for the sake of many of these But do not inflict such treatment on yourself I also go with you to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata I also together with you plant wholesome roots which help to realize such dharmas Sakra Chief of Gods now throws off his disguise as a young man and in his own proper body he stood before the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and says to him I applaud your firm sense of obligation In these three times Tathagatas have so great an aspiration for Dharma and it is this which helps these to full enlightenment and to gain the precious jewel of Dharma as these first course in the vehicle of a Bodhisattva and ask questions about perfection of wisdom and skill in means I have no need for your heart blood or marrow I only come here to test you Give me supreme dharmas of a Buddha Sakra Chief of Gods replied This lies not within my province This lies within the province of Buddhas the Lords Choose another boon Sadaprarudita replied Do not trouble your mind about the mutilated condition of my body I now make it whole again by the magical power of enunciation of Truth As I am in truth irreversible and predicted to full enlightenment and am known to the Tathagatas by my unconquerable resolution may through this Truth through this utterance of the Truth this my body be again as it is before  This very moment instant and second through the Bodhisattvas might and through the perfect purity of the Bodhisattvas resolution the body of the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita became as before healthy and whole And Sakra Chief of Gods and Mara the Evil One reduced to silence just vanished from this place The merchants daughter then said to Sadaprarudita Come on son of good family let us go up to my house I ask my parents to give you riches with which you can express your desire to worship this perfection of wisdom and to honor the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata a desire which is due to your love for dharma The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and the merchants daughter go together to her house Upon arriving Sadaprarudita remains standing on the threshold while the merchants daughter goes into the house and now she says to her parents Mummy and daddy give me a part of your wealth Together with Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita I go to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata in order to worship him And he demonstrates dharma to us and in this way we acquire the dharmas of a Buddha  Her parents replied Who is this Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and is he here just now The merchants daughter said He set out determined to know full enlightenment in other words he aspires to set all beings free from immeasurable sufferings of birthanddeath She told her parents all she saw and heard  how Sadaprarudita sold his body and mutilated it and how as she asked him for a reason he praises and reveals to her unthinkable qualities of a Buddha and immeasurable dharmas of a Buddha which he has in mind as his goal She goes on to say As I hear of unthinkable qualities of a Buddha I feel exceeding joy and elation How can we fail to worship dharma and to make a vow to reach such stations we who have vast and abundant possessions  So I said to this son of good family Her parents replied Unthinkable for sure are the dharmas for the sake of which he endures these hardships these must be the most distinguished in the whole world a source of happiness to all beings She takes abundant riches and ample provisions mounts upon one carriage together with the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and proceeds East surrounded by the five hundred maidens on their five hundred carts accompanied by a huge retinue and preceded by her parents After some time the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita sees the city of Gandhavati from afar In the middle of the marketplace he sees the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata on his pulpit demonstrating dharma surrounded and revered by an assembly of many hundreds of many thousands of many hundreds of thousands Let me here and now alight from it He alights from this carriage and the merchants daughter with her five hundred maidens follow suit Sadaprarudita with the merchants daughter and her five hundred maidens go up to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgatas seat amidst a magnificent display of religious aspirations For the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata at this time created for perfection of wisdom a pointed tower made of the seven precious substances adorned with red sandalwood and encircled by an ornament of pearls The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and the merchants daughter with her five hundred maidens look upon this pointed tower so magnificently decorated as a display of religious aspirations These see thousands of Gods with Sakra Chief of Gods scattering over this pointed tower heavenly Mandarava flowers heavenly sandalwood powder heavenly gold dust and heavenly silver dust  and these hear the music of heavenly instruments Sadaprarudita now asks Sakra Chief of Gods For what purpose do you together with many thousands of Gods scatter over this pointed tower which consists of precious substances heavenly Mandarava flowers etc and why do the Devas up in space play heavenly music on their instruments Sakra answered Do you not know the reason son of good family This is perfection of wisdom the mother and guide of the Bodhisattvas As Bodhisattvas train in this these soon reach perfection of wisdom of all qualities and consequent on this all dharmas of a Buddha and knowledge of all modes Sadaprarudita replied Where is this perfection of wisdom the mother of Buddhas and guide of Bodhisattvas Sakra answered The holy Bodhisattva Dharmodgata placed this in the middle of this pointed tower as he has written this on golden tablets with melted Vaidurya and sealed this with seven seals These now worship the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata by scattering flowers garlands wreaths raiment jewels incense flags and golden and silvery flowers over him and played heavenly music on their instruments  motivated by an aspiration to worship Dharma The flowers now rise high above the head of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata and form a pointed tower of flowers As the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and the merchants daughter with her five hundred maidens behold this wonder these think to themselves This is wonderful to see such wonderworking power this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata possesses how great a might how great an influence So far he courses but in the course of a Bodhisattva and now already he possesses such power to work wonders How much more does he have after he has known full enlightenment  The merchants daughter and the five hundred maidens here feel a longing for the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata All of one mind these resolutely raise their hearts to the supreme enlightenment and say May we through this wholesome root be Tathagatas in this future period May we come to course in the course of Bodhisattvas and may we receive these very dharmas which this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata receives And may we just so honor and respect the perfection of wisdom as this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata honors and respects this and may we reveal this to many just as he does And may we be as endowed with perfect wisdom and skill in means and as accomplished in these as this Bodhisattva Dharmodgata is The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita and the merchants daughter with her five hundred maidens as these worship the perfection of wisdom and honor the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata with their heads respectfully salute him with hands together and stand on one side The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita now tells the whole story of quest for perfection of wisdom beginning with the voice he hears in the forest which bid him go East He told Dharmodgata how he stands in many concentrations and how the Buddhas and Lords of the ten directions comforted and applauded him and had said Well done son of good family The Tathagatas now vanished and I emerged from this state of concentration He can explain to me this matter as it really is and tell me whence these Tathagatas come and whither these go Now I am come to you and I ask you son of good family Whence these Tathagatas come and whither these go Demonstrate to me son of good family this coming and going of these Tathagatas so we may cognize this and so we may be not lacking in vision of the Tathagatas The Coming and the Going of Tathagatas Dharmodgata Tathagatas certainly do not come from anywhere nor do these go anywhere Suchness does not move and Tathagata is Suchness Nonproduction neither comes nor goes and Tathagata is nonproduction One can conceive of neither coming nor going of realitylimit and Tathagata is realitylimit This same can be said of emptiness of anything which exists in according to facts or of dispassion of stopping of element of space Suchness as these dharmas is Suchness as any and all dharmas and Suchness as Tathagata is simply Suchness as any and all Tathagatas Here is no division within Suchness Simply before even one throughout and after all is Suchness Suchness does not even pass beyond counting as it can not be counted to begin with and thus certainly is here nothing to end with Neither is Suchness one nor other than one by which to determine any singularity nor two nor three nor apart from these A man scorched by the heat of summer during the last month of summer  at noon might see a mirage floating along and might run towards it and think here I shall find some water here I shall find something to drink What do you think you children of good family does this water come from anywhere or does this water go anywhere to or from the Eastern great ocean or the Southern Northern or Western Sadaprarudita No water exists in this mirage How can its coming or going be conceived Equally foolish are any and all these who adhere to Tathagatas through form and sound and who in consequence imagine coming or going of any or all Tathagatas A Tathagata can neither be seen nor determined from any form body Dharmabodies  are such Tathagatas and the real nature of dharmas neither comes nor goes Here is no real coming or going of the body of an elephant horse chariot or footsoldier tree or even a rock which has been conjured up when magicians perform Just so here is neither coming nor going of Tathagatas which as with all things neither have any granting given nor even any conjuring whatsoever A sleeping person might in dreams see one Tathagata or two or three or up to one thousand or still more  On waking up however they no longer see even one single Tathagata What do you think dear children of good family have these Tathagatas come from anywhere or gone to anywhere One cannot conceive as in any dream any dharma whatsoever as having the status of a full and perfect reality for any dream is deceptive Just so Tathagatas teach all dharmas are as a dream These who do not come to naturally and wisely know all dharmas as these really are which is to say as a dream as Tathagata points out these adhere to Tathagatas through their namebody and formbody and in consequence these imagine Tathagatas come and go These who in ignorance of true nature of dharmas imagine a coming OR going of Tathagatas these are just foolish common peoplenot as yet diligent to truth and presently as is as good as any and all times these belong to birthanddeath with six places of rebirth and these are far from these revelations of perfection of wisdom far away from dharmas of a Buddha  yet experience these dharmas within each and every breath as close as pure life itself On the contrary however these who know all dharmas as a dream ie as they really are are in agreement with the teaching of Tathagata these do not imagine the coming or going of any dharma nor its production or stopping These naturally know Tathagatas true nature and do not imagine coming or going of Tathagatas And these who naturally know true nature of Tathagata these course near to full enlightenment and these course in this perfection of wisdom These disciples of Lords do not consume alms fruitlessly  and these are worthy of the worlds results and dedications The gems which are in the great ocean do not come from any place in the East or West or any other of the ten directions but these owe existence to wholesome roots of beings These are not produced without cause or are not without cause to be produced Such simply manifest due to these causes and conditions Yet still as dependent on cause condition and reason these gems are coproduced and stopped by conditions these do not pass on to any place anywhere in the world in any of the ten directions And nevertheless as these conditions exist the gems are augmented as these conditions are absent no augmentation takes place Just so the perfect body of Tathagatas does not come from any place anywhere in the ten directions and it does not go to any place anywhere in the world with its ten directions It is brought to perfection by conduct and action in time and it is produced dependent on causes and conditions coproduced by subsidiaries produced as result of karma done in this past It is however not in any place anywhere in the world with its ten directions In this way this sound comes forth from the boogharp dependent on causes dependent on conditions And yet that sound does not come forth from that hollow body of the harp nor from the parchment sounding board nor from the strings nor from the hollow arm nor from the bindings nor from the plectrum nor from the person who plays it nor from this persons exertions OR knowledge It is just the combination of all of these which makes the sound conceivable And as it is stopped the sound also does not go anywhere But the augmenting of Buddhabody does not result from one single cause nor from one single condition nor from one single wholesome root This is also not without cause This is coproduced by a totality of many causes and conditions but does not come from anywhere So also as this totality of causes and conditions cease to be this does not go to anywhere Thus is viewed the coming and going of Tathagatas and this conforms to true nature of all dharmas And it is just as this is naturally recognized as Tathagatas and also all dharmas are neither produced nor stopped you are fixed on full enlightenment and you definitely course in perfection of wisdom and in skill in means As this disquisition of the fact Tathagatas neither come nor go is being taught the earth and the entire great trichiliocosm shakes in six ways stirs quakes gets agitated resounds and rumbles And all the realms thought to be and seen as of Mara are stirred up and discomfited All the grasses shrubs and herbs and trees in the great trichiliocosm bend in the direction of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata Flowers come up out of season From high up in the air a great rain of flowers comes down And Sakra Chief of Gods and the Four Great Kings scatter and pour heavenly sandalwood powder and heavenly flowers over the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata and say Well spoken son of good family In consequence of your asking for this disquisition on the noncoming and nongoing of Tathagatas and through my exposition of this eight thousand living beings acquire patient acceptance of dharmas which fail to be produced eighty niyutas of living beings raise their hearts to full enlightenment and of sixtyfour thousand living beings the dispassionate unstained dharmaeye is purified for vision of dharmas Sadapraruditas Self Sacrafice The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita now has a supreme most sublime feeling of zest and joy It is a gain to me a very great gain by asking for perfection of wisdom and for this disquisition I have wrought the weal of so many beings This alone brings me merit sufficient for the accomplishment of full enlightenment Unquestionably I become a Tathagata In his zest and joy he rose seven palm trees high into the air and standing at the height of seven palm trees he reflected How can I standing here in the air do honor to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata Sakra Chief of Gods now sees him and reads his thoughts presents him with heavenly Mandarava flowers and says to him Honor the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata with these heavenly flowers Rare are the beings who like you have the strength for the sake of all beings through countless aeons to bear such great burden The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita now takes the Mandarava flowers from Sakra Chief of Gods and scatters these over the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata He presents the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata with his own body and said to him I give you myself as a present and I am your attendant and servant from today onwards And with hands together he stands before Dharmodgata The merchants daughter and her five hundred maidens said to the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita We in our turn make a present of ourselves to you son of good family Through this wholesome root we also become recipients of just these dharmas and together with you we again and again honor and revere the Buddhas and Lords and the Bodhisattvas and we remain near to you Sadaprarudita replied As you maidens in accordance with my own earnest intention give yourselves with earnest intention to me I accept you The maidens replied We are in accord with you and with earnest resolution we give ourselves as presents to you to do with us as you may Here and now the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita presented the merchants daughter and her five hundred maidens embellished and adorned together with their five hundred welldecorated carriages to the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata and said All these I present to you as attendants and servants and also the carriages for your own use Sakra Chief of Gods applauded him and said Well done son of good family Through this thought of renunciation one soon realizes full enlightenment and the worship one pays thus to exponents and preachers of Dharma enables one to hear about perfection of wisdom and skill in means Also in these three times Tathagatas as these still are Bodhisattvas do by this fact these renounce everything procure a claim to realization of full enlightenment and these also ask questions about perfect wisdom and about skill in means The Bodhisattva Dharmodgata accepted Sadapraruditas gift so his wholesome root might reach fulfillment Immediately afterwards he returned this to Sadaprarudita After this all now the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata goes into his house The sun is about to set I remain either standing or walking until the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata again comes out of his house in order to reveal dharma to us The Bodhisattva Dharmodgata remains for seven years immersed in one uninterrupted state of trance and he dwelt in countless thousands of concentrations peculiar to Bodhisattvas which issue from perfection of wisdom and skill in means For seven years Sadaprarudita adopted any other posture than sitting or lying down and he did not fall into sloth and torpor One day Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita heard a heavenly voice which said On the seventh day from today the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata emerges from his trance and he at this time seated in the center of the town demonstrates dharma As Sadaprarudita hears the heavenly voice he is contented elated joyous overjoyed and jubilant Together with the merchants daughter and her five hundred maidens he cleans the ground spreads out the seat made of the seven precious things takes off his upper garment and spreads it on top of the seat The maidens also took off their upper garments spread their five hundred upper garments on this seat and thought Seated on this seat the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata demonstrates dharma  And these also are contented elated joyous overjoyed and jubilant As the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita wanted to sprinkle the ground he can not find any water though he searched all round For Mara the Evil One was thought to and therefore seen to have hidden all the water And he did this so Sadaprarudita as he can not find any water becomes depressed and sad or change his mind with the result his wholesome root may vanish or the fervor of this worship be dimmed The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita now thinks to himself Let me pierce my own body and sprinkle the ground with my blood The ground is full of rising dust and I fear some of it may fall on the body of the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata Better surely this my body be destroyed by such an action rather than by an ineffectual one For the sake of sense pleasures as a result of sense pleasures many thousands frames of mine again and again while I wandered in birthanddeath break up but never in conditions as favorable as these never for the sake of gaining the good law As these once more be broken up let these in any case be broken up in a holy cause He  took a sharp sword pierced his body on every side and everywhere sprinkled any piece of ground with his own blood The merchants daughter with her five hundred maidens followed his example and did as he did But here is no alteration of thought in either the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita or in all these maidens which gives whats seen and thought of as Mara the Evil One a chance of entering in order to obstruct these wholesome roots Sakra Chief of Gods thinks to himself It is wonderful how this Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita loves dharma how firm his sense of obligation how great this armor he has put on and how he disregards this body this life and these pleasures and how resolutely he sets out with the goal of knowing full enlightenment in his aspiration to set free any and all beings from measureless sufferings of birthanddeath once he knows full enlightenment Sakra now changes by magic all this blood into heavenly sandalwood water And all round this piece of ground for one hundred leagues an inconceivable sublime scent the scent of the heavenly sandalwood water filled the air Well done son of good family The Tathagatas in this past  also procure the right to full enlightenment through this kind of earnest intention vigor and love for dharma The Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita now thinks to himself I spread out the seat for the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata and I swept and sprinkled this piece of ground Now I must still get flowers with which to cover this peace of ground and to scatter over the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata as he demonstrates dharma Sakra now says to Sadaprarudita Accept these heavenly Mandarava flowers for this twofold purpose And he presented him with a thousand heavenly Khara measures of heavenly flowers And the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita accepted these flowers and used some of them to cover the piece of ground and later on he strewed others over the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata Dharmodgatas Demonstration of Dharma At the lapse of seven years the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata emerges from his trance goes up to the seat spread out for him sits down on this and surrounded and attended by an assembly of many hundreds of thousands he demonstrates dharma The moment the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita  sees the Bodhisattva Dharmodgata he is filled with a kind of happiness which a monk feels as with onepointed attention he obtains the first trance The perfection of wisdom is selfidentical and as such any and all dharmas are same Perfect wisdom is boundless and as such any and all dharmas are boundless As the ocean is boundless so perfect wisdom As Meru shines in multicolored brilliance so does perfection of wisdom Perfect wisdom is selfidentical and as such the adamantine dharma is selfidentical Perfect wisdom is undifferentiated and as such all dharmas are undifferentiated Perfect wisdom is unthinkable and as such all dharmas are unthinkable Here and now on this occasion is born in the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita the king of concentrations called sameness of any and all dharmas and consequent on this the concentrations called isolation of any and all dharmas immobility of any and all dharmas absence of any and all mental acts in any and all dharmas lack of numbness in any and all dharmas the one taste of any and all dharmas boundlessness of any and all dharmas boundless like firmament boundless like the ocean brilliant and multicolored like Meru not fashioned like firmament boundless like form etc boundless like the element of earth etc adamantine nondifferentiatedness of any and all dharmas nonapprehension of any and all dharmas sameness of any and all dharmas whatever these may surpass any and all dharmas are powerless to act any and all dharmas are unthinkable Beginning with these the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita acquired six million concentration doors In this manner also do you know this perfection of wisdom as the one who nurses the cognition of the allknowing in the Bodhisattvas Now through Tathagatas sustaining power this is well written in very distinct letters in a great book one honors reveres adores and worships this with flowers incense scents wreaths unguents aromatic powders strips of cloth parasols banners bells flags and with rows of lamps all round and with manifold kinds of worship This is our admonition to you Ananda Ananda He is O Lord Here now Ananda just as you give affection faith and respect to me as I am at present in this incarnation just so Ananda act after my decease towards this perfection of wisdom For the second time for the third time I entrust and transmit to you this perfection of wisdom so this does not disappear As long as this perfection of wisdom is observed in the world one can be sure for so long does Tathagata abide in this also for so long does Tathagata demonstrate dharma and the beings in it are not lacking in vision of the Buddha hearing of dharma attendance of the Sangha Enraptured the Bodhisattvas headed by Maitreya and the Venerable Subhuti and the Venerable Ananda and Sakra Chief of Gods and the entire world with its Gods men Asuras Garudas and Gandharvas delighted in the Lords teaching Verses On The Perfection Of Wisdom  Prajnaparamita Ratnagunasamcayagatha  Translated by Edward Conze  Taisho Tripitaka     Homage to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas Thereupon the Lord in order to gladden the four assemblies and to further lighten up this perfection of wisdom preached at that time the following verses   Chapter I  Preliminary Admonition  Call forth as much as you can of love of respect and of faithRemove the obstructing defilements and clear away all your taints Listen to the Perfect Wisdom of the gentle BuddhasTaught for the weal of the world for heroic spirits intended The rivers all in this Roseapple Island Which cause the flowers to grow the fruits the herbs and trees They all derive from the might of the king of the NagasFrom the Dragon reside in Lake Anopatapta his magical power Just so whatever Dharmas the Jinas disciples establish Whatever they teach whatever adroitly explainConcerning the work of the holy which leads to the fullness of bliss And also the fruit of this workit is the Tathagatas doing For whatever the Jina has taught the Guide to the Dharma His pupils if genuine have well been trained in itFrom direct experience derived from their training they teach it Their teaching stems but from the might of the Buddhas and not their own power   The Basic Teachings No wisdom can we get hold of no highest perfection No Bodhisattva no thought of enlightenment eitherWhen told of this if not bewildered and in no way anxious A Bodhisattva courses in the WellGones wisdom In form in feeling will perception and awareness Nowhere in them they find a place to rest onWithout a home they wander dharmas never hold them Nor do they grasp at themthe Jinas Bodhi they are bound to gain  The wanderer Srenika in his gnosis of the truth Could find no basis though the skandhas had not been undoneJust so the Bodhisattva when he comprehends the dharmas as he shouldDoes not retire into Blessed Rest In wisdom then he dwells What is this wisdom whose and whence he queries And then he finds that all these dharmas are entirely emptyUncowed and fearless in the face of that discovery Not far from Bodhi is that Bodhibeing then To course in the skandhas in form in feeling in perception Will and so on and fail to consider them wisely Or to imagine these skandhas as being emptyMeans to course in the sign the track of nonproduction ignored But when he does not course in form in feeling or perception In will or consciousness but wanders without homeRemaining unaware of coursing firm in wisdom His thoughts on nonproductionthen the best of all the calming trances cleaves to him Through that the bodhisattva now dwells tranquil in himself His future Buddhahood assured by antecedent Buddhas Whether absorbed in trance or whether outside it he minds notFor of things as they are he knows the essential original nature Coursing thus he courses in the wisdom of the Sugatas And yet he does not apprehend the dharmas in which he courseThis coursing he wisely knows as a nocoursing That is his practice of wisdom the highest perfection What exists not that nonexistent the foolish imagine Nonexistence as well as existence they fashionAs dharmic facts existence and nonexistence are both not real A bodhisattva goes forth when wisely he knows this If he knows the five skandhas as like an illusion But makes not illusion one thing and the skandhas anotherIf freed from the notion of multiple things he courses in peace That this is his practice of wisdom the highest perfection Those with good teachers as well as deep insight Cannot be frightened on hearing the Mothers deep tenetsBut those with bad teachers who can be misled by others Are ruined thereby as an unbaked pot when in contact with moisture   Three Key Terms Defined What is the reason why we speak of Bodhisattvas Desirous to extinguish all attachment and to cut it off True nonattachment or the Bodhi of the Jinas is their future lotBeings who strive for Bodhi are they therefore called What is the reason whey Great Beings are so called They rise to the highest place above a great number of peopleAnd of a great number of people they cut off mistaken views That is why we come to speak of them as Great Beings When free from doubts the Bodhisattva carries on his practiceAs skilled in wisdom he is knows to swellAll dharmas are not really there their essential original nature is emptyTo comprehend that is the practice of wisdom perfection supreme   Chapter II Where Bodhisattvas Stand He does not stand in form perception or in feelingIn will or consciousness in any skandha whatsoever In Dharmas true nature alone he is standingThen that is his practice of wisdom the highest perfection Change and no change suffering and ease the self and notselfThe lovely and repulsivejust one Suchness in this Emptiness they are And so he takes not his stand on the fruit which he won which is threefoldThat of an Arhat a Single Buddha a Buddha fully enlightened The Leader himself was not stationed in the realm which is free from conditionsNor in the things which are under conditions but freely he wandered without a homeJust so without a support of a basis a Bodhisattva is standingA position devoid of a basis has that position been called by the Jina  Wherein Bodhisattvas Train Those who wish to become the Sugatas DisciplesOr Pratyekabuddhas or likewise Kings of the DharmaWithout resort to this patience they cannot reach their respective goals They move across but their eyes are not on the other shore Those who teach dharma and those who listen when it is being taught Those who have won the fruit of an Arhat a Single Buddha or a worldsavior And the Nirvana obtained by the wise and the learnedMere illusions mere dreamsso has the Tathagata taught us Four kinds of persons are not alarmed by this teaching Sons of the Jina skilled in the truths saints unable to turn backArhats free from defilements and taints and rid of their doubts Those whom good teachers mature are reckoned the fourth kind Coursing thus the wise and learned Bodhisattva Trains not for Arhatship nor on the level of Pratyekabuddhas In the Buddhadharma alone he trains for the sake of allknowledgeNo training is his training and no one is trained in this training Increase or decrease of forms is not the aim of this training Nor does he set out to acquire various dharmasAllknowledge alone he can hope to acquire by this training To that he goes forth when he trains in their training and delights in its virtues   The Facts of Existence Forms are not wisdom nor is wisdom found in form In consciousness perceptions feeling or in will They are not wisdom and no wisdom is in themLike space it is without a break or crack Of all objective supports the essential original nature is boundless Of beings likewise the essential original nature is boundlessAs the essential original nature of space has no limits Just so the wisdom of the Worldknowers is boundless Perceptionsmere words so the Leaders have told us Perceptions forsaken and gone and the door is open to the BeyondThose who succeed in ridding themselves of perceptions They having reached the Beyond fulfill the Teachers commandments If for eons countless as the sands of the Ganges The Leader would himself continue to pronounce the word beingStill pure from the very start no being could ever result from his speaking That is the practice of wisdom the highest perfection   Conclusion  And so the Jina concludes his preaching and finally tells usWhen all I said and did at last agreed with perfect wisdomThen this prediction I received from Him who went before meFully enlightened at a future time thou shalt a Buddha be   Chapter III  The Merit Derived from Perfect Wisdom One who will take up this Perfection of WisdomWherein the Saviours course and constantly study itFire poison sword and water cannot harm him And also Mara finds no entrance nor his host Someone may for the Sugata who went to rest build Stupas Made of the seven precious things and worship themUntil thousands of kotis of fields are filled with these Stupas Of the Sugata countless as the sands of the Ganges And like him as many beings again as there are in endless kotis of fields They all would do worship without doing anything else  With heavenly flowers and the best perfumes and unguents Let us reckon for aeons in the three periods and still more than that But if someone else had copied this book the Mother of the Sugatas From which come forth the Guides with the ten powers Would bear it in mind revere it with flowers and unguents An infinitesimal portion of his merit would have those who had given worship to the Stupas  Perfect Wisdom a Great Lore This Perfection of Wisdom of the Jinas is a great lore Appeasing dharmas making for sorrow and ill in many a world of beingsThe Saviours of the World in the past and in the future and those now in the ten directions They have by training in this lore become the supreme physicians And also those who course in the practice of pity and concern for the welfare of others They the wise by having trained in this lore will experience enlightenmentThose who have conditioned happiness and those who have unconditioned happiness All their happiness should be known as having issued from this  Perfect Wisdom and the Other Five Perfections Gems exist potentially scattered in the earth And when conditions are favourable they grow in great varietyAll the qualities of enlightenment that are in the five perfections They all grow from the perfection of wisdom Wherever we know the Universal Monarch may travel There is all the army of all the seven precious thingsWherever there is this perfection of wisdom of the Jinas There also all dharmas of good quality are brought along  Chapter IV Relative Value of Relics and Perfect Wisdom Asked a question by the Jina Sakra answeredIf I could have Buddhafields like the sands of the river Ganges All of them filled to the top with the relics of the Jinas Nevertheless I would still take this wisdom the foremost of the perfections  For what reason It is not that I lack in respect for the relicsBut they are worshipped because they are fostered by wisdomJust as every man who is supported by the king gets worshipJust so the Buddharelics because they are supported by the perfection of wisdom  Simile of the Wishing Jewel A precious gem in possession of all qualities priceless The basket in which it may be should be paid homage to Even when it has been taken out the basket continues to emit its radiance Such are the qualities of that gem  Just so it is with the qualities of wisdom the foremost perfectionWhich gain worship for the relics of the Jina even after he has gone to restTherefore let him who wants to win the Jinaqualities Take up the perfection of wisdom She is the liberation  Perfect Wisdom and the Other Five Perfections  The Lord then said Wisdom controls him who gives giftsAnd also morality patience vigour and concentrationShe takes hold of the wholesome dharmas so that they may not be lost She alone is also the one who reveals all dharmas Simile of the Shadows There are in Jambudvipa many thousands of kotis of trees Of different species manifold and different in form And yet there would not also be a difference between their shadowsBut when one speaks they are all equally reckoned as shadows Just so do these five perfections of the Jinas Have their name from the perfection of wisdomWhen they are being turned over into allknowledge The name of enlightenment provides one single principle for all the six of them Chapter V The Counterfeit and the True Perfection of Wisdom When a Bodhisattva falsely reveals form perception feeling will Or thought as impermanent claiming that they are destroyed  In the counterfeit perfection of wisdom he courses considering not wiselyBecause the learned never effect the destruction of a dharma Wherein of form of feeling or perception Or consciousness or will there is no apprehensionBy the method of emptiness and nonproduction he cognizes all dharmas This is the practice of wisdom the foremost perfection  Perfect Wisdom Greater Than Any Other Spiritual Gift If someone would discipline in Arhatship as many beings As there are in fields equal to the sands of the river Ganges And if someone else having copied this perfection of wisdomWould give the book to another being  his would be the more distinguished merit For what reason The supreme Teachers trained in this Make all dharmas intelligible in this emptiness When they have learned that the Disciples speedily experience their own kind of emancipationOthers experience Pratyekabuddhaenlightenment others again the Buddhaenlightenment  Importance of the Thought of Enlightenment Where there is no sprout there can in the world be no tree How can therein be the production of branches leaves fruits or flowersWithout the aspiration for enlightenment there is no possibility of a Jina in the world How then could Sakra Brahma fruit and disciples manifest themselves When the orb of the sun sends forth a multitude of light Then beings exert themselves in doing their workSo when the thought of enlightenment has come into being for the sake of knowing the world Through its cognition all the dharmas of quality are assembled If there were no Chief of the Serpents in his Anavatapta Lake How could there be here in Jambudvipa a flowing along of the riversAnd if there were no rivers fruits and flowers could not possibly be And there would also be no manifold jewels in the oceans So if there were no thought of enlightenment how could there be The flowing along of the cognition of the Tathagata in all these worlds And if there is no cognition there can be no growth of the virtuesNo enlightenment nor the oceanlike dharmas of the Buddha  The Sun and the Firefly If all the lightemitting animals everywhere in this world Would for the purpose of illumination shed lightOne single ray issued from the orb of the sun outshines them all And infinitesimal would be all the luster of the hosts of lightemitting animals  Chapter VI Supreme Merit of Dedication and Jubilation However much merit the hosts of Disciples may begetAssociated with giving morality and meditational development But if a Bodhisattva rejoices with one single thought There would by comparison be no mass of merit in all the hosts of the Disciples  The Range of Jubilation If we take the niyutas of kotis of Buddhas who have gone by in the past period of time And those who just now abide in endlessly many thousands of kotis of Buddhafields And also those Saviours of the world who having gone to ParinirvanaWill demonstrate the jewel of Dharma for the sake of the complete extinction of suffering If we consider the merit of those Jinas during the period Beginning with the first production of the thought of the foremost enlightenment Until the time of the extinction of the good Dharma of the GuidesAnd the dharmas connected with the perfections and also the Buddhadharmas  And also the merit of the offspring of the Buddhas and of the DisciplesBe they in training or adepts with outflows or without Having heaped it all up the Bodhisattva rejoices at it And turns it all over to the enlightenment which is linked with the weal of the world  True and False Turning over  When in one who turns over there proceeds the perception of a thoughtOr if the turning over of the perception of enlightenment involves the perception of a being Established in perception false views and thought it is tied by the triple attachmentIt does not become turned over to those who apprehend it But when he thus cognizes These dharmas are extinct and stopped And wherein they are turned over that is also extinct Nor is ever anywhere a dharma turned over into a dharmaThen it does become turned over in one who thus considers wisely When he makes a sign he does not turn over to enlightenment But if he turns to it as the signless that becomes turned over into enlightenmentJust as though food mixed with poison were good to cat So has the taking of pure dharmas as a basis been spoken of by the Jina Therefore thus should one train in turning over As the Jinas wisely know that wholesome root Its class as it is its origins as they are its characteristics as they are  Thus do I rejoice in that wholesome root thus do I turn it over And thus turning merit over into enlightement He does not upset the Buddha one who preaches what the Jina has taught As many as there are in the world Bodhisattvas who lean on a basisAll of them surpasses the hero who turns over in this way  Chapter VII Perfect Wisdom Guides the Other Perfections How can those niyutas of kotis of bornblind who are without a guide Who are not conversant with the way find an entrance to the city Without wisdom these five perfections are eyelessThose who are without the guide are unable to experience enlightenment  When they are taken hold of by wisdomThen having gained the eye do they get that designation ie perfection It is like a religious painting of a deity or a saint which is complete except for the eyes Only after the eyes are painted in does one get ones fee  The Attitude to Dharmas and to the Self When one who develops wisdom to the end does not seize on the least dharmaConditioned or unconditioned dark or bright Then one comes to speak in the world of the perfection of wisdom Which is like space wherein nothing real whatsoever is established When he thinks I course in the wisdom of the JinasI will set free niyutas of beings touched by many ills This Bodhisattva is one who imagines the notion of beingsAnd this is not the practice of wisdom the foremost perfection  Faith in the Perfection of Wisdom The Bodhisattva who has observed this foremost perfection When in the past he served the Buddhas is learned and does not doubtAs soon as he has heard it he will again recognise the Teacher And he will swiftly understand the Peaceful Calm of enlightenment  Though in the past he has honoured millions of Buddhas and served themIf without faith in the Jinas perfection of wisdomHearing of it he will cast it away one of small intelligence After he cast it away he will go to the Avici Hell and no one can save him Therefore have faith in this Mother of all the Jinas If you wish to experience the utmost BuddhacognitionLet him be like a merchant who has travelled to the treasure island And who having lost his goods would nevertheless again return to it  Chapter VIII  The Meaning of Purity The purity of form should be known from the purity of the fruit From the purity of form and fruit is the purity of allknowledgeThe purity of allknowledge and of the fruit and the purity of form As with the sameness of the spaceelement they are not broken nor cut apart Having transcended what belongs to the triple world the Bodhisattvas Although their defilements are removed exhibit their rebirth Although freed from decay illness and death they exhibit decease This is the perfection of wisdom in which course the constantly wise This world is attached to the mud of nameandform The wheel of birthanddeath revolves similar to a windwheelHaving cognized the revolving world as like a snare for wild beasts The wise roam about similar to the birds in space He who coursing perfectly pure does not course in form Nor in consciousness perception feeling or will Thus coursing he shuns all attachmentsFreed from attachments he courses in the wisdom of the Sugatas   Chapter IX  Allround Purity Thus coursing the wise and learned Bodhisattva Having cut off his attachments marches on unattached to the worldAs the sun released from the planet Rahu blazes forthOr as fire let loose burns up grass log and forest  The Bodhisattva sees that all dharmas and the Perfection of WisdomAre pure perfectly pure in their essential original natureBut he does not seize on one who sees nor on all dharmasThis is the practice of wisdom the foremost perfection   Chapter X  Qualifications for Perfect Wisdom Sakra King of Gods asks the Jina Coursing in wisdom how is the Bodhisattva engaged in itWho is joined to not the least thing whatsoever be it skandha or element He who is engaged thus that Bodhisattva is joined to wisdom As one set out for long in the vehicle should that being be known As one who has done his duty under many niyutas of kotis of BuddhasWho when he has heard that these dharmas are fictitious and like an illusion Does not hesitate but makes efforts to train himself  The Simile of a Village If a man coming out of a wilderness extending over many miles Would see cowherds or boundary lines or woodsHe then regains his breath and has no more fear of thieves For he knows that these are signs that a village or city is quite near Just so the one who searches for enlightenment when he learns of this wisdom The foremost perfection of the Jinas and gets hold of itHe regains his breath and he has no more fear Not even that of falling on the level of an Arhat or the level of a Pratyekabuddha  The Simile of the Ocean As long as a man who travels to the watery ocean in order to see it Still sees the trees and forests of the Himalayas he is far from itBut when he no longer sees these signs he becomes free from doubt and knows that Quite near is the great ocean it is not too far away Just so should be known one who has set out for the foremost enlightenment And who is learning about this perfection of wisdom of the Jinas Although he is not one who has face to face been predicted by the LeaderHe knows that before long I will experience the Buddhaenlightenment  The Simile of Spring In beautiful springtime when the stalks and leaves have come out From the branches will before long come forth more leaves and fruits and flowers One who has been taken in hand by this perfection of wisdomBefore long he will attain the foremost enlightenment of the Leaders  The Simile of the Pregnant Woman When a pregnant woman is all astir with pains One should know that the time has come for her to give birthJust so will the Bodhisattva if on hearing of the wisdom of the Jinas He beholds her with delight and zest speedily experience enlightenment  How to Dwell in Perfect Wisdom When the Yogin is coursing in wisdom the supreme perfection He does not see the growth of form nor its diminutionIf someone does not see dharma nor nodharma nor the Dharmaelement And if he does not experience the Blessed Rest then he dwells in wisdom When he courses therein he does not imagine the Buddhadharmas Nor the powers nor the roads to psychic power nor does he imagine the peaceful calm of enlightenmentNot discriminating free from constructions coursing on resolutely This is the practice of wisdom the foremost perfection  Chapter XI The Theme Subhuti asks the Buddha the moon of the DoctrineWill there be any obstacles to the precious qualities Many obstacles there will be preaches the TeacherOf them I will proclaim only a few  Various Obstacles Diverse and manifold flashes of ideas will arise in himWhen he copies out this wisdom the perfection of the JinasThen again they will speedily vanish like lightning Without benefit to the weal of the world This is one deed of Mara And he may have some doubts when it is being taughtMy name is not proclaimed by the Leader therein Nor are the circumstances of my birth nor my birthplace or clan Because of that they will not listen and reject it That also is Maras deed  The Bodhisattvapath and the Disciplepath Just as in his ignorance someone would give up the rootAnd prefer the deluded the branches and foliage Or as one who when he had got an elephant would want an elephants foot instead  Thus would be one who having heard the Prajnaparamita would wish for the Sutras of the Disciples instead Just as one who had got superior food of a hundred different tastes Would although he has got the best food of all nevertheless seek for inferior foodSo would be a Bodhisattva who having got this perfection Would seek for enlightenment on the level of an Arhat  More Obstacles They will want honour they will want gain In their hearts longing for them intent on familiarity with the families of the faithfulHaving spurned what is right Dharma they will do what is wrong Having left the right path they have gone to a wrong road This also is Maras deed Even though at first they have produced faith Keen to hear this most excellent dharmaWhen they find that the dharmapreacher is disinclined to do his work They will go away devoid of joy and very sad  Maras Deeds and the Buddhas Help When these deeds of Mara will take place Together with many other diverse and manifold obstacles Then many monks will be troubled therebyAnd will not bear in mind this Prajnaparamita Where there are jewels which are pricelessAnd hard to get their owners invariably have many foesJust so this wisdom the foremost perfection of the JinasIs the Dharmajewel hard to get and connected with many troubles When a being has newly set out in the vehicle and is limited in his intelligenceHe does not at once obtain this Dharmajewel hard to get Mara will then be zealous to cause obstacles But the Buddhas in the ten directions will be intent on helping  Chapter XII  Perfect Wisdom the Mother of the Buddhas If a mother with many sons had fallen ill They all sad in mind would busy themselves about herJust so also the Buddhas in the worldsystems in the ten directions Bring to mind this perfection of wisdom as their mother The Saviours of the world who were in the past and also those that are just now in the ten directions Have issued from her and so will the future ones beShe is the one who shows the world for what it is she is the genetrix the mother of the Jinas And she reveals the thoughts and actions of other beings  How the Tathagata Knows the World The Suchness of the world the Suchness of the Arhats The Suchness of Pratyekabuddhas and the Suchness of the Jinas As just one single Suchness free from existence unalteringHas the perfection of wisdom been understood by the Tathagata Whether the wise abide in the world or whether they have gone to final Nirvana Firmly established remains this fixed sequence of Dharmahood Dharmas are emptyIt is that Suchness tathata which the Bodhisattvas understand Therefore then have the Buddhas been given the name of Tathagatas This is the sphere of the Guides with their own powersWho reside in the delightful forests of the perfection of wisdomAlthough they fetch suffering beings out of the three places of woe Yet they never have anywhere the notion of a being  Similes about the Buddha When a lion residing in his mountain cave Roars fearlessly the lesser beasts are made to trembleLikewise when the Lion of Men depending on the perfection of wisdom Roars fearlessly the many heretics are made to tremble Just as the rays of the sun supported by the ether Dry up this earth and do reveal its formJust so the king of the Dharma supported by the perfection of wisdom Dries up the river of craving and reveals the dharma  The Tathagatas Vision of Dharma Wherein there is no vision of form no vision of feelings No vision of perception no vision of will No vision of consciousness thought or mindThis has been expounded as the vision of Dharma by the Tathagata A vision in space is a being so they declare A vision like that of space so should you consider that objectThus has the vision of Dharma been expounded by the Tathagata But it is not possible to report on that vision by definite statements that differ from it  Chapter XIII  Simile of the King and His Ministers Who sees thus he sees all dharmas When the minister does everything the king is evenmindedWhatever Buddhaactions there are whatever dharmas of the Disciples It is the perfection of wisdom which effects them all A king does not travel to villages or into the countryside But in his own home is the meetingplace where he assembles allJust so the Bodhisattva does not move away from the dharmic nature of dharmas But he assembles all the qualities in the Buddhadharmas  Chapter XIV  The Bodhisattva and Enlightenment The Bodhisattva who has firm faith in the Sugata Who is resolutely intent on the supreme perfection of wisdom Gone beyond the two levels of the Disciples and PratyekabuddhasHe will swiftly attain unhindered the enlightenment of the Jinas  The Simile of the Ship When a ship breaks up in the ocean Those who do not get hold of a corpse a stick or a log Go to their destruction in the midst of the water without having gained the shoreBut those who hold on to something travel to the other shore and reach it Just so those who although endowed with some faith and in possession of some serenity Reject the perfection of wisdom the motherIn the ocean of birthanddeath they must wander about for ever and ever In birth decay death sorrow turmoil and the breaking up of limbs But those who have been taken hold of by the supreme wisdom Skilled in seeing the ownbeing of existence seers of ultimate realityThey are persons worthy of the vehicle who have collected the wealth of merit and cognition They will speedily experience the exceedingly wonderful Sugataenlightenment  The Simile of the Jar It is as if someone would transport water in an unbaked jar One should know that it will break quickly because it does not hold the water wellBut when water is transported in a fully baked jar that on the way It might break there is no fear and it gets safely to the house Although the Bodhisattva be full of faith If deficient in wisdom he swiftly reaches destruction But when taken hold of by both faith and by wisdomGone beyond the two levels he will attain the supreme enlightenment  The Simile of the Two Ships A ship which is not well got ready in the ocean Goes to destruction together with its goods and merchantsBut when a ship is well got ready and well joined together Then it does not break up and all the goods get to the other shore Just so a Bodhisattva exalted in faith But deficient in wisdom swiftly comes to a failure in enlightenmentBut when he is well joined to wisdom the foremost perfection He experiences unharmed and uninjured the enlightenment of the Jinas  The Simile of the Aged Man An aged man ailing one hundred and twenty years old Although he may have got up is not capable of walking on his own But when two men both to his right and left have taken hold of himHe does not feel any fear of falling and he moves along at ease Just so a Bodhisattva who is weak in wisdom Although he sets out he breaks down midway But when he is taken hold of by skilful means and by the best wisdomThen he does not break down he experiences the enlightenment of the mightiest of men  Chapter XV  The Beginner and the Good Friends The Bodhisattvas who stand on the stage of beginners Who with resolute intention have set out for the supreme enlightenment of a Buddha They the discerning should as good pupils intent on respect for their Gurus Always tend their spiritual teachers who are their good friends For what reason From that tending come the qualities of the learned They the good friends are those who instruct in the perfection of wisdom Thus preaches the Jina the holder of all the best qualitiesDependent on the good friend are the Buddhadharmas  How a Bodhisattva Helps Beings Giving morality also patience and vigour The concentrations and wisdom should be turned over into enlightenmentBut one should not grab at enlightenment having considered it as belonging to the skandhas It is thus that it should be demonstrated to beginners Coursing thus the Oceans of Qualities the Moons of the doctrine Become the shelter of the world its refuge and its place of rest The means of salvation route the intelligence the islands leaders who desire its welfareThe light the torch teachers of the foremost Dharma imperturbable An armour difficult to wear the greatly determined put onBut they are not armed with the skandhas elements or sensefields They are free from the notion of the three vehicles and have not taken hold of it They are irreversible immovable and steadfast in their character Being thus endowed with dharma unimpeded Freed from hesitations perplexity and consternation intent on what is beneficial Having heard the perfection of wisdom they do not despairThey should be known as incapable of being led astray by others as irreversible  Perfect Wisdom and Its Conflict with the World Deep is this dharma of the Leaders hard to see Nor is it obtained by anyone nor do they reach itFor that reason when he has obtained enlightenment the Benevolent and Compassionate Becomes unconcerned  what body of beings will cognize this For beings delight in a place to settle in they are eager for senseobjects Bent on grasping unintelligent and quite blindedThe Dharma should be attained as nothing to settle in and as nothing to grasp Its conflict with the world is manifest  Chapter XVI  On Suchness The spaceelement in the eastern direction and in the southern And so in the western and northern directions is boundlessAbove and below in the ten directions as far as it goes There is no multiplicity and no difference is attained Past Suchness future Suchness Present Suchness the Suchness of the Arhats The Suchness of all dharmas the Suchness of the Jinas All that is the DharmaSuchness and no difference is attained  Wisdom and Skill In Means If a Bodhisattva wishes to reach thisEnlightenment of the Sugatas free from differentiated dharmas He should practise the perfection of wisdom joined to skill in means Without wisdom there is not the attainment of the Leaders of men A bird with a frame one hundred and fifty miles large Would have little strength if its wings were lost or feebleIf it should jump down to Jambudvipa from the abodes of the Gods of the Thirtythree It would travel to its destruction Even if he would procure these five perfections of the Jinas For many niyutas of kotis of aeonsAnd would all the time tend the world with an infinite abundance of vows  If he is without skill in means deficient in wisdom he falls into Discipleship  The Desirable Attitude to Other Beings If he wishes to go forth into this Buddhacognition He should have an even mind towards the whole world the notion of father and mother towards all beings He should exert himself with a thought of benevolence and a friendly mindAmenable and straight he should be soft in his speech   Chapter XVII  The Theme The Elder Subhuti questions the Saviour of the World Teach the characteristics of those who are secluded in Peace of the Oceans of QualitiesHow they become irreversible and of great might Declare O Jina their qualities merely by way of outline Qualities of Irreversible Bodhisattvas They are free from the perception of multiplicity they speak suitablyThey do not take refuge with outside Sramanas or Brahmanas The wise have avoided for all time the three places of woe And they are practised in the ten wholesome paths of action Free from selfinterest they instruct the world in Dharma They take delight in the Dharma They always speak gentlyStanding walking lying down sitting they are fully conscious of what they are doing They walk along looking ahead only one yoke their thoughts not wandering about They wear garments clean and unsoiled They become pure through the threefold detachment Majestic men they want no gain but always DharmaThey have passed beyond Maras realms Others cannot lead them astray They meditate in the four trances but they do not use those trances as a support for a better rebirth They do not want fame their hearts are not overcome by anger As householders they remain constantly unattached to their entire propertyThey do not seek to earn their livelihood in the wrong way Through bewitchmentspells or the spells which are the work of women Nor do they earn a living by telling plausible lies to men and women Practised in the quite detached wisdom the best of perfectionsFree from quarrels and disputes their thoughts firmly friendlyThey want to see the allknowing their thoughts always inclined towards the religion  They have avoided the barbarous populations of outlying districts of the border regions They are free from doubts about their own stage always fashioned like MeruFor the sake of Dharma they renounce their very life intent on their practice These should be wisely known as the characteristics of the irreversible  Chapter XVIII  Deep Stations Deep are form feeling and will Consciousness and perception signless in their essential original nature and calmLike one who tries to reach the bottom of the ocean with a stalk So when the skandhas have been considered with wisdom one does not get to the bottom of them When a Bodhisattva thus understands that these dharmas In the deep vehicle are in the ultimate sense stainlessWherein there is neither skandha nor sensefield nor element How can there be to him the attainment of his own merit anywhere  The Simile of the Woman As a man preoccupied with matters of greed had made a date With a woman and would not having met her indulge in many thoughts As many preoccupations as he would have in his mind during a dayFor so many aeons does a Bodhisattva strive to reach his goal  Considerations of Merit  If a Bodhisattva would for many thousands of kotis of aeonsGive spotless gifts and would equally guard his moralityAnd if another one were to preach the dharma associated with wisdom the foremost perfection  The merit from giving and morality would by comparison be infinitesimal When a Bodhisattva having meditated on the foremost wisdom Emerged therefrom ie that meditation preaches the stainless DharmaAnd turns over also the merit from that to the enlightenment linked to the weal of the world There is nothing that is lovely in the triple world that could become equal to him And just that merit is declared to be just worthless And likewise empty insignificant void and unsubstantialThus coursing he courses in the wisdom of the Sugatas Coursing thus he acquires immeasurable merit  No Growth or Diminution As mere talk he cognizes all these dharmas Which the Buddha has demonstrated practised and revealedThough he may teach for many niyutas of kotis of aeons Yet the Dharmaelement does not get exhausted nor does it increase And as to these five perfections of the JinasThese dharmas also have been proclaimed as mere words The Bodhisattva who turns over without putting his mind to itDoes not fail but he experiences the supreme Buddhaenlightenment   Chapter XIX  Conditioned Coproduction and the Simile of the Lamp The wick of a burning oil lamp  it is not by the first incidence of the flameThat the wick is burned away nor is it burned away when that incidence is not without it Nor is the wick burned away by the last incidence of the flame And also when that last flame is not does the lamp wick not burn away By the first thought of enlightenment one does not experience the foremost enlightenment And again when that is not there one is not able to experience itNor does the last thought arrive at the Bliss Nor again when it is not there is one able to reach it  The Simile of the Seed and the Fruit From a seed trees fruits and flowers come forth When it is obstructed or absent then there is no tree from it Just so the first thought is of course the foundation of enlightenmentBut when it is obstructed or absent there is no enlightenment from it Conditioned by seeds grow barley rice and so on Their fruits are in these seeds and yet they are not in them When this enlightenment of the Jinas arisesWhat takes place is an illusion which in its ownbeing is without existence  The Simile of the Water Drops Water drops fill a water jar drop by drop Gradually from the first incidence to the last one Just so the first thought is the initial cause of supreme enlightenmentGradually are the bright qualities fulfilled in the Buddhas  The Meaning of Emptiness He courses in dharmas as empty signiess and wishless But he does not experience the Blessed Rest nor does he course in a signAs a skilful ferryman goes from this shore to the other shore But does not stand at either end nor does he stand in the great flood Thus coursing the Bodhisattva also does not think Predestined by those who have the ten powers may I experience enlightenmentNor is he trembling because he sees that enlightenment is here not anything Thus coursing he becomes one who courses in the wisdom of the Sugatas  The Attitude to Places Which Might Inspire Fear When they have seen a world which is a wilderness full of famine and disease They have no fear and go on putting on the armourFor the wise are always joined to the limit which is further on They do not produce the least fatigue in their minds  Chapter XX  The Three Doors to Deliverance and the Buddhadharmas Furthermore the Bodhisattva who courses in the wisdom of the Jinas Cognizes these skandhas as unproduced as empty from the beginningEven during the time that unconcentrated he views in compassion the world of beings He does not become destitute of the Buddhadharmas  The Simile of the Hero A skilful man endowed with all qualities Powerful unassailable wellqualified instructed in many arts Perfect in archery devoted to many craftsPerfect in knowing the various forms of magical illusion keen on the welfare of the world He takes his mother and father together with his sons and daughters And enters a wilderness full of many hostile forcesHe conjures up many men heroic champions Gets away safely and again goes back to his home Just so at that time when a wise Bodhisattva Extends the great friendliness to all in the world of beingsHaving passed beyond the four Maras and the two levels He permanently abides in the best of concentrations but he does not experience enlightenment  The Simile of the Cosmos Supported by space is air and by that the mass of water By that again is supported this great earth and the living world If the foundation of the enjoyment of the deeds of beingsIs thus established in space how can one think of that object Just so the Bodhisattva who is established in emptiness Manifests manifold and various works to beings in the worldAnd his vows and cognitions are a force which sustains beings But he does not experience the Blessed Rest for emptiness is not a place to stand on At the time when the wise and learned Bodhisattva Courses in this most excellent quietude of the concentration on emptinessDuring that time no sign should be exaltedNor should he stand in the signless for he is one who courses calm and quiet  The Simile of the Flying Bird A flying bird has no footing in the intermediate space It does not stand on it nor does it fall to the ground So the Bodhisattva who courses in the doors to freedomNeither experiences the Blessed Rest nor does he course in the sign  The Simile of the Archer As a man trained in archery shoots an arrow upwards And then again other arrows in quick succession Without giving a chance to the first one to fall to the ground Until he wishes the arrow to fall to the ground Just so someone who courses in wisdom the best of perfections And who accomplishes wisdom skill in means the powers and the ability to work wondersAs long as these wholesome roots remain unfulfilled So long he does not obtain that most excellent emptiness  The Simile of the Twin Miracle A monk endowed with the most excellent ability to work wonders Standing in the sky performs the twin miracleHe exhibits the coming and going the lying down and the sitting But he cannot be made to desist nor does he feel exhausted however long he may be in it Just so the wise Bodhisattva standing in emptiness Perfect in cognition and the ability to work wonders wandering without a homeManifests an endless variety of works to the world But he cannot be worn down nor does he feel exhausted for kotis of aeons  The Simile of the Parachutes  It is as with some men who have stood on a high cliffIf they held a parachute in each hand and would jump off into space Their bodies once they had left the high cliffsWould go on falling until they had reached the ground Just so the wise Bodhisattva having stood in compassion Having takenhold of the two parachutes of skill in means and of wisdomConsiders dharmas as empty signless and wishless Though he does not experience the Blessed Rest he nevertheless sees the dharmas  The Simile of the Merchant and the Jewel Island Someone desirous of jewels has travelled to the treasure island And having obtained the jewels he would again return home Although in those circumstances the merchant lives quite happilyYet he bears in mind the hosts of his suffering kinsmen Just so the Bodhisattva who has travelled to the treasure isle of Emptiness And has obtained the trances faculties and powers Although he could experience the Blessed Rest wholly delighting in itHe would bear in mind all suffering beings  The Simile of the Merchant and His Journey As a merchant interested in business goes into the cities Market towns and villages which he comes across on his way so as to get acquainted with them But he neither abides therein nor in the treasure islandBut he the discerning becomes skilful in the path which leads to his home Just so the wise Bodhisattvas who become skilful everywhere In the cognition and emancipation of the Disciples and PratyekabuddhasThey abide not therein nor in the Buddhacognition Nor in what is conditioned Wise as to the path becomes the one who knows the method The Bodhisattva Undefinable At the time when he has communed with the world in friendliness And courses in the concentrations on emptiness the signless and the wishless It is impossible that he either would have an inclination to reach the Blessed Rest Or that he could be defined by the conditioned As a magically created man or one who has made his body invisible Cannot be defined by wordsJust so the Bodhisattva who courses in the doors to freedom Can also not be defined by words  The Doors to Deliverance and the Irreversible Stage If on being questioned about the practice and the faculties A Bodhisattva does not effect the revelation of deep dharmasWhich are empty and signless if he fails to indicate the dharmas peculiar to The irreversible stage he should not be known as one who has been predicted  Tokens of Irreversibility Not the level of an Arhat nor the Pratyekabuddhalevel Nor what belongs to the triple world does he long for in his dreamsBut he sees the Buddhas and himself as one who preaches Dharma to the world Predicted as irreversible should he then be known Having seen in his dreams the beings who are in the three places of woe He makes the vow May I that very instant abolish the places of woeIf through the power of his declaration of the Truth he appeases even a mass of fire Predicted as irreversible should he then be known Those possessed by ghosts with various diseases in the world of mortals Through the power of his declaration of the Truth he appeases them he who is benevolent and compassionateNor does there arise to him any selfconsciousness or pride Predicted as irreversible should he then be known  Chapter XXI  Pride and Other Deeds of Mara But when there arises in him the conceit I have been predestinedBecause by my declaration of the Truth manifold things get accomplishedWhen a Bodhisattva sets himself above other Bodhisattvas as one who has been predestined One should know that he stands in conceit and has little intelligence  Again as to the power of the name Mara having approachedWill say to him This is your name The lineage of your father and mother for seven generations backwards he runs through When you are a Buddha this will then be your name If he is one who has behaved in accordance with the ascetic practices a devoted YoginMara will tell him Formerly in your past lives you have also had these very same qualities The Bodhisattva who on hearing this becomes conceited One should know him to be possessed by Mara of little intelligence  Faults in Connection with Detachment Though he might practise quite detached from villages or cities in a mountain cave In a remote forest or in isolated woods  The Bodhisattva who exalts himself who deprecates othersOne should know him to be possessed by Mara of little intelligence Although they may constantly dwell in a village a royal city or a market town If therein they do not generate longing for the vehicle of the Arhats and PratyekabuddhasBut are devoted to enlightenment for the sake of maturing beings Then this has been preached as the detachment of the Sugatas sons Though he may reside in mountain caves five hundred miles wide Infested with wild beasts for many kotis of yearsThat Bodhisattva does not know this true detachment If he dwells contaminated by conceit When he feels superior to Bodhisattvas who practise for the weal of the world And who have attained the concentrations emancipations faculties trances and powersOn the ground that they do not course in the detachment of the remote forest  Of him the Jina has said that he is established in Maras sphere Whether he dwells in the neighbourhood of a village or in the remote forest If he is free from the thought of the twofold vehicle and fixed on the supreme enlightenmentThen this is the detachment of those who have set out for the weal of the world As one whose self is extinct should that Bodhisattva be considered   Chapter XXII  The Good Friends and the Perfections Therefore then the learned who has slain pride Who seeks with weighty resolution for the best enlightenmentShould as one attends upon a physician to be cured of a multitude of ailments Attend upon the good friend undaunted The Buddhas the Bodhisattvas who have set out for the best enlightenment And those who have these perfections have been enumerated as the good friendsIt is they who instruct them ie the Bodhisattvas in these progressive stages For a double reason they quickly understand the Buddhaenlightenment The past and future Jinas and those who stand just now in all the ten directions They all have this perfection for their path and no otherAs a splendid illumination as a torch as a light as the Teacher Have these perfections been described to those who have set out for the best enlightenment As he cognizes the perfection of wisdom through the mark of emptiness So by the same mark he cognizes all these dharmas When he wisely knows dharmas as empty as without marksIn coursing thus he courses in the wisdom of the Sugatas  Defilement and Purification In want of food indulging in imagination beings Always wander about in birthanddeath their minds attached Both I and Mine as dharmas are unreal and emptyBy his own self has the fool become entangled in space As someone who suspects that he has been poisoned May well be struck down although no poison has got into his stomach Just so the fool who has admitted into himself the notions of I and MineIs forced by that quite unreal notion of an I to undergo birth and death again and again Where one takes notice there is defilement so it has been revealed The nonapprehension of I and Mine has been called purificationBut there is herein no one who is defiled or who is cleansed Then the Bodhisattva has understood the perfection of wisdom  The Supreme Merit of Perfect Wisdom If as many beings as there are here in the entire Jambudvipa Would all having aspired for the foremost enlightenmentAnd having given gifts for many thousands of kotis of years Dedicate it all to the enlightenment linked to the weal of the world But if someone else practised in wisdom the foremost perfection Would for even one single day comply with itAn infinitesimal merit would here that heap of giving bring Therefore the undaunted should always plunge into wisdom  Compassion and Perfect Wisdom When the Yogin courses in wisdom the best of perfections He engenders the great compassion but no notion of a beingThen the wise becomes worthy of the offerings of the whole world He never fruitlessly consumes the alms of the realm The Bodhisattva who wishes to set free the gods and men Bound for so long and the beings in the three places of woeAnd to manifest to the world of beings the broad path to the other shore Should be devoted to the perfection of wisdom by day and by night  The Simile of the Pearl of Great Price A man who had gained at some time a very fine jewel Which he had not got before would be contentedIf as soon as he had gained it he would lose it again through carelessnessHe would be sorry and constantly hankering after the jewel Just so the Yogin who has set out for the best enlightenmentShould not get parted from the perfection of wisdom which is comparable to a jewelSeizing the jewel which he has gained with growing energyHe moves forward and swiftly he comes to the state of Bliss  Chapter XXIII  The Superior Position of Bodhisattvas When the sun rises free from clouds and one blaze of rays Having dispelled the entire blinding and confusing darkness It outshines all animals such as glowwormsAnd also all the hosts of the stars and the lustre of the moon Just so the wise Bodhisattva who courses in wisdom the foremost perfection Having destroyed the jungle of views The Bodhisattva who courses in emptiness and the signlessVery much surpasses the whole world as well as the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas  The Simile of the King and the Crown Prince Just as the son of a king a giver of wealth desiring the welfare of others Becomes a person of authority among all much sought afterFor even now he makes many beings happy How much more so when he will be established as the resourceful ruler of the kingdom Just so the wise Bodhisattva who courses in wisdom A donor of the deathless dear to gods and menAlready now he is interested in the happiness of many beings How much more so when he will be established as king of the Dharma  Chapter XXIV  How Mara is Discomforted and Defeated But Mara at that time becomes like one who feels a thorn in his flesh Afflicted with sorrow miserable displeased of little staminaHe manifests a conflagration on the horizon he hurls a meteor in order to cause fear How can this Bodhisattva be made to become despondent in his mind When the wise become resolutely intent Day and night beholding the meaning of wisdom the foremost perfectionThen their bodies thoughts and speech become free like a bird in the sky How can the Kinsman of Darkness gain entrance to them  What Makes Mara Contented When a Bodhisattva has taken to quarrels and disputes And when the thoughts of two Bodhisattvas become mutually conflicting and angryThen Mara becomes contented and supremely elated thinking Both these remain far distant from the cognition of the Jinas  Both these remain far distant from it comparable to malignant demons Both these will effect for themselves a waning of their pledgeThose who are full of hate deficient in patience how can they have enlightenment  Then Mara becomes contented together with his host The Bodhisattvas Pride and Repentance If a Bodhisattva who has not had his prediction Should have angry thoughts for one who has had it and should bring about a dispute For as many moments as he persists in his obstinate faulty thoughts For so many aeons he must again put on the armour Then he sets up mindfulness and he reflects These are unwholesome thoughtsBy means of the perfection of patience do the Buddhas experience enlightenment He confesses his fault and afterwards he restrains himselfOr he desists and trains himself in this Buddhadharma  Chapter XXV  How a Bodhisattva Is Trained When he trains himself he does not anywhere approach a trainingNor does he get at one who trains or at the dharmas which constitute training Who trains himself without discriminating between both  training and notraining  He trains himself in this Buddhadharma The Bodhisattva who thus cognizes this training He does not ever become deficient in training or immoralHaving found pleasure in them he trains himself in these Buddhadharmas He trains himself skilful in the superior training but without apprehending anything When they train thus in wisdom to the wise shedders of light Not even one single thought arises that is unwholesomeAs when the sun goes through the sky before the impact of its rays No darkness can maintain itself in the intermediate space  Perfect Wisdom Comprehends All the Perfections For those who have effected a training in the perfection of wisdom All the other perfections are comprehended in itAs in the false view of individuality all the sixtytwo false views Are included so are these perfections included in the perfection of wisdom As when the life faculty has been stopped Also all the other faculties that may exist are stoppedJust so when the best of the wise course in wisdom All these perfections have been said to be therein comprehended  Bodhisattvas and Disciples In all the qualities of the Disciples and likewise of the Pratyekabuddhas The wise Bodhisattva becomes trainedBut he does not stand in them nor does he long for them In that also should I be trained he thinks In that sense he trains himself in them  Chapter XXVI  Rejoicing and Perfect Wisdom If someone resolutely rejoices in the productions of thought Of a Bodhisattva who has set out for the best enlightenment and is irreversible from itOne might measure the Merus in up to a trichiliocosm by comparing them with a tip of straw But not that merit derived from rejoicing They rejoice at the heap of merit of all beings that there are Who desire what is wholesome land who want emancipationWhen for the weal of beings they have reached the infinite qualities of a Jina They will give the Dharma to the world for the complete extinction of suffering The Bodhisattva who not discriminating comprehends All dharmas as empty signless and unimpeded Without any dualism he seeks in wisdom for enlightenmentDevoted to the foremost perfection of wisdom is that Yogin  The Simile of Space and the Firmament An obstruction of the spaceelement by the firmament Cannot be found anywhere by anyoneJust so the wise Bodhisattva coursing in wisdom Is just like open space and he courses calmly quiet  The Simile of the People Created by Magic As it does not occur to a man whom a magician has conjured up when he looks at the audience I will please those people and nevertheless he performs his workThey see him exhibiting manifold illusory works Although he has no body thought or name Just so it never occurs to one who courses in wisdom Having known enlightenment I will set free the worldIn his various rebirths he is associated with manifold works Which he manifests like magical illusions but he does not course in false discrimination  The Simile of the Buddhas Magical Creations As a Buddhas magical creation performs a Buddhas work But when he does so no thought of selfconceit arises in himJust so the wise Bodhisattva who courses in wisdom Manifests all works comparable to a fictitious magical illusion  The Simile of the Machine An expert and experienced mason has made a wooden apparatus Comparable to a man or a woman it performs here all its worksJust so the wise Bodhisattva coursing in wisdom Performs all his work by his cognition but without discrimination  Chapter XXVII  The Bodhisattva Worthy of Homage To the wise who courses thus many congregations of gods Having bent forth their outstretched hands in respectful salutation will pay homageThe Buddhas also as many as there are in the worldsystems in the ten directions Effect the proclamation of the garland of the praises of his qualities  Mara Is Powerless against Certain Bodhisattvas If as many beings as there are in the fields countless like the sands of the Ganges Would all let us assume become MarasAnd if every single hair on their bodies would again magically create a snare They all could not hinder the wise For four reasons does the powerful and wise Bodhisattva Become unassailable by the four Maras and unshakableHe becomes one who dwells in the empty and yet he is not one who abandons beings He acts as he speaks he is sustained by the Sugatas  The True Attitude to Suchness The Bodhisattva who resolutely believes when this perfection of wisdom The mother of the Tathagatas is being taught And who practises the progressive path with resolutionHe should be known as having well set out towards allknowledge But he does not come to a standing place in the Suchness of the Dharmaelement He becomes as one who like a cloud stands in the sky without anywhere to stand onAs a sorcerer who like a bird rides on the wind which offers him no support Or as one who by the force of his spells miraculously produces on a tree fullblown flowers out of season  The Bodhisattva Dwells Supreme The wise and learned Bodhisattva who courses thus Does not get at one who wakes up to enlightenment nor also at the BuddhadharmasNor at one who demonstrates nor also at one who loves and sees the DharmaThis is the dwelling of those who desire calm of those who delight in the precious qualities As many as there are the dwellings of Disciples and PratyekabuddilasAssociated with the peace and happiness of calm concentration With the exception of the Arhatliberation of the Tathagatas This dwelling is among all the foremost and the unsurpassed  How and Why One Should Dwell in Emptiness A bird dwells in space but does not fall down A fish dwells amidst water but does not dieJust so the Bodhisattva who through the trances and powers has gone beyond Dwells in the empty but does not reach the Blessed Rest  One who wants to go to the summit of the qualities of all beings To experience the best the exceedingly wonderful BuddhacognitionTo give the best gift of the highest and supreme Dharma He should resort to this best dwelling of those who bring benefit  Chapter XXVIII  Who Trains in Perfect Wisdom Trains in Buddhahood Of all the trainings which have been revealed by the Leader This teaching is the best and unsurpassedOne who wise in all trainings wishes to go Beyond He should train in this perfection of wisdom in the Buddhatraining  Inexhaustibility of Perfect Wisdom This is the best receptacle the storehouse of the supreme Dharma The treasury of happiness and ease of those people who belong to the clan of the BuddhasThe past and future world saviours and those who are at present in the ten directions They have come forth from this and yet the Dharmaelement does not get exhausted As many trees fruits flowers and forest trees as there are They all have come out of the earth and originate in itAnd yet the earth does not undergo exhaustion or growth It does not get tired does not dwindle away making no discrimination The Buddhas offspring the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas The gods and the dharmas which lead to the ease and happiness of all the world  as many as there areThey all have issued from wisdom the foremost perfection And yet wisdom does not ever get exhausted nor does it increase As many beings as there are in the low middle and high regions of the world They have all so has the Sugata said been brought about by ignoranceThe machinery of ill is kept going by the full complement of the conditions And yet the machinery of ignorance does not get exhausted nor does it grow As many roots of skilful devices as there are or doors and methods of cognition They all have issued from wisdom the foremost perfection The machinery of cognition is kept going by the full complement of conditionsAnd yet the perfection of wisdom does not increase or become diminished  Conditioned Coproduction But the Bodhisattva who understands conditioned coproduction as nonproduction And this wisdom as nonextinctionAs the rays of the sun freed from the covering of the clouds So he has dispelled the covering of ignorance and become one SelfExistent  Chapter XXIX  The Perfection of Concentration Those of great might who dwell in the four Trances Do not make them into a place to settle down in nor into a homeBut these four Trances with their limbs will in their turn become The basis for the attainment of the supreme and unsurpassed enlightenment One who is established in the Trances becomes one who obtains the foremost wisdom And also when he experiences the four most excellent Formless TrancesHe makes these Trances subservient to the best and foremost enlightenment But it is not for the extinction of the outflows that the Bodhisattva trains himself in these Astonishing and wonderful is this accumulation of precious qualities When they have dwelled in Trance and Concentration there is then no signWhen the personality of those who have stood therein breaks up They are reborn again in the world of sensedesire as and where they had intended As some man from Jambudvipa who had in the past been a godWould after reaching again the highest abodes of the gods See the apartments contained in them And would then again come back and not make his home therein Just so those Bodhisattvas bearers of the best qualities Having dwelt in Trance and Concentration Yogins who have exerted themselvesBecome again established in the senseworld unstained As the lotus in water independent of the dharmas of the fools Except in order to mature beings to purify the Buddha field To fulfil these perfections the Greatsouled onesDo not strive after rebirth in the formless world Lest there be a loss of the perfections and of the qualities of enlightenment therein It is as if some man having found a deposit of jewels Would not generate longing in his intelligence with regard to it At some other time he may acquire a few of themHaving taken hold of them having entered his home he would not be covetous for any more Just so the wise Bodhisattvas who have gained The calm concentration of the four Trances which gives joy and ease Having let go the acquisition of the joy and ease of Trance and concentrationThey enter again into the sensuous world compassionate for all that lives When a Bodhisattva dwells in the concentration of the Trances He generates no longing in his intelligence for the vehicle of the Arhats and PratyekabuddhasFor then he becomes unconcentrated in his thought distracted and puffed up He has lost the qualities of a Buddha a sailor who suffers shipwreck Although he applies himself to the five sensequalities  To form and sound and likewise smell and taste and touchWhen free from the vehicle of the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas the joyous Bodhisattva Should a hero be wisely known as being constantly concentrated  The Perfection of Vigour They have pure and courageous minds and are linked to other beings and persons When they are practising the excellent perfection of VigourAs a maid servant is submissive to her master who is not subject to anyone else So do the firmly wise submit to subjection by all beings The servant does not answer back to her master Even when abused struck or beatenExceedingly trembling in mind and overcome by fear She thinks He surely will kill me for that Just so the Bodhisattva who has set out for the foremost enlightenment Should behave towards the entire world like a true servantThereupon he obtains enlightenment and the fulfilment of the qualities takes place Fire which has arisen from grass and sticks then burns them up Having renounced a happy destiny for himself Practising his duty towards other beings day and night in his thought free from hesitationLike a mother ministering to her only child He abides in his resolute intention unexhausted  Chapter XXX  The Perfection of Vigour Continued The Bodhisattva who intends to wander about in birthanddeath for a long time A Yogin devoted to the purification of the Buddha field for the welfare of beingsAnd who does not produce the least thought of fatigue He is endowed with the perfection of vigour and undaunted If the unwise Bodhisattva counts the kotis of aeons And has the notion that it is long until the full attainment of enlightenment he is bound to suffer And for a long time he will be suffering while moving unto DharmaTherefore he is inferior in the perfection of vigour and essentially indolent Beginning with the production of the first thought of the foremost enlightenment Until in the end he reaches the unsurpassed BlissIf night and day he would persevere singlemindedly The wise and learned should be known as one who has put forth vigour If someone would say On condition that you have shattered Mount Sumeru You will be one who will attain to the foremost enlightenmentAnd if he then effects a thought of fatigue or limitation to his efforts Then that Bodhisattva is affected by indolence  But when there arises to him the mindful thought That is nothing difficultIn a mere moment Sumeru will break up into dust Then the wise Bodhisattva becomes one who puts forth vigourBefore long he will attain the foremost enlightenment of the Leaders If he would exert himself with body thought and speech thinking Having matured it I will work the weal of the world Then established in the notion of a self he is affected by indolenceHe is as far distant from the meditational development of notself as the sky is from the ground When one has no notion of either body or thought or a being Standing rid of perception coursing in the nondual DharmaThat has been called by Him who bestows benefits the perfection of vigour Of those who desire the blissful imperishable foremost enlightenment  The Perfection of Patience When he hears someone else speaking to him harshly and offensively The wise Bodhisattva remains quite at ease and contentedHe thinks I Who speaks Who hears How to whom by whom The discerning is then devoted to the foremost perfection of patience  If a Bodhisattva devoted to the precious Dharma remains patient And if someone else would give the trichiliocosm filled with precious things To the Buddhas Knowers of the world and to the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas Infinitesimal only will be by comparison the merit from that heap of gifts The personality of one who is established in patience is completely purified Exalted by the thirtytwo marks it becomes boundless He preaches the best empty Dharma to beingsDear to the entire world do the patient and discerning become If someone had taken a basket containing sandalwood power And with respect and affection strewed it over the Bodhisattva And if a second one were to throw live coals over his head He should produce a mind equal to both of them Having thus been patient the wise and learned Bodhisattva Dedicates that production of thought to the foremost enlightenment The hero who remains patient in all the worlds surpassesWhatever Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas there may be in the world of beings  Again one who is patient should produce a thought thusIn the hells in the world of animals and in the Yama world there are many ills With the sensepleasures as cause one must experience much that causes displeasureBetter for the sake of enlightenment to be patient today Whip stick sword murder imprisonment and blows Decapitation and amputation of ears hands and feet and of noseAs many ills as there are in the world all that I will endure When he thinks thus then the Bodhisattva stands in the perfection of patience   Chapter XXXI  The Perfection of Morality By morality those who hanker after calm are lifted upEstablished in the sphere of those with the ten powers unbroken in their moralityHow ever many actions of restraint they comply with They dedicate them to enlightenment for the benefit of all beings  If he generates a longing for the enlightenment of Arhats and PratyekabuddhasHe becomes immoral unwise and likewise faulty in his coursingBut when one turns over all ones merit into the utmost Bliss of enlightenment Then one is established in the perfection of morality although joined to the sensequalities The Dharma from which come the qualities of the enlightenment of the Gentle That is the object of the morality of those who are endowed with the qualities of DharmaThe Dharma which involves the loss of the qualities of the enlightenment of those who act for the weal of the world As immorality has that been proclaimed by the Leader When a Bodhisattva tastes of the five sensequalities But has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the holy SanghaAnd has turned his attention towards allknowledge thinking I will become a Buddha  As established in the perfection of morality should that discerning one be known If when coursing for kotis of aeons in the ten paths of wholesome action He engenders a longing for Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood Then he becomes one whose morality is broken and faulty in his moralityWeightier than an offence deserving expulsion is such a production of thought When he guards morality he turns the resulting merit over to the foremost enlightenmentBut he does not feel conceited about that nor does he exalt himself When he has got rid of the notion of I and the notion of other beings Established in the perfection of morality is that Bodhisattva called If a Bodhisattva coursing in the path of the Jinas Makes a difference between these beings as observers of morality and those as of bad moralityIntent on the perception of multiplicity he is perfectly immoral He is faulty in his morality not perfectly pure in it  He who has no notion of I and no notion of a beingHe has performed the withdrawal from perception and he has no need for restraintOne who minds neither about restraint nor about nonrestraint He has been proclaimed by the Leader as restrained by morality  The Perfection of Giving But one who endowed with morality a pure beingBecomes unconcerned about anything that may be dear or unclear If when he renounces head hands and feet his thought remains undejected He becomes one who gives up all he has always uncowed And having known the essential original nature of dharmas as void and without self He would renounce his own flesh undejected in thought To say nothing of his renouncing of property and goldIt is impossible that he should act from meanness Through the notion of I comes about a sense of ownership about property as well as greed How can the deluded have the resolve to renunciationThe mean are reborn in the world of the Pretas Or if as humans then they are poor Then the Bodhisattva having understood why these beings are povertystricken Becomes resolved on giving always a generous giverWhen he has given away the four Continents well adorned as if they were just spittle He becomes elated for he has not kept the Continents Having given gifts the wise and learned Bodhisattva Having brought to mind all the beings that there are in the triple world Becomes to all of them a donor and he turns overThat gift into the most excellent enlightenment for the weal of the world When he has given a gift he does not make it into a basis or support And he does never expect any reward from itHaving thus renounced he becomes a wise renouncer of all The little he has renounced becomes much and immeasurable If all the beings in the entire triple world as many as there are Would let us assume give gifts for endless aeonsTo the Buddhas Knowers of the world to Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas But would wish for the virtues of the Disciples And if a Bodhisattva wise and skilled in means Would rejoice at the foundation of their meritorious deed And would for the weal of beings turn it over into the best and most excellent enlightenment By having turned over he surpasses the merit of the entire world If there were a large heap of spurious glass jewels One single gem of lapis lazuli surpasses it all Just so the Bodhisattva who rejoices surpassesThe merit from the whole vast heap of gifts of the entire world If the Bodhisattva when giving gifts to the world Remains unaffected by a sense of ownership or by affection for his propertyFrom that his wholesome root grows into something of great might As the moon in the absence of cloud is a circle of radiant light in the bright half of the lunar month  Chapter XXXII  Rewards of the Six Perfections Through Giving a Bodhisattva cuts off rebirth as a Preta He also cuts off poverty and likewise all the defilements When he courses in it ie giving he gains infinite and abundant wealthThrough his giving he matures beings in trouble Through Morality he avoids rebirth as one of the many animals And also the eight untoward moments he constantly gains rebirth at an auspicious momentThrough Patience he gains a perfect and exalted body With golden skin dear to the world to look at Through Vigour he does not incur the loss of the bright qualities He gains the storehouse of the infinite cognition of the JinasThrough Trance he casts off the sensequalities in disgust He acquires the lore the superknowledges and concentrations Having through Wisdom comprehended the essential original nature of dharmasHe completely transcends the triple world and the states of woe Having turned the precious wheel of the Mightiest of Men He demonstrates Dharma to the world for the complete extinction of ill When the Bodhisattva has fulfilled these dharmas He then still receives the purity of the field and the purity of the beings in itHe also receives the lineage of the Buddha the lineage of the Dharma And likewise the lineage of the Sangha He receives all dharmas  Conclusion The supreme physician who accords medical treatment to the sickness of the world Has taught this exposition of wisdom which is the path to enlightenment It is called The Path to enlightenment which is the Accumulation of Precious Qualities Thus have I heard Once upon a time the Buddha sojourned in the Jetavana park near Sravasti with an assembly of twelve hundred and fifty bhiksus One day at mealtime the World Honoured One put on His robe took His bowl and entered the great town of Sravasti to beg for His food After He had begged from door to door He returned to His place When He had taken His meal He put away His robe and bowl washed His feet arranged His seat and sat down At the time the elder Subhuti who was in the assembly rose from his seat uncovered his right shoulder knelt upon his right knee respectfully joined the palms of his hands and said to the Buddha It is very rare O World Honoured One how well the Tathagata protects and thinks of all Bodhisattvas how well He instructs all the Bodhisattvas O World Honoured One when virtuous men or women develop the supremeenlightenment mind how should their minds abide and how should they be subdued The Buddha said As you say the Tathagata protects cherishes and instructs Bodhisattvas so well Now listen attentively and I will tell you how the minds of virtuous men and women who develop the supreme enlightenment mind should thus abide and be subdued  Oh yes World Honoured One I shall be glad to hear  The Buddha said Subhuti all Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas should subdue their minds as follows All living beings born from eggs wombs humidity or by transformation with or without form either thoughtful or thoughtless and neither thoughtful nor thoughtless are all led by me to the final nirvana for the extinction of reincarnation Although immeasurable uncountable and unlimitable numbers of living beings are thus led to  the extinction of reincarnation it is true that not a living being is led there Why so Subhuti Bodhisattva Furthermore Subhuti a Bodhisattvas mind should not abide anywhere when giving alms that is to say he should give without a mind abiding in form or he should give without a mind abiding in sound or in smell or in taste or in touch or in things  Subhuti thus a Bodhisattva should give alms without a mind abiding in false notions of form   his merit will be inconceivable and immeasurable Subhuti what do you think Can you think of and measure the extent of space in the East I cannot World Honoured One Subhuti can you think of and measure  a Bodhisattva practises charity without a mind abiding in forms his merit is equally inconceivable and immeasurable Subhuti a Bodhisattvas mind should thus abide as taught Subhuti what do you think Can the Tathagata be seen by means of His bodily form No World Honoured One the Tathagata cannot be seen by means of His bodily form Because when the Tathagata speaks of bodily form it is not  form The Buddha said to Subhuti Everything with form is unreal if all forms are seen as unreal the Tathagata will be perceived Subhuti said to the Buddha World Honoured One will there be living beings who can develop a true belief in these words sentences and chapters when they are expounded to them The Buddha said In the last  years before the final passing of the Tathagata there will be those who will observe the rules of morality and perform good actions which will result in blessing These people will be able to develop a faith in these sentences which they will consider as embodying the Truth You should know that they will not have planted good roots in just one two three four or five Buddha lands They will have planted them in countless thousands and tens of thousands of Buddha lands Upon hearing these sentences there will arise in them a single thought of pure faith Subhuti the Tathagata knows and sees all these living beings will thus acquire immeasurable merits they will have wiped out false notions of an ego a personality a being and a life of Dharma and NotDharma cling to the notion of an ego a personality a being and a life If their minds grasp the Dharma they will  cling to the notion of an ego a personality a being and a life cling to the notion of an ego a personality a being and a life Therefore one should not grasp and hold on to the notion of Dharma as well as that of NotDhama This is why the Tathagata always said Ye Bhiksus should know that the Dharma I expound is likened to a raft Even the Dharma should be cast aside how much more so the NotDharma Subhuti what do you think Has the Tathagata  As I understand the meaning of the Buddhas teaching there is no fixed Dharma called Supreme Enlightenment and there is also no fixed Dharma the Tathagata can expound  it is neither Dharma nor NotDharma Why is this All Bhadras and Aryas differ on account of the Eternal Asamskrta Dharma Subhuti what do you think If someone filled the Universe with the seven treasures and gave them all as alms would his merit be great Subhuti replied Because this merit is not the nature of merit the Tathagata says it is great Subhuti if on the other hand someone received and kept even a four line stanza of this sutra and expounded it to others his merit would surpass that   Subhuti all Buddhas and their SupremeEnlightenmentDharma originate from this sutra Subhuti the socalled Buddhas and Dharmas are not real Buddhas and Dharmas Subhuti what do you think I have obtained the fruit of entering the stream Subhuti replied No World Honoured One Because srotaapanna means entering the stream but actually there is no entry into either form sound smell taste touch or dharma Therefore he is called srotaapanna Subhuti what do you think Can a Sakrdagamin have this thought  I have obtained the fruit of a Sakrdagamin Subhuti replied No World Honoured One Because Sakrdagamin means once more to come but actually there is neither coming nor going Therefore he is called a Sakrdagamin Subhuti what do you think Can an Anagamin have this thought  I have obtained the fruit of an Anagamin Subhuti replied No World Honoured One Because Anagamin means nocoming but actually there is no such a thing as nocoming Therefore he is called an Anagamin Subhuti what do you think Can an Arhat have this thought  I have obtained the enlightenment of an Arhat Subhuti replied No World Honoured One Because there is no Dharma which is called Arhatship World Honoured One if an Arhat thinks I have obtained the enlightenment of an Arhat he will still grasp and hold on to the notion of an ego a personality a being and a life World Honoured One the Buddha has declared that I have obtained the Passionless Samadhi and that I surpass all men I am therefore the highest passionless Arhat World Honoured One I do not think I am a passionless Arhat for World Honoured One if I had thought I have attained Arhatship the World Honoured One would not have said Subhuti takes delight in the calm and quiet free from temptation and distress The fact that Subhuti does not act  is called the calm and quiet in which Subhuti takes delight The Buddha said to Subhuti What do you think Do Bodhisattvas adorn Buddha lands  No World Honoured One Because this is not real adornment it is  called the adornment of Buddha lands Subhuti this is why all Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas should thus develop a pure and clean mind which should not abide in form sound smell taste touch and dharma Subhuti supposing a man has a body as great as mount Sumeru what do you think Would such a body be great Subhuti replied Very great World Honoured One Because the Buddha says it is not the real body but is  called a great body Subhuti if there were as many rivers like the Ganges as there are grains of sand in the Ganges would the total of grains of sand in all these rivers be very great Subhuti replied These rivers would be innumerable how much more so would be their sandgrains Subhuti I now tell you truly If a virtuous man or woman filled a number of universes as great as the number of sandgrains in all these rivers with the seven treasures and gave them all away in alms  would his or her merit be great Subhuti replied Very great World Honoured One The Buddha said to Subhuti If a virtuous man or woman receives and holds  even a fourline stanza of this sutra and expounds it to others his or her merit will surpass that of the almsgiver Furthermore Subhuti wheresoever this sutra or even one of its fourline stanzas is expounded you should know that all devas men and asuras should make their offerings there as if the place was a Buddha stupa or a Buddha temple How much more so if someone is able to receive hold  read and recite the whole sutra Subhuti you should know that such a person will achieve the highest and rarest Dhama Wheresoever this sutra may be found the Buddha and His respected disciples will be there also Subhuti then asked the Buddha World Honoured One what name should be given to this sutra and how should we receive and hold it  The Buddha said Because Subhuti the Prajna paramita as expounded by the Buddha is not Prajna paramita but is  so called Subhuti what do you think Does the Tathagata expound the Dharma Subhuti said World Honoured One the Tathagata does not expound anything Subhuti what do you think Are there many particles of dust in the universe Subhuti replied Many World Honoured One Subhuti the Tathagata says these particles of dust are not  called particles of dust The Tathagata says the universe is not  called the universe Subhuti what do you think Can the Tathagata be perceived by means of His thirtytwo physical characteristics  No World Honoured One The Tathagata cannot be perceived by them Because the Tathagata says they are not real but are  even a fourline stanza of this sutra and expounds it to other the merit resulting from the latter will be greater At that time after listening to this sutra Subhuti had understood its profound meaning and was moved to tears He said to the Buddha How rare O World Honoured One The Buddha has expounded such a very profound sutra Since I have acquired the wisdom eye I have not heard of such a sutra World Honoured One if someone after listening to this sutra believes that his mind is clean and pure he will realise reality We should know that such a person will achieve the highest and rarest merit World Honoured One this Reality is not Reality but the Tathagata calls it Reality World Honoured One as I now listen to this sutra I have no difficulty in believing understanding receiving and holding it but in the last epoch the last five hundred year period if there be a man who  listen to this sutra believes understands receives and holds it he will be most rare Because he will no longer  an ego a personality a being and a life Because the forms of an ego a personality a being and a life are not forms Because when he has rejected all forms he is called a Buddha The Buddha said Just so Subhuti just so If on the one hand there be a man who listens to this sutra and is not filled with alarm fear or dread you should know that such a person is most rare Because Subhuti as the Tathagata says the first perfection  Subhuti the Tathagata speaks of the Perfection of Patience  which is not but is called the Perfection of Patience Because Subhuti in  when my body was mutilated by Kaliraja I had at that time no notion of an ego a personality a being and a life Because in the past when my body was dismembered if I  held the conception of an ego a personality a being and a life I would have been stirred by feelings of anger and hatred Subhuti I also remember that in the past during my former five hundred lives I was a Ksantyrsi and held no conception of an ego a personality a being and a life Therefore Subhuti Bodhisattvas should forsake all conceptions of form and resolve to develop the Supreme Enlightenment Mind  Their minds should not abide in form sound smell taste touch and dharma Their minds should abide nowhere If minds abide somewhere it will be in falsehood This is why the Buddha says that Bodhisattvas minds should not abide in form when practising charity  Subhuti all Bodhisattvas should thus make offerings for the welfare of all living beings The Tathagata speaks of forms which are not forms and of living beings who are not living beings Subhuti the Tathagatas words are true and correspond to reality They are ultimate words neither deceitful nor heterodox Subhuti the Dharma the Tathagata has obtained is neither real nor unreal Subhuti if a Bodhisattva practises charity  if a Bodhisattva practises dana with a mind not abiding in dharma he is like a man with open eyes who can see everything in the sunshine Subhuti in future ages if a virtuous man or woman is able to receive hold  read and recite this sutra the Tathagata by means of His Buddha Wisdom will know and see clearly that such a person will achieve immeasurable and unlimitable merits Subhuti if  contradiction the latters merit will surpass that of the former How much more so if this sutra is written received held read recited and expounded to others Subhuti to sum up the merits resulting from this sutra are inconceivable inestimable and without limit The Tathagata expounds it to those initiated into the Mahayana and the Supreme Yana If they are able to receive hold  read and recite it and expound it widely to others the Tathagata will know and will see that they will achieve inexpressible and inconceivable merits that are without measure or limit They will bear  Why Because Subhuti those who take delight in the Hinayana and hold the view of an ego a personality a being and a life cannot listen to receive hold  read and recite this sutra and explain it to others Subhuti wheresoever this sutra may be found all worlds of devas men and asuras should make offerings for you should know that such a place is just a stupa which should be revered worshipped and circumambulated with offerings of flowers and incense Subhuti I remember that in the past countless aeons before the advent of Dipamkara Buddha I met  milliards of Buddhas to whom I made offerings and whom I served faultlessly Now if in the last period  read and recite this sutra his merits will far exceed mine which resulted from my offerings made to Buddhas for mine cannot be reckoned as one hundredth one thousandth one ten thousandth or one hundred thousandth part thereof in fact no computation or comparison is possible Subhuti in the last period of the Buddha kalpa if a virtuous man or woman is able to receive hold  read and recite this sutra my full statement of this persons merits will create derangement doubt and disbelief in the minds of all listeners Subhuti you should know that as the meaning of this sutra is inconceivable so is the fruit of its reward At the time Subhuti asked the Buddha World Honoured One if a virtuous man or woman is determined to develop the Supreme Enlightened Mind how should his or her mind abide and how should it be subdued The Buddha said to Subhuti I have to lead all living beings to put a stop to  or escapes suffering Because Subhuti if a Bodhisattva clings to the notion of an ego a personality a being and a life he is not a  Bodhisattva Because Subhuti there is not really a Dharma which can develop the SupremeEnlightenmentMind Subhuti what do you think When the Tathagata was with Dipamkara Buddha did He have any Dharma by means of which He attained Supreme Enlightenment  No World Honoured One As I understand the meaning of the Buddhas teaching when He was with Dipamkara Buddha He had no Dharma by means of which He attained Supreme Enlightenment The Buddha said Just so Subhuti just so There was really no Dharma by means of which the Tathagata attained Supreme Enlightenment Because Tathagata means the suchness of all Dharmas If someone still says The Tathagata obtained Supreme Enlightenment I tell you Subhuti there is no Dharma by means of which the Buddha did so  Subhuti that Enlightenment was by itself neither real nor unreal This is why the Tathagata says that all Dharmas are Buddhas Dharmas Subhuti these socalled Dharmas are not but are  called all Dharmas World Honoured One the great body of which the Tathagata speaks is not great but is  called a great body Subhuti in like manner if a Bodhisattva says I should lead uncountable living beings to put a stop to  he cannot be called a Bodhisattva Because there is really no dharma called the Bodhisattva  Therefore the Buddha says Of all dharmas there is not a single one which possesses an ego a personality a being and a life Subhuti if a Bodhisattva says I should adorn Buddha lands he cannot be called a Bodhisattva Because when the Tathagata speaks of such adornment it is not but is  called adornment Subhuti if a Bodhisattva is thoroughly versed in  the Tathagata will call him a true Bodhisattva Subhuti what do you think Does the Tathagata possess human eyes Yes World Honoured One the Tathagata possesses human eyes Subhuti what do you think Does the Tathagata possess deva eye Yes World Honoured One the Tathagata possesses deva eyes Subhuti what do you think Does the Tathagata possess wisdom eyes Yes World Honoured One the Tathagata possesses wisdom eyes Subhuti what do you think Does the Tathagata possess Dharma eyes Yes World Honoured One The Tathagata possess Dharma eyes Subhuti What do you think Does the Tathagata possess Buddha eyes Yes World Honoured One the Tathagata possesses Buddha eyes Subhuti what do you think Does the Tathagata say that the sandgrains in the Ganges are sandgrains Yes World Honoured One the Tathagata says they are sandgrains Subhuti what do you think If there were as many Ganges rivers as sandgrains in the Ganges and if there were as many Buddha realms as sandgrains of all these Ganges rivers would there be many world systems Many World Honoured One The Buddha said the living beings in all these world systems have many different minds which are all known to the Tathagata Because the minds the Tathagata speaks of are not minds but are  called minds And why Because Subhuti neither the past the present nor the future mind can be found Subhuti what do you think If someone filled the universe with the seven treasures and gave all away in his practice of dana would this  cause the giver would gain a great merit Subhuti if the merit was real the Tathagata would not say it was great He says so because there is no merit Subhuti what do you think Can the Buddha be perceived by His completely perfect physical body  No World Honoured One the Tathagata should not be so perceived Because the Buddha says the completely perfect rupakaya is not but is called the completely perfect rupakaya Subhuti what do you think Can the Tathagata be perceived by His completely perfect forms No World Honoured One the Tathagata should not be so perceived because the Tathagata says the completely perfect forms are not but are called completely perfect forms Subhuti do not say that the Tathagata thinks I must expound the Dharma Do not have such a thought Because if someone says so he will really slander the Buddha and be unable to understand my teaching Subhuti when  expounds the Dharma there is really no Dharma to teach World Honoured One will there be in future ages living beings who will believe this Dharma when they hear it The Buddha said Subhuti the living beings  are neither living nor not living beings Because Subhuti the Tathagata says these living beings are not  called living beings Subhuti said to the Buddha World Honoured One does your  mean that you have not gained anything whatsoever The Buddha replied Just so Subhuti just so I have not gained even the least Dharma from Supreme enlightenment and this is called Supreme Enlightenment Furthermore Subhuti this Dharma is universal and impartial wherefore it is called Supreme Enlightenment The practice of all good virtues  free from attachment to an ego a personality a being and a life will result in the attainment of Supreme Enlightenment Subhuti the socalled good virtues  called good virtues Subhuti if  reads and recites even a fourline stanza of this Prajnaparamita Sutra and expounds it to others the merit resulting from the formers dana will not be worth onehundredth onethousandth onetenthousandth and onehundred thousandth part of that obtained by the latter as no conceivable comparison can be made between the two Subhuti what do you think You should not say the Tathagata has this thought  I should liberate living beings Subhuti you should not think so Because there are really no living beings whom the Tathagata can liberate If there were the Tathagata would hold  an ego a personality a being and a life Subhuti  the Tathagata speaks of an ego there is in reality no ego although common men think so Subhuti the Tathagata says common men are not but are  called common men Subhuti what do you think Can the Tathagata be recognised by His thirtytwo physical characteristics Subhuti replied Yes yes He can The Buddha said Subhuti if the Tathagata can be recognised by His thirtytwo physical characteristics a world ruler  would be the Tathagata Subhuti said to the Buddha World Honoured One as I understand your teaching the Tathagata cannot be recognised by His thirtytwo physical characteristics Thereupon the World Honoured One recited the following gatha He who sees me by outward appearance  cannot perceive the Tathagata Subhuti if you have  this thought The Tathagata does not rely on His possession of characteristics to obtain supreme Enlightenment Subhuti banish that thought Subhuti if you think it while developing the Perfect Enlightenment Mind you will advocate the annihilation of all Dharmas Because one who develops the Supreme Enlightenment Mind does not advocate the annihilation  Because Subhuti all Bodhisattvas do not receive reward for their merits Subhuti asked the Buddha World Honoured One why do Bodhisattvas not receive reward for their merits Subhuti Bodhisattvas should have no longing and no attachment when they practise meritorious virtues therefore they do not receive a reward Subhuti if someone says the Tathagata comes or goes sits or lies he does not understand what I mean Because the Tathagata has neither whence  therefore He is called the Tathagata Subhuti If a virtuous man or woman reduced to dust all the worlds in the Universe would those particles of dust many Subhuti replied Many World Honoured One Because if they really existed the Buddha would not say they were particles of dust And why Because when the Buddha speaks of particles of dust they are not but are  called particles of dust World Honoured One when the Tathagata speaks of worlds they are not but are  called worlds Because if they really exist they are just agglomerations The Tathagata speaks of agglomerations which are not but are  called agglomerations Subhuti that which is called an agglomeration cannot be spoken of but the vulgar man has longing for and attachment to this thing Subhuti what do you think The Buddha speaks of the view of an ego a personality a being and a life Subhuti does that person understand what I mean No World Honoured one that person does not understand Subhuti the socalled form of things  called the form of things Subhuti if on the one hand someone gave away in alms  read and recited even a fourline stanza of this sutra and expounded it to others the latters merit would surpass that of the former In what manner should it be taught to others By teaching it without attachment to form with the immutability of the absolute Why is it Because All phenomena are like a dream an illusion a bubble and a shadow Like dew and lightning Thus should you contemplate them When the Buddha had finished expounding this sutra the elder Subhuti together with bhiksus bhiksunis upasakas upasikas and all the worlds of devas men and asuras who had listened to His teaching were filled with joy and believed received and observed it Sūtra of the AllEncompassing Knowledge Store the Heart of PrajñāPāramitā Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Tang Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Dharmacandra from India Thus I have heard At one time the Buddha was staying on the Vulture Peak Mountain near the great city of Rājagṛha together with  great bhikṣus and  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas At their head were Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva Maitreya Bodhisattva and others They all had attained the Samādhi of Total Retention abiding in the inconceivable liberation Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva seated in the multitude rose and came to the Buddha Facing the Buddha he joined his palms and bent over respectfully Gazing deferentially at the venerated visage he said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I would like to pronounce in this assembly Bodhisattvas allencompassing knowledge store the heart of prajñāpāramitā I pray only that the WorldHonored One will permit me to pronounce to the Bodhisattvas the secret tenets of the Dharma The WorldHonored One replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva in the Brahma tone Great Compassionate One you have my permission to speak and to be the great radiance to sentient beings Then Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva having received the Buddhas approval and considerate protection entered the right experience in the Samādhi of Wisdom Light After he entered this samādhi with its power he went deep into prajñāpāramitā and saw that the selfessence of the five aggregates is all empty With the understanding that the selfessence of the five aggregates is all empty he peacefully rose from his samādhi Forthwith he told āriputra the Wise Good man this Bodhisattva has the heart of prajñāpāramitā called the AllEncompassing Knowledge Store Now hearken and ponder well I will pronounce it to you That having been said āriputra the Wise responded to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva Yes Great Pure One I pray that you will pronounce it Now is the right time Thereupon he told āriputra BodhisattvaMahāsattvas should learn in this way The nature of form is emptiness the nature of emptiness is form Form is no different from emptiness emptiness is no different from form In effect form is emptiness and emptiness is form The same is true for sensory reception perception mental processing and consciousness The nature of consciousness is emptiness the nature of emptiness is consciousness Consciousness is no different from emptiness emptiness is no different from consciousness In effect consciousness is emptiness and emptiness is consciousness āriputra dharmas with empty appearances have neither birth nor death neither impurity nor purity neither increase nor decrease Therefore in emptiness there is no form nor sensory reception perception mental processing or consciousness no eye ear nose tongue body or mental faculty nor sights sounds scents flavors tactile sensations or mental objects no spheres from eye sphere to mental consciousness sphere There is neither ignorance nor ending of ignorance neither old age and death nor ending of old age and death There is no suffering accumulation  cessation  or the path There is neither wisdomknowledge nor attainment because there is nothing to attain Bodhisattvas because they rely on prajñāpāramitā have no hindrances in their minds Without hindrance they have no fear Staying far from inverted dreaming and thinking they will ultimately attain nirvāṇa Buddhas of the past present and future because they rely on prajñāpāramitā all attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Hence we know that the PrajñāPāramitā  is the great spiritual mantra the great illumination mantra the unsurpassed mantra the unequaled mantra which can remove all suffering It is true not false Hence the PrajñāPāramitā Mantra is pronounced gate gate pāragate pārasagate bodhi svāhā  After the Buddha pronounced this sūtra  the multitude of bhikṣus and Bodhisattvas as well as all the gods humans asuras gandharvas and others in the world having heard the Buddhas words greatly rejoiced They all believed in accepted and reverently carried out the teachings Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Liu Song Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Guṇabhadra from IndiaAt one time the Buddha was dwelling in the Anāthapiṇḍika Garden of Jetavana Park in the city kingdom of rāvastī together with  great bhikṣus as well as  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas and a multitude of gods dragons yakṣas and gandharvas Also present were  upāsakas and upāsikās In attendance too were the Brahmakings rulers of this Sahā World as well as the godking akra the four godkings and their retinues From worlds in the ten directions came innumerable bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās as well as Bodhisattvas At that time the Tathāgata pronounced the Dharma to His four groups of disciples telling them With existence there are pain and pleasure Without existence there is neither pain nor pleasure Therefore keeping away from pain and pleasure is the foremost bliss of nirvāṇa All these  voicehearer bhikṣus were Arhats They had ended their afflictions and the discharges thereof and their minds had achieved command and ease Like the great dragon with their minds liberated and their wisdom unfolded they had completed their undertaking  Having shed the heavy burden they had acquired benefits for themselves ending the bondage of existence Liberated by true knowledge they had achieved the foremost pāramitā and total command of their minds Of those who were still learning a countless number had achieved the  fruits becoming Srotāpannas Sakṛdāgāmins or Anāgāmins An innumerable multitude of bhikṣus though still with afflictions had come to achievement Also from worlds in the ten directions came an innumerable multitude of BodhisattvaMahāsattvas who had acquired immeasurable asakhyeyas of merits Their number was beyond calculation or analogy unknowable to voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas The exceptions were Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva Great Strength Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva and Maitreya BodhisattvaMahāsattva Such leading BodhisattvaMahāsattvas were in asakhyeya multitudes as numerous as grasses and trees grown from the earth Bodhisattvas who came from other directions were countless as well Also present was the bhikṣuṇī Kṣema together with a group of bhikṣuṇīs Present as well were Lady Viśākhā and Queen Mallikā together with their innumerable attendants Also present was the Elder Sudatta together with innumerable upāsakas The WorldHonored One in the midst of this huge multitude introduced the Dharma Door of Existence and Nonexistence Meanwhile King Prasenajit rising from his sleep thought I should go to the WorldHonored One Having had this thought he immediately set off with drums beating and conch shells blowing going to the Buddha The WorldHonored One knowing the reason still asked nanda why is there the sound of drums and conch shells nanda replied to the Buddha King Prasenajit is coming to the Buddha Hence the sound of drums and conch shells The Buddha told nanda You should also beat the great Dharma drum because I now will pronounce the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum nanda asked the Buddha I have never heard of the name of this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Why is it called the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum The Buddha told nanda How can you know it Not even one of the BodhisattvaMahāsattvas in this assembly knows this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum which has a sixsyllable name  Much less have you heard of it nanda said to the Buddha This is unprecedented The name of this Dharma is truly hard to know Indeed nanda the fact is not different from your statement nanda this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum like the bloom of the udumbara tree is rare in the world nanda asked the Buddha Not all Buddhas have this Dharma The Buddha told nanda Buddhas of the past present and future all have this Dharma nanda asked the Buddha If so why did these Bodhisattvas the heroes among men all come to gather here Why do their Tathāgatas not expound this Dharma in their own lands The Buddha told nanda For example an āraṇyaka bhikṣu lives alone in a mountain cave On his way to the village to beg for food he sees various human and animal corpses Having seen them he feels disgusted and returns without food thinking Alas I will definitely be like that Then he feels happy thinking I should go there again to observe corpses to intensify my revulsion Again he heads for that village looking to see corpses in order to strengthen his perception of impurity Seeing them he continues to observe them Then he achieves the holy fruit becoming an Arhat Buddhas in other worlds do not teach impermanence suffering emptiness or impurity Because the Dharma in those Buddha Lands should be their way Those Tathāgatas say to their Bodhisattvas How marvelous ākyamuni the WorldHonored One taking the hard way appears in the land of the five turbidities For the sake of suffering sentient beings using various viable approaches he pronounces the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Therefore good men you should learn in that way Those Bodhisattvas have come to this assembly because they all want to see me to pay respects and to make obeisance Having come to this assembly they will attain the first ground even up to the tenth ground  Hence the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum is very hard to encounter Hence multitudes of great Bodhisattvas from worlds in the ten directions for the sake of hearing the Dharma have all gathered here nanda said to the Buddha Very good Very good All who attend will benefit They all will receive the hardtoacquire Dharma in this sūtra The Buddha told nanda Such a profound sūtra cannot be received by all Therefore you should not say that all who attend will benefit nanda asked the Buddha Why will not all who attend benefit The Buddha told nanda This sūtra is the secret Dharma store of Tathāgatas Therefore nanda you should not say that all who attend will benefit nanda said to the Buddha Then is it not like King Prasenajit beating the huge war drum to launch a battle When the sound is heard all  arrows fall away The Buddha told nanda When King Prasenajit beats the war drum not all delight in hearing the sound of the drum The cowardly ones are scared to death or nearly to death Indeed nanda the name of this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum is the Dharma Door in which riders of the Two Vehicles disbelieve Therefore nanda as the huge war drum is beaten only by the king before fighting a battle so too can this great Dharma drum the secret of Buddhas be expounded only by a Buddha who has appeared in the world Then the WorldHonored One asked Mahākāśyapa The bhikṣus here having left all the scum and chaff are pure alike and truly strong Are they capable of hearing this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Mahākāśyapa replied to the Buddha If there are bhikṣus who have breached the precepts or violated the regulations they are rebuked by Mahāmaudgalyāyana Even I do not accommodate such bhikṣus much less would the WorldHonored One The multitude in this assembly is like the sandalwood grove pure and unvaried The Buddha told Mahākāśyapa The multitude in this assembly is all pure and homogeneous However they do not have good understanding of my veiled statements Mahākāśyapa asked the Buddha What is meant by veiled statements The Buddha told Mahākāśyapa Saying that the Tathāgata enters the ultimate nirvāṇa is making a veiled statement In truth the Tathāgata abides eternally never extinct because parinirvāṇa is not a dharma of destruction This sūtra leaves the veiled approach and expounds with entirely explicit tones through hundreds of thousands of causes and conditions Therefore Mahākāśyapa you should survey this huge multitude again Mahākāśyapa again observed those present and their reason for coming In the time of a kṣaṇa sentient beings of weak faith voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and novice Bodhisattvas who considered themselves incapable had the thought of giving up As an analogy a man named Thousand Strong Men stands up in the midst of a multitude of strong men owned by the royal family Beating a drum he chants Who is capable of wrestling with me The incapable ones remain silent thinking I am incapable of wrestling with him I might be injured or even lose my life The one against whom no one in the group dares to fight is the brave indomitable strong man who can erect the great victory banner I am incapable of hearing or accepting this Dharma which states that the Tathāgata has entered parinirvāṇa and that He is eternally abiding never extinct Having heard in the midst of the multitude what they had never heard before they left their seats and departed Because they had cultivated in the long night the view of void with respect to parinirvāṇa Upon hearing of this pure sūtra which is free from obscurity they left their seats and departed Among the voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and novice Bodhisattvas who came from worlds in the ten directions on the scale of a million koṭi parts only one part remained The BodhisattvaMahāsattvas who stayed on believed in the eternal abiding and changelessness of the dharma body They then could settle in accept and uphold all the sūtras about the Tathāgata store They could also explain to and comfort the world enabling others to understand all the veiled statements  They could well discern sūtras of definitive meaning versus sūtras of nondefinitive meaning They all could subdue sentient beings that violated the prohibitions and they all could respect and serve the pure virtuous ones With great pure faith in the Mahāyāna they would not consider the Two Vehicles as extraordinary They would pronounce only mahāvaipulya sūtras not other sūtras They would pronounce only that the Tathāgata is eternally abiding and that there is the Tathāgata store without abandoning emptinessnot only the emptiness of the selfview but also the emptiness of the selfessence of all saskṛta dharmas The Buddha told Mahākāśyapa Ask the huge multitude again whether they want to hear this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum the hardtobelieve Mahāyāna sūtra from the vast One Vehicle Ask all of them this three times Mahākāśyapa said to the Buddha Very good WorldHonored One Forthwith he rose from his seat bared his right shoulder knelt on his right knee and bowed down at the feet of the Buddha He then circled the Buddha three times and questioned the huge multitude Do you all want to hear this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum The Tathāgata now will expound to all of you the One Vehicle the Mahāyāna which surpasses the vehicle of voicehearers and the vehicle of Pratyekabuddhas Three times he asked them and they all replied We would be delighted to hear it Yes Mahākāśyapa we all have come here to hear the Dharma May the Buddha pronounce to us the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Kāśyapa next asked Why do you all believe They then replied As an analogy a man  years of age has a son  years old If the Buddha says so we will believe that it is so Much more will we believe in the true Dharma He is going to pronounce Because the Tathāgata acts in accordance with His words The Tathāgatas pure eye shines perfectly hindrance free Seeing with His Buddhaeye He knows our minds Kāśyapa praised Very good Very good You worthy ones are capable of hearing the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum to uphold or pronounce it The Buddha told Kāśyapa As an analogy a man only  years of age has a yearold son Because the Tathāgata enters parinirvāṇa and still abides eternally Nothing has a self but the Tathāgata still speaks of a self They immediately responded Only the Buddha can know Whatever the WorldHonored One says we will accept and uphold it accordingly Kāśyapa asked the Buddha I pray only that the WorldHonored One will pronounce the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum beat the great Dharma drum and blow the great Dharma conch shell The Buddha said Very good Kāśyapa you now want to hear me pronounce the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha Affirmatively I accept Your teachings Because the Tathāgata regards me highly and treats me with respect What kind of respect He once said to me Come and sit together with me For this reason I should recognize His kindness The Buddha said Very good Kāśyapa for a good reason I treat you with respect For example King Prasenajit takes good care of his four types of armed forces When they fight they beat the huge war drums and blow the huge war conch shells standing their ground against the enemy Because of the kings kind caring they fight sparing no strength to defeat the enemy in order to bring peace to the country Therefore bhikṣus after my parinirvāṇa Mahākāśyapa should protect and uphold this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum For this reason I let him use half of my seat Accordingly he should carry on my Way After my parinirvāṇa he will be capable of widely expounding the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Kāśyapa said to the Buddha I am the eldest son born from the mouth of the WorldHonored One The Buddha told the bhikṣus As an analogy King Prasenajit teaches his sons to engage in the  studies so that they will one day be capable of continuing the royal line Thus bhikṣus after my parinirvāṇa in the same way the bhikṣu Kāśyapa will protect and uphold this sūtra Furthermore Kāśyapa for example King Prasenajit and other kings are enemies and they battle against one another During those times his warriors in the four types of armed forceselephants cavalry chariots and infantryupon hearing the sound of the great drum have no fear and they hold firm their armor and weapons The king out of kindness regularly bestows on them good food During a war they are in addition given jewels and even cities If they have defeated the enemy they are each crowned with a white silk scarf decorated as kings If among my voicehearer bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs as well as upāsakas and upāsikās there are those who learn the Prātimokṣa precepts and become accomplished in observing these rules of conduct the Tathāgata will give them the peace and joy of human or celestial life If there are those who have achieved great merit by subduing the four māras the Tathāgata will crown their heads with the white silk scarf of liberation made of the Four Noble Truths If there are those who with enhanced faith and understanding seek the Buddha store the true self and the eternally abiding dharma body the Tathāgata will pour the water of sarvajña  on their heads and crown them with the white silk scarf of the Mahāyāna Mahākāśyapa in the same way I now crown your head with the white silk scarf of the Mahāyāna You should protect and uphold this sūtra in the places where innumerable future Buddhas will be Kāśyapa know that after my parinirvāṇa you are capable of protecting and upholding this sūtra Kāśyapa said to the Buddha It will be as You instruct He further said to the Buddha From today on and after Your parinirvāṇa I will always protect uphold and widely pronounce this sūtra The Buddha told Kāśyapa Very good Very good I now will pronounce to you the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Then gods and dragons in the sky praised with one voice Very good Very good Kāśyapa today gods rain down celestial flowers and dragonkings rain down sweet nectar and finely powdered incense To comfort and delight all sentient beings you should be established by the WorldHonored One as the eldest son of the Dharma Then the multitude of gods and dragons with one voice spoke in verse As the king in the city of rāvastī Beats the war drum and blows the war conch shell The Dharma King in Jetavana Park Beats the great Dharma drum The Buddha told Kāśyapa You should now use questioning as the drumstick to beat the great Dharma drum The Tathāgata the Dharma King will explain to you The God of Gods will resolve your doubts Then the WorldHonored One told Mahākāśyapa There is a bhikṣu called Faith in the Mahāvaipulya If among my four groups of disciples for those who hear his name the arrows of their greed anger and delusion will all be pulled out Kāśyapa King Prasenajit has  Superior Medicine who is the son of Jīva When King Prasenajit is battling an enemy country he tells Superior Medicine Quickly bring me the medicine which can pull the arrows out for sentient beings  Then Superior Medicine brings the antipoison medicine and the king smears his war drum with the medicine He beats the drum as he smears it with medicine and suffuses it with the smoke of burning medicine If sentient beings that have been shot by poisonous arrows hear the sound of the drum one or two yojanas away their arrows will all be pulled out Thus Kāśyapa if there are those who hear the name of the bhikṣu Faith in the Mahāvaipulya the arrows of their greed anger and delusion will all be pulled out Because that bhikṣu has propagated the true Dharma through this sūtra and acquired this great fruit as his present achievement Mahākāśyapa you should note that even beating a mindless ordinary drum smeared with mindless medicine and suffused with its smoke has such power to benefit sentient beings Much more sentient beings that hear the name of a BodhisattvaMahāsattva or the name of the bhikṣu Faith in the Mahāvaipulya are enabled to remove their three poisons Kāśyapa said to the Buddha If hearing the name of a Bodhisattva can remove the three poisonous arrows for sentient beings it will be more effective if they praise the name and merit of the WorldHonored One by saying Namo ākyamuni If praising the name and merit of ākyamuni can pull the three poisonous arrows out of sentient beings it will be even more effective if they hear this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum and expound its verses and stanzas to comfort others Furthermore if they expound it widely it will be impossible for their three poisonous arrows not to be pulled out The Buddha told Kāśyapa As I just mentioned bhikṣus who observe their precepts purely can fulfill their wishes at will because of their original vows All Buddhas have this Dharma as taught in the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum that dharmas which  are not made  neither arise nor perish Therefore Kāśyapa in a future life you will be like me Because if your four groups of disciples hear your name their three poisonous arrows will all be pulled out Therefore Kāśyapa you now should request the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum and then after my parinirvāṇa protect uphold and pronounce it for a long time in the world Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Very good WorldHonored One please pronounce for my sake the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum The Buddha told Kāśyapa You should spare no question about this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Very good WorldHonored One I will ask about my doubts The WorldHonored One says With existence there are pain and pleasure Without existence there is neither pain nor pleasure What is meant by that The Buddha told Kāśyapa Without existence means the foremost bliss of parinirvāṇa Therefore having left pain and pleasure one acquires the foremost bliss of parinirvāṇa Pain and pleasure mean that there is existence Without existence there is neither pain nor pleasure Therefore those who wish to attain parinirvāṇa should seek to cease existing Then the WorldHonored One to restate this meaning spoke in verse Existence is impermanent Nor is it changeless With existence there are pain and pleasure Without existence there is neither pain nor pleasure Not acting  brings neither pain nor pleasure Acting  brings pain and pleasure Do not delight in saskṛta dharmas Nor be involved with them If one acquires pleasure One will nevertheless fall into pain Before attaining nirvāṇ One abides in neither peace nor bliss Then Kāśyapa replied in verse If sentient beings do not effect their existence Nirvāṇa will be their foremost bliss That bliss is merely a name As there is no one experiencing bliss Then the WorldHonored One again spoke in verse The eternal liberation is not just a name The wondrous form  evidently standing This is not the state of voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas Nor that of Bodhisattvas Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why do you speak of form then say it is eternally abiding The Buddha told Kāśyapa I will give you an analogy A person comes from Mathurā in the south Someone asks him Where do you come from He answers From Mathurā He is next asked Where is Mathurā Then this person points to the south Kāśyapa will the questioner not believe him Thus Kāśyapa because I have seen it you should believe me Then the WorldHonored One again spoke in verse By analogy there is a person Who points his finger to the sky I now do the same Who pronounce liberation by name Analogous to the person Who comes from the distant south I now do the same Who come from nirvāṇa However Kāśyapa those who see the meaning do not need causes or conditions If they do not see the meaning they need causes and conditions Indeed Kāśyapa BuddhaBhagavāns always indicate liberation through innumerable causes and conditions Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is cause The Buddha told Kāśyapa Cause is the reason Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is condition The Buddha told Kāśyapa Condition is a contributing factor Kāśyapa asked the Buddha I pray that you will further clarify with an analogy The Buddha told Kāśyapa For example a child is born from parents The mother is the cause and the father is the condition Thus a dharma born through causes and conditions is called a formation Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is meant by formation The Buddha told Kāśyapa Formation refers to a worldly formation Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is world The Buddha told Kāśyapa It is constructed with an assembly of sentient beings Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is a sentient being The Buddha told Kāśyapa A sentient being is constructed with an assemblage of dharmas Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is dharma The Buddha told Kāśyapa Nondharma is dharma and dharma is nondharma There are two kinds of dharmas What are these two Saskṛta and asaskṛta form and nonform There is no third kind Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What does dharma look like The Buddha told Kāśyapa Dharma is nonform Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What does nondharma look like The Buddha told Kāśyapa Nondharma is also nonform Kāśyapa asked the Buddha If both dharma and nondharma have neither form nor appearance then what is dharma and what is nondharma The Buddha told Kāśyapa Dharma is nirvāṇa and nondharma is sasāra Kāśyapa asked the Buddha If both dharma and nondharma have neither form nor appearance how what and why can the wise know about their appearances The Buddha told Kāśyapa Through their cycle of birth and death sentient beings that develop various kinds of meritorious pure roots of goodness are in the right ways If they carry out these dharmas pure appearances will arise Those who perform these dharmas are dharma sentient beings If they carry out nondharmas impure appearances will arise Those who perform these nondharmas are nondharma sentient beings Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what is a sentient being The Buddha told Kāśyapa A sentient beings is constructed by assembling the four domainsearth water fire and windas well as the five faculties the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising sensory reception perception thinking mind mental faculty and mental consciousness Kāśyapa know that it means all dharmas Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Which of these component dharmas is a sentient being The Buddha told Kāśyapa None of them alone is called a sentient being Kāśyapa taking the king Prasenajits drum as an example what is a drum Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha A socalled drum includes a membrane wood and a drumstick The assemblage of these three dharmas is called a drum The Buddha told Kāśyapa Likewise a construction with an assemblage of dharmas is called a sentient being Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Is the soundproducing drum not the drum The Buddha told Kāśyapa Besides the soundproducing drum any drum makes sound to be carried by the wind Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Is the drum a dharma or a nondharma The Buddha told Kāśyapa The drum is neither a dharma nor a nondharma Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is its name The Buddha told Kāśyapa What is neither a dharma nor a nondharma is called a nonspecific dharma Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Including the nonspecific dharma there should be three kinds of dharmas in the world The Buddha told Kāśyapa An example of a nonspecific appearance would be a person who is neither male nor female Such a person is called a nonman The drum is nonspecific in the same way Kāśyapa asked the Buddha As the WorldHonored One says a child is born from the union of his parents If they do not have the seeds for forming sentient beings they are not the parental causes and conditions The Buddha told Kāśyapa That which does not have the seeds for forming sentient beings is called nirvāṇa So too is the great eternal nonman As an analogy when King Prasenajit battles an enemy country his warriors who eat mens meals are not called men if they are not bold and fierce Therefore those who do not have the seeds of sentient beings are not called parents and neither is the great eternal nonman Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One there are good dharmas bad dharmas and neutral dharmas What are good bad and neutral dharmas The Buddha told Kāśyapa A pleasurable experience is a good dharma A painful experience is a bad dharma An experience that is neither pleasurable nor painful is a neutral dharma Sentient beings are always in contact with these three dharmas Pleasurable experiences relate to gods or humans gratifying the five desires as requital for their merit Painful experiences relate to  hell dwellers animals hungry ghosts or asuras Experience in neither pleasure nor pain is like a minor skin disease Kāśyapa said to the Buddha This is not right The Buddha told Kāśyapa Pleasure as a cause of pain and pain as a cause of pain are also called a neutral experience Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What would be an analogy The Buddha told Kāśyapa For example one becomes ill because of eating food Eating food is pleasure but illness is pain Like a minor skin disease this is called a neutral experience Kāśyapa said to the Buddha If both pleasure and pain can be called a neutral experience then parents giving birth to a child is also a neutral experience The Buddha told Kāśyapa This is not right Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What would be an analogy The Buddha told Kāśyapa Formless gods in Neither with Nor without Perception Heaven and gods with form in No Perception Heaven still abide by the law of karma So doesgoodness Kāśyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One as the Buddha says those with sensory reception and perception are sentient beings Then formless gods in Neither with Nor without Perception Heaven must not be sentient beings The Buddha told Kāśyapa They still have mental processing The dharma of sentient beings that I describe excludes the gods with form in No Perception Heaven Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Are sentient beings form or nonform The Buddha told Kāśyapa Sentient beings are neither form nor nonform Those who accomplish this dharma are called sentient beings Kāśyapa said to the Buddha If there are sentient beings formed by a different dharma formless gods should not be included Then there should not be these two realms of existence called the form realm and the formless realm The Buddha told Kāśyapa Dharmas are nonform and nondharmas are also nonform Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Does it mean that dharmas are attuned to liberation and that nondharmas are as well Are formless gods already liberated The Buddha told Kāśyapa Not true There are only saskṛta and asaskṛta dharmas and liberation is an asaskṛta dharma Formless gods are in the domain of saskṛta dharmas because they still have the disposition to assume form Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One all saskṛta dharmas are form and asaskṛta dharmas are nonform Seeing the form of formless gods is the state of the Buddha not our state The Buddha told Kāśyapa Very good Very good It is my state not yours Indeed BuddhaBhagavāns having achieved liberation are free from form but still have form The Buddha then asked Kāśyapa What are formless gods Do you know what these gods do Kāśyapa can gods with form be considered formless Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha This is beyond our state The Buddha told Kāśyapa Indeed BuddhaBhagavāns who have achieved liberation all assume form You should observe them Kāśyapa said to the Buddha If one achieves liberation in this way one should still experience pain and pleasure The Buddha asked Kāśyapa If sick sentient beings take medicine and are cured of their diseases will they be sick again Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha If they have karma they will still have illnesses The Buddha asked Kāśyapa Will those who have no karma have illnesses Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha No WorldHonored One The Buddha told Kāśyapa Indeed leaving pain and pleasure is liberation Know that pain and pleasure are illness A great man is one who has attained nirvāṇa Kāśyapa asked the Buddha If leaving pain and pleasure is liberation will illness end with the exhaustion of karma The Buddha told Kāśyapa Worldly pleasures are in effect pain One achieves liberation by leaving such pleasures and ending karma Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Is liberation the final ending The Buddha told Kāśyapa One may liken space to the ocean As space is beyond analogy so too is liberation No one can know that formless gods have form Nor can one know whether they are like this or like that whether they stand in this way or frolic in that way As this  is beyond the state of voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas so too is liberation Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One who forms sentient beings The Buddha told Kāśyapa Sentient beings are formed by themselves Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What does that mean The Buddha told Kāśyapa Those who do good are Buddhas Those who do evil are sentient beings Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Who made the very first sentient being The Buddha asked Kāśyapa Who made the formless gods such as those in Neither with Nor without Perception Heaven How do formless gods live and how do they carry themselves Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha Although their karmas cannot be known they are formed by their own karmas Then who makes sentient beings black in sasāra or white in nirvāṇa The Buddha told Kāśyapa It is made by their karmas Karma gives rise to innumerable dharmas goodness also gives rise to innumerable dharmas Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What arises from karma What arises from goodness The Buddha told Kāśyapa Existence arises from karma Liberation arises from goodness Kāśyapa asked the Buddha How does goodness arise as a dharma that has no birth The Buddha told Kāśyapa These two are not different Kāśyapa asked the Buddha As goodness arises how can one realize that it has no birth The Buddha told Kāśyapa By doing good karmas Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Who taught this The Buddha told Kāśyapa It has been taught by Buddhas since time without a beginning Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Who taught and transformed all Buddhas without a beginning in time The Buddha told Kāśyapa Time without a beginning is not what voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas can know by thinking If a person who is as wise and well informed as āriputra appears in the world he can think throughout the long night but still cannot know who is the very first of Buddhas who are without a beginning Nor can he know His nirvāṇa or the interval in between Furthermore Kāśyapa even Mahāmaudgalyāyana using his transcendental powers can never find the very first Buddha World without a beginning Thus none of the voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas or Bodhisattvas on the tenth ground such as Maitreya Bodhisattva can know it As the origin of Buddhas is hard to know so too is the origin of sentient beings Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Therefore WorldHonored One there is neither a doer  nor a recipient  The Buddha told Kāśyapa Causation is the doer and the recipient Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Does the world have an ending or have no ending The Buddha told Kāśyapa The world has not ended There is nothing to end nor is there a time of ending Then the Buddha asked Kāśyapa Suppose you use a hair to draw water from the immense ocean by the drop Can you deplete the ocean water Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha Yes it can be finished The Buddha told Kāśyapa Innumerable asakhyeyas of great kalpas ago a Buddha called Kelava appeared in the world who widely expounded the Dharma At that time in the Licchavi clan there was a youth called Entire World Is Delighted to See He was a WheelTurning King who ruled with the true Dharma This king together with his retinue in the hundreds of thousands went to that Buddha He bowed down at the feet of that Buddha and circled Him three times After presenting his offerings he asked that Buddha How long will it take me to acquire the Bodhisattva Way That Buddha told the great king A WheelTurning King is a Bodhisattva There is no difference Because no one else can be the godking akra a Brahmaking or a WheelTurning King A Bodhisattva is the godking akra a Brahmaking or a WheelTurning King First he is reborn as the godking akra or a Brahmaking many times then he is reborn as a WheelTurning King to rule and deliver people through the true Dharma You have already been the godking akra or a Brahmaking as many times as the sands of asakhyeya Ganges Rivers Now you are a WheelTurning King Then the king asked What does the godking akra or a Brahmaking look like Kevala Buddha told the great king The godking akra or a Brahmaking looks just like you now wearing a celestial crown but their magnificence does not match yours For example the form of a Buddha is so sublime and extraordinary that voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and Bodhisattvas can never compare As a Buddha is sublime you in your way are magnificent Kāśyapa the noble king next asked Kevala Buddha How long will it take me to attain Buddhahood That Buddha replied Great King attaining Buddhahood requires a vastly long time Suppose you Great King abandon your merit become an ordinary person and use a hair to draw water from the immense ocean by the drop When the ocean water is almost completely gone and the remaining water is like  cow tracks in the world will appear a Tathāgata called Lamp Light the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha At that time there will be a king named Earth Sovereign and Lamp Light Tathāgata will bestow upon him a prophecy that he will be a Buddha Great King  you will be that kings firstborn son upon whom Lamp Light Buddha will also bestow a prophecy Great King  your firstborn son is born to you as the water in the immense ocean diminishing since the past is near depletion During this period he has never been a lesser king but has been the godking akra a Brahmaking or a noble WheelTurning King ruling and transforming the world with the true Dharma This firstborn son of yours is boldly valiant and energetically diligent Great King Earth Sovereign bodhi is hard to attain Because of these causes and conditions I give you an analogy Earth Sovereign this firstborn son of yours has  lady attendants Like goddesses they are shapely beautiful adorned with necklaces of jewels He will abandon them all like spit Knowing that desire is impermanent precarious and fickle he will say I will renounce family life Having said this believing that family is not his way of life he will renounce family life to learn the Way Therefore Lamp Light Buddha will bestow a prophecy upon that youth In the future there will be a Buddha called ākyamuni His world will be called Endurance Young man you will then be reborn in the Licchavi clan and become a youth called Entire World Is Delighted to See After the parinirvāṇa of ākyamuni Buddha the true Dharma will be perishing When eighty years still remain you will be  a bhikṣu who upholds this Buddhas name and disseminates this sūtra not caring even about his own life Standing on the eighth Bodhisattva ground he will manifest one body in Tuṣita Heaven another body in the Pure Land of Peace and Bliss and a third body to ask Ajita Buddha questions about this sūtra Then King Earth Sovereign having heard the prophecy of his son will be exultant and exuberant saying Today the Tathāgata has prophesied that my son will stand on the eighth ground That youth having heard the prophecy will make energetic progress Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Therefore WorldHonored One drawing water by the drop with a hair can deplete the water in the immense ocean The Buddha asked Kāśyapa What is meant by that Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha WorldHonored One as an analogy a merchant keeps his gold coins in a container the money in the container decreases day by day Likewise BodhisattvaMahāsattvas know how the water in the immense ocean decreases drop by drop as well as how much still remains Even more the WorldHonored One should know the ending of the infinite mass of sentient beings However sentient beings have no ending All voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas are unable to know this Only BuddhaBhagavāns can know this The Buddha told Kāśyapa Very good Very good As you say the infinite mass of sentient beings has no ending Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Do sentient beings have an ending or not Does parinirvāṇa mean the end or not The Buddha told Kāśyapa Sentient beings have no ending Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Why do sentient beings not have an ending The Buddha told Kāśyapa The ending of sentient beings would mean decrease  Therefore Kāśyapa BuddhaBhagavāns after parinirvāṇa are eternally abiding Because of this meaning BuddhaBhagavāns having entered parinirvāṇa are never extinct Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Why do BuddhaBhagavāns enter parinirvāṇa but are not ultimately extinct The Buddha told Kāśyapa Indeed Indeed When a house is destroyed space is revealed Indeed Indeed The nirvāṇa of Buddhas is liberation Fascicle   Then the WorldHonored One told Mahākāśyapa As an analogy a king is active in giving alms and many hidden treasures are uncovered in his kingdom Because the king widely gives various kinds of relief to unfortunate sentient beings hidden treasure stores spontaneously turn up Thus Kāśyapa Bodhisattvas who use skillful ways to pronounce the profound Dharma treasure widely will acquire this profound sūtra which is in accord with  emptiness no appearance and no act and is a sūtra apart from nondharmas They will acquire sūtras about the Tathāgata store as well Kāśyapa on Uttarakuru the northern continent food grows naturally and it never diminishes as the multitudes continue to partake of it Because the people there in their entire lives never have thoughts of belongings stinginess or greed Likewise Kāśyapa here on Jambudvīpa the southern continent if among the bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās there are those who having acquired this profound sūtra read and recite it copy and uphold it thoroughly penetrate it and widely pronounce it to others never maligning it or feeling bored or doubtful they will always naturally receive by virtue of Buddhas spiritual power offerings to their satisfaction Until their attainment of bodhi the offerings will be without any shortage continuing endlessly except for those constrained by firm karmic requitals During their entire lives as long as bhikṣus observe their precepts without being lax gods and spirits will serve them and make offerings to them If they can refrain from thinking even one maligning thought of this profound sūtra they will gain knowledge of the Tathāgata store and of the eternal abiding of Tathāgatas and they will often see Buddhas be close to them and make offerings to them As the seven treasures always follow the WheelTurning King wherever he goes likewise this sūtra is always where its comforting presenter stays The seven treasures stay only where the WheelTurning King stays not elsewhere while lesser treasures stay elsewhere Likewise where a comforting presenter stays this sūtra will come to him from elsewhere while sūtras in accord with the nondefinitive meaning of emptiness will stay elsewhere When the comforting presenter goes away from his place this sūtra always accompanies him Wherever the WheelTurning King goes sentient beings that follow him each thought Where the king stays I too should be there Likewise wherever the comforting presenter goes this sūtra always follows him When a WheelTurning King appears in the world the seven treasures appear Likewise when a comforting presenter appears in the world this sūtra appears If one of the seven treasures owned by the WheelTurning King is lost and the king seeks it he will definitely arrive in the place where that one treasure is Likewise if the comforting presenter for the sake of hearing this sūtra seeks everywhere he will definitely arrive in the place where this sūtra is Furthermore when a WheelTurning King does not appear in the world the lesser kings acting like WheelTurning Kings appear in the world along with other kings However nowhere does anyone expound this profound sūtra There are those who pronounce kindred sūtras primary or secondary Sentient beings study and follow them In the course of their study when they hear of this ultimate profound sūtra about the Tathāgata store and the eternal abiding of the Tathāgata they elicit doubts in their minds They bear malice toward the comforting presenter and dishonor and scorn him Without any appreciation they insult and criticize making such statements as These words are spoken by māras Judging this sūtra as destructive to the Dharma they all reject it and return to their own places Because they damage the Dharma breach the precepts and hold the wrong views they will never acquire such a sūtra Why not Because this sūtra stays only with its comforting presenter There will be many sentient beings that malign Mahāyāna sūtras they see or hear Do not have fear Why not Because as the true Dharma declines during the times of the five turbidities there will be sentient beings that malign the Mahāyāna As in a village of seven families there must be a dhāyini ghost so too wherever this sūtra is in a sevenmember group there must be a maligner Kāśyapa as those who observe the same precepts are delighted to see one another likewise are those who violate the precepts When in the midst of the multitude they hear this sūtra they look at one another and scornfully say What is the realm of sentient beings What is eternal Viewing one anothers facial expressions they think These are my companions They empathize with one another keep their ways and go their ways As an analogy an elder in the Brahmin caste has a son who has learned evil ways After being reproached and admonished by his parents he neither regrets nor changes his ways He abandons his family to follow his evil friends entertaining themselves with bird fights and animal fights He goes to other lands banding with his kind and doing nondharma things together They are mates Those who do not appreciate this sūtra do the same When they see others recite or pronounce this sūtra they laugh at them Because most sentient beings will be negligent and indolent Lax in observing their precepts they will cause difficulties in preserving the Dharma Following one another those mates viciously criticize Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Alas Truly that will be an evil time The Buddha told Kāśyapa As for the comforting presenters  what should they do Kāśyapa as an analogy the roadside fields near a city are encroached upon by people elephants and horses The landowner sends a man to guard the fields but the guard is not vigilant in protecting them He then increases the number of guards to two three four five ten twelve and even a hundred The more guards sent the more trespassers arrive The last guard thinks Guarding the fields in this way does not really protect them all There should be a skillful way to keep them from raids He then takes the seedlings from the fields and personally hands them out as alms The recipients are grateful and the seedlings in the fields are saved Kāśyapa likewise those who have skillful means will be able to protect this sūtra after my parinirvāṇa Kāśyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I can never accommodate those evil ones I would rather carry Mount Sumeru on my shoulders for  kalpas than tolerate those evil ones violating the precepts destroying the Dharma maligning the Dharma or defiling the Dharma Such evils are not the tones of the Dharma WorldHonored One I would rather be owned by someone as a slave than tolerate those evil ones violating the precepts countering the Dharma abandoning the Dharma or damaging the Dharma Such evils are not the tones of the Dharma WorldHonored One I would rather carry on my head the great earth mountains and oceans for  kalpas than tolerate those evil ones violating the precepts destroying the Dharma elevating themselves or slandering others Such evils are not the tones of the Dharma WorldHonored One I would rather be deaf blind or mute than tolerate those evil ones damaging and violating the pure precepts or renouncing family life for benefits such as others trust and offerings Such evils are not the tones of the Dharma WorldHonored One I would rather quickly abandon my body and enter parinirvāṇa than tolerate those evil ones damaging and violating the pure precepts committing insidious acts fawning with their bodies or telling lies with their mouths Such evils are not the tones of the Dharma The Buddha told Kāśyapa Your parinirvāṇa would be that of a voicehearer not the ultimate parinirvāṇa Kāśyapa asked the Buddha If the parinirvāṇa of a voicehearer or of a Pratyekabuddha is not the ultimate why does the WorldHonored One pronounce the Three Vehicles the VoiceHearer Vehicle the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle and the Buddha Vehicle Why does the WorldHonored One having entered parinirvāṇa enter parinirvāṇa again The Buddha told Kāśyapa A voicehearer enters parinirvāṇa as a voicehearer and this parinirvāṇa is not the ultimate A Pratyekabuddha enters parinirvāṇa as a Pratyekabuddha and this parinirvāṇa is not the ultimate If one acquires the merit of all merit the knowledge of all knowledge and the Mahāyāna parinirvāṇa then this is ultimate or no different from the ultimate Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what does this mean The Buddha told Kāśyapa For example cream is produced from milk fresh butter is produced from cream melted butter is produced from fresh butter and ghee is produced from melted butter Ordinary beings holding the wrong views are like an impure mixture of milk and blood Those who have taken refuge in the Three Jewels are like pure milk Those who act according to their faith and newlyresolved Bodhisattvas who stand on the Training Ground for Excellent Understanding are like cream Voicehearers in the seven ranks who are still learning and Bodhisattvas from the first through the seventh sround are like fresh butter Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas who can manifest their mindcreated bodies and Bodhisattvas on the ninth and tenth grounds are like melted butter Tathāgatas also called Arhats SamyakSabuddhas are like ghee Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why does the Tathāgata say that there are the Three Vehicles The Buddha told Kāśyapa As an analogy a valiant heroic guiding teacher takes his retinue and a huge multitude from their homes to another place As they pass through wilderness and treacherous perilous paths he thinks This group is fatigued and they might want to turn back In order for them to take a rest he conjures up a great city ahead of them He points at it in the distance and says to the huge multitude There is a great city ahead and we should quickly go there Those in the multitude seeing that they are approaching the city say to one another This is where I can rest They all enter into the city to rest and enjoy their stay unwilling to proceed further Then the guiding teacher thinks This huge multitude has gained this small pleasure and is satisfied with it Weak and indolent they have no intention of advancing further Forthwith the guiding teacher dissolves the conjured city When the huge multitude sees the city vanish they ask their guiding teacher What was it An illusion or a dream or something real Hearing this the guiding teacher tells the huge multitude It was for your respite that I conjured up that great city We now should go to the next city We should quickly get there to have peace and joy The huge multitude responded Affirmatively we accept your instruction Why should we enjoy this sordid small place Together we should go to the great city of peace and joy The guiding teacher tells them Very good We should proceed As they advance together he further tells the huge multitude This great city we go toward is appearing You should observe that this great city ahead is prosperous and joyous As they gradually go forward they all see the great city Thereupon the guiding teacher tells the huge multitude Kindly People know that before you is the great city Then all in the huge multitude seeing the great city in the distance peaceful prosperous and joyous find delight in their minds They look at one another with curiosity and ask Is this city real or just another illusion The guiding teacher replies This city is real with all its extraordinary peace prosperity and joy He tells the multitude to enter this great city for this is the foremost ultimate great city There is no other city beyond this one After the huge multitude has entered into the city with wonder and happiness they praise their guiding teacher Very good Very good The one with true great wisdom treats us in skillful ways with great compassion Kāśyapa know that the conjured city is like the pure knowledge of the VoiceHearer Vehicle and the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle the wisdomknowledge of emptiness no appearance and no act The real great city is like the liberation of a Tathāgata Therefore the Tathāgata presents the Three Vehicles and reveals the two nirvāṇas He then pronounces the One Vehicle The Buddha told Kāśyapa If there are those who say that this sūtra is nonexistent they are not my disciples nor am I their teacher Kāśyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One Mahāyāna sūtras mostly state the meaning of emptiness The Buddha told Kāśyapa All sūtras about emptiness have unrevealed aspects Only this sūtra is the unsurpassed pronouncement without any unrevealed aspect For example Kāśyapa King Prasenajit always sponsors a great assembly of almsgiving in the eleventh month of the year He first feeds the hungry ghosts the forlorn ones and the poor mendicants He next gives to śramaṇas and Brahmins fine food in various flavors as they wish In the same way BuddhaBhagavāns expound various kinds of Dharmas in the sūtras according to sentient beings desires and preferences There are sentient beings that breach their precepts are negligent and indolent in training and learning and reject the wondrous texts concerning the eternal abiding of the Tathāgata store They prefer to study and learn various sūtras that teach emptiness whether following the words and phrases or adding or altering some words and phrases Because they say these words The Buddhas sūtras all declare that a sentient being has no self Nevertheless they do not know the true meaning of emptiness and no self Those without wisdom pursue extinction Indeed emptiness and no self are the Buddhas words Because immeasurable afflictions like stored dirt have always been empty in nirvāṇa Indeed nirvāṇa is the allencompassing word It is the word for the great parinirvāṇa attained by Buddhas eternally in peace and bliss Kāśyapa asked the Buddha How does one discard  cessation  perpetuity The Buddha told Kāśyapa Sentient beings each transmigrate through their cycle of birth and death without a commanding self However the great parinirvāṇa attained by Buddhas is eternal peace and bliss This meaning shatters the two wrong views cessation and perpetuity Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Please turn to no self having talked about self for a while The Buddha told Kāśyapa I explain the meaning of no self to destroy the worldly view of self If I did not say so how could I induce people to accept the Dharma of the great teacher When the Buddha pronounces no self sentient beings become curious To hear what they have never heard before they come to the Buddha Then I enable them to enter the Buddha Dharma through hundreds of thousands of causes and conditions Once they have entered the Buddha Dharma with growing faith they diligently train and energetically progress in their learning of the Dharma of Emptiness Then I pronounce to them the eternal peace and bliss and the liberation that still manifests form There are worldly doctrines asserting that existence is liberation To destroy them I pronounce that liberation leads to nonexistence If I did not say so how could I induce people to accept the Dharma of the great teacher Through hundreds of thousands of causes and conditions I explain to them liberation nirvāṇa and no self Then I see sentient beings mistake liberation for ultimate extinction Those without wisdom pursue extinction Then I pronounce through hundreds of thousands of causes and conditions that there still is form after achieving liberation Kāśyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One achieving liberation and command means that sentient beings must be eternal By analogy upon seeing smoke one deduces that there must be fire If there is a  self in one then there can be liberation Saying that there is a  self means that there is form after achieving liberation This is not the worldly selfview nor is it the statement of cessation or perpetuity Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why does the Tathāgata who never enters  parinirvāṇa manifest entering parinirvāṇa Why does He who is never born manifest birth The Buddha told Kāśyapa It is for destroying the idea of perpetuity in sentient beings calculating minds The Tathāgata never enters  parinirvāṇa but manifests entering parinirvāṇa He is never born but manifests birth Because sentient beings would say Even a Buddha has an ending in life and is not in command not to mention any of us who has a self and its belongings As an analogy a king is seized by a neighboring nation In cangue and shackles he thinks Am I now still the king the lord I now am neither the king nor the lord Why does he have such tribulations It is caused by his abandonment of selfrestraint Every sentient being that transmigrates through its cycle of birth and death has no commanding self The lack of command is the meaning of no self that I have explained As another analogy a person is pursued by bandits who will harm him with knives He thinks I now have no strength How can I avoid death With such concerns about the suffering of birth aging illness and death sentient beings wish to become the godking akra or a Brahmaking The Tathāgata is the god of gods If His parinirvāṇa meant extinction then the world should also go extinct If it does not mean extinction then it means eternal peace and bliss To be in eternal peace and bliss there must be a  self just as to have smoke there must be fire If there is no self and one claims to have a self the world should be filled with selves A  self does not invalidate no self If there were no  self a  self could not be established Kāśyapa asked the Buddha What is existence The Buddha told Kāśyapa Existence refers to the twentyfive forms of existence as sentient beings Nonexistence refers to the state of any nothinking thing or any sentient being before its birth or after its death If thinking beings could be destroyed sentient beings would eventually be extinct Because sentient beings  have neither birth nor death they neither increase nor decrease in number Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One if there is a  self in one why is it covered up by ones afflictions which are like dirt The Buddha told Kāśyapa Very good Very good You should ask the Tathāgata this question As an analogy a goldsmith perceives the purity of gold He thinks about why such pure gold is mixed with dirt and seeks the origin of the dirt Will he find its origin Kāśyapa replied No WorldHonored One The Buddha told Kāśyapa If he spends his entire lifetime thinking about the initial cause of the dirt since time without a beginning will he find the original state He will acquire neither gold nor the origin of dirt However if he diligently uses skillful means to remove the dirt mixed with the gold he will acquire the gold The Buddha told Kāśyapa Thus  self is covered up by ones afflictions like dirt If a person who wants to see his  self thinks I should search for this self and the origin of afflictions will that person find the origin Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha No WorldHonored One The Buddha told Kāśyapa If one diligently uses skillful means to remove ones afflictions which are like dirt one will realize ones  self If one having heard this sūtra with profound faith and delight uses skillful means neither leisurely nor rushed to do good karmas with ones body voice and mind through these causes and conditions one will realize ones  self Kāśyapa asked the Buddha If there is true self why it is not seen The Buddha told Kāśyapa I will now give you an analogy For example a beginning student is learning the five letters  which are used to compose stanzas of verses If one wants to know the meanings  before learning  can one know them One should first learn  then one will know  Having learned  one needs to be taught by the teacher who uses examples to indicate the meanings of verses composed of words If one can listen to and accept the teacher one will acquire understanding of the meanings of the verses and believe and appreciate them The  self is now covered up by the store of afflictions If someone says Good man the Tathāgata store is such and such then the hearer immediately wants to see it Is he able to see it Kāśyapa replied No WorldHonored One The Buddha told Kāśyapa For example the student who does not know the meanings of the verses should follow the teacher on faith Kāśyapa know that the Tathāgata is the speaker of truthful words He truthfully describes the existence of sentient beings You will know later like that student who has learned  I now explain to you the realm of sentient beings by four veiled analogies These four are the eye blinded by a disease the moon covered by heavy clouds the water in a well to be dug and the flame of a lamp inside a container Know that these four analogies involve the causes and conditions for realizing ones Buddha nature All sentient beings have Buddha nature with immeasurable excellent appearance majesty and radiance For example the disease of the eye can be cured Before one has encountered a good physician ones eye is sightless Once a good physician appears one will quickly perceive sights Indeed the immeasurable store of afflictions covers and obstructs ones Tathāgata nature Unless one encounters Buddhas  voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas one mistakes no self for self and nonself for belongings of self After encountering Buddhas  voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas one then knows about ones true self As if cured of a disease ones eye opens and sees clearly The eye disease refers to ones afflictions and the eye refers to ones Tathāgata nature When the moon is covered by clouds it is neither bright nor clear Likewise when ones Tathāgata nature is covered up by afflictions it is neither bright nor clear If one discards ones cloudlike afflictions ones Tathāgata nature will be bright and clear like the full moon When one digs a well dry dirt indicates that water is still far away When one gets wet dirt one knows that water is near If one gets the water then it is the ultimate  If one encounters Buddhas  voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas and learns to do good karmas and to remove ones afflictions like dirt one will realize ones Tathāgata nature which is like the water This nature is also like the flame of a lamp inside a container It is useless to sentient beings when its brilliance is hidden If the container is removed then the light of the lamp will shine everywhere Likewise ones afflictions are the container that hides ones Tathāgata store which is useless to sentient beings when its appearance and majesty are neither bright nor clear If one discards the store of afflictions eradicating them all forever then ones Tathāgata nature will fully manifest its excellent appearance and radiance for Buddha work It is like shattering the container so that sentient beings can enjoy the lamplight Thus these four analogies illustrate the causes and conditions As ones  self encompasses the realm of sentient beings the same is true for all sentient beings The realm of sentient beings is boundless radiant and pure Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One if all sentient beings have the Tathāgata store in one nature and ride the One Vehicle why does the Tathāgata say there are the Three Vehicles the VoiceHearer Vehicle the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle and the Buddha Vehicle The Buddha told Kāśyapa I should now use an analogy An elder of great wealth has an only son who under the care of his wet nurse was lost in the midst of a crowd As the elder is near his time he thinks It has been a long time since I lost my only son I do not have other sons nor parents or relatives Once I die all my assets will go to the king As he is feeling concerned the lost son begging on his way arrives at his original home Because the son has been lost since childhood His father recognizes him but does not tell him so Because he is afraid that his son might run away He gives him some things and says to him I have no offspring and you can be my son Do not go elsewhere The son answers I cannot bear staying here Because my staying here would be as painful as if in shackles The elder asks What would you like to do The son answers I would rather remove filth tend livestock or work in the fields The elder thinks I will go along with his wish for now Then he tells him to remove feces A long time has passed and the son has seen the elder gratify the five desires Delight rising in his heart he thinks I hope this great elder will out of pity accept me as his son and give me riches and treasures With this idea in mind he no longer works diligently The elder having seen the change thinks Before long he will definitely be my son Then the elder finds him and asks Do you now have different ideas which cause you not to work hard The son replies My heart wishes to be your son The elder says Very good I am your father and you are my son I am really your father though you did not know it I now give you all that is in my treasure store He then makes an announcement in the midst of a huge multitude This is my longlost son Unwittingly he happened to return home Today he willingly asks to be my son Kāśyapa that elder tactfully entices his humbleminded son first telling him to remove feces next giving him wealth Then he makes an announcement in the midst of a huge multitude saying these words He is originally my son who after having been lost for a long time has come back by luck and has reckoned that he is my son Likewise Kāśyapa to those who do not appreciate the One Vehicle I pronounce the Three Vehicles Because this is the Tathāgatas skillful approach All voicehearers are my sons just like the feces remover who has come to know his identity only today Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Alas Strange How inferior is the VoiceHearer Vehicle are really the sons of the Buddha but they do not recognize their father The Buddha told Kāśyapa You should learn  If you cannot bear to rebuke or reprove them then you should refrain from doing so When they come to maturity later you will know it Furthermore Kāśyapa the VoiceHearer Vehicle and the Mahāyāna often counter each other like the worldly versus that which is free from afflictions and their discharges or folly versus wisdom Because the maligners after death will fall into boundless darkness Out of pity for them you should devise some ways to bring them to maturity through the Dharma of the Mahāyāna While those who are beyond cure will fall into hell the faithful ones will believe Moreover Kāśyapa if there is a man who has just developed fever he should not immediately be given medicine or other treatments Because the time has not come One should bide the right time to treat the patient A physician who knows neither the right treatment nor its timing is a failure Therefore treatment should be given when the disease has come to a head If it is not yet ready one should wait for its time Likewise for sentient beings that malign this sūtra when they come to maturity they will reprove themselves in remorse saying Alas I now finally realize what I have done At that time you should rescue them and draw them in by means of the Four Drawingin Dharmas Moreover Kāśyapa suppose there is a man who crossing an expanse of wilderness hears the call of a flock of birds Dreading that the bird call means there are bandits he takes another path He enters an empty marshland and arrives at where tigers and wolves lurk He is eaten by a tiger Kāśyapa likewise when bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās in future times hear the talk of self as well as the talk of no self they fear the talk of self They then enter the vast void the view of cessation to study and learn no self They do not appreciate the profound sūtras that teach the Tathāgata store and the eternal abiding of Buddhas Furthermore Kāśyapa you ask me what I have said to nanda With existence there are pain and pleasure Without existence there is neither pain nor pleasure Hearken now Kāśyapa the Tathāgata is neither existence nor a sentient being nor does He perish Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Why not WorldHonored One The Buddha told Kāśyapa As an analogy under the snow mountain there is a precious jewel radiating pure light A person who is skilled in identifying precious jewels can recognize one on sight and seize it It is like the process of refining gold When the impurities and rubbish are eliminated pure gold is revealed which has never been tainted by the filth initially with it Because it is like the lamp carried by a person walking Wherever he goes darkness is dispelled by the bright light of the lamp As refined pure gold is never tainted by filth neither is the precious jewel When moonlight and starlight shine on it it rains down pure water When sunlight shines on it it blazes fire Indeed Kāśyapa the Tathāgata also called Arhat SamyakSabuddha who appears in the world has forever left birth aging illness and death and has eradicated all afflictions and habits He always radiates great light like a luminous jewel and He is never tainted like a pure lotus flower never touched by dirt or water Furthermore Kāśyapa the Tathāgata responsively appears in the world manifesting an ordinary body with such and such an appearance at such and such a time He is never tainted by the filth in the birthplace of ordinary beings nor does He experience the pain or pleasure of the world The pleasures of the five desires of gods and humans as requital for ones merit in effect are pains Only liberation is the ultimate eternal bliss Kāśyapa said to the Buddha Very good Very good WorldHonored One I just realize that beginning today I have truly renounced family life accepted the complete monastic precepts become a bhikṣu and attained Arhatship I should recognize the kindness of the Tathāgata and requite His kindness because the Tathāgata once shared His seat with me Moreover today in the midst of His four large groups  He poured the Dharma water of the Mahāyāna on the crown of my head Among the multitude were those assuming the appearance and deportment of bhikṣus those assuming the appearance and deportment of upāsakas and those assuming the appearance and deportment of nonupāsakas Leaning sideways bending forward or back they all were in disguise under the power of the māra Then nanda asked the Buddha WorldHonored One this huge multitude having left the scum are firm and true like the sandalwood grove Why do those others stay in this multitude The Buddha advised nanda Ask Mahākāśyapa nanda said Yes very good I should ask him He then asked Kāśyapa Why do they stay in this multitude Kāśyapa replied Those fools are the retinue of the māra and they have come along with him That is why nanda I said earlier that after the Tathāgatas parinirvāṇa I would be incapable of protecting the true Dharma by skillful means as if competently guarding the fields That is why I said earlier with other details that I would rather carry the great earth Thereupon the Tathāgata told me After my parinirvāṇa you should be capable of protecting and upholding the true Dharma until its end I then said to the Buddha I will be capable of protecting and upholding the true Dharma for forty years And the Buddha rebuked me Why are you too lazy to protect the Dharma until its end The Buddha told Kāśyapa Identify the māra  If you can find him you are capable of protecting the Dharma Kāśyapa then searched with his Godeye but was unable to see the māra He was like that savage in the city kingdom of rāvastī who had lost his son Searching through a huge multitude the savage failed to find his son and he returned tired Likewise Kāśyapa searched with his Godeye for the māra in the multitude but could not find him Forthwith he said to the Buddha I am incapable of finding the evil māra For the same reason the  great voicehearers all said that they were incapable Kāśyapa also ordered the  Bodhisattvas including Worthy Protector Bodhisattva to find the evil māra Except for a Bodhisattva called Entire World Is Delighted to See all were unable to find him Then the WorldHonored One told Kāśyapa You are incapable of protecting or upholding the Dharma for the last eighty years as the Dharma perishes A Bodhisattva from the south will be able to protect and uphold it You will at last find him among the  Bodhisattvas including Worthy Protector Bodhisattva Kāśyapa replied Very good WorldHonored One this Licchavi youth called Entire World Is Delighted to See must be the one The Buddha told Kāśyapa You should go ask him to find the evil māra Then Kāśyapa together with the  great voicehearers and the  Bodhisattvas including Worthy Protector Bodhisattva jointly said to the Licchavi youth called Entire World Is Delighted to See Young man you are designated by the WorldHonored One as the one who is capable of finding the evil māra This youth in the huge multitude said to Kāśyapa I am capable of finding the evil māra However there are  great voicehearers and  Bodhisattvas including Worthy Protector as well as holy Bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī Avalokiteśvara Great Might Arrived Annihilating All Evil LifeJourney and Maitreya Why do they not look for him and why do you make me look for him It would be appropriate first to have them do it and next to have me do it Kāśyapa asked Is subjugating the evil māra not a merit He replied Kāśyapa since you know there is merit you should do it yourself I cannot do it for now Then Kāśyapa reported the story to the Buddha The Buddha asked Kāśyapa Why did this youth say these words Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha This youth said The great virtuous ones have precedence and I am next in line I am a worldly person in a humble caste These great virtuous ones such as the  great voicehearers and the  leading Bodhisattvas including Worthy Protector should go first Like that savage who had been unable to find his son they all admitted that they were incapable and retired to one side Then the WorldHonored One further told Kāśyapa You now have heard this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum For forty years after my parinirvāṇa you should protect and uphold the true Dharma as you do today You should beat the great Dharma drum blow the great Dharma conch shell convene the great Dharma assembly and erect the great Dharma banner Then during the next eighty years as the true Dharma perishes the Licchavi youth called Entire World Delighted Is to See will bind that evil māra and each of his retinue with five strings like tying up a little rabbit He will widely pronounce and recite the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum He will beat the great Dharma drum blow the great Dharma conch shell convene the great Dharma assembly and erect the great Dharma banner Kāśyapa asked the Buddha When will this happen The Buddha told Kāśyapa During the last eighty years of the true Dharma as it perishes Kāśyapa said to the Buddha I would like to see the evil māra The Buddha told the youth Quickly show the evil māra to the huge multitude Then the youth gazing reverently at the Buddha said Look at this evil māra that has come from elsewhere and is seated among the multitude in the way Bodhisattvas assume the forms of bhikṣus The huge multitude all saw him bound by five strings The māra said Young man I will no longer be a hindrance to this sūtra Three times he said it Then the WorldHonored One told the Licchavi youth called Entire World Delighted Is to See as well as the multitude of Bodhisattvas Mahākāśyapa will be able to protect and uphold the true Dharma for forty years after my parinirvāṇa Who among you all can be the final Dharma protector after I am gone Three times the Buddha asked them and no one was capable The Buddha told the multitude Do not think less of yourselves In this multitude I have many disciples who after my parinirvāṇa will be able to protect the true Dharma and pronounce this sūtra The last one among the  Bodhisattvas including Worthy Protector is the Licchavi youth called Entire World Delighted Is to See After my parinirvāṇa he will beat the great Dharma drum blow the great Dharma conch shell convene the great Dharma assembly and erect the great Dharma banner Then the youth released the vile māra Then the huge multitude said to the youth You have received a prophecy from the Buddha The Buddha told Mahākāśyapa Kāśyapa like a man guarding the fields without effective skills you are incapable of protecting or upholding this sūtra This youth has now heard this sūtra He will excel in reading and reciting it will step forward to protect and uphold it and will expound it to others He will always assume the form of an ordinary man though he stands on the seventh Bodhisattva ground When eighty years still remain for the true Dharma  as it perishes he will be reborn in the south in the kingdom of Madras  into the Kāyale family in the village of Mahāpari on the bank of the Skillful Means River He will be the bhikṣu who upholds my name as if skillfully guarding and protecting the seedlings in the fields In the midst of an arrogant negligent indolent multitude he will renounce family life the secular life He will draw in that multitude by means of the Four Drawingin Dharmas After receiving this profound sūtra he will read recite and penetrate it He will purify the Saṅgha enabling its members to abandon the impure ways they have accepted First he will pronounce to them this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum Second he will pronounce to them Mahāyāna sūtras about emptiness Third he will pronounce to them the eternal abiding of a Tathāgata and the realm of sentient beings in accordance with this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum He will beat the great Dharma drum blow the great Dharma conch shell convene the great Dharma assembly and erect the great Dharma banner In my presence he will don the armor of great vows He will pour down the Dharma rain in his entire year lifespan After living  years he will manifest great spiritual powers and demonstrate parinirvāṇa He will say these words ākyamuni Buddha now has come here All should regard Him reverently pay respects and make obeisance You kindly people should observe that true reality is eternal and blissful as I say Thereupon Buddhas from worlds in the ten directions will all appear and say these words Indeed It is just as you say All should believe in what you have said so well Kāśyapa asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what merits should a Bodhisattva achieve in order to see the eternal indestructible dharma body of the Tathāgata and upon dying to demonstrate great spiritual powers The Buddha told Kāśyapa BodhisattvaMahāsattvas who have acquired eight merits can readily see the eternal indestructible dharma body of the Tathāgata What are these eight merits First pronounce this profound sūtra tirelessly Second pronounce the teachings of the Three Vehicles also tirelessly Third never abandon those who should be delivered Fourth bring harmony and unity to disrupted Saṅghas Fifth never be intimate with bhikṣuṇīs women or eunuchs Sixth stay far away from kings or those in power Seventh always delight in dhyāna and samādhi Eighth ponder and observe impurity and no self These are the eight merits to acquire There are four more things What are these four First excel in upholding the Dharma Second always celebrate the good and joyful things one has done Third willingly take refuge  and recognize it as a gain of great benefits Fourth resolutely have no doubts about the eternal abiding of the Tathāgata and day and night think of the merit of the Tathāgata Through these causes and conditions before ones death one will presently see ones eternally abiding dharma body and manifest great spiritual powers Kāśyapa wherever such good men and good women stay in cities or villages I will reveal the dharma body to them and say these words Good men and good women the Tathāgata is eternally abiding From today on you should accept and uphold this sūtra and read and recite it You should explain it to others saying these words Know that the Tathāgata always abides in peace and bliss You should wish to see  with an upright mind neither sycophantic nor deceitful You should know that the WorldHonored One is indeed eternally abiding For the pure ones who wish to see me I will manifest myself to them Mahākāśyapa you should believe and deliberate If one does not train in accordance with the Dharma how can one see me  How can one acquire transcendental powers and demonstrate them As I have said to the voicehearers if a bhikṣu can discard even one  dharma I assure him that he will achieve a  fruit becoming an Anāgāmin In the same way he will acquire merits As I said earlier a bhikṣu who observes his precepts will have gods following and serving him for life Therefore you all should never be greedy for benefits or worship You should cultivate disgust as you meditate on your  body Furthermore Kāśyapa that bhikṣu who will uphold my name will bring purity to the Saṅgha Kāśyapa asked the Buddha Why do you say that The Buddha told Kāśyapa That bhikṣu will skillfully guard and protect the Four Drawingin Dharmas and will draw in the entire multitude of those who are greedy and corrupt and those who violate the precepts Each of the  Bodhisattvas including Worthy Protector initially considered himself incapable of being the final protector of the Dharma after my parinirvāṇa They now are still incapable When that bhikṣu who will uphold my name carries out the Drawingin Dharmas he will include the bhikṣus who are negligent and indolent and have them learn to make offerings He will give sūtras to them diminishing their afflictions and protecting their minds like a ranger who tames cattle when they are ready Those who do not reform after inclusion and training should be abandoned Do not allow poisonous arrows to touch and harm good and pure people He will have these thoughts Do not allow bhikṣus who are pure in their ways to breach their precepts because of the seamy ones Nor should they perform together with the seamy ones the Saṅgha duties such as Dharma assembly recitation of precepts confession and repentance Just as a king subjugates his enemies he will tame the bhikṣus by skillful means Having tamed them for  years he will always pour down the Dharma rain beat the great Dharma drum blow the great Dharma conch shell convene the great Dharma assembly and erect the great Dharma banner He will demonstrate great spiritual powers and at death enter parinirvāṇa After the appearance of  Buddhas and  Pratyekabuddhas and the parinirvāṇa of  Tathāgatas in  kalpas he will then attain Buddhahood He will be called Knowledge Accumulation Radiance the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha That bhikṣu who will uphold my name then ultimately attain SamyakSabodhi in this land is now the Licchavi youth called Entire World Is Delighted to See Kāśyapa know that it is hard to attain the unsurpassed bodhi Kāśyapa is it something an ordinary being can attain Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha No WorldHonored One The Buddha told Kāśyapa As a Buddha does His Buddha work in a oneBuddha world so too do a second Buddha and a third Buddha  Within a mustard seed there is a multitude of worlds Sentient beings are not aware that they move to and fro among worlds and they do not know who is in command of their comings and goings or who places them somewhere They cannot help doing things according to what they know Some know there is  self while others do not In this world on the Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain there is ākyamuni Buddha and in the same place there will be Ajita Buddha Events may manifest in this world whether the burning of a kalpa or the pronouncement of the Dharma by a Buddha What is the foremost extraordinary event It is the youth Entire World Is Delighted to See who has never been reborn into an ordinary family The families into which he has been reborn are Bodhisattvas Kāśyapa know that his supporting family and attendants are all delighted His loving kin all say these words such  person has been born into our family These people are all sent by me Kāśyapa know that if my four groups of disciples who survive me become the retinue of that BodhisattvaMahāsattva they all will hear him pronounce this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum They all will attain the unsurpassed bodhi Kāśyapa in a life far in the past I was a WheelTurning King called Nandisena in the city of Vaiśālī At that time the city of Vaiśālī was like this Sahā World Jambudvīpa one of the four continents  in this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World My lifespan was inconceivable As the WheelTurning King I gave generous alms and cultivated virtues in asakhyeya ways My observance of the precepts was pure and I trained in good actions accumulating immeasurable merit However if good men and good women hearing of the Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum of the One Vehicle go laughing to its presentation or remember it in one thought only the merit they will acquire surpasses mine as described It will be beyond reckoning by measurement or calculation or by analogy For example when the mantraking Blazing Flame recites a mantra he will be well protected by its power for four months Kāśyapa know that the power of even a worldly ordinary mantra can be such If one reads this Sūtra of the Great Dharma Drum it is impossible that its power will fail to protect one for life Therefore if there are sentient beings that can make offerings to this sūtra they have the definite cause for attaining the unsurpassed bodhi Until their attainment of the ultimate bodhi they will not stop pronouncing this sūtra Then the huge multitude chanted with one voice Very good Very good How amazing WorldHonored One this youth will be  the bhikṣu who will uphold the Buddhas name If this bhikṣu enters parinirvāṇa in the south the spirits of Jetavana Park here will have nothing to rely on Instead have him come from the south to the place where the Buddha was then enter parinirvāṇa The Buddha told the huge multitude He will not take the initiative to come here I will go to him manifesting myself I will first have this sūtra sent to him and then go there Because if this sūtra is not in his hands his mind will regress If he knows sentient beings that should be tamed I together with a huge multitude will stand before him After he has seen me he will come here Having been received here he will enter parinirvāṇa He will enter parinirvāṇa in the place where he wishes to deliver sentient beings A son of the godking akra called Abhimaru had come to this assembly by means of his transcendental powers Although he was young he believed and delighted in the Mahāyāna with a truly pure mind Unique and unmatched he upheld among the gods this profound Mahāyāna sūtra Because he explained to them the right cause of liberation he received a prophecy from the Buddha Then the huge multitude with one voice spoke in verse Amazing The youth Entire World Is Delighted to See Will be  a bhikṣu To beat the great Dharma drum And to protect the Buddha Dharma Enabling it to abide for a long time After his parinirvāṇa The world will be empty like space After his parinirvāṇa No one can take his place Such a bhikṣu Rare in the world Can pronounce to the world The ultimate Way Kāśyapa nanda Worthy Protector Bodhisattva and the innumerable multitude having heard the Buddhas words rejoiced and reverently carried out the teachings Sūtra of the Vajra Samādhi  Translated in the Northern Liang Dynasty by An Unknown      Chapter   Preface Thus I have heard At one time the Buddha was staying on the Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain near the city of Rājagṛha He was accompanied by  great bhikṣus who all had completed the Arhat path including āriputra Mahāmaudgalyāyana and Subhūti Also present were  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas including Liberation Bodhisattva Mind King Bodhisattva and Not Abiding Bodhisattva In attendance as well were  elders including Brahma Way Great Brahma Way and Jyotiṣka Also gathered there were  koṭi gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras mahoragas humans and nonhumans At that time the WorldHonored One surrounded by the multitude pronounced to all a Mahāyāna sūtra called The Truth in One Flavor  No Appearance  No Birth the Absolute True Reality  and the Benefits of Ones Inherent Awareness Whoever heard this sūtra and accepted and upheld even one fourline stanza would enter a Buddhas wisdom ground and be able to use skillful means to teach and transform sentient beings and to serve as their great beneficent learned friend After the Buddha pronounced this sūtra He sat crosslegged and entered the Vajra Samādhi His body and mind motionless Then in the midst of this multitude a bhikṣu named Agada  rose from his seat knelt on his right knee and joined his palms to restate the meaning of this sūtra he spoke in verse The WorldHonored One who has great lovingkindness Wisdom and hindrancefree transcendental powers To widely deliver sentient beings Has revealed the meaning of the one truth Using the one flavor Never the path of the Small Vehicle  The meaning He has revealed Is apart from falsity It enters Buddhas wisdom ground To reveal the absolute true reality  Whoever hears it will transcend the world And achieve liberation To deliver sentient beings Innumerable Bodhisattvas for the sake of this multitude Ask profound questions In order to know that dharmas are in quiet nirvāṇa And to enter their absolute place  Using wisdom and skillful means The Tathāgata has given teachings to reveal the truth Teachings that follow the One Vehicle  And have no mixed flavors As a rain brings wetness All grasses thrive according to their different natures As the Dharma in one flavor Pervades everywhere Bodhi sprouts grow Like grasses wetted by a rain Whoever enters the Vajra Samādhi The samādhi that verifies the truth Definitely will eliminate  doubts and regrets In accordance with one dharma  Chapter   Dharmas Have No Appearance Then the WorldHonored One rose from samādhi and said Buddhas wisdom ground reveals the true reality of dharmas Their skillful means and spiritual powers have no appearance because dharmas are by nature absolutely empty  However the definitive meaning of the one realization  is hard to understand and fathom and beyond the knowledge and views of riders of the Two Vehicles Only Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can know it To sentient beings ready to be delivered I expound the Dharma in one flavor Then Liberation Bodhisattva rose from his seat Kneeling on his right knee with joined palms he asked the Buddha WorldHonored One after the Buddha enters parinirvāṇa the true Dharma  will be gone and a likeness of the Dharma will abide in the world In its final kalpa with the five turbidities sentient beings will do evil karmas as they endlessly transmigrate in the Three Realms of Existence I pray that the Buddha out of lovingkindness and compassion will expound the Dharma in one flavor and reveal the absolute true reality of dharmas to enable future sentient beings to achieve equal liberation The Buddha answered Good man you ask why I have appeared in the world It is because I want to transform sentient beings and enable them to acquire the spiritual fruit ie to transcend the world This great matter  is inconceivable because it arises from great compassion If I would not give you teachings out of great compassion stinginess would be a fault of mine All of you should intently hearken as I explain to you Good man when transforming sentient beings if one neither regards oneself as a transformer who transforms them nor regards them as objects to be transformed and if one does not regard their transformation as no transformation then this is a great transformation One should enable every sentient being to discard the wrong view that one has a mind and an embodied self because they have always been empty and quiet If he realizes that his mind is empty it will not produce illusions  His realization that ones mind has no birth lies in its freedom from producing illusions Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One a sentient beings mind by nature has always been empty and quiet An empty and quiet mind has no form Then how should one train in order to realize that it has always been empty I pray that the Buddha out of lovingkindness and compassion will explain to me The Buddha answered Bodhisattva all ones mental appearances have no root no place and no birth and are empty and quiet If ones mind has no birth it must be empty and quiet By clearing ones mind ground one realizes that ones mind has always been empty and had no appearance Good man as ones mind with no appearance has no mind and no self so all dharma appearances  Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One if sentient beings imagine that they have a self and a mind what teachings should be used to enable them to free themselves from their fixations The Buddha answered Good man if someone holds the view that one has a self you should have him observe the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising which are based on cause and effect and arise from ones mental actions Even ones mind does not exist much less ones body If someone holds the view that one has a self you should have him discard the view of its existence If someone holds the view that one has no self you should have him discard the view of its nonexistence If someone thinks that ones mind has a birth you should have him discard his misconception that it will die If someone thinks that ones mind has a death you should have him discard his misconception that it was born Once he discards these views  he will enter the true reality of dharmas Hence all dharmas have neither birth nor death neither death nor birth Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One when a sentient being perceives the birth of a dharma what view should he discard When he perceives the death of a dharma what view should he discard The Buddha answered Bodhisattva when a sentient being perceives the birth of a dharma you should have him discard the view of its nonexistence When he perceives the death of a dharma you should have him discard the view of its existence If he discards these views he will realize that dharmas are by nature absolutely empty and definitely have no birth Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One if a sentient being abides in the view that dharmas have no birth has he realized the truth that dharmas have no birth The Buddha answered Abiding in the view of no birth means birth  Because not abiding in the view of no birth means no birth  Bodhisattva if one has the thought that dharmas have no birth one is using the birth of a thought to end the view of birth Only when one ends  birth and death of dharmas will one realize that dharmas have never had any birth and that ones mind is constantly empty and quiet and abides in nothing When ones mind abides in nothing it has no birth Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One if ones mind abides in nothing how does one train and learn Does one still have something to learn or have nothing to learn The Buddha answered Bodhisattva ones mind which has no birth neither enters something  nor exits anything  because it is ones Tathāgata store  which has always been quiet and motionless It has neither something to learn nor nothing to learn Freedom from learning and not learning means having nothing to learn What one has learned is that ones mind has nothing to learn Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why is ones Tathāgata store by nature quiet and motionless The Buddha answered Although ones Tathāgata store is hidden by the appearances of birth and death of ones thoughts and concerns it is by nature quiet and motionless Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what are the appearances of the birth and death of ones thoughts and concerns The Buddha answered Bodhisattva the principle  is free from duality If one differentiates between approval and disapproval  thousands of thoughts will arise and expire These are the appearances of birth and death Bodhisattva observe that ones true nature  fully accords with the principle while thousands of thoughts and concerns disaccord with the principle If one has no thoughts or concerns then their births and deaths will not appear and ones  consciousnesses will remain quiet and motionless Then ones five dharmas  will become pure This is a Mahāyāna teaching Bodhisattva when one enters the purity of ones five dharmas ones mind will be free from delusion Without delusion one enters a Tathāgatas holy wisdom ground of selfrealization Having entered the wisdom ground one will know well that no dharma has ever been born Knowing that dharmas have never been born one will not have deluded thinking Liberation Bodhisattva said to the Buddha WorldHonored One if one has no deluded thinking then one does not need to stop it The Buddha said Bodhisattva because ones delusion has never been born there is no delusion to end If one knows that ones mind is no mind there is no mind to stop Free from differentiation ones manifesting consciousness  does not arise Then it has no birth to stop However no stopping is not no stopping Because there is nothing to stop Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Although stopping does not have anything to stop to stop something means the birth  Then what is no birth The Buddha answered Bodhisattva one should stop the birth of a thought As one does not abide in ones no stopping or no abiding how can there be the birth  Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha If ones mind  has no birth how does one accept or reject anything In what dharma appearances does one abide The Buddha answered Ones mind which has no birth neither accepts nor rejects anything It abides in no mind and no dharma Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how does one abide in no mind and no dharma The Buddha answered If ones mind does not arise one abides in no mind If a dharma does not arise  one abides in no dharma Good man as dharmas and ones mind do not arise one relies on nothing As one does not abide in actions  ones mind is constantly empty and quiet free from various appearances As an analogy the open sky neither moves nor abides neither arises nor does anything and never differentiates between this and that When one acquires the eye that sees that ones mind is empty and acquires the mind that knows that dharmas are empty one realizes that ones five aggregates and six faculties are empty and quiet Good man to train to realize this emptiness one does not rely on the Three Realms of Existence or various precepts because ones mind has no thoughts and is pure and free from restraint and unrestraint Although it is by nature as adamantine as vajra it never damages  Three Jewels Empty and motionless ones mind encompasses the six pāramitās Liberation Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One the six pāramitās have their appearances How can one use dharmas with appearances to transcend the world The Buddha answered Good man the six pāramitās that I expound have no appearances and are asaskṛta  Because if one discards desires ones mind will always be pure If ones resolve is firm and if ones mind is pure abides in nothing and has no attachment to the Three Realms of Existence this is śīlapāramitā  If one delves into the emptiness of dharmas cuts off ones fetters quiets ones three karmas  and does not abide in ones body or mind this is kṣāntipāramitā  If one stays far way from names and numbers discards the opposite view whether that a dharma is empty or that it is existent and delves into the emptiness of ones five aggregates this is vīryapāramitā  If ones meditation stays away from blankness and does not abide in various emptinesses and if ones mind abides in nothing not even great emptiness this is dhyānapāramitā  If one knows that ones mind has no appearance but is not a blank like the open sky does not give birth to actions or enter nirvāṇa does not rely on the Bodhisattva grounds or abide in ones wisdom neither enters nor exits anything but constantly abides in equality  and definitely accords with the true reality of dharmas this is prajñāpāramitā  Good man these six pāramitās are the benefits of ones inherent awareness and accord with ones true nature They enable one to transcend the world and achieve hindrancefree liberation Good man this liberation has neither appearance nor action Freedom from liberation and no liberation is called liberation Because it has no appearance no action no motion and no disorder It is quiet nirvāṇa without the appearance of nirvāṇa After Liberation Bodhisattva heard these words he found great joy in his heart because he acquired an understanding he never before had To affirm the meaning of the Buddhas words he spoke in verse The WorldHonored One who is fully enlightened Has Expounded the Dharma to this multitude His teachings reveal the One Vehicle Not the paths of the Two Vehicles in one flavor and with no appearance Is like the vast open sky which encompasses all things It enables all those with different natures To realize their own place  If one discards the view that one has a mind and a self One will realize that all things are manifested by one dharma  When one discards the view of opposite appearances  such as existence and nonexistence One realizes quiet nirvāṇa But does not abide in it Because one enters the absolute place  Which is free from appearances and actions Ones empty mind on the nirvāṇa ground Is the nirvāṇa mind which has no birth It is by nature as adamantine as vajra And never damages  Three Jewels It has the six pāramitās To deliver all sentient beings One never rides the Small Vehicle To transcend the Three Realms of Existence Because the seal of the Dharma in one flavor Is formed by the One Vehicle After the multitude heard this meaning all found great joy in their hearts discarded the wrong view that one has a mind and a self entered the vastness of emptiness and no appearance and definitely cut off their fetters and ended their afflictions Chapter   Actions Have No Birth At that time Mind King Bodhisattva heard the Buddhas inconceivable teaching on transcending the Three Realms of Existence He rose from his seat joined his palms and asked in verse According to the Tathāgatas teaching Ones transcendence of the world has no appearance If all sentient beings End their afflictions cut off their fetters And know that ones mind and self are empty They will realize that dharmas have no birth As dharmas have no birth How can one acquire endurance in ones realization that dharmas have no birth Then the Buddha told Mind King Bodhisattva Good man endurance in ones realization that dharmas have no birth means an enduring understanding that dharmas have never had any birth for example all actions have no birth It is false that one can take action that has birth to acquire endurance in ones realization that dharmas have no birth Mind Kind Bodhisattva said WorldHonored One if perceiving as an attainment ones endurance in ones realization that dharmas have no birth is false then perceiving no attainment and no endurance must not be false The Buddha said Not so Why not Because perceiving no attainment and no endurance implies attainment  Any attainment and ones endurance in it mean birth the birth of an attainment Whether one perceives attainment or no attainment ones perception is false Mind Bodhisattva asked WorldHonored One why is ones mind which has no birth and no abiding in anything not false The Buddha answered What is meant by ones mind which has no birth and no abiding in anything Ones mind has no shape or sections just as the nature of fire is hidden in wood but has no place Fire has a name which is a word but its true nature cannot be captured To describe its principle one gives it a false name which also cannot be captured Likewise ones mind does not have a place Good man ones mind is like an āmra  which is not born from itself from something else from both itself and something else or from no cause It has no birth Because conditions arise and expire When a condition arises it is no birth when a condition expires it is no death Whether conditions are hidden or visible they have no appearance because their basic principle is nirvāṇa The presence of ones mind cannot be identified with a place because it abides in its true nature This true nature is neither the same nor different neither perpetual nor ceasing neither entering nor exiting and has neither birth nor death It is free from the four falsities and beyond the way of words Likewise ones mind by nature has no birth How can it be described as born or not born or as having or not having endurance If someone claims that his mind attains abides in or sees something he has not attained anuttarasamyaksabodhi prajñā  he remains in the long night  To understand ones mind and its nature one should know that ones mind is true suchness  and that its nature is true suchness as well They have no birth and no action Mind King Bodhisattva said WorldHonored One if ones mind is true suchness it will not give birth to actions and actions will not be born from ones mind Whatever has no birth takes no action Hence actions have no birth The Buddha asked Good man do you use  no birth to prove that actions have no birth Mind King Bodhisattva answered Not so Why not Because as the appearances of ones actions which have no birth are by nature empty and quiet there is no seeing or hearing no gain or loss no words or speech no knowing or appearing and no accepting or rejecting Then how does one verify anything Any claim of verifying  would be disputable Actions which have no birth are free from dispute and discussion The Buddha asked Have you attained anuttarasamyaksabodhi Mind King Bodhisattva answered WorldHonored One I do not attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Why not Because bodhi by nature has neither gain nor loss neither perception nor knowledge and makes no differentiation Its freedom from differentiation is purity and its nature is unadulterated indescribable by words and free from existence and nonexistence and knowing and not knowing Likewise are Dharma actions Because all Dharma actions have no place because of their true nature Therefore how can one attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi The Buddha said Indeed indeed As all ones mental actions are quiet and have no appearance and no birth so too all ones consciousnesses are quiet and have no appearance and no birth Because as eye and what it touches are empty and quiet eye consciousness is empty and quiet free from motion and no motion and from the three kinds of internal sensations  which are in nirvāṇa So too are ear consciousness nose consciousness tongue consciousness body consciousness mental consciousness  manas consciousness  and ālaya consciousness  All ones consciousnesses are free from the notion that they are in nirvāṇa and the notion that they have no birth If one entertains these two notions then ones actions have birth not no birth and one is not free from the three kinds of sensations the three kinds of actions  and the three kinds of precepts If one has attained nirvāṇa ones mind does not arise but is quiet and free from effort and usage It abides in neither attainment nor no attainment of nirvāṇa As ones mind remains in no abiding and no appearance one is free from the three kinds of sensations the three kinds of actions and the three kinds of precepts Ones mind is quiet and pure has neither birth nor action and abides in nothing whether dhyāna or samādhi Mind King Bodhisattva asked Dhyāna can control ones moving mind and still ones chaotic illusions Why should one not abide in dhyāna The Buddha answered Bodhisattva dhyāna is motion No motion and no dhyāna are dhyāna which has no birth Dhyāna by nature has no birth and is apart from its appearances It by nature does not abide in anything and is apart from the motion of abiding in dhyāna If one knows that dhyāna by nature has neither motion nor quietness one will understand that it has no birth Likewise prajñā which has no birth does not abide in anything and ones mind does not move Because of this wisdomknowledge  one achieves prajñāpāramitā which has no birth Mind King Bodhisattva said WorldHonored One prajñā which has no birth neither abides nor departs anywhere Ones mind abides nowhere and there is nowhere ones mind can abide Having nowhere to abide ones mind has no birth and no abiding Abiding in this way ones mind abides in no birth and no abiding WorldHonored One ones mind which has no birth and no abiding is inconceivable What is inconceivable is describable and indescribable The Buddha said Indeed indeed After Mind King Bodhisattva heard these words he marveled at them as unprecedented teachings and praised the Buddha in verse The WorldHonored One who is adorned with great wisdom Has broadly expounded that dharmas have no birth These teachings never before heard Are now given They are like pure sweet dew Which appears once in a long while They are inconceivable hard to encounter And hard to hear Like an unsurpassed fortune field And a supreme remedy To deliver sentient beings These teachings are now given After the multitude heard these words all acquired endurance in their realization that dharmas have no birth and acquired prajñā which has no birth Chapter   The Benefits of Ones Inherent Awareness At that time Not Abiding Bodhisattva heard the Buddha expound the inconceivable truth in one flavor Having come from a distant place he stayed close to the Tathāgatas seat to listen with intent mindfulness He entered a pure state his body and mind motionless Then the Buddha asked Not Abiding Bodhisattva Whence have you come and where have you come to Not Abiding Bodhisattva answered I came from nowhere and came to nowhere The Buddha praised Inconceivable Because you came from nowhere and came to nowhere you have acquired the benefits of your inherent awareness You are a BodhisattvaMahāsattva Then He emitted vast radiance that illuminated everywhere in the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World and spoke in verse He always uses the benefits of his inherent awareness To benefit sentient beings Neither coming nor going As he carries out his four majestic deportments He constantly abides in the benefits of his inherent awareness To guide sentient beings Then Not Abiding Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what benefits should be used to enable a sentient beings emotiondriven consciousnesses to become amala  The Buddha said BuddhaTathāgatas always use the one realization  to turn a sentient beings consciousnesses into amala Because all sentient beings have their inherent awareness So Buddhas use the one realization to awaken all sentient beings enabling them to realize their inherent awareness and see that their emotiondriven consciousnesses are empty and quiet and have no birth Because a sentient beings true nature has always been motionless Not Abiding Bodhisattva asked Ones eight consciousnesses depend on objects to arise How can they not move The Buddha said All  objects and ones consciousnesses have always been empty Emptiness is free from dependency Then how can ones consciousnesses depend on objects to arise Not Abiding Bodhisattva asked If all objects are empty how does one perceive them The Buddha said Ones perception is false Because all dharmas in existence have no birth no appearance and no names As all dharma appearances are empty and quiet so too are all sentient beings bodies Even ones body does not exist much less its perception Not Abiding Bodhisattva said If ones body  objects and consciousnesses are empty ones inherent awareness must also be empty The Buddha said Ones inherent awareness is indestructible because of its true nature It is neither empty nor not empty and free from emptiness and nonemptiness Not Abiding Bodhisattva said Likewise the appearances of all objects are neither empty nor not empty The Buddha said Indeed Moreover the root of this nature has no place Not Abiding Bodhisattva said Likewise ones inherent awareness has no place The Buddha said Indeed Because ones inherent awareness has no place it is pure In its purity it has no perception Because a  thing has no place it is pure In its purity it has no form Not Abiding Bodhisattva said Likewise ones mind eye and consciousness are inconceivable The Buddha said Likewise ones mind eye and consciousness are inconceivable Because an object has no place and is pure and without a name it does not come inside  Because ones eye has no place and is pure and without perception it does not go outside  Because ones mind has no place and is pure it neither arises from nor stops anywhere Because ones consciousness has no place and is pure and motionless it makes no differentiation The nature  is emptiness which has no perception Good man when one realizes that ones inherent awareness is free from perception ones consciousnesses enter  Because when one arrives on the ground of vajra wisdom one has completed the liberation path and entered the noabiding ground  free from entering and exiting and ones mind abides nowhere on the ground of its true nature This ground is pure like lucid aquamarine  its nature is equality like the nature of the great earth its discerning observations are like the wisdom sunlight its benefits that enable sentient beings to realize their inherent awareness are like a great Dharma rain Acquiring these four kinds of wisdomknowledge is entering the ground of a Buddhas wisdomknowledge where ones consciousnesses do not arise Not Abiding Bodhisattva said The holy power of realizing ones inherent awareness and the ground of the four kinds of vast wisdomknowledge revealed by the Tathāgata are the benefits of every sentient beings inherent awareness Because every sentient being has always had them in his body The Buddha said Indeed Because all sentient beings have always been free from afflictions and had the benefits of their inherent awareness However they have not yet conquered their desires which are like thorns Not Abiding Bodhisattva asked If sentient beings have not yet acquired the benefits of their inherent awareness and are still collecting  how can they conquer what is hard to conquer The Buddha answered Whether one is collecting  or letting ones perception be alone whether one is making differentiations or forming attachments  whether one draws ones mind back to stay in an empty cavern  one will be able to conquer what is hard to conquer and to liberate oneself from the fetters of māras because when one sits loftily  on the open ground ones consciousness enters nirvāṇa Not Abiding Bodhisattva said When ones mind abides in nirvāṇa alone unaccompanied  one should achieve liberation The Buddha said Constantly abiding in nirvāṇa is being fettered by nirvāṇa Because nirvāṇa is a benefit of ones inherent awareness and because the benefits of ones inherent awareness are in nirvāṇa Attaining nirvāṇa is realizing ones inherent awareness As ones inherent awareness is by nature changeless so too nirvāṇa is changeless As ones inherent awareness has neither birth nor death so too nirvāṇa has neither birth nor death Because nirvāṇa and ones inherent awareness are no different attaining nirvāṇa is no attainment As attaining nirvāṇa is no attainment how can one abide in it Good man an enlightened person does not abide in nirvāṇa Why not Because ones inherent awareness has no birth and is apart from ones filthy afflictions Ones inherent awareness has no death and is apart from the motion of entering nirvāṇa Abiding on this wisdom ground ones mind abides in nothing Free from entering and exiting it enters amala consciousness Not Abiding Bodhisattva said Entering amala consciousness means that there is a place to enter Entrance into this place means attainment The Buddha said Not so Why not As an analogy a confused son possesses gold coins but does not know that he has them He roams in the ten directions for fifty years undergoing poverty and hardship He has to beg for things to live a life of privation When the father sees his son in such a plight he says to him You have gold coins Why do you not use them Then you can get whatever you need in full The son is awakened and sees his gold coins With great joy in his heart he declares that he has gotten gold coins His father says Confused child do not rejoice The gold coins have always been yours You did not get them There is no reason to rejoice Good man likewise is ones amala consciousness Because it has never left one it does not enter one When one is confused it is not absent Ones awakening  does not mean that it enters one Not Abiding Bodhisattva asked The father knows that his son is confused Why does he let him wander in the ten directions for fifty years undergoing poverty and hardship then tell him  The Buddha answered Passing fifty years describes how ones mind moves in one thought Roaming in the ten directions in pursuit of the appearances of objects describes how one travels far away  Not Abiding Bodhisattva asked What is meant by ones mind moves in one thought The Buddha answered When ones mind moves in one thought ones five aggregates arise which bring fifty evils Not Abiding Bodhisattva asked Roaming in the ten directions in pursuit of the appearances of objects far away from ones true mind describes how a thought in ones mind brings fifty evils How can a sentient being be enabled not to have any thoughts The Buddha answered Have a sentient being quiet his mind and abide on the vajra ground where no thought arises If his mind remains peaceful and calm not a single thought will arise Not Abiding Bodhisattva said Inconceivable When one has no thought ones mind remains peaceful and calm This is a benefit of ones inherent awareness Its benefits are motionless constantly present and free from existence and nonexistence and awareness and unawareness Free from perception ones inherent awareness is pure changeless taint free and attachment free because its pure nature is inconceivable The Buddha said Indeed After hearing these words Not Abiding Bodhisattva acquired an understanding he never before had and spoke in verse Once realizing ones inherent awareness One uses its benefits to guide sentient beings to realize their inherent awareness Like that son who comes to see his gold coins And whose gain is no gain When the multitude heard these words all achieved prajñāpāramitā a benefit of their inherent awareness Chapter   Entering the True Reality of Dharmas Then the Tathāgata said Bodhisattvas who have entered deep into their inherent awareness and acquired its benefits can deliver sentient beings After the true Dharma age even when the times are not right they should explain to them a sentient beings inherent awareness They should give them pertinent teachings whether the same or different whether in accord with or against their views to guide their emotiondriven consciousness into the sea of sarvajña  and to enable those ready to be delivered not to puff their false wind of ignorance but to drink the wondrous Dharma milk in one flavor Whether one engages in worldly or supraworldly matters one should abide nowhere to observe the five emptinesses and should neither grasp nor discard them when one enters or exits ones observation Because dharmas have empty appearances Their true nature is neither existence nor nonexistence though they may appear to be existent or nonexistent Without a fixed appearance they abide in neither existence nor nonexistence If a Bodhisattva knows that realizing the emptiness of dharmas is a benefit of ones inherent awareness he will attain bodhi Then in the midst of this multitude a Bodhisattva called Great Strength rose from his seat and came forward He asked the Buddha WorldHonored One as the Buddha says one should neither grasp nor discard the five emptinesses when one enters or exits  What are these five emptinesses The Buddha answered Bodhisattva the five emptinesses are the emptiness of  the meanings of ones mind and consciousnesses  Bodhisattva emptinesses such as these do not abide in emptiness and have no appearance of emptiness How can one grasp or discard a dharma which has no appearance When one enters the nograsping ground one enters the three emptinesses Great Strength Bodhisattva asked What are the three emptinesses The Buddha answered The three emptinesses are the emptiness of  whatever is seen as empty Not abiding in their appearances these three emptinesses are true beyond the way of words and inconceivable Great Strength Bodhisattva said Whatever is true implies its existence The Buddha said Existence does not abide in existence nonexistence does not abide in nonexistence An existent dharma does not mean that it abides in its existence a nonexistent dharma does not mean that it abides in its nonexistence One cannot use the existence or nonexistence of a dharma to explain its principle  Bodhisattva it is inconceivable that a dharma with no name and no meaning appears to have a name and a meaning Because a dharma has no name but is given a name and because a name has no meaning but is given a meaning Great Strength Bodhisattva said Then the name and meaning of a dharma are actually an appearance of true suchness just as a Tathāgata is an appearance of true suchness True suchness does not abide in true suchness and has no appearance of true suchness Although the appearance of a dharma is not true suchness it is no different from the appearance of a Tathāgata Likewise a sentient beings mental appearances are a Tathāgatas appearance Then his mind must not have differentiated objects The Buddha said Indeed A sentient beings mind has no differentiated objects Because ones mind has always been pure and should have no taints However it is tainted by ones afflictions and perceives the Three Realms of Existence The Three Realms of Existence perceived by ones mind are called its differentiated objects These objects are false because they are manifested by ones mind If ones mind is not deluded it will not manifest differentiated objects Great Strength Bodhisattva said If ones mind is pure it does not give birth to objects If ones mind is pure one does not perceive the Three Realms of Existence The Buddha said Indeed Bodhisattva ones mind does not give birth to objects and objects do not give birth to ones mind Because when one sees objects one sees only ones mind If ones mind does not give birth to illusions then one does not see them If one sees no sentient being within oneself and sees the emptiness of the three natures  of ones karma then one sees neither oneself nor others Even when one makes the two entrances  ones mind does not arise After one acquires this benefit  the Three Realms of Existence will not arise in ones mind Great Strength Bodhisattva asked What is meant by making the two entrances while ones mind does not arise If ones mind has never had any birth how does it make an entrance The Buddha answered The two entrances are  the entrance through action The entrance through the principle means having a deep belief that sentient beings are no different from their true nature One should focus ones awareness and intently observe that ones Buddha nature is neither existent nor nonexistent does not differentiate between itself and other things and is the same in an ordinary being and a holy being When one firmly abides on the ground of ones vajra mind remains in quietness and makes no differentiation this is called the entrance through the principle The entrance through action means keeping ones mind quiet free from forming attachments producing illusions and seeking something and like the great earth remaining immovable by winds One should discard the view that one has a mind and a self and should rescue and deliver sentient beings Using ones mind which has neither birth nor appearance one neither grasps nor discards anything Realizing that it neither enters nor exits is called entering  though entering is no entering Bodhisattva entering  in this way one does not regard dharma appearances as empty or false Why not Because a dharma that is not nonexistent has merits As  neither ones mind nor its projections it is naturally pure Great Strength Bodhisattva asked What is neither ones mind nor its projections and is naturally pure The Buddha answered  emptiness or true suchness which cannot be identified by ones mind consciousnesses or mental functions It is free from the appearance of emptiness and the appearance of form and is neither coherent  nor incoherent  with ones mind through or not through conditions It is not ones mental projections or indications It has no selfessence makes no differentiation and has no appearance no name and no meaning Because the meaning of a name is words not true suchness There is no dharma whose nature is not true suchness because true suchness pervades all dharmas Because true suchness is the root principle of all dharmas but is neither a root nor a principle is apart from dispute and has no appearance Bodhisattva this pure dharma is beyond birth and death Great Strength Bodhisattva said Inconceivable A dharma appearance is not formed compositely or singly and is not constrained by existence or nonexistence neither gathers nor disperses has neither birth nor death and neither comes nor goes nor abides It is inconceivable The Buddha said Indeed As a dharma appearance is inconceivable so too is ones mind Because ones mind is no different from true suchness and because it has always been true suchness A sentient being and his Buddha nature are neither the same nor different His nature has neither birth nor death because the nature of birth and death is nirvāṇa Dharma nature and appearance are true suchness which never moves Although all dharmas appear to arise through conditions they have no birth because the nature of their arising is true suchness which never moves Moreover the appearances of conditions are by nature empty As each condition also arises through conditions in true reality there is no dependent arising of dharmas However ones deluded mind sees dharmas arise through conditions not knowing that their appearances have no birth because the conditions they depend upon are nonexistent Ones mind accords with the principle of dharmas because its essence is emptiness Like the open sky it abides nowhere However an ordinary beings mind takes dharma appearances as real and differentiates them Because the appearance of true suchness is beyond existence and nonexistence whoever perceives the existence or nonexistence of a dharma sees only his mind and consciousnesses Bodhisattva ones mind has no selfessence and is neither existent nor nonexistent It has neither appearance nor no appearance and is beyond the description of words Because true suchness like the open sky has no appearance and is beyond riders of the Two Vehicles Only those who train through the six stages can know it Great Strength Bodhisattva asked What are the six stages of training I pray that you will reveal them The Buddha answered They are  the ground of virtually perfect enlightenment Those who train in this way can know true suchness Great Strength Bodhisattva asked The benefits of ones inherent awareness neither enter nor exit What dharma can enable ones mind to enter the true reality of dharmas The Buddha answered The true reality of dharmas is boundless When one realizes ones boundless mind one enters the true reality of dharmas Great Strength Bodhisattva asked Ones boundless mind has limitless wisdom It is hindrance free and with hindrancefree wisdom enters the true reality of dharmas However an ordinary being has a weak mind that jitters What dharma should be used to enable him to develop a firm mind in order to enter the true reality of dharmas The Buddha answered Bodhisattva his mind jitters because it is driven by internal faculties and external objects to accumulate his afflictions which form a sea with waves agitated by strong winds Bodhisattva have him retain three things abide in one thing and enter a Tathāgatas dhyāna Through dhyāna his mind will not jitter Great Strength Bodhisattva asked What is meant by retaining three things abiding in one thing and entering a Tathāgatas dhyāna The Buddha answered Retaining three things means retaining the three liberations Abiding in one thing means abiding in the true suchness of ones mind Entering a Tathāgatas dhyāna means using the principle to observe that ones mind is true suchness When one enters ones mind ground in this way one enters the true reality of dharmas Great Strength Bodhisattva asked What are the three liberations How does one use the principle to observe  The Buddha answered The three liberations are  prajñā liberation When one uses the principle to observe one sees that ones mind is as pure as the principle and never differentiates between approval and disapproval  Great Strength Bodhisattva asked What is meant by making use  How does one observe  The Buddha answered Making use  means seeing that ones mind is no different whether one is in meditation or is doing things Ones mind is no different whether one is observing ones internal actions or is taking external actions whether one is entering or exiting meditation Not abiding in any appearance free from any sense of gain or loss ones pure mind flows with the same or different appearances This is called using the principle to observe Bodhisattva whoever observes his mind in this way does not abide in opposite appearances Although he does not renounce family life he does not abide in family life Although he does not don a Dharma robe does not observe the prātimokṣa precepts and does not participate in the poṣadha practice he does selfpurification by letting his mind be and acquires the holy fruit He does not ride either of the Two Vehicles but enters the Bodhisattva Way Then he completes his training on all Bodhisattva grounds and attains Buddha bodhi Great Strength Bodhisattva said Inconceivable Such a person neither renounces nor does not renounce family life Because he enters the house of nirvāṇa dons a Tathāgatas robe and sits on a bodhi seat Even śramaṇas should respect him and make offerings to him The Buddha said Indeed Because entering the house of nirvāṇa means that his mind transcends the Three Realms of Existence donning a Tathāgatas robe means that he realizes the emptiness of dharmas sitting on a bodhi seat means that he ascends to the ground of true enlightenment The mind of such a person is beyond riders of the Two Vehicles not to mention śramaṇas How can they not make offerings to him Great Strength Bodhisattva said His wisdom ground and his  ocean of emptiness cannot be seen by riders of the Two Vehicles The Buddha said Indeed Riders of the Two Vehicles are attached to the flavor  of samādhi and acquire a samādhi body As if in a coma caused by drinking alcohol even after several kalpas they still cannot awaken to their inherent awareness Only after the alcohol has worn off can they begin to train and then to acquire a Buddhas body By contrast as soon as a person sheds the status of an icchantika  he trains through the six stages On his training ground in one thought from his pure mind he absolutely understands the truth acquires the power of vajra wisdom reaches the spiritual level of avinivartanīya  and with endless lovingkindness and compassion begins to deliver sentient beings Great Strength Bodhisattva said Such a person has no need to observe the precepts or show respect for śramaṇas The Buddha said Buddhas pronounce the precepts to transform those whose evil ways and arrogance are like ocean waves However on that persons mind ground the ocean of his eighth consciousness is clear and the flow of his ninth consciousness  is pure immovable by winds that agitate ocean waves The precepts are by nature empty but those who observe them are attached to their appearances However that persons seventh and sixth consciousnesses do not arise and his accumulation of afflictions has ended in his samādhi He is never apart from the three Buddhas under whom he activates the bodhi mind He pierces a dharmas three appearances  to see that they have no appearance and reveres the Three Jewels Displaying his majestic deportments he never fails to show respect for śramaṇas Bodhisattva that kindly one abides in neither action nor no action in the world He enters the three emptinesses and ends his attachment to the Three Realms of Existence Great Strength Bodhisattva said That kindly one activates the bodhi mind under the three Buddhas the Tathāgatastore Buddha  the Buddha fulfilled in all required merits  and the Buddha in physical form  He enters the three clusters of Bodhisattva precepts but does not abide in their appearances He ends his attachment to the Three Realms of Existence but does not abide on the nirvāṇa ground He enters the place where the untamed reside and never abandons those ready to be delivered He is inconceivable Then āriputra rose from his seat came forward and spoke in verse Sailing in the ocean of prajñā A Buddha does not abide in the city of nirvāṇa He is like a wonderful lotus flower Which does not grow on a plateau For countless kalpas Bodhisattvas never discard their afflictions As they deliver the world and attain Buddhahood Like a lotus flower that rises from mud The six stages of training Are a Bodhisattvas training ground The three emptinesses Are the right path to bodhi I now abide in not abiding in  In accordance with the Buddhas teachings And I will come to this world again and again  I will enable sentient beings To do the same no different from me And enable those who are ready now and those will be ready later To attain true enlightenment Then the Buddha told āriputra  inconceivable You will attain bodhi and enable innumerable sentient beings to cross the ocean of suffering from birth and death At that time all riders of the Mahāyāna attained bodhi and riders of the Small Vehicle entered the ocean of the five emptinesses Then āriputra said to the Buddha WorldHonored One trainings on the Bodhisattva Way have neither names nor appearances Then the three clusters of Bodhisattva precepts have no descriptions How can one accept them and explain them to sentient beings I pray that the Buddha out of lovingkindness and compassion will explain to me The Buddha said Good man hearken I will explain to you Good man good and evil dharmas are manifested by ones mind All ones perceptions of objects are differentiations made by ones consciousnesses and words Because good man as ones inherent awareness never arises the three clusters of Bodhisattva precepts have no use abides in true suchness  the doors of the six lifepaths shut and the four conditions accord with true suchness and encompass the three clusters of Bodhisattva precepts āriputra asked What is meant by the four conditions accord with true suchness and encompass the three clusters of Bodhisattva precepts The Buddha answered The four conditions are as follows the power of wisdom arising from ones inherent awareness is the condition that accords with true suchness These are the four conditions Bodhisattva the power of these four conditions does not abide in anythings appearances but has its usefulness However one cannot acquire it if one fails to set ones mind in one place Good man ones inherent awareness is the one thing that encompasses the six stages of training and is Buddha bodhi which is an ocean of wisdom āriputra said  does not abide in anythings appearances but has its usefulness  absolute emptiness and has the four virtues eternity bliss a true self and purity It is free from the two wrong views  that a dharma has a self It is the great nirvāṇa but has no attachment to it According to ones direct observation ones inherent awareness must encompass the Thirtyseven Elements of Bodhi The Buddha said Indeed Their names and numbers are mere words which cannot capture their true meaning This one meaning that cannot be captured has no words and no appearances because it is emptiness which means true suchness The principle of true suchness encompasses all dharmas Good man whoever abides in this principle will cross the ocean of the three kinds of suffering āriputra asked All dharmas are described by words whose appearances are not the true meaning If the true meaning of a dharma is indescribable by words how does the Tathāgata expound the Dharma The Buddha answered I expound the Dharma because you sentient beings use speech in your lives I expound the Dharma to express what is ineffable What I say is the true meaning not mere words What sentient beings say is mere words not the true meaning Speech that does not reveal the true meaning is void and void words have no meaning Speech devoid of meaning is false speech Speech in accord with the meaning of true suchness is apart from opposite appearances such as empty and not empty or real and unreal and does not abide in the middle Not abiding in a dharmas three appearances  it abides nowhere Speech in accord with the meaning of true suchness reveals that true suchness abides in neither existence nor nonexistence Such is a description of true suchness āriputra asked To reach a Tathāgatas state and attain a Tathāgatas reality starting with an icchantikas mind through what steps should all sentient beings develop The Buddha answered For an icchantikas mind to reach a Tathāgatas state and attain a Tathāgatas reality he should develop through five steps The first step is belief Belief means that one should believe that the seed of true suchness in ones body is shrouded by ones false mind By discarding ones false mind ones pure mind reveals its purity and one knows that ones perceptions of objects are differentiations made by ones consciousnesses and words The second step is pondering Pondering means that one should observe that ones perceptions of objects are displays of differentiations made by ones consciousnesses and words and that ones perceptions are not ones root consciousness  which is neither a mental object nor its meaning neither a grasper nor an object grasped The third step is training As the arising of the bodhi mind and ones training are concurrent one should be guided by wisdom to eliminate hindrances and difficulties and free oneself from the fetters of ones mental coverings The fourth step is completion of training Completion of training means that one leaves all training grounds because ones mind is free from accepting and rejecting ones faculties are extremely pure and keen and ones mind in its true nature in great nirvāṇa and in absolute emptiness is motionless The fifth step is relinquishment Relinquishment means that one does not abide in emptiness because ones true wisdom is revealed Ones great compassion is an appearance of true suchness but does not abide in true suchness Although one does not attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi ones mind is boundless has no place and has reached a Tathāgatas state Good man these five steps are the benefits of ones inherent awareness When one transforms sentient beings one should start from their own place  āriputra asked What is meant by starting from their own place The Buddha answered  has no origin and no place Realizing that it is emptiness one enters the true reality of dharmas activates the bodhi mind and completes the holy path Because good man holding empty space in ones fist is neither attainment nor no attainment āriputra said As the WorldHonored One says before one does anything one should use the benefits of ones inherent awareness to see that ones thoughts are in nirvāṇa which is true suchness It encompasses all virtues and all dharmas in a perfect fusion It is inconceivable Know that ones inherent awareness is mahāprajñāpāramitā  which is the great spiritual mantra the great illumination mantra the unsurpassed mantra and the unequaled mantra The Buddha said Indeed indeed True suchness is the emptiness of dharma nature  Ones realization of this emptiness is the wisdom fire that burns away ones afflictions Then one will realize that all dharmas are equal  And one will complete the three grounds of virtually perfect enlightenment and acquire the three bodies of perfect enlightenment  because one has entered ones ninth consciousness  which is bright and pure free from ones mental projections Good man this dharma  is neither a cause nor a condition because its wisdom naturally arises It is neither moving nor motionless because its nature is emptiness It is neither existent nor nonexistent because the appearance of emptiness is empty Good man when you transform sentient beings have them study this meaning Whoever fathoms this meaning sees a Tathāgata āriputra said To study this meaning revealed by the Tathāgata one should not abide in the flows  but should leave the four dhyānas and transcend Akaniṣṭha Heaven the top heaven in the form realm The Buddha said Indeed Because all dharmas including the four dhyānas are described by names and numbers To see a Tathāgata is to realize that ones Tathāgata mind is hindrance free and constantly in nirvāṇa neither entering nor exiting anything because  inside and  outside are equal  Good man the four dhyānas are meditations on the appearance of emptiness but observing true suchness is not like them Because if one uses true suchness to observe true suchness one can find neither an observer nor an object observed for the appearance of true suchness is in nirvāṇa Meditations on the appearance of emptiness imply motion which is not dhyāna Because the nature of dhyāna is no motion It neither taints nor is tainted is neither a mental object nor a mental projection and is apart from making differentiations because it is a benefit of ones inherent awareness Good man doing meditation according to this observation is called dhyāna āriputra asked Inconceivable The Tathāgata always uses the meaning of true suchness to transform sentient beings which contains many words and broad meanings While those with a keen capacity can train accordingly those with a dull capacity find it hard to comprehend What skillful means can be used to enable them to enter this truth The Buddha answered Have those with a dull capacity accept and uphold a fourline stanza and they will enter the truth The entire Buddha Dharma is encompassed in this stanza āriputra asked What is this fourline stanza I pray that you will speak it Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse The statement that dharmas are born through causes and conditions Means that they are in nirvāṇa and have no birth Ending  a dharmas birth and death Means  arises and never ends When the multitude heard this stanza all greatly rejoiced ended  a dharmas birth and death and entered the ocean of wisdom realizing that dharma nature is emptiness Chapter   The Tathāgata Store Then Brahma Way the Elder rose from  the true reality of dharmas and asked the Buddha WorldHonored One a dharmas birth  is no birth a dharmas death  is no death Mastering the meaning of true suchness is attaining Buddha bodhi and bodhi is by nature free from differentiation Ones differentiationfree wisdomknowledge can differentiate countless appearances and end ones making differentiations Dharma appearances and the meaning of true suchness are inconceivable and whatever is inconceivable is free from differentiation WorldHonored One the entire Dharma encompasses countless names and appearances However they have only one true meaning and abide in only one nature What does this mean The Buddha answered Inconceivable Elder I expound the Dharma to the confused and use skillful means to guide them All dharma appearances have only one true meaning Because it is like a city with four gates each providing an entrance to the city Multitudes can enter the city through any gate at will Likewise various Dharma flavors come down to only one flavor Brahma Way said If the Dharma is like this I can abide in one Dharma flavor to taste all flavors The Buddha said Indeed indeed Because the true meaning in one flavor is like a vast ocean into which all streams flow Elder all Dharma flavors are like streams Although all streams have different names their waters are no different Likewise if one abides in one Dharma flavor one tastes all flavors Brahma Way asked If all Dharmas have one flavor why do riders of the Three Vehicles have different wisdoms The Buddha answered Elder as an analogy a creek a stream a river and an ocean have different sizes depths and names Water in a creek is called creek water water in a stream is called stream water water in a river is called river water When these waters are in the ocean they all are called ocean water Likewise all teachings arise from true suchness and are called the path to Buddhahood Elder whoever walks this path should understand three actions Brahma Way asked What are the three actions The Buddha answered The three actions are actions that  accord with true suchness These three actions encompass all Dharma Doors  without exception Whoever takes these actions does not fabricate the appearance of emptiness but enters his Tathāgata store though entering is no entering Brahma Way asked Inconceivable Entering ones Tathāgata store is like a seedling coming to bear fruit without entering any place When one uses the power of the benefits of ones inherent awareness to realize ones inherent awareness how much wisdom does one acquire The Buddha answered One acquires limitless wisdom In brief one acquires four wisdoms Elder past Buddhas have already expounded the use of these wisdoms They are a great bridge and a great ferry Whoever transforms sentient beings should use these wisdoms Elder to put these four great wisdoms to great use one must do three great things One must do these three things to attain bodhi Without doing them ones mind cannot flow into the ocean of those four wisdoms but will allow māras to gain the upper hand Elder until each of you in this multitude attains Buddhahood each of you should train to do these three things without lapsing even temporarily Brahma Way asked What are the three samādhis The Buddha answered The three samādhis are  noaction samādhi These are the three samādhis Brahma Way asked  what are the great domains the three sets of components and the foundation The Buddha answered The great domains  are earth water fire and wind As one does these three things to put the four wisdoms to great use one benefits oneself and others enters the Bodhisattva Way transcends the Three Realms of Existence and does not abide in nirvāṇa However one may perceive the births and deaths of dharma appearances because of ones differentiation If one stays away from making differentiation  dharmas have neither birth nor death Then to restate this meaning the Buddha spoke in verse Dharmas are born from differentiation And die from differentiation When Brahma Way heard this stanza he found great joy in his heart and affirmed its meaning in verse Dharmas have always been in nirvāṇa Which has no birth Dharmas perceived as undergoing birth and death Do not reveal the meaning of no birth Birth and death are not the same as nirvāṇa If one holds the view of a dharmas perpetuity or cessation Nirvāṇa is apart from these two opposites And does not abide in the middle If someone holds that dharmas are existent  their appearances are false Like a wheel of swirling hair Or water in a mirage If someone holds that dharmas are nonexistent Like the open sky He is like a blind man who claims that there is no sun A claim that is like the hair of a turtle I now have heard the Buddhas words And learned that dharmas are apart from opposite views Do not abide in the middle But abide nowhere As the Tathāgatas teachings Abide nowhere So I abide nowhere To make obeisance to the Tathāgata I make obeisance to the appearance of the Tathāgata Whose immovable wisdom equals the sky With no attachment and no place I make obeisance to His  body which abides nowhere Wherever I am I constantly see Tathāgatas I pray that Tathāgatas Will expound to me what is eternal Then the Tathāgata said Good men all of you hearken I will expound to you what is eternal Good men what is eternal cannot be described by words It is not perpetuity  because it is apart from the view of perpetuity or cessation It has no time frames  and is not a truth not a liberation not a mental object not nonexistence and not impermanence One clearly sees that ones root consciousness  is eternal because it is constantly in nirvāṇa which is beyond description Good men ones mind that knows that dharmas are in nirvāṇa is not the mind in nirvāṇa because the mind constantly in nirvāṇa is ones true awareness  The mind in ones name and form  is ones deluded mind which differentiates dharmas by means of words Nothing else is done by ones name and form Knowing that they are like this one should not follow words If ones mind accords with the true reality of dharmas and does not differentiate between self and no self because one knows that self is but a false name one attains nirvāṇa Attaining nirvāṇa is attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi When Brahma Way heard these words he spoke in verse Name appearance and differentiation Are the three dharmas  True wisdomknowledge  and true suchness Together with the preceding three constitute the five dharmas I now know that these dharmas Are connected with  perpetuity and cessation Entering the path of birth and death Is entering  impermanence The emptiness of dharmas expounded by the Tathāgata Is far apart from perpetuity and cessation Causes and conditions have no birth And whatever has no birth has no death Taking causes and condition as truly existent Is like trying to pluck a flower in the sky Or looking for a barren womans child Because neither object can be grasped One should not take a dharmas birth and death as real Because they arise from causes and conditions While true suchness Is always changeless and hindrance free All myriad dharmas Are manifested by ones consciousness Without ones consciousness dharmas are nonexistent Therefore emptiness is their true reality By discarding the view that dharmas have birth and death One can abide in nirvāṇa However driven by great compassion One does not abide in the quietness of nirvāṇa Turning away from perceiving a grasper and an object grasped One enters ones Tathāgata store When the multitude heard this meaning all began to live a righteous life and acquired a Tathāgatas wisdom in the ocean of the Tathāgata store Chapter   Total Retention of Teachings Then in the midst of the multitude Earth Store  Bodhisattva rose from his seat and came before the Buddha Kneeling with joined palms he said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I observe that all in this multitude have unresolved doubts and that the Tathāgata wants to resolve their doubts I would like to ask questions according to their doubts and pray that the Buddha out of lovingkindness and compassion will give me permission The Buddha said BodhisattvaMahāsattva you can rescue and deliver sentient beings in this way because your great compassion is inconceivable You should ask questions widely I will explain to you Earth Store Bodhisattva asked Why are dharmas not born from conditions Then the Tathāgata answered in verse If dharmas were born from conditions Without conditions there would be no dharmas As dharma nature is emptiness How can any condition give birth to a dharma Earth Store Bodhisattva asked If dharmas have no birth why is it said that they are born from ones mind Then the WorldHonored One answered in verse To say that dharmas are born from ones mind Is to imply subject  and object  Like a drunkards eye seeing a flower in the sky Though dharmas  have no birth Earth Store Bodhisattva said If a dharma is like this it is not relative  A dharma that is not relative must be formed by itself The WorldHonored One spoke in verse A dharma is neither existent nor nonexistent Nor does it have a self versus others It has neither a beginning nor an end Neither formation nor destruction Earth Store Bodhisattva said As all dharma appearances are in nirvāṇa so too are nirvāṇa and the appearance of emptiness As nirvāṇa and emptiness cannot be grasped they accord with true suchness The Buddha agreed As nirvāṇa and emptiness cannot be grasped they are true suchness Earth Store Bodhisattva said Inconceivable It cannot be grasped by means of ones mind or actions Likewise ones mind cannot be grasped because it is empty quiet and in nirvāṇa Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Although all dharmas are empty and quiet They are quiet but not empty  While ones mind is not empty It is not existent Earth Store Bodhisattva said Ones mind is not encompassed in the three truths  When one realizes that form is emptiness ones mind is in nirvāṇa As dharmas have always been in nirvāṇa so too ones mind has always been in nirvāṇa Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Dharmas have no selfessence And are born from ones differentiation Earth Store Bodhisattva asked If dharmas have neither birth nor death why are they not the same Then the WorldHonored One answered in verse As dharmas abide nowhere They are nonexistent because their appearances and numbers are empty Earth Store Bodhisattva asked All dharma appearances abide on neither of the two opposite shores  nor in the stream between them Then why are objects of perception born from ones consciousness If they are born from ones consciousness ones consciousness is also born from its perceived objects Why can ones consciousness which has no birth have subject and object Then the WorldHonored One answered in verse Birth and what is born Are ones perception and perceived objects And neither has selfessence Before ones consciousness arises There is no object of perception Before an object is perceived Ones consciousness is nonexistent Ones consciousness and its objects of perception are nonexistent And nonexistence is not a state that can be grasped As ones consciousness which has no birth is nonexistent How can it give birth to objects of perception Earth Store Bodhisattva said Such are dharma appearances inside and  outside are both empty because they have always been in nirvāṇa The true reality of dharmas revealed by the Tathāgata is absolute emptiness which never collects  The Buddha said Indeed The true reality of dharmas has no form abides nowhere is neither a collector nor things collected and is neither the four domains nor ones five aggregates twelve fields or eighteen spheres One acquires its mass of inconceivable virtues when ones seventh and sixth consciousnesses halt and ones eighth and first five consciousnesses become quiet because ones ninth consciousness  is revealed which is neither empty nor not empty As the WorldHonored One says dharmas and their meanings are empty As one enters the liberation door of emptiness without taking action one never stops doing karmas  When ones faculties inside and objects perceived as outside become quiet one is freed from their fetters and achieves the nowish liberation As one makes observations in accordance with the principle ones wisdom and samādhi accord with true suchness As the WorldHonored One often says realizing that dharmas are empty is good medicine  The Buddha said Indeed Because dharma nature is emptiness As emptiness has no birth so too ones mind has no birth As emptiness has no death so too ones mind has no death As emptiness abides nowhere so too ones mind abides nowhere As emptiness is free from causes and conditions so too ones mind is free from causes and conditions As emptiness neither enters nor exits is apart from gain and loss and has no five aggregates twelve fields or eighteen spheres so too ones mind has no attachment to anything Bodhisattva I expound the emptiness  to shatter  existence Earth Store Bodhisattva said WorldHonored One one should know that existence is unreal like water in a mirage and that true reality is existent like the nature of fire hidden in wood Because he makes observations in accord with true suchness As he observes his mind in nirvāṇa he sees that appearance and no appearance are equally empty Because he cultivates  emptiness he never fails to see a Buddha Because he sees a Buddha he rides the Mahāyāna to go against the flow of afflictions in the Three Realms of Existence Walking the path of the three liberations he realizes that dharmas are in unity because they have no selfessence Because they have no selfessence they are empty Because they are empty they have no appearance Because they have no appearance one takes no action  Because one takes no action one has no wish  Because one has no wish one knows ones karmas and purifies ones mind Because ones mind is pure one sees a Buddha Because one sees a Buddha one will be reborn in a Pure Land Bodhisattva one should diligently train through the Three Liberation Doors to master the profound Dharma When ones wisdom and samādhi are perfected one transcends the Three Realms of Existence Earth Store Bodhisattva asked As the Tathāgata says birth and death mean impermanence When one ends  birth and death one realizes the eternality of nirvāṇa which never ends and is apart from motion and no motion in the Three Realms of Existence Therefore one should avoid dharmas subject to causes and conditions like avoiding a fire pit WorldHonored One because of what things should one reprove oneself in order to enter the one door  The Buddha answered Bodhisattva one should reprove ones mind because of three grave things and should follow three great truths to train to attain bodhi Earth Store Bodhisattva asked Because of what three things should one reprove ones mind What three truths should one follow in order to train to attain bodhi The Buddha answered The three grave things are  ones consciousness  These three things have always been empty and are not ones true self Why should one be attached to them One should observe these three things and know that they are ones fetters as one drifts in the ocean of suffering Because of these things one should constantly reprove ones mind The three great truths are as follows equal training in wisdom and samdhi not other trainings brings one bodhi If one follows these three truths to train to attain Buddha bodhi one will never fail to attain true enlightenment One will acquire a Buddhas wisdomknowledge exude great compassion benefit oneself and others and attain Buddha bodhi Earth Store Bodhisattva said WorldHonored One the truth that dharmas are equal means that they are free from causes and conditions Without conditions causes will not arise How can one use motionless dharmas to enter a Tathāgatas state Then to explain this meaning the Tathāgata spoke in verse As dharmas appear Their nature is emptiness free from motion  Then a dharma at any given time Does not arise A dharma has no time frames  And does not arise at such various times It neither moves nor does not move And is in nirvāṇa because its nature is emptiness However because dharma nature is emptiness A dharma appears at any given time Although dharmas depend on conditions to appear They are empty and not born from conditions Causes and conditions have neither birth nor death Because the nature of birth and death is emptiness A condition perceived as a subject or an object Also arises from conditions  a dharma does not arise from conditions Because conditions do not arise Dharmas born from causes and conditions Are causes and conditions  They have the appearances of birth and death But their nature has neither birth nor death In true reality Dharmas neither appear nor disappear Although they appear and disappear At any given time Their extremely pure root  Never depends on the power of conditions When Earth Store Bodhisattva heard the Buddhas words he found great joy in his heart and knew that all in the multitude no longer had any doubts in their minds Then he spoke in verse Knowing that all in this multitude had doubts in their minds I eagerly asked questions With great lovingkindness The Tathāgata explained in detail without reservation The two groups  Have understood His teachings I will use my understanding To transform all sentient beings As the Tathāgata out of great compassion Never abandons his original vows I should regard sentient beings as an only son And deliver them as I abide in my afflictions Then the Tathāgata told the multitude This Bodhisattva is inconceivable He constantly uses great lovingkindness to remove sentient beings suffering Whoever upholds this sūtra and this Bodhisattvas name will never go down any evil lifepaths and his hindrances and difficulties will be eliminated If someone intently thinks of this sūtra without distracting thoughts and trains accordingly this Bodhisattva will manifest a body to expound the Dharma to him He will support and protect him never abandon him even temporarily and enable him to quickly attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi To transform sentient beings you Bodhisattvas should have them study this Mahāyāna sūtra of absolutely definitive meaning Chapter   Entrusting This Sūtra Then nanda rose from his seat came forward and asked the Buddha This sūtra pronounced by the Buddha is a mass of Mahāyāna virtues What is the name of this sūtra How much merit will one acquire by upholding his sūtra I pray that the Buddha out of lovingkindness and compassion will tell me The Buddha answered Good man the name of this sūtra is inconceivable It is protected and remembered by all Buddhas and can enable one to enter the ocean of a Tathāgatas wisdomknowledge Whoever upholds this sūtra will not seek other sūtras This sūtra retains all teachings of Buddhas and encompasses the essentials of all sūtras It is the hub of the teachings in all sūtras This sūtra is called Adopting the Mahāyāna also called Vajra Samādhi also called Tenet of Immeasurable Meaning Accepting and upholding this sūtra is accepting and upholding   Buddhas The merit acquired in this way is inconceivable and boundless like the open sky I entrust to you this sūtra nanda asked What mental actions should be taken by whoever can accept and uphold this sūtra The Buddha answered Good man whoever accepts and upholds this sūtra should take five mental actions have no attachment to the Three Realms of existence while living a family life Such benefits are enjoyed by a person who accepts and upholds this sūtra nanda asked If that person delivers sentient beings can he accept their offerings The Buddha answered That person can serve as a great fortune field to sentient beings He uses great wisdom to give provisional and definitive teachings because he relies upon four dharmas He can accept even such offerings as head eyes brain and bone marrow not to mention food and clothing Good man that person is your beneficent learned friend and your bridge  How can ordinary beings not make offerings to him nanda asked If one accepts and upholds this sūtra under that person and makes offerings to him how much merit will one acquire The Buddha answered Suppose that one takes gold and silver that fill a city and gives them away as alms This act is not as meritorious as accepting and upholding under that person one fourline stanza from this sūtra The merit acquired by making offerings to that person is inconceivable Good man one who has sentient beings uphold this sūtra should constantly be in samādhi and never forget ones true mind  If one forgets it one should immediately repent because repentance brings coolness nanda said Repenting of past sins does not mean entering the past The Buddha said Indeed As an analogy if a bright lamp is placed in a dark room darkness is expelled Good man do not say that repenting of past sins is entering the past nanda asked What is meant by repentance The Buddha answered Repentance means following the teachings in this sūtra to observe the true reality of dharmas As soon as one makes this observation ones sins are expunged and one leaves all evil lifepaths and will be reborn in a Pure Land and quickly attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi After the Buddha pronounced this sūtra nanda the Bodhisattvas and the Buddhas four groups of disciples acquired a resolute mind and greatly rejoiced Mahāyāna Vaipulya Sūtra of Total Retention   Translated in the Sui Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master VinītaruciThus I have heard At one time the Buddha was staying on the Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain near the city of Rājagṛha together with  great bhikṣus  koṭi BodhisattvaMahāsattvas and  koṭi  upāsakas from the kingdom of Magadha The summer meditation retreat having ended nearing the time of His parinirvāṇa the WorldHonored One entered the InAccordwiththeDharma Samādhi During His samādhi this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World was everywhere adorned with silky banners and canopies Jeweled incense vases were well placed and fragrances were widely spread Scattered all about were thousandpetaled lotus flowers At that time in this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World multitudes in the hundreds of thousands of koṭis Brahmakings and their retinues in the hundreds of thousands of koṭis came to the Buddha Upon arrival they bowed their heads down at the feet of the Buddha With folded palms facing the Buddha they stepped back to stand on one side Also to the Buddha came hundreds of thousands of koṭis of godsons from pure abode heavens godkings śvara and Maheśvara dragonkings yakṣakings asurakings garuḍakings kinarakings mahoragakings together with their respective retinues in the hundreds of thousands of koṭis Upon arrival they bowed their heads down at the feet of the Buddha Also to the Buddha from worlds in the ten directions came BodhisattvaMahāsattvas of great awesome virtue who were as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Upon arrival they bowed their heads down at the feet of the Buddha With folded palms facing the Buddha they stepped back to stand on one side Even the gods from the top heaven in this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World came to join the huge multitude which filled the space with no room to spare Also to the assembly came all those others with great awesome power such as gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras mahoragas and others The WorldHonored One prompted by the right thought rose from His samādhi He looked all over the huge multitude as He stretched His body and opened His mouth Like a lionking three times He stretched Then the WorldHonored One extended from His mouth His wideranging farreaching tongue completely covering this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World After the Tathāgata had finished His display of spiritual power He again looked at the massive crowd Then all in the huge multitude rose from their seats They made obeisance with joined palms and stood in silence Then the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva Ajita before long the Tathāgata will enter parinirvāṇa If you have doubts regarding the Dharma and would like to ask me now is the right time while I am still here Do not allow yourself to have any distressing regrets after the Buddha is gone Then Maitreya BodhisattvaMahāsattva said to the Buddha Yes WorldHonored One You best know the right time The BuddhaTathāgata has realized the ultimate of all dharmas I pray only that You will pronounce it enabling Your Dharmaeye to abide in the world for a long time In the assembly the godking Maheśvaras sons and  koṭi gods from pure abode heavens together with their retinues surrounded the Buddha and bowed their heads down at His feet Joining their palms reverently they said to the Buddha WorldHonored One the Mahāyāna Vaipulya Total Retention Dharma Door has been taught in the past by innumerable BuddhaTathāgatas also called Arhats SamyakSabuddhas We pray only that the Tathāgata now will also expound it to bring benefits comfort and delight to innumerable gods and humans and to enable the Buddha Dharma to abide in the world for a long time The Buddha approved in silence Knowing that the Buddha had granted their request the godking Maheśvaras son was joyful and exuberant Joining his palms he made obeisance and stepped back to stand on one side Then the Buddha told Maitreya BodhisattvaMahāsattva Ajita this Mahāyāna Vaipulya Total Retention Dharma Door is not taught by me only Innumerable Buddhas of the past present and future in worlds in the ten directions have frequently taught it If there are sentient beings that malign the Dharma and the Saṅgha and say that the Buddhas words are not spoken by the Buddha these maligners will go down the evil lifepaths to undergo suffering in hell Then the Buddha told Maitreya BodhisattvaMahāsattva If among good men and good women there are those who have activated the bodhi mind and will accept and uphold read and recite and explain to others this Mahāyāna Vaipulya Sūtra of Total Retention know that these people will not go down the evil lifepaths Then the WorldHonored One asked Maitreya BodhisattvaMahāsattva Ajita from the night I attained Buddhahood to the time when I will enter the nirvāṇa without remnant are there evil karmas arising from oversights in what has been done spoken thought of and pondered by the Buddhas body voice and mind Maitreya BodhisattvaMahāsattva replied No WorldHonored One The Buddha said Maitreya as you say from the time of my attainment of bodhi to the time of my parinirvāṇa what I have said in this interval is all true never false If there are fools who failing to understand that the Tathāgatas words are skillful tools judge that this Dharma is this way this Dharma is not this way they are maligning the true Dharma as well as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas I say that they are headed for hell Ajita after my parinirvāṇa if in the world of the five turbidities among bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās there are those who are not Bodhisattvas but claim to be Bodhisattvas they are actually nonBuddhists Because they in their past lives had made offerings to Buddhas and made their resolve they have been able to enter the Buddhas Order renouncing family life Wherever they have gone they have sought fame benefits and worship from their kinfolk and friends They have unscrupulously engaged in impure activities and abandoned their faith They have not restrained themselves from evil acts They have not subjugated their greed for benefits and worship For the sake of their kinfolk they have falsely claimed their knowledge and understanding Standing in flattery and deception their mouths have spoken contradictory words and their bodies have performed contradictory acts Ajita in my Bodhi Way all sentient beings are equal and embraced in my great compassion While using skillful means I never lose right mindfulness Abiding peacefully in His unequaled power the Tathāgata expounds the Dharma hindrance free Suppose there are sentient beings that say these words Bodhisattvas should not hear study or accept the sūtras the Buddha has pronounced for voicehearers These are not the true Dharma nor the right path Nor should Bodhisattvas study the Pratyekabuddha Dharma Suppose they also say Voicehearers should not hear or accept the Dharmas that Bodhisattvas practice Nor should voicehearers hear or accept the Pratyekabuddha Dharma Suppose they also say Whatever Bodhisattvas have to say voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas should not hear or accept Their contradictory words and actions are not in accord with the sūtras They are unable to believe and accept either the true Dharma of Liberation or words that are in accord with true reality The followers of their ways cannot even be reborn in heaven much less achieve liberation Ajita according to their faith I have expounded the Dharma to and tamed as many  as the sands of the Ganges Ajita even now I want to go to worlds in the ten directions to expound the Dharma suitably to sentient beings for their benefit Nor is it for the evil deceitful ones who having heard little of the Dharma double talk about my Dharma Suppose the double talker says these words This Bodhisattvas should learn This Bodhisattvas should not learn Having maligned the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha the double talker after death will fall into hell and for hundreds and thousands of kalpas will not be able to leave there Suppose he will later be reborn in a poor family and even receive the prophecy of attaining Buddhahood Then he will eventually attain samyaksabodhi in an evil world of the five turbidities just like me who has realized Buddha bodhi in this world of the five turbidities Therefore you should hearken believe and know that such will be the consequences of following the way of evil friends Ajita as I remember countless kalpas ago in the world appeared a Buddha called Untainted Flame WorthyofName King the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha Knowledge and Action Perfected Sugata Understanding the World Unsurpassed One Tamer of Men Teacher to Gods and Humans Buddha the WorldHonored One During His life of  nayuta years that Buddha expounded the Dharma to the multitudes In the Dharma of Untainted Flame WorthyofName King Tathāgata there was a bhikṣu called Pure Life As a great Dharma master he retained fourteen koṭi sūtras and six million Mahāyāna sūtras His words were pure and beautiful his eloquence unhindered He helped innumerable countless sentient beings by giving them teachings benefits and delight Untainted Flame WorthyofName King Tathāgata upon entering parinirvāṇa told the bhikṣu Pure Life You should protect and uphold my true Dharmaeye in future times Pure Life having accepted that Buddhas instruction for thousands and tens of thousands of years after that Buddhas parinirvāṇa guarded and circulated the secret store of Buddhas He accepted and upheld and read and recited  the Vaipulya Total Retention Dharma Door and had profound understanding of their tenets He also widely expounded them to all the sentient beings in  cities in that world according to their wishes and preferences At that time there was a great city called Bhadra Pure Life went to that city to expound the Dharma to  koṭi households according to their preferences Consequently  koṭi people in that city acquired pure faith one koṭi people set themselves on the Bodhi Way and  koṭi people accepted the VoiceHearer Vehicle and were thus trained Then the Dharma master Pure Life followed by  bhikṣus went to train in the Bodhi Way At that time in the city of Bhadra there was a bhikṣu named Dharma He accepted and upheld  Mahāyāna vaipulya sūtras and attained the four dhyānas He was transforming the sentient beings in that city only by means of the Vaipulya Dharma of Emptiness Unable to speak easily and skillfully he said these words All dharmas are empty and silent What I say is truly the words of the Buddha What the bhikṣu Pure Life says is filthy and impure This bhikṣu is leading an impure life but calls himself Pure Life Because this bhikṣu keeps the flowers he has received for his own enjoyment not for making offerings He does the same with the solid perfumes and powdered incense This bhikṣu Pure Life foolish and senseless does not know that I have long trained in the Brahma way of life He is young and has not renounced family life for too long He is arrogant faithless and utterly undisciplined Those who do not have this knowledge say that Pure Life is a bhikṣu who observes the precepts Then Dharma who with a vicious mind had slandered the bhikṣu upholding the Dharma after death fell into hell Upon completion of the  kalpas he was reborn in animal form After  kalpas he encountered Fragrant Jewel Light Buddha under whom Dharma activated his bodhi mind He continued to be reborn in animal form for  lives After these  lives he was reborn in human form For  lives he did not have a tongue and lived in poverty and sordidness  the bhikṣu Pure Life having gained pure faith in the Dharma continued to pronounce the Dharma Subsequently he encountered  nayuta Buddhas As a Dharma master with the five transcendental powers he always asked each Buddha to turn the wheel of the true Dharma  Ajita tell me this Was the bhikṣu Pure Life in the past a different person Do not view him as someone different He is none other than Amitābha Buddha today Ajita tell me this Was the bhikṣu Dharma in the past a different person Do not view him as someone different He is none other than I today Because I had slandered Him out of foolishness and senselessness I underwent such suffering Through these karmic causes and conditions I have attained samyaksabodhi in this world of the five turbidities Therefore Ajita if there are Bodhisattvas who double talk about the Dharma they will for these causes and conditions attain Buddha bodhi in a future world of the five turbidities When they expound the Dharma there will be māras in their Buddha Lands constantly causing hindrances and making trouble When the huge assembly heard the Buddhas words they all wept in grief tears flowing and noses running They all said these words May we unlike that bhikṣu refrain from double talk about the Dharma Then one hundred Bodhisattvas in the assembly rose from their seats knelt on their right knees and cried loudly shedding tears of sorrow The WorldHonored One knowing the reason still asked these Bodhisattvas Good men why do you all wail miserably like this These Bodhisattvas replied with one voice to the Buddha WorldHonored One we see in ourselves such evil karma hindrances as well In confirmation the WorldHonored One spoke these words Indeed In the past you renounced family life in the Dharma of Dīpaṅkara Buddha After the parinirvāṇa of Dīpaṅkara Buddha there was a bhikṣu called Knowledge Accumulation and you all slandered this bhikṣu For this reason you have since been unable to see Buddhas unable to activate the bodhi mind and unable to acquire dhāraṇīs and samādhis From now on you all will stay on the Bodhi Way Good men under the last Buddha in this Worthy Kalpa you will achieve the Endurance in the Realization of the No Birth of Dharmas Afterward you will walk the Bodhisattva Way for over three asakhyeya kalpas and then you will attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Therefore good men when Bodhisattvas see other Bodhisattvas they should not think of self versus others Instead they should think that others are like sacred pagodas like Buddhas Hence when Bodhisattvas see other Bodhisattvas they should not have discriminatory thoughts considering others as nonBuddhas Any discriminatory thoughts are selfharming You should accept and uphold this  Without alienating thoughts you should join others in harmony If I held the view that newlyresolved Bodhisattvas would be less than a Buddha I would be deceiving innumerable asakhyeyas of Buddhas of the present  in the ten directions Therefore good men if Bodhisattvas can acquire dhāraṇīs and samādhis in the future in a world of the five turbidities it will all be by virtue of the awesome power of Buddhas Hence good men slandering a Dharma master is no different from slandering a Buddha Good men after the Buddhas parinirvāṇa if there is a Dharma master who can well expound the Dharma according to the preferences  and is able to have Bodhisattvas study the Mahāyāna doctrine and to have the multitude feel as little joy as a hair and even shed one tear know that it will all be by virtue of the spiritual power of the Buddha Suppose a fool who is not a Bodhisattva but claims to be a Bodhisattva maligns a true Bodhisattva and his actions even speaking these words What does he know What does he understand Maitreya I remember in the past in Jambudvīpa when I was learning to be a Bodhisattva I loved and treasured the Dharma For the sake of a verse or a stanza I abandoned my head eyes wife and throne which I cherished To seek the Dharma As for the fools who seek only fame benefits and worship confident in their own limited capacity they do not go to one who imparts the Dharma of the Tathāgata to hear and receive the true Dharma Maitreya if the slanderers and the slandered unite in harmony they will be able to uphold and circulate my Dharma If the two groups are in conflict and in dispute the true Dharma will not prevail Ajita you can observe those who malign the Dharma They have done such enormously sinful karma that they will go down the three evil lifepaths from which it is hard to escape Furthermore Ajita in the time since I attained Buddhahood with true wisdom I have widely expounded the true Dharma to sentient beings Suppose there are fools who neither believe nor accept the Buddhas words just like that bhikṣu Dharma Although he had read and recited  Mahāyāna sūtras explained them to others and attained the four dhyānas because of his slander of another he underwent dreadful suffering for  kalpas It is even more severe for those who foolish and sordid without any real knowledge  proclaim these words I am a Dharma master who clearly understands the Mahāyāna and can widely spread it They slander the true Dharma master saying that he has no understanding For selfelevation they also malign the Buddha Dharma If those fools malign even a fourverse stanza in the Buddhas Mahāyāna teachings know that for this karma they will definitely fall into hell Because they malign the Buddha Dharma and Dharma masters For these causes and conditions they will always walk the evil lifepaths never to see Buddhas Because they have maligned the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha they can also create obstacles for those who have recently activated the bodhi mind causing them to abandon the right path Know that those who adorn themselves with enormously sinful karmas will fall into hell to receive horrendous requitals for immeasurable kalpas Fixing an evil eye on one who has activated the bodhi mind will result in the requital of no eyes Slandering one who has activated the bodhi mind will result in the requital of no tongue Ajita I have never seen an evil dharma graver than the sin of sabotaging others activation of the bodhi mind Even for this sin one will go down the evil lifepaths Even graver is  slandering Bodhisattvas Bodhisattvas should explain the Dharma truthfully to sentient beings without holding the wrong views such as perpetuity or cessation the definite existence or definite nonexistence of sentient beings or the existence or nonexistence of dharmas Ajita those who are learning to be Bodhisattvas should abide in this way Abiding in this way is a pure and good karma of Bodhisattvas They do not cling to what they train in or learn If sentient beings cling to anything know that they will be reborn in the world of the five turbidities Furthermore there are Bodhisattvas who excel in pronouncing the Dharma in various ways to sentient beings according to their natures and desires Ajita Bodhisattvas who practice all six pāramitās in this way will be able to attain the unsurpassed bodhi The fools who believe in what they fixate on may say these words Bodhisattvas should practice prajñāpāramitā only Do not learn other pāramitās because prajñāpāramitā is the supreme one This statement is incorrect Because Ajita in the past when King Kāśaka was training to be a Bodhisattva he abandoned his head eyes bone marrow and brain which he cherished Did this king not have any wisdom Maitreya replied to the Buddha WorldHonored One truly as Your Holiness has said he had wisdom The Buddha told Ajita I practiced all six pāramitās fully for an immeasurable amount of time If I had not practiced all six pāramitās fully I would not have attained the unsurpassed bodhi Indeed WorldHonored One The Buddha told Ajita As you say in the past I practiced dānapāramitā śīlapāramitā kṣāntipāramitā vīryapāramitā dhyānapāramitā and prajñāpāramitā each for sixty kalpas There is nothing right about their claim Because they embrace the view of void they expound the Dharma with such impurity The body voice and mind of those speakers contradict the Dharma As they explain to others their understanding of emptiness their do not act according to their words Without  actions they are far from the  meaning of emptiness Even more than their kinfolk they harbor jealousy and are attached to benefits and worship Ajita when I was a WheelTurning King I abandoned jewels my head my eyes my hands and my feet but still could not attain the unsurpassed bodhi By contrast fools for the sake of food and drink visit others homes to make their statement They only praise the Dharma of Emptiness and claim that what they say is the Bodhi Way and the Bodhisattva action and that only this Dharma is the true Dharma while all other Dharmas are not They also say these words My understanding has been realized by and known to innumerable Dharma masters For the sake of fame they praise themselves saying that they clearly understand hatred and jealousy Ajita I see those who set their minds on seeking benefits and worship for a livelihood Even if they take good actions for one hundred kalpas they will not develop even a little Endurance in Dharmas much less attain the unsurpassed bodhi Ajita I do not pronounce bodhi to the deceitful ones who have contradictory mind and mouth Nor to those who are jealous nor to those who are arrogant and disrespectful nor to those who are faithless nor to those who are untamed nor to those who engage in sexual misconduct nor to those who believe that they are right and others wrong Ajita those fools out of arrogance claim that they have surpassed the Buddha They malign Mahāyāna sūtras pronounced by the Buddha alleging that these are actually pronounced by voicehearers riding the Small Vehicle Then the Buddha told the venerable Subhūti You should not pronounce prajñāpāramitā to those who adhere to the view of dualism Subhūti said to the Buddha No indeed WorldHonored One as the Buddha says The Buddha said Indeed Subhūti giving alms without being attached  is called bodhi Subhūti said Indeed WorldHonored One The Buddha said Subhūti giving without praising oneself and criticizing others is called bodhi Subhūti said Indeed WorldHonored One The Buddha said Subhūti when you see fools who for the love of their kinfolk greedy for a living  adhere to the view of self and its belongings and enjoy accepting offerings from others without any sense of shame or dishonor you know that they do only evil karma Furthermore Ajita Bodhisattvas should have no fear of any dharmas such as the dharmas of Pratyekabuddhas voicehearers or ordinary beings afflictions ending of dharmas or difficulty in making progress right or wrong act or no act fear or fearlessness existence or nonexistence mind or no mind enlightenment or no enlightenment karma or no karma good or bad peace or no peace liberation or no liberation training or not training dharma or nondharma serenity or turmoil true or false belief or disbelief good thoughts or bad thoughts abiding or not abiding Thus Bodhisattvas do not have fear of any dharmas Ajita because I have trained in the past in such fearlessness I have attained samyaksabodhi I can know the mental states of all sentient beings without the notion that I am the knower of what I know I expound what I have realized according to the capacities of Bodhisattvas enabling those who have heard the Dharma to acquire the Radiant Dhāraṇī Seal Having acquired this Dharma Seal they will never regress If one does not truly know this dharma  and speaks without eloquence one will not ultimately attain the unsurpassed bodhi Ajita when I expound the Dharma to the sentient beings here in this small world comprising four large continents by virtue of the spiritual power of the Buddha each of them sees  ākyamuni Tathāgata expound the Dharma only to him In the same way from one heaven to the next up to Akaniṣṭha Heaven each of the sentient beings there also says that the Tathāgata pronounces the Dharma only to him It is like this ranging from a small world comprising four continents to even a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold world All sentient beings think ākyamuni Buddha has come to be born in my country and He turns the great Dharma wheel only for me Ajita in the morning using great skill I observe everywhere sentient beings in immeasurable boundless worlds and expound the Dharma to those that should be transformed In the midday and in the evening I observe sentient beings impartially with my Dharmaeye and expound the Dharma in their worlds Such are the states of innumerable Buddhas All sentient beings that are learning to be Bodhisattvas should train in this way Those fools who malign the true Dharma pronounced by the Buddha adhere to their wrong understanding as the right understanding Those who malign the Dharma do not believe in the Buddha Because of this evil karma they will fall into hell to undergo multitudinous suffering never to hear the Dharma Furthermore Ajita you should accept and uphold the secret teachings of the Tathāgata and widely pronounce them to others by skillful means Then BodhisattvaMahāsattvas including Mañjuśrī the Youth Fortune Light Equality Bodhisattva No Doubt Bodhisattva Definite Resolve Bodhisattva Wonder Mind Open Intellect Bodhisattva Radiance Bodhisattva Joyful King Bodhisattva Fearless Bodhisattva Thoughts Reaching Boundless Buddha Lands Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva Fragrant Elephant Bodhisattva Annihilating All Evil Karma Bodhisattva Abiding in Samādhi Bodhisattva Hundred Thousand Merits Adorned Bodhisattva Wonderful Tone Heard Afar Bodhisattva All Knowledge Unforgotten Bodhisattva Great Name Shaking Jeweled Banner Adorned Bodhisattva Seeking All Dharma Bodhisattva Abiding in the Buddha State Bodhisattva Moonlight Adorned Bodhisattva and Great Multitude in All the World Adorned Bodhisattva said to the Buddha WorldHonored One indeed indeed truly as Your Holiness says when we passed Buddha Lands in the east which were as numerous as the sands of sixty Ganges Rivers and reverently made obeisance to the Buddhas there we saw only ākyamuni Buddha appearing in every world We then visited everywhere  in the ten directions for seven days and still saw only ākyamuni Buddha appearing in each world not other Buddhas After visiting everywhere we have returned to this land to hear and accept the true Dharma At that time the Buddha told Mañjuśrī the Youth Now observe carefully The wisdom of the Tathāgata is inconceivable and the state of the Tathāgata is also inconceivable Those fools say these words Only prajñāpāramitā is the Tathāgata action the Bodhisattva action and the sweet nectar action The Buddha told Mañjuśrī Their words contradict the Dharma Because it is very difficult to fully complete the Bodhisattva action Acting without attachment is the Bodhisattva action acting without the view of a self and its belongings is the Bodhisattva action acting with the understanding of emptiness is the Bodhisattva action and acting with no appearance is the Bodhisattva action Mañjuśrī such actions are the Bodhisattva action Those learning to be Bodhisattvas should accept and uphold it If those fools embrace the wrong views you should know that they do not understand my Dharma Do not allow them to dissipate in bad ways Fortify your minds and keep them from regressing As you fully expound the Dharma to sentient beings you should abide in the Dharma Since I fully attained the unsurpassed bodhi distant asakhyeya kalpas ago I have widely and skillfully pronounced the Dharma enabling sentient beings to stay far away from the evil lifejourneys Making a statement that this Dharma is correct and that Dharma is incorrect is called maligning the Dharma Making a statement that this Dharma is pronounced for Bodhisattvas and that Dharma is pronounced for voicehearers is called maligning the Dharma Making a statement that these are Bodhisattva studies and those are not Bodhisattva studies is called maligning the Dharma Making a statement that as the past Buddha is gone the future Buddha has not yet arrived and the present Buddha is not staying only I have acquired the Dhāraṇī Dharma is called maligning the Dharma Because of maligning the Dharma their claim to have acquired the dhāraṇī is an impure dharma They malign what a true Dharma master is cultivating They further slander the Dharma master saying that although he has intellectual understanding his actions are inconsistent with his words They further slander the Dharma master saying that his actions violate the Way They also say This sūtra is correct this sūtra is incorrect this stanza is correct this stanza is incorrect this Dharma is credible this Dharma is not credible They wrongly rebut what is explained correctly For those who listen to the true Dharma they create hindrances making claims such as this is a training this is not a training this is an accomplishment this is not an accomplishment this is the right time this is the wrong time These statements are all called maligning the Dharma Furthermore Mañjuśrī whether voicehearers pronounce the Dharma whether Bodhisattvas pronounce the Dharma know that it is entirely by virtue of the awesome spiritual power of the Tathāgatas protection and consideration which enables Bodhisattvas and others to say what they say Mañjuśrī even now the fools slander the Buddha After my parinirvāṇa how can Dharma masters who accept and uphold my Dharma not be slandered by them Because these fools are the retinue of the māras know that they will go down the evil lifepaths As these fools greedily seek benefits and worship to support their kinfolk they not only have no faith in the Dharma of the Tathāgata but also destroy the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata Their kinfolk with a clannish mind go to the houses of Brahmins and elders to praise these fools claiming that they know and understand the Dharma and its meanings and that they are good at explanations because they know others capacities and desires These fools accept others trust and offerings without any sense of shame or dishonor Because they malign the Dharma both they and their retinues will fall into hell Mañjuśrī I do not pronounce the Bodhisattva action to nonbelievers Nor do I pronounce the pure Dharma to those who are attached to family life Nor do I pronounce the Dharma of Liberation to those who adhere to the view of dualism Nor do I pronounce the supraworldly Dharma to those who adhere to the view of monism Mañjuśrī with a mind clinging to nothing I teach to people as many Dharma Doors as the sands of the Ganges Then with a mind seemingly attached to something I also teach to sentient beings as many Dharma Doors as the sands of the Ganges If sentient beings delight in emptiness I pronounce to them the Dharma of Emptiness If sentient beings delight in knowledge I pronounce to them the Dharma of Knowledge If sentient beings delight in no appearance I pronounce to them the Dharma of No Appearance If sentient beings delight in appearance I pronounce to them the Dharma of Appearance If sentient beings delight in lovingkindness I pronounce to them the Dharma of Lovingkindness If sentient beings delight in causality I pronounce to them the Dharma of Causality If sentient beings delight in no causality I pronounce to them the Dharma of No Causality The words of those fools which malign the true Dharma of the Buddha are not in accord with the pure true teachings of the Tathāgata Then Mañjuśrī asked Buddha WorldHonored One as You say such fools because they are close to evil friends step forward to voice their slander Then WorldHonored One through what causes and conditions can they avoid this fault The Buddha told Mañjuśrī For seven years in the distant past day and night in the six periods I repented of the grave sins I had committed with my body voice and mind After being purified it took me ten kalpas to acquire the Endurance in Dharmas Mañjuśrī know that this sūtra is the Bodhisattva Vehicle It can enable those who have not realized  to come to realization If those who having heard the words of this sūtra refuse to believe and accept them and even malign them they will go down the evil lifepaths Bodhisattvas need to understand and accept my Dharma before they can pronounce it to others By accepting and upholding  in this way one can stay far away from the evil lifejourneys The Buddha told Mañjuśrī There are four equality dharmas Bodhisattvas should learn What are these four First Bodhisattvas are impartial to all sentient beings Second they are impartial to all dharmas Third they are impartial to bodhi Fourth they pronounce various Dharmas impartially These are the four equality dharmas Bodhisattvas should know these four dharmas and explain them to sentient beings The believers will stay far away from the evil lifejourneys The nonbelievers will go down the evil lifepaths If among good men and good women there are those who abide in these four dharmas know that they will not have to take the evil lifejourneys There are another four dharmas  What are these four First their minds do not regress from helping sentient beings Second they neither disdain nor slander Dharma masters Third they do not slander the wise Fourth they always respect everything said by Tathāgatas If good men and good women can competently train in and learn these four dharmas they will never go down the evil lifepaths Furthermore Mañjuśrī Bodhisattvas can take the seven treasures which fill up as many Buddha Lands as the sands of the Ganges and make offerings every day for as many kalpas as the sands of the Ganges to as many BuddhaBhagavāns as the sands of the Ganges If good men and good women can three times read and recite a verse or a stanza in such a wonderful Mahāyāna vaipulya sūtra the merit they will acquire exceeds that from making those offerings The merit acquired by those who recite and uphold this sūtra will be twice as much Suppose there are those who practice almsgiving observance of precepts endurance energetic progress meditation and wisdom The merit they achieve from cultivating these six pāramitās also cannot compare  Mañjuśrī the name and meaning of such a sūtra are so vast that they are unequaled You BodhisattvaMahāsattvas should study and learn this sūtra accept and uphold it read and recite it and explain it widely to sentient beings Then those in the huge multitude and BodhisattvaMahāsattvas from worlds in the ten directions all said to the Buddha Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of  Ganges Rivers attained the spiritual level of no regress from the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind Furthermore the massive multitudes in  koṭi  nayuta ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Worlds having heard the Buddhas words heartily rejoiced They would have to continue flowing in the stream of birth and death for  kalpas and then they too would reach the spiritual level of no regress from the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind At the end of another  kalpas they would fully attain the unsurpassed bodhi All in the multitudeBodhisattvas gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras and mahoragas humans nonhumans and othershaving heard the Buddhas words greatly rejoiced and made obeisance Then they reverently carried out the teachings Sūtra of Immeasurable MeaningTranslated in the Xiao Qi Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master DharmagatayaśasChapter  The Virtuous ActionsAt one time the Buddha was staying on the Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain near the city of Rājagṛha together with  great bhikṣus and  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas as well as gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras and mahoragas Also present were bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās as well as great WheelTurning Kings and lesser WheelTurning Kings such as gold wheel kings and silver wheel kings as well as kings princes state ministers citizens men women and elders surrounded by their retinues in the billions They all came to the Buddha bowed their heads down at His feet and circled Him  times They burned incense scattered flowers and presented various kinds of offerings Having made their offerings to the Buddha they stepped back and sat on one side Among the  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas were Mañjuśrī the Dharma Prince Great Awesome Virtue Store the Dharma Prince Carefree Store the Dharma Prince Great Eloquence Store the Dharma Prince Maitreya Bodhisattva Guiding Leader Bodhisattva Medicine King Bodhisattva Medicine Superior Bodhisattva Flower

Roar King Bodhisattva Lion Frolic World Bodhisattva Lion Vigor Bodhisattva Lion Advance Bodhisattva Valiant Force Bodhisattva Lion Fierce Subjugation Bodhisattva Magnificence Bodhisattva and Great Magnificence Bodhisattva All of these BodhisattvaMahāsattvas are great ones who have realized their dharma body through perfecting  precepts samādhi wisdom liberation and the knowledge and views of liberation Their minds silent and meditative are constantly in samādhi peaceful reserved asaskṛta and free from desire Inverted thoughts and perceptions no longer arise Silent lucid profound and vast their minds can remain still for  koṭi kalpas as innumerable Dharma Doors are all present before them Having unfolded great wisdom and penetrated all dharmas they understand the true reality of dharmas which differentiated by their natures and appearances clearly manifest as existence or nonexistence long or short Moreover they are adept in identifying the capacities natures and desires of sentient beings Equipped with dhāraṇīs and unimpeded eloquence they always request Buddhas to turn the Dharma wheel Likewise they are also able to turn it They first dampen the dust of desire with drizzling drops  As they open the door to nirvāṇa and fan the wind of liberation they turn the heat of the afflictions of the world into the coolness of the Dharma They next rain down the profound principle of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising upon the blazing glowing sunlight of suffering that runs from ignorance to old age illness and death Then they cascade a downpour of unexcelled Mahāyāna  to water the roots of goodness of sentient beings in the Three Realms of Existence They scatter the seeds of goodness everywhere in merit fields enabling all to germinate bodhi sprouts With their wisdom like the sun and the moon using skillful means and timing they promote and expand the mission of the Mahāyāna enabling sentient beings to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly and to abide in bliss and inconceivable true reality As these BodhisattvaMahāsattvas rescue longsuffering sentient beings with immeasurable great compassion they are their true beneficent learned friends their great fortune fields and their unasked teachers For sentient beings they serve as sanctuaries of peace and joy and as places of rescue protection and great reliance In every way they are the great guiding teachers to sentient beings They can be the eye for those who are born blind and be the ear nose and tongue for those who are deaf unable to smell and mute They can complete those who are incomplete in their faculties and can make the deranged think straight Like the captain the great captain of a ship they carry sentient beings across the river of birth and death to the shore of nirvāṇa Like the medicine king the great medicine king they differentiate the symptoms of diseases know the properties of medicines dispense medicines according to the diseases and make patients enjoy taking them Like the animal trainer who can train elephants and horses without fail they the tamers the great tamers always refrain from unrestrained actions Like the brave fierce lion that subdues all animals totally undefeatable they playfully practice the Bodhisattva pāramitās Unshakably resolved to attain the Tathāgata Ground they rely on the power of their vows to purify Buddha Lands Before long they will attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi These BodhisattvaMahāsattvas all have such inconceivable merits as described Among the  bhikṣus were āriputra the Great Wisdom Maudgalyāyana the Transcendental Power Subhūti the Wisdom Life Mahākātyāyana Pūrṇa  Upananda Revata Kapphiṇa Vakkula Mahāmaudgalyāyana Svāgata Mahākāśyapa the Foremost in Dhūta Training Uruvilvākāśyapa Gayākāśyapa and Nadīkāśyapa All of them were Arhats who having ended their afflictions and the discharges thereof were free from bondage and truly liberated At that time Great Magnificence BodhisattvaMahāsattva seeing the multitude settled calmly together with the  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas in the assembly rose from his seat and came to the Buddha They bowed their heads down at the feet of the Buddha and circled him  times As an offering to the Buddha celestial incense smoke flowers garments necklaces and priceless jewels fell spiraling down from the sky and gathered around like clouds Celestial serving dishes and bowls were filled with delicacies of one hundred celestial flavors gratifying all with their colors and aromas Placed everywhere were celestial banners flags and canopies as well as wonderful musical instruments playing celestial music to entertain the Buddha With one mind and one voice they presented their tribute in verse Sublime is the holy lord the great enlightened one With no taint no defilement and no attachment He is the tamer of gods and men as well as of elephants and horses The influence of His Way and the fragrance of His virtue permeate everywhere His wisdom is peaceful His emotions serene and His cares at rest His mental faculty and mental consciousness are still and His mind silent Having forever ceased dreaming thinking perception and rumination He no longer takes as real the  domains the  aggregates the  spheres and the  fields Born from neither causes nor conditions neither self nor others His  body is neither existent nor nonexistent Neither square nor round neither long nor short Neither appearing nor disappearing with neither birth nor death Neither constructed nor arisen neither made nor formed Neither sitting nor lying neither walking nor standing still Neither moving nor turning neither noisy nor tranquil Neither advancing nor retreating neither safe nor perilous Neither right nor wrong neither gaining nor losing Neither this nor that neither coming nor going Neither blue nor yellow neither red nor white Neither scarlet nor purple nor in a variety of colors It is realized through achieving  precepts samādhi wisdom liberation and the knowledge and views of liberation Accomplished are the Three Clarities the six transcendental powers and the  Elements of Bodhi Arisen are lovingkindness compassion the Ten Powers and the Four Fearlessnesses His thirtytwo physical marks And eighty excellent characteristics seem to be visible In true reality there is neither form nor appearance Because appearances before the eye are empty As the appearance of no appearance is manifested as His body In the same way it is manifested as the bodies of sentient beings His appearance enables sentient beings to make obeisance joyfully And to pay their respects sincerely and earnestly By discarding selfelevation and selfarrogance He has acquired such a wonderful body All of us together  in this multitude Make obeisance to and take refuge in the holy one who without attachment Has skillfully transformed His thinking perception mind mental faculty and mental consciousness As well as tamed elephants and horses We bow down to take refuge in the physical form of His dharma body A combination of precepts samādhi wisdom liberation and the knowledge and views of liberation We bow down to take refuge in the appearance of the wondrous being We bow down to take refuge in the inconceivable one His Brahma tone thunders in eight ways Wondrous pure and farreaching Announcing the Four Noble Truths the six pāramitās and the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising According to the mind karmas of sentient beings None of the hearers will fail to open his mind And to shatter the bondage of his immeasurable cycle of birth and death Some voicehearers become Srotāpannas Sakṛdāgāmins Anāgāmins or Arhats Some acquire innumerable dhāraṇīs And delight in expounding the Dharma with great eloquence They pronounce profound wondrous stanzas Playing and bathing in the pure lake of the Dharma Some display transcendental powers as they jump up and fly Or freely go in and out of water or fire Such are the manifestations of the Dharma wheel Pure boundless and inconceivable Again we all bow down together to take refuge In the Dharma wheel that turns at the right time We all bow down to take refuge in the Brahma tones For innumerable kalpas in the past The WorldHonored One arduously trained in virtuous actions For Himself humans gods dragons spirits kings And all other sentient beings He was able to abandon all that was hard to abandon Such as wife children riches throne and kingdom Never begrudging dharmas internal or external He gave others his head eyes bone marrow and brain Observing the pure precepts of Buddhas He never caused any harm even to save His life He never became angry when struck by knives or clubs Or attacked by insults and abusive words For kalpas He was never tired or indolent in His endeavor Day and night He has kept his mind in meditation Having learned all the ways in the Dharma He can penetrate the capacities of sentient beings with His wisdom Hence He has now achieved commanding power Becoming the Dharma King in command of dharmas We all bow down together to take refuge So that we can endeavor to do what is hard to do Chapter  Expounding the Dharma Great Magnificence BodhisattvaMahāsattva and the  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas having finished the stanza in praise of the Buddha asked the Buddha WorldHonored One all of us  Bodhisattvas now would like to ask about the Dharma of the Tathāgata We do not know whether the WorldHonored One will grant us permission The Buddha told Great Magnificence Bodhisattva and the  Bodhisattvas Very good Very good Good men you best know that this is the right time You may ask any questions Before long the Tathāgata will enter parinirvāṇa and there should be no doubts remaining after my parinirvāṇa You may ask me any questions you wish Then Great Magnificence Bodhisattva and the  Bodhisattvas asked the Buddha with one voice WorldHonored One if BodhisattvaMahāsattvas wish to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly through what Dharma Door should they train What Dharma Door will enable BodhisattvaMahāsattvas to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly The Buddha replied to Great Magnificence Bodhisattva and the  Bodhisattvas Good men there is one Dharma Door through which Bodhisattvas can attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly If there are Bodhisattvas who learn this Dharma Door they can attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly WorldHonored One what is this Dharma Door called What is its meaning How should Bodhisattvas train themselves The Buddha replied Good men this one Dharma Door is called Immeasurable Meaning Bodhisattvas who wish to study and learn the immeasurable meaning should observe that dharmas have always been empty in nature and in appearance With neither birth nor death dharmas are neither large nor small neither moving nor standing still neither advancing nor retreating Like space they are nondual However sentient beings mistakenly calculate this versus that gain versus loss They elicit bad thoughts do evil karmas and hence transmigrate through the six lifejourneys undergoing dreadful suffering For innumerable koṭis of kalpas they are unable to transcend the cycle by themselves Having observed them carefully in this way and wishing to rescue them BodhisattvaMahāsattvas feel sympathy and exude great lovingkindness and compassion Moreover they deeply penetrate all dharmas with such a dharma appearance such a dharma is arising with such a dharma appearance such a dharma is staying with such a dharma appearance such a dharma is changing with such a dharma appearance such a dharma is perishing such a dharma appearance can produce evil dharmas such a dharma appearance can produce good dharmas In the same way each dharma stays changes and perishes Having fully observed and understood the ins and outs of the four appearances  Bodhisattvas next observe intently that all dharmas arise and perish instantly as thoughts one after another never stay They also observe the instantaneous birth stay change and death of all dharmas Having made these observations Bodhisattvas then penetrate the capacities natures and desires of sentient beings Because their capacities natures and desires are immeasurable Bodhisattvas pronounce immeasurable Dharmas As the Dharmas pronounced are immeasurable their meanings are also immeasurable The immeasurable meanings are born from one dharma This one dharma is no appearance which is not apart from appearance The truth that appearance and no appearance are not apart from each other is called true reality As BodhisattvaMahāsattvas abide in this true reality the lovingkindness and compassion they exude are genuine not false They can truly end sentient beings suffering Having rescued them from suffering Bodhisattvas pronounce the Dharma to them enabling them to experience happiness Good men if Bodhisattvas can train in this one Dharma Door of Immeasurable Meaning they will quickly attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Good men this profound unexcelled Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning is true in its principle and supreme in its dignity It is protected by all Buddhas of the past present and future No māras or nonBuddhists can enter it nor can it be corrupted by the wrong views that perpetuate birth and death Therefore good men BodhisattvaMahāsattvas who wish to attain the unsurpassed bodhi should study and learn this profound unexcelled Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning Great Magnificence Bodhisattva next said to the Buddha WorldHonored One the Dharma pronounced by You is inconceivable the capacities of sentient beings are also inconceivable and the explanations of the Dharma Doors are inconceivable as well We no longer have doubts about the Dharma pronounced by the Buddha However I need to restate my question because sentient beings have bewildered minds WorldHonored One since the Tathāgatas attainment of bodhi for over forty years You have often expounded to sentient beings that the meaning of the four appearances of every dharma is impermanence pain emptiness and no self With neither birth nor death dharmas are neither large nor small but in the one appearance of no appearance Dharma nature and dharma appearance have always been empty neither coming nor going neither appearing nor disappearing Of those who have heard these teachings some have completed  Warmth Pinnacle Endurance and Foremost in the World some have become Srotāpannas Sakṛdāgāmins Anāgāmins or Arhats some have activated the bodhi mind and ascended to the First Second Third or even the Tenth Ground What is the difference in the meaning between the Dharma You have pronounced in the past and what You have stated today that prompted You to say that Bodhisattvas who train according to this profound unexcelled Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning will attain the unsurpassed bodhi quickly What is the reason I pray only that the WorldHonored One out of His lovingkindness and compassion for all will widely explain it to sentient beings enabling present and future hearers of the Dharma not to have a web of doubts remaining Then the Buddha told Great Magnificence Bodhisattva Very good Very good Man of great goodness you are able to ask the Tathāgata about such subtle meaning of this profound unexcelled Mahāyāna We know that you are able to bring a great many benefits to gods and humans and to rescue suffering sentient beings giving them all peace and joy Your great lovingkindness and compassion are true not false Because of these causes and conditions you will definitely attain the unsurpassed bodhi quickly You will also enable sentient beings in the Three Realms of Existence to attain the unsurpassed bodhi in their present or future lives Good man after sitting properly for six years under the bodhi tree in my bodhimaṇḍa I attained anuttarasamyaksabodhi I then observed all dharmas with my Buddhaeye and decided that some  should not yet be pronounced Because the natures and desires of sentient beings are varied Because their natures and desires are varied my teachings have also been varied Pronouncing various Dharmas with the power of skillful means for over forty years I did not reveal the definitive meaning As a result there are differences in the bodhi attained by sentient beings and they are unable to attain the unsurpassed bodhi quickly Good man the Dharma is like water which can wash off filth and dirt Whether water comes from a well a lake a stream a river a brook a channel or an immense ocean it all can wash off different kinds of dirt Likewise the Dharma water can cleanse sentient beings filthy afflictions Good man the nature of water is the same but a stream a river a well a pool a channel and an immense ocean are different from one another Likewise the nature of the Dharma is the same and there is no difference in its washing away of filthy afflictions However the three dharmas the four  fruits and the Two Paths are not the same Good man although water from any source washes off dirt just the same a well is not a pool a pool is neither a stream nor a river and a brook or a channel is not an immense ocean The Dharma pronounced by the Tathāgata the hero in the world who has command of all dharmas is like water Although what is taught at the beginning in the middle and at the end all can cleanse sentient beings afflictions the beginning is not the middle nor is the middle the end The teachings given at the beginning in the middle and at the end use the same words but their meanings are different Good man after I rose from under the bodhi tree the king of trees I went to Deer Park in Vārāṇasī and turned the Dharma wheel of the Four Noble Truths for the five people including jñātakauṇḍinya I pronounced that dharmas have always been empty changing nonstop as thoughts arise and perish thought after thought During the middle period of my teachings I expounded everywhere to bhikṣus and Bodhisattvas the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising and the six pāramitās I also pronounced that dharmas have always been empty changing nonstop as thoughts arise and perish thought after thought As I now expound this Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning I again pronounce that dharmas have always been empty changing nonstop as thoughts arise and perish thought after thought Therefore good man the teachings at the beginning in the middle and at the end use the same words but with different meanings Because the meanings are different sentient beings understandings are different Because their understandings are different the Dharma the fruit and bodhi they acquire are also different Good man at the beginning as I pronounced the Four Noble Truths to those who wanted to be voicehearers eight koṭi gods who descended  to hear the Dharma activated the bodhi mind In the middle period  as I pronounced everywhere the profound Twelve Links of Dependent Arising to those who wanted to become Pratyekabuddhas innumerable sentient beings activated the bodhi mind while others remained as voicehearers I next pronounced sūtras in the twelve categories including the vaipulya sūtras and the mahāprajñā sūtras like a splendid ocean of clouds and I expounded how Bodhisattvas would train themselves for kalpas However of the hundreds of thousands of bhikṣus and tens of thousands of koṭis of humans and gods a countless number became Srotāpannas Sakṛdāgāmins Anāgāmins or Arhats abiding in the Dharma of Dependent Arising realized by Pratyekabuddhas Good man for this reason know that although the words are the same their meanings are different Because the meanings are different the understandings of sentient beings are different As their understandings differ the Dharma fruit and bodhi they achieve also differ Good man after attaining the great bodhi from the time I started pronouncing the Dharma to this day on which I expound the Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning I have never stopped explaining suffering emptiness impermanence and no self Nor have I stopped explaining that dharmas neither real nor unreal neither large nor small have never been born nor do they die The one appearance of all dharmas is no appearance as dharma appearance and dharma nature are neither coming nor going However sentient beings continue to be driven by the four appearances they perceive  Good man this means that Buddhas who never speak contradictory words can respond with one tone universally to all sounds They each can use one body to manifest as many copies of that body as the sands of immeasurable uncountable billions of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers Each copy can in turn manifest as many kinds of forms as the sands of asakhyeyas billions of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers Each form can further manifest as many shapes as the sands of asakhyeya billions of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers Good man the inconceivable profound state of Buddhas is unknowable to riders of the Two Vehicles and beyond Bodhisattvas on the Tenth Ground It is understood only by Buddhas Therefore good man I pronounce this wondrous profound unexcelled Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning which is true in its principle and supreme in its dignity It is protected by all Buddhas of the past present and future No māras or nonBuddhists can enter it nor can it be corrupted by the wrong views that perpetuate birth and death If BodhisattvaMahāsattvas wish to attain the unsurpassed bodhi quickly they should study and learn this profound unexcelled Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning After the Buddha had finished these words this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World quaked in six different ways The sky spontaneously rained down various kinds of celestial flowers such as utpala padma kumuda and puṇḍarīka As an offering to the Buddha and the huge multitude of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers innumerable kinds of celestial incense garments necklaces and priceless jewels fell spiraling down from the sky Celestial serving dishes and bowls were filled with delicacies of one hundred celestial flavors Placed everywhere were celestial banners flags canopies and musical instruments As celestial music and songs were performed to praise the Buddha the world again quaked in six different ways In the east in Buddha Lands as numerous as the sands of the Ganges their skies also rained down celestial flowers incense garments necklaces and priceless jewels Their celestial serving dishes and bowls too were filled with delicacies of one hundred celestial flavors Also placed everywhere were celestial banners flags canopies and musical instruments Just the same were worlds in the south west and north as well as in the four inbetween directions and toward the zenith and nadir Then in the multitude  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas attained the Samādhi of Immeasurable Meaning and  BodhisattvaMahāsattvas acquired innumerable immeasurable Dhāraṇī Doors and were enabled to turn the noregress Dharma wheel of Buddhas of the past present and future The bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas upāsikās gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras and mahoragas as well as great WheelTurning Kings and lesser WheelTurning Kings such as silver wheel kings and iron wheel kings as well as kings princes state ministers citizens men women and elders together with their retinues in the hundreds of thousands having heard the Buddha pronounce this sūtra all received benefits Some achieved  Warmth Pinnacle Endurance and Foremost in the World Some achieved the  fruits becoming Srotāpannas Sakṛdāgāmins Anāgāmins or Arhats Chapter  The Ten Virtues Great Magnificence BodhisattvaMahāsattva next said to the Buddha WorldHonored One You have pronounced this wondrous profound unexcelled Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning Truly it is very profound very profound very profound Because in this multitude of BodhisattvaMahāsattvas Your four groups of disciples gods dragons spirits kings state ministers citizens and sentient beings having heard this profound unexcelled Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning no one has failed to acquire the Dhāraṇī Doors the Three Dharmas the four  fruits or the bodhi mind Know that this sūtra is true in its principle and supreme in its dignity It is protected by all Buddhas of the past present and future No māras or nonBuddhists can enter it nor can it be corrupted by the wrong views that perpetuate birth and death Why not Because by hearing it only once one is enabled to uphold all Dharmas If there are sentient beings that have heard this sūtra it is to their great benefit Because if they train accordingly they will attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly If there are sentient beings that are unable to hear this sūtra know that it is a great loss to them Even after passing immeasurable limitless inconceivable asakhyeyas of kalpas they still will not attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Why not Because not knowing the great Way to bodhi they take perilous paths which lead to many tribulations WorldHonored One this sūtra is inconceivable I pray only that the WorldHonored One out of lovingkindness and sympathy will broadly expound to this huge multitude the profound and inconceivable things about this sūtra WorldHonored One where does this sūtra come from where does it go and where does it stay to have such immeasurable virtue and inconceivable power enabling sentient beings to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly Then the WorldHonored One told Great Magnificence BodhisattvaMahāsattva Very good Very good Good man indeed indeed it is just as you say Good man I say that truly this sūtra is very profound very profound very profound Because it enables sentient beings to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly Hearing it once enables them to uphold all Dharmas It brings great benefits to sentient beings and it enables them to walk the great right path without tribulations Good man you ask where this sūtra comes from where it goes and where it stays Hearken well Good man this sūtra comes from the abode of Buddhas goes to sentient beings for them to activate the bodhi mind and stays in the action range of Bodhisattvas Good man this sūtra comes in this way goes in this way and stays in this way Indeed this sūtra has immeasurable virtue and inconceivable power and can enable sentient beings to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi quickly Good man would you like to hear the ten inconceivable powers of this sūtras virtue Great Magnificence Bodhisattva replied I would be delighted to hear The Buddha said Good man first this sūtra can enable Bodhisattvas who have not activated the bodhi mind to activate the bodhi mind enable those who have no lovingkindness to invoke the mind of lovingkindness enable those who enjoy killing to awaken the mind of compassion enable those who are jealous to open the mind of sympathetic joy enable those who have love and attachment to cultivate the mind of equability enable those who are miserly and greedy to unleash the mind of generosity enable those who are arrogant to observe their precepts enable those who are easily angered to endure  enable those who are negligent and indolent to strive for energetic progress enable those who are disorderly to develop the meditative mind enable those who are foolish to unfold the wisdom mind enable those who are unable to deliver others to have the will to deliver others enable those who do the ten evil karmas to be motivated to do the ten good karmas enable those who delight in saskṛta dharmas to realize the asaskṛta mind enable those with a regressive mind to invoke the mind that never regresses enable those who discharge their afflictions to uncover the mind with no affliction to discharge and enable those who have a great many afflictions to resolve to eradicate them Good man these are called the first inconceivable power of this sūtras virtue Good man here is the second inconceivable power of this sūtras virtue If there are sentient beings that have acquired this sūtra whether in its entirety or just one stanza or one verse they will be enabled to penetrate  koṭi meanings in the Dharma which for innumerable kalpas they have upheld but been unable to expound Because the Dharma in this sūtra has immeasurable meaning Good man by analogy a seed can produce hundreds thousands and tens of thousands of seeds Each seed in turn can produce hundreds thousands and tens of thousands of seeds The seeds successively produced in this way are innumerable Likewise this sūtra expands One Dharma gives rise to hundreds and thousands of meanings Each meaning in turn evokes hundreds thousands and tens of thousands of meanings Expanding in this way immeasurable boundless meanings are revealed Therefore this sūtra is called Immeasurable Meaning Good man these are called the second inconceivable power of this sūtras virtue Good man here is the third inconceivable power of this sūtras virtue If there are sentient beings that have heard this sūtra whether in its entirety or just one stanza or one verse they will be enabled to penetrate a billion koṭi meanings Although they still have afflictions they will carry on as if without afflictions They will go through birth and death without thoughts of fear As a strong man can carry heavy loads so too can the upholders of this sūtra shoulder the onerous undertaking for the unsurpassed bodhi and carry sentient beings away from the journey of birth and death Although they have not delivered themselves they will be able to deliver others As an analogy a severely ill captain of the ship stays on this shore because of his physical disability but he owns a sturdy ship equipped for transporting people so he gives it to others to sail away So too do the upholders of this sūtra Transmigrating through the five lifepaths with their bodies fettered by  grave diseases they will continue their ignorance grow old and die on this shore  However they have this sturdy Mahāyāna Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning and can deliver others Sentient beings that train according to its tenets will be delivered from  birth and death Good man these are called the third inconceivable power of this sūtras virtue Good man here is the fourth inconceivable power of this sūtras virtue If there are sentient beings that have heard this sūtra whether in its entirety or just one stanza or one verse they will acquire bravery Although they have not delivered themselves they will be enabled to deliver others and to have Bodhisattvas as their spiritual family BuddhaTathāgatas will often expound the Dharma to them After hearing it they will be able to accept and uphold it accordingly not countering it They will in turn pronounce it widely to others where appropriate Good man they are like the youngest prince born to the king and queen whether one or two or up to seven days old whether one or two or up to seven months old whether one or two or up to seven years old Although he is unable to administer the affairs of the state he is already respected by his people He

inconceivable indescribable innumerable and beyond reckoning Their leader was Vajragarbha Vajra Store Bodhisattva  The Samādhi of Mahāyāna Radiance  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva through the spiritual power of the Buddha entered the Bodhisattva samādhi called Mahāyāna Radiance In the ten directions beyond worlds as numerous as the dust particles in ten koṭi Buddha Lands there were Buddhas as numerous as the dust particles in ten koṭi Buddha Lands and they all were called Vajra Store Vajra Store you can enter this Bodhisattva Samādhi of Mahāyāna Radiance because you are supported by the power of Buddhas as numerous as the dust particles in ten koṭi Buddha Lands by the power of the original vows of Vairocana Tathāgata the SamyakSabuddha and by the power of your own excellent wisdom You are thus enabled to reveal to all Bodhisattvas the radiance of the inconceivable Buddha Dharma It will enable them to enter the wisdom grounds to develop all rootsofgoodness to select the teachings in the Buddha Dharma to know a wide range of dharmas to excel in expounding the Dharma to achieve purity by acquiring the differentiationfree wisdomknowledge to remain untainted by worldly dharmas to achieve purity by developing supraworldly roots of goodness to acquire inconceivable wisdom and even Buddha wisdom to complete the ten Bodhisattva grounds from start to finish to explain correctly the differences between the ten Bodhisattva grounds to ponder the entire Buddha Dharma to learn and differentiate dharmas that are free from ones afflictions to adorn themselves with the radiance of great wisdom to enter the definite door of wisdomknowledge to expound the Dharma systematically and fearlessly at their spiritual levels to acquire the radiance of unimpeded eloquence to abide on the ground of unimpeded wisdomknowledge to retain the bodhi mind and never to lose it to bring sentient beings to  maturity to be present everywhere and definitely to attain enlightenment Good man you should skillfully differentiate the  Dharma Doors because you are supported by the spiritual power of Buddhas because you are blessed by the wisdom light of Tathāgatas because you have purified your roots of goodness because you universally purify the dharma realm because you universally benefit all sentient beings because you reveal the dharma body the wisdom body because Buddhas have poured the water of wisdom on your head because you have assumed the hugest body in the world because you have transcended all worldly paths because you have pure supraworldly roots of goodness because you fully qualify to acquire  the knowledge of all knowledge  Then Buddhas  in the ten directions bestowed upon Vajra Store Bodhisattva the unexcelled body the unimpeded eloquence the pure differentiating wisdomknowledge the power of mindfulness and unfailing memory the radiant wisdom to understand everything the wisdomknowledge to be present everywhere and definitely to attain enlightenment the commanding power to attain bodhi the fearlessness of Tathāgatas the wisdomknowledge of Buddhas to examine and differentiate Dharma Doors the sublime body voice and mind that adorn all Tathāgatas Why Because this Bodhisattva has naturally attained the Samādhi of Mahāyāna Radiance and because of his original vows his pure mind his pure wisdom his good training to complete the elements of bodhi his good rectification of his karmas his being an immeasurable Dharmavessel his pure faith in and understanding of  his unadulterated  total retention of the Dharma and his sanctifying of his wisdomknowledge of the dharma realm as a seal  Pronouncing the Names of the Ten Bodhisattva Grounds  Then BuddhaBhagavāns  in the ten directions extended their right hands and rubbed the crown of Vajra Store Bodhisattvas head Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva rose from his samādhi He told all the Bodhisattvas in the multitude BuddhaSons Bodhisattva vows are a crucial resolve Unadulterated and invisible they are as vast as the dharma realm and as ultimate as the open sky Throughout the endless future Bodhisattvas will rescue and deliver all sentient beings in all Buddha Lands Protected by all Buddhas they will enter the wisdom ground of Buddhas of the past future and present BuddhaSons what are the wisdom grounds of BodhisattvaMahāsattvas There are ten wisdom grounds As they were pronounced by Buddhas of the past will be pronounced by Buddhas of the future and are pronounced by Buddhas of the present so I now pronounce them What are these ten BuddhaSons these ten Bodhisattva grounds were pronounced by Buddhas of the past will be pronounced by Buddhas of the future and are pronounced by Buddhas of the present BuddhaSons I have never seen any Buddha Land where the Tathāgata does not expound these ten grounds Why not Because they are the supreme Bodhisattva Way to bodhi and are the illumination door of the pure Dharma BuddhaSons to expound and differentiate these Bodhisattva grounds is inconceivable because the Bodhisattva wisdom developed on each ground is inconceivable  After pronouncing the names of the ten Bodhisattva grounds Vajra Store Bodhisattva fell silent He did not explain their meanings  Liberation Moons Request for an Explanation of the Ten Grounds  At that time all Bodhisattvas in the multitude heard the names of the ten Bodhisattva grounds but not their explanations and they were filled with longing They thought Why did Vajra Store Bodhisattva only pronounce the names of the ten Bodhisattva grounds but not explain them  Then Liberation Moon Bodhisattva knowing the thoughts of the multitude asked Vajra Store Bodhisattva in verse Why did the pure enlightened one who is Equipped with mindfulness wisdom and merit Pronounce the names of the wondrous grounds But not explain them though he can Resolute in everything He is valiant and fearless Why did he pronounce the names of the grounds But not expound their meanings This multitude wishes to hear The profound meanings of the grounds Their minds are not timid And they pray that you will explain to them This multitude is pure Disciplined and free from indolence Unwavering in their solid training They are adorned with merit and wisdom Gazing with reverence They all look up to you Like bees thinking of pure honey And like the thirsty longing for sweet dew Vajra Store Bodhisattva the fearless one with great wisdom heard these stanzas To delight the multitude he spoke in verse The training of a Bodhisattva on each ground Is the supreme root of a Buddha A detailed explanation Is hard in the extreme Such an explanation is subtle and hard to grasp Beyond ones thinking mind As it arises from Buddha wisdom The hearer will be bewildered Only those who hold their minds like a vajra Have profound faith in Buddha wisdom and Know that ones mind ground Has no self  Can hear such superb teachings which are Like pictures or the wind In the open sky Such is Buddha wisdom A description of which is too hard to comprehend Knowing that Buddha wisdom is Supreme and inconceivable and that No one in the world can accept it I choose to remain silent Having heard these words Liberation Moon Bodhisattva said to Vajra Store Bodhisattva BuddhaSon this multitude of Bodhisattvas has congregated They excel in training to complete the elements of bodhi They have attended  koṭi Buddhas developed innumerable roots of goodness and acquired immeasurable merit They have discarded their doubts and afflictions With deep faith in and understanding of the Buddha Dharma they do not need to be taught Very good BuddhaSon through the spiritual power of the Buddha you should expound to them These Bodhisattvas can carry out your profound teachings  Then to restate his meaning Liberation Moon Bodhisattva spoke in verse I pray that you will expound The supreme and most steadfast training of a Bodhisattva Your explication of the Bodhisattva grounds Will lead them to pure wisdom and true enlightenment This multitude of Bodhisattvas who are free from afflictions Abide in pure faith and understanding And have attended innumerable Buddhas Can understand the meanings of the Ten Grounds Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva replied BuddhaSon although this multitude has pure thoughts has discarded delusions and doubts and does not need to be taught the profound Dharma there are sentient beings with inferior intellect If they hear this profound and inconceivable training they will harbor doubts and will be distressed in the long night Out of pity for them I remain silent  Then to restate his meaning Vajra Store Bodhisattva spoke in verse This multitude has vast pure wisdom Which is profound keen and capable of making right choices And has a mind unwavering like the king of mountains And indestructible like the immense ocean They follow their consciousness not their wisdom If they hear my teachings they will harbor doubts that will cause them to go down the evil lifepaths Out of compassion for them I do not explain Liberation Moon Bodhisattva again asked Vajra Store Bodhisattva BuddhaSon I pray that through the spiritual power of the Buddha you will give this inconceivable teaching The hearers because of the Buddhas protection and concern will believe and accept it Because when the Ten Grounds are pronounced all Bodhisattvas naturally receive the Buddhas protection and concern Then they will enter the wisdom grounds with boldness Because these grounds provide Bodhisattvas with the basic training to master the entire Buddha Dharma As an analogy writing and numbering are based on the alphabet They cannot be done without the alphabet BuddhaSon  the Buddha Dharma relies on the Ten Grounds One must complete ones training on the Ten Grounds to acquire  the overall wisdomknowledge Therefore BuddhaSon I pray that you will expound the Ten Grounds All hearers will be protected by the Tathāgata who will enable them to believe and accept your teachings  To restate his meaning Liberation Moon Bodhisattva spoke in verse BuddhaSon I pray that you will expound A Bodhisattvas training on the Ten Grounds to head for bodhi All Buddhas in worlds in the ten directions Protect and care for the roots of wisdom The Ten Grounds are the ultimate training place for wisdom From which arises the entire Buddha Dharma As writing and numbering are based on the alphabet Likewise  the Buddha Dharma relies on  the grounds  Joint Request of the Multitude  At that time the multitude of great Bodhisattvas with one voice spoke to Vajra Store Bodhisattvas in verse Equipped with the excellent stainless wisdomknowledge And the immeasurable eloquence to explicate dharmas You can speak profound and beautiful words In accord with the highest meaning You take pure actions with mindfulness Accumulate merit through your ten powers And explicate meanings with eloquence So you can expound the supreme grounds Having trained our minds with precepts and meditation Having discarded our arrogance and wrong views This multitude harbors no doubts But wishes to hear your profound words As the thirsty long for cool water Likewise the hungry yearn for warm food As bees covet pure honey Likewise the ill seek strong medicine In the same way We wish to taste the sweet dew of the Dharma Great is the one with vast wisdomknowledge We pray that you will reveal how to enter the Bodhisattva grounds In order to acquire the Ten Powers  hindrance free And take all the actions of the Sugata  Support from Buddhas  At that time the WorldHonored One emitted from between His eyebrows a beam of pure light called Flaming Radiance of the Power of Bodhisattvas accompanied by  asakhyeya beams as its retinue It shone everywhere in all worlds in the ten directions Sentient beings on the three evil lifepaths were given a respite from their suffering It also illuminated all Tathāgata assemblies revealing the inconceivable power of Buddhas It also illuminated all Bodhisattvas in all worlds in the ten directions who were expounding the Dharma with the support of Buddhas Then the radiance formed a huge platform of radiance in the sky like a web of radiant clouds Meanwhile Buddhas in worlds in the ten directions did the same They too emitted beams of pure light from between Their eyebrows The names the retinues and the actions of these beams were the same as those just described These beams also illuminated the Buddha and the huge multitude in this Sahā World as well as Vajra Store Bodhisattva on his lion throne Then the radiance formed a huge platform of radiance in the sky like a web of radiant clouds From this platform of radiance through the spiritual power of Buddhas a voice spoke in verse The Buddha is as unequaled as the open sky Adorned with immeasurable merit and the TenPowers BuddhaSon through the power of the Buddha You should open the greatest treasury of this Dharma king Through the spiritual power of the Buddha you should explain The superb training on all wisdom grounds The hearers supported by the power of the Sugata Will accept the Dharma treasure into their minds After they have completed purifying the Ten Grounds one by one They will acquire the Ten Powers of a Tathāgata Those with doubts and disbelief Will never hear such meanings Those capable of accepting them will definitely hear them Even if they live in the water and fire at the end of a kalpa You should expound the grounds as the excellent wisdom path For them to train step by step In order to develop their wisdom through their training And benefit all sentient beings  The Request Granted  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva observed everywhere in the ten directions To strengthen the faith of the multitude he spoke in verse The bodhi attained by the Tathāgata the holy master Is wondrous and hard to know It is beyond thinking and apart from thoughts Impossible to be captured by ones perception With neither birth nor death Its nature is forever pure and quiet One who is wise and free from afflictions Knows that wisdom is Empty and quiet in nature as well as Nondual and endless It enables one to liberate oneself from making repeated lifejourneys And to abide in the equality of nirvāṇa With no beginning middle or ending It cannot be described by words It transcends past present and future And appears like the open sky The attainment of a Buddha is nirvāṇa Which is beyond the description of words Likewise is ones training on the Bodhisattva grounds Which is hard to describe and hard to accept Apart from thinking and mental functions Ones wisdom  leads to Buddha wisdom Not in the realm of ones fiveaggregates twelvefields and eighteenspheres It is beyond ones conscious mind As bird tracks in the sky Are hard to indicate Likewise the meanings of the Ten Grounds Are hard for ones mind to comprehend Equipped with lovingkindness compassion and the power of ones vows One can enter the Bodhisattva grounds to train It can be known but not described Through the power of the Buddha I will expound it and You should reverently accept it The training for wisdom Cannot be explained in a koṭi kalpas I now will describe it briefly Revealing its true meanings without omission You should wait with reverence and a single mind For me to speak through the power of the Buddha Wondrous tones of the true Dharma that express Words and analogies in accord with their meanings May the immeasurable spiritual power of the Buddha Enter into my body What is hard to expound I now will reveal in brief  The First Ground the Joyful Ground   Activating the Bodhi Mind  BuddhaSon if sentient beings persistently develop their roots of goodness gather provisions for the spiritual journey do good training make offerings to Buddhas do good karmas are protected by beneficent learned friends cultivate a pure and profound mind raise great aspirations achieve profound understanding  and elicit lovingkindness and compassion then they can activate the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind They activate the bodhi mind because they seek to acquire Buddha wisdom to acquire the Ten Powers to acquire fearlessness to master the Buddha Dharma founded on equality to purify their lovingkindness and compassion to rescue all in the world to acquire all possible wisdomknowledge from the ten directions to purify all Buddha Lands hindrance free to know in one thought everything in the past present and future to turn the great Dharma wheel without fear BuddhaSon the bodhi mind is led by great compassion ruled by wisdom assisted by skillful means and sustained by the supreme profound mind It draws upon the immeasurable power of Tathāgatas and can observe and differentiate dharmas Using the wisdomknowledge of unhindered power it follows ones innate wisdom and can accept the wisdom contained in the entire Buddha Dharma The bodhi mind is as vast as the dharma realm and as ultimate as the open sky throughout the endless future BuddhaSon as soon as someone activates the bodhi mind he immediately transcends the ground of ordinary beings and becomes a Bodhisattva he is born into the Tathāgata family and no one can scorn his family name He leaves worldly paths enters the supraworldly path and acquires the Bodhisattva Dharma As a Bodhisattva he realizes the equality of past present and future As a Bodhisattva of the Tathāgata charactertype he will definitely attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi A Bodhisattva abiding in these dharmas is called abiding on the first ground the Joyful

Tathāgatas because I am born in the realm of Buddhas because I join all Bodhisattvas as their equal because I stay far away from all terrifying things that cause my hair to stand on end  Why Because a Bodhisattva abiding on the Joyful Ground has left behind all his fears such as  fear of the overwhelming presence of multitudes He has discarded all such fears Because this Bodhisattva has no perception of having a self He does not cherish even his body much less his assets therefore he has no fear of his inability to survive He does not seek to receive offerings but gives alms to all sentient beings therefore he has no fear of a bad name He has neither selfview nor perception of having a self therefore he has no fear of death He knows that after death he will never be separated

perform magical acts everywhere in the world Throughout all future kalpas without rest he honors this vow which is as vast as the dharma realm and as ultimate as the open sky  The Ten Impossible Endings  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on the Joyful Ground makes such great vows with such great boldness and such great purpose Led by these ten great vows he fulfills a million asakhyeya great vows BuddhaSon these ten great vows are established with ten impossible endings What are these ten They are  ending of the realm of changes in worlds dharmas and knowledge As these ten from the realm of sentient beings to the realm of the three kinds of changes have no end so my great vows arising from my roots of goodness have no end  Acquiring Ten Dharmas  Faith  BuddhaSon having made such great vows this Bodhisattva acquires ten minds the benevolent mind the gentle mind the compliant mind the quiet mind the tame mind the mind in nirvāṇa the humble mind the nurturing mind the unwavering mind and the clear mind He thus elicits pure faith in the original training of Tathāgatas in achieving the pāramitās in entering the superb Bodhisattva grounds in acquiring the Ten Powers in achieving the Four Fearlessnesses in acquiring the indestructible Eighteen Exclusive Dharmas in the inconceivable Buddha Dharma in a Tathāgatas realm that has neither middle nor sides in entering a Tathāgatas immeasurable state and in achieving the holy fruit He has faith in all Bodhisattva actions and all teachings on the wisdom ground of Tathāgatas Compassion and Lovingkindness  BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva thinks The true Dharma of Buddhas is in nirvāṇa and it is profound quiet untainted immeasurable and vast It enables one to see the emptiness of dharmas and liberates one from ones attachment to their appearances and ones wish for rebirth However ordinary beings shrouded by ignorance embrace the wrong views Their minds never discard stinginess and jealousy and they create the causes and conditions for repeated birth and death through the six lifejourneys The karmas done by their greed anger and ignorance increase day and night The wind of their anger blows on the fire of their consciousnesses and their karmas accord with their inverted views The stream of their desire existence ignorance and wrong views waters the seeds of their consciousnessesālaya consciousness manas consciousness and mental consciousnesswhich germinate buds of suffering in the Three Realms of Existence Each sentient being is born with name and form which develop the sixfaculties Contact of these faculties with their corresponding objects produces sensory reception sensory experiences spark love of sense objects Growing love leads to grasping and grasping fuels the karmic force for being However each sentient being as an aggregate of suffering is empty without a self with its belongings It has no doer no recipient no perceiver and no knower like a plant or stone wall and like a reflection However each suffering sentient being neither perceives nor knows its state  This Bodhisattva sees sentient beings living in suffering unable to escape so he elicits great compassion with radiant wisdom He thinks I should rescue these sentient beings and put them in a peaceful and joyful place Then he elicits great lovingkindness with radiant wisdom Relinquishment  BuddhaSon as this BodhisattvaMahāsattva abides on the first ground with a profound mind he follows his great lovingkindness and great compassion and never begrudges anything Seeking to acquire the great wisdom of a Buddha he can give away everything as alms such as grain and warehouses gold silver jewels pearls aquamarine conch shells jade corals precious collectibles and ornaments including necklaces elephants horses and vehicles cities villages gardens and mansions wives retinues slaves and servants men and women and people even his head eyes hands feet bone marrow and other body parts He gives them all away as alms without begrudging them because he seeks to acquire the great wisdom of a Buddha This is called achieving great relinquishment  on the first ground Tirelessness  BuddhaSon out of lovingkindness compassion and generosity to rescue all sentient beings this Bodhisattva tirelessly does worldly and supraworldly things to benefit them Thus he acquires the tireless mind Wisdomknowledge Worldly Knowledge  With a tireless mind he is not too timid to study scriptural texts Without timidity he acquires wisdomknowledge from scriptural texts With wisdomknowledge he determines what he should or should not do for sentient beings of high middling and low capacities according to their needs abilities and backgrounds Thus this Bodhisattva acquires worldly knowledge A Sense of Shame and Dishonor The Power of Persistence  With worldly knowledge knowing the right time and measure he adorns himself with a sense of shame and dishonor as he trains to benefit himself and others Thus he fully develops a sense of shame and dishonor Then he diligently trains to transcend the world never to regress or digress from his path Thus he acquires the power of persistence Making Offerings to Buddhas Carrying Out Their Teachings  With the power of persistence he diligently makes offerings to Buddhas and carries out Their teachings BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva thus acquires these ten dharmas that purify the Bodhisattva grounds  Training under All Buddhas  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on the first ground through the power of his great vows comes to see many Buddhas hundreds of Buddhas thousands of Buddhas hundreds of thousands of Buddha koṭis of Buddhas hundreds of koṭis of Buddhas thousands of koṭis of Buddhas hundreds of thousands of koṭis of Buddhas koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas hundreds of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas and even hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas With a magnanimous and profound mind he reveres honors and attends all Buddhas and makes offerings to Them He offers Them lifesupporting things including clothing food and drink beds and bedding and medicine He also makes these offerings to all monks Then he transfers his roots of goodness to his attaining the unsurpassed bodhi BuddhaSon because he makes offerings to Buddhas this Bodhisattva acquires skillful means to teach and transform sentient beings Of the Four DrawinginDharmas  he mainly employs the first two almsgiving and loving words to draw in sentient beings He has faith in and understanding of the last two but his practice of them is not yet proficient Of the tenpāramitās he mainly practices the first pāramitā the almsgiving pāramitā  It is not that he refuses to practice the other nine pāramitās but that he practices them according to his ability and at his discretion BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva makes offerings to Buddhas and teaches and transforms sentient beings as he trains to purify this ground BuddhaSon as an analogy a goldsmith who is skilled in refining gold fires the gold time and again More and more the gold becomes lustrous pure soft and usable Likewise this Bodhisattva makes offerings to Buddhas and teaches and transforms sentient beings in order to purify the ground As he transfers all his roots of goodness to his acquiring  the overall wisdomknowledge they become more and more radiant pure gentle and capable  Preparing for All Ten Grounds  BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abiding on the first ground should tirelessly ask Buddhas  Bodhisattvas and beneficent learned friends about the features and fruit of the first ground because he wishes to complete his training on this ground He should also tirelessly ask them about the features and fruit of each of the next nine grounds because he wishes to complete his training on all ten grounds For each ground this Bodhisattva should know its hindrances and their remedy its formation and destruction its features and fruit its purity and his arrival and departure He should know how to progress from one ground to the next the right or wrong place of each ground the excellent wisdom developed on each ground  each ground is a stage of no regress how to purify and cultivate all these grounds and how finally to enter the wisdom ground of Tathāgatas BuddhaSon a Bodhisattvas wisdomknowledge of the features of each ground is uninterrupted from the first through tenth grounds Because of the radiance of his wisdom developed on all Bodhisattva grounds he acquires the radiance of Tathāgata wisdom BuddhaSon suppose a wise merchant leader plans to take a group of merchants to a big city Before they set off he asks about the roads their advantages and disadvantages the safety and dangers of the stops on the way and the faults of turning back He then prepares for the journey accordingly BuddhaSon before they set off that merchant leader already knows all the safe and treacherous things on the journey He ponders and plans the journey with wisdom and gathers the needed provisions He then takes the group safely to the great city Thus he and his companions are free from anxiety and distress BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva is like that merchant leader Though abiding on the first ground he knows well how to remove the hindrances on all Bodhisattva grounds and how to purify these grounds in order to ascend to the wisdom ground of Tathāgatas Then equipped with great merit and wisdom as provisions he takes all sentient beings across the treacherous wilderness of repeated birth and death to arrive safely in the city of sarvajña Thus he and sentient beings do not undergo tribulations Therefore a Bodhisattva should diligently do excellent pure karmas on all grounds in order to enter the wisdom ground of Tathāgatas BuddhaSon this is a brief description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattva training on the first ground An extensive explanation would include immeasurable boundless hundreds of thousands of asakhyeyas of different things  Becoming the King of Jambudvīpa  BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abiding on the first ground usually becomes the king of Jambudvīpa  Noble and commanding he protects the true

wonderful especially wonderful superb especially superb To all sentient beings I should be leader guide general and teacher I should even be the reliance for those who seek the knowledge of all knowledge  If this Bodhisattva wishes to renounce family life in order to make energetic progress in learning the Buddha Dharma he can relinquish his wife and family life and discard the five desires to head for bodhi following the teachings of Tathāgatas After renouncing family life if he makes energetic progress in one thought he enters  samādhis sees  Buddhas and knows the spiritual power of  Buddhas He can move visit and illuminate  Buddha Lands and teach sentient beings in  Buddha Lands He can live for  kalpas and know all things in  past and future kalpas He can enter the Illumination Door of One Hundred Dharmas It cannot be known by figuring for   or  kalpas or even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  Summarizing Stanzas  Then to restate his meaning Vajra Store Bodhisattva spoke in verse Suppose

respect uprightness and a sense of shame He protects  his faculties He aspires to rescue all sentient beings in the world And to acquire all wisdomknowledge As soon as he enters the first Bodhisattva ground He discards five fears Inability to survive a bad name death The evil lifepaths and the overwhelming presence of multitudes Discarding his fixation on having a self With its belongings This Buddhason Is free from fears Eliciting great lovingkindness and compassion With faith and reverence And the virtue of knowing shame and dishonor He does good dharmas day and night He appreciates the

Their great path Constantly making great vows He vows to undergo the supreme training To bring sentient beings to  maturity And to adorn and purify Buddha Lands He wishes that Buddhasons in All Buddha Lands Have the one mind of equality That their endeavor never goes to waste And that they attain true enlightenment simultaneously  on the tips of all hairs  Such great vows are Immeasurable and boundless as endless as The domain of space the realm of sentient beings The realm of dharmas the realm of nirvāṇa The appearance of Buddhas in all worlds The realm of Tathāgata wisdom and the realm of ones mental objects My vows would end only if Tathāgata wisdom And the three kinds of changes ended As they have no end So my vows have no end Having made such great vows He acquires the gentle mind and the compliant mind He thus has faith in the merits adorning Buddhas Observing the suffering of sentient beings He realizes that everything arises through causes and conditions He then elicits lovingkindness and compassion  These suffering sentient beings I now should rescue To these sentient beings He gives all kinds of alms Giving away his kingship and treasures Elephants horses and vehicles His head eyes hands and feet Even his body blood and flesh He can give away everything as alms Without anxiety or regret He seeks wisdomknowledge from scriptural texts With a tireless mind He

worlds Enters the Illumination Door of One Hundred Dharmas And knows all things in  past and future kalpas He manifests  bodies Each body manifesting  Bodhisattvas as its retinue Through the power of his vows What he can do far exceeds these things and is immeasurable I have described  only briefly In my explanation of the meaning of this ground An extensive explanation Cannot be finished in a koṭi kalpas The supreme Bodhisattva Way Benefits all sentient beings Thus I have finished describing The first ground  Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment fascicle  Translated from the digital Chinese Canon   When Bodhisattvas heard  This superb and wonderful ground  Their minds were purified And they were filled with joy They rose from their seats Jumped up into the open sky And showered down wonderful flowers They praised in unison Very good Vajra Store The fearless one with great wisdom Has well expounded the training of A Bodhisattva on this ground Liberation Moon Bodhisattva Knowing that this multitude had pure minds and Hoped to hear the second ground Requested Vajra Store Bodhisattva I pray that the one with great wisdom Will expound the second ground which All Buddhasons would like to hear  Cultivating Ten Profound Minds  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva told Liberation Moon Bodhisattva BuddhaSon after a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has completed his training on the first ground if he wishes to enter the second ground the TaintFree Ground  he should cultivate ten profound minds What are these ten They are  the magnanimous mind With these ten minds this Bodhisattva enters the second ground  The Ten Good Karmas  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on this TaintFree Ground naturally never kills sentient beings He does not stock weaponry such as knives and clubs nor does he harbor hatred He has a sense of shame and dishonor Kind and forgiving he has lovingkindness for all sentient beings and wants to benefit them This Bodhisattva does not out of malice distress sentient beings much less intentionally kill them knowing that they are sentient beings He naturally never steals anything This Bodhisattva is content with his own assets With lovingkindness and forgivingness toward others he never raids or damages others things When he sees others things he never thinks of stealing them He does not take even a blade grass not given to him much less lifesupporting things This Bodhisattva is satisfied with his own wife and never pursues the wife of another He does not even lust for his wife or concubines or for women under his protection betrothed to his relatives or protected by the law much less actually have sex  much less in a perverted way He naturally never lies This Bodhisattva always speaks truthful and timely words He does not lie even in his dreams He naturally never speaks divisive words This Bodhisattva does not want to divide distress or harm sentient beings He does not say such words to that person to damage this person nor does he speak such words to this person to damage that person He protects a relationship not letting it break and prevents a broken relationship from getting worse He does not wish to divide people nor does he speak divisive words true or false He naturally never speaks abusive words such as vicious words rude words hurtful words angerprovoking words overtly abusive words covertly abusive words coarse words vulgar words distasteful words displeasing words angry words heartburning words feudforming words heated words unlovely words unpleasant words and words that harm others and hence himself Discarding such abusive words he always speaks nurturing words gentle words enjoyable words pleasant words joyful words heartcapturing words elegant words popular enjoyable words popular pleasant words and inspiring words He naturally never speaks suggestive words This Bodhisattva delights in carefully chosen words timely words truthful words meaningful words Dharma words sensible words cogent words and wellconsidered decisive words This Bodhisattva carefully watches himself even when he jokes and laughs to avoid speaking meaningless words  He naturally has no greed This Bodhisattva has no

and sycophancy He has firm faith in the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva protects and upholds the tengood karmas without interruption He thinks Sentient beings go down the evil lifepaths because they have done the tenevilkarmas Therefore I should do the right training and persuade others to do the same Because it is utterly wrong for one to tell others to do the right training while unwilling to do so oneself  The Three Vehicles on the Path of the Ten Good Karmas  BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva next thinks Taking the path of the ten evil karmas causes sentient beings to be reborn as helldwellers animals or hungry ghosts Taking the path of the ten good karmas causes them to be reborn as humans or gods including gods in the highest form heaven  If those who follow the path of the ten good karmas with highgrade purity have narrow and lowly minds fear rebirth in the ThreeRealmsof Existence lack compassion for sentient beings and learn  by hearing it they are called riders of the VoiceHearerVehicle If those who follow the path of the ten good karmas with highgrade purity do so without being taught by others lack compassion for sentient beings lack skillful means for delivering them and realize the profound principle of causality they are called riders of the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle If those who follow the path of the ten good karmas with highgrade purity have a magnanimous mind compassion and skillful means make great vows seek the great wisdom of Buddhas purify and cultivate all Bodhisattva grounds practice all pāramitās and never abandon sentient beings they  will complete wideranging Bodhisattva actions Because they have achieved all kinds of purity they will eventually acquire the TenPowers and the FourFearlessnesses  and master the entire Buddha Dharma Therefore I should do the ten good karmas to achieve purity in everything They are the skillful means a Bodhisattva should learn  Requitals for the Ten Evil Karmas  BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva next thinks Doing the ten evil karmas can cause one to be reborn as a helldweller as a severe requital an animal as a moderate requital or a hungry ghost as a minor requital  The sin of killing can cause a sentient being to be reborn as a helldweller an animal or a hungry ghost If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals a short lifespan and sickliness The sin of stealing can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals poverty and no command of joint assets The sin of sexual misconduct can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals an unfaithful wife and an unruly retinue The sin of lying can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals being slandered and being deceived The sin of divisive speech can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals a disloyal retinue and vile relatives The sin of abusive speech can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals hearing evil sounds and speaking contentious words The sin of suggestive speech can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals rejection of his words and incomprehensibility of his words The sin of greed can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals discontentment and insatiable desire The sin of anger can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals being criticized by others and being incriminated by others The sin of holding the wrong views can cause a sentient being to go down any of the three evil lifepaths If reborn as a human he will receive two requitals a crooked mind and rebirth into a family that holds the wrong views BuddhaSon the path of the ten evil karmas leads to an immeasurable and boundless pile of suffering Therefore this Bodhisattva thinks I should shun this path and take the path of the ten good karmas which is like a Dharma garden I will enjoy my stay there and persuade others to stay there as well  Resolved to Transform Sentient Beings  BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva has lovingkindness compassion and sympathy for all sentient beings and is resolved to benefit them and give them peace and joy He regards them as himself and wants to draw them into the Dharma and to be their protector teacher and great teacher He thinks Sentient beings are pitiable because they are trapped in a dense forest of wrong views evil wisdom evil desires and evil paths I should enable them to abide in the right views and follow the right path  He next thinks All sentient beings differentiate between self and others They harm one another and fight with ceaseless fiery anger I should enable them to abide in the unsurpassed great lovingkindness  He next thinks All sentient beings covet and grasp insatiably They seek wealth and benefits through an evil livelihood I should enable them to make a right livelihood using body voice and mind in a pure way He next thinks Sentient beings are driven by the three poisons  which inflame their other afflictions They do not seek to acquire the skillful means to achieve liberation I should enable them to extinguish the massive fire of their afflictions and to settle themselves in the coolness of nirvāṇa  He next thinks Sentient beings blinded by delusion and wrong views like a thick film  have entered a dense forest of darkness far from the radiance of their innate wisdom They tread treacherous paths in wilderness and hold various wrong views I should enable them to acquire the hindrancefree pure wisdomeye and to know the true reality of dharmas without being taught by others  He next thinks Taking the treacherous path of birth and death sentient beings may go down the evil lifepaths reborn as helldwellers animals or hungry ghosts Fallen into the web of wrong views and lost in the dense forest of delusion they follow evil paths and take evil actions Like the blind without a guiding teacher they mistake the entrance for the exit and enter the domain of māras Captured by bandits they follow the mind of māras and go against the intent of Buddhas I should rescue them from such tribulations and enable them to settle down in the fearless city of  the overall wisdomknowledge  He next thinks Swallowed by torrential waters sentient beings linger in streams of desire existence ignorance and wrong views In the vortex of birth and death they drift in the turbulent river of love unable to make observations Seized by selfview which is like a rakṣasa who wants them to remain forever in the dense forest of love and desire they follow their perception of desire anger and malice Deeply attached to the things they love each of them settles down on its mountain of arrogance and lives in its village of the six faculties They have no one to rescue them I should activate my great mind of compassion and rescue them with my rootsofgoodness enabling them to end their tribulations to leave impurity for purity and to abide on the treasure continent of all wisdomknowledge  He next thinks Sentient beings live in a prison world of pain and distress Filled with love and hate they have anxiety and fear Bound by heavy chains of love and desire lost in the dense forest of ignorance they are repeatedly reborn in the Three Realms of Existence unable to escape on their own I should enable them to transcend the Three Realms of Existence and to abide in the hindrancefree great nirvāṇa  He next thinks Sentient beings are fixated on having a self and none of them seeks to leave its cave of the fiveaggregates Each equipped with the sixfaculties they take the four inverted actions Each bound to the four domains  which are like venomous snakes and driven by the five aggregates which are like bandits they undergo immeasurable suffering I should enable them to abide in the supreme attachmentfree place the hindrancefree supreme nirvāṇa  He next thinks Sentient beings have narrow and lowly minds and fear the highest wisdom path If they wish to leave the world they prefer the VoiceHearer Vehicle or the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle I should enable them to abide in the vast Buddha Dharma and vast wisdom  BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva protects the Bodhisattva precepts in this way and excels in cultivating the mind of lovingkindness and compassion  Training under All Buddhas  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on this TaintFree Ground through the power of his vows comes to see many Buddhas hundreds of Buddhas thousands of Buddhas hundreds and thousands of Buddhas koṭis of Buddhas hundreds of koṭis of Buddhas thousands of koṭis of Buddhas hundreds of thousands of koṭis of Buddhas and even hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas With a magnanimous and profound mind he reveres honors and attends all Buddhas and makes offerings to Them He offers Them lifesupporting things including clothing food and drink beds and bedding and medicine He also makes these offerings to all monks Then he transfers his roots of goodness to his attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi Before every Buddha he vows to accept and do the ten good karmas until his attainment of bodhi never to forget or lose them As an analogy genuine gold refined with alum becomes more lustrous and pure Because for  koṭi nayuta kalpas he shuns stinginess jealousy and the taint of violating the precepts this Bodhisattva fully achieves purity in almsgiving and observance of precepts BuddhaSon of the Four Drawingin Dharmas  this Bodhisattva employs loving words more than the other three dharmas Of the tenpāramitās he practices the second pāramitā the precept pāramitā  more than the other nine pāramitās It is not that he refuses to practice them but that he practices them according to his ability and at his discretion  Becoming a WheelTurning King  BuddhaSon this is a brief description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattva training on the second ground the TaintFree Ground A Bodhisattva abiding on this ground usually becomes a WheelTurningKing a great Dharma master equipped with the seven precious things He has the power to enable sentient beings to stop their stinginess greed and violation of the precepts and has the skillful means to enable them to set off on the path of the ten good karmas He is a great almsgiver who gives alms endlessly As he carries out almsgiving loving words beneficial actions and collaborative work  he constantly thinks of the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha and even of acquiring sarvajñajñāna the knowledge of all knowledge He thinks Among all sentient beings I should be excellent especially excellent wonderful especially wonderful superb especially superb To all sentient beings I should be leader guide general and teacher I should even be the reliance for those who seek the knowledge of all knowledge  If this Bodhisattva wishes to renounce family life in order to make energetic progress he can relinquish his wife and family and discard the five desires After renouncing family life if he makes energetic progress in one thought he enters  samādhis sees  Buddhas and knows the spiritual power of  Buddhas He can move  Buddha Lands and manifest  bodies Each body can manifest  Bodhisattvas as its retinue It cannot be known by figuring for   or  kalpas or even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  Summarizing Stanzas  Then to restate his meaning Vajra Store Bodhisattva spoke in verse Upright gentle and capable With tameness quietness and benevolence This Bodhisattva cultivates the magnanimous mind to transcend repeated birth and death And with the ten profound minds he enters the second ground Abiding on this ground he acquires merit by observing the precepts Shunning killing and harming  Stealing and sexual misconduct As well as using abusive divisive and suggestive speech Not greedy for material wealth he elicits lovingkindness and compassion Walking the right path with an upright mind he is never deceitful or sycophantic Having destroyed his arrogance he is always gentle He acts in accordance with the Dharma never abandoning self restraint As helldwellers and animals undergo myriads of suffering Hungry ghosts spew blazing flames Knowing that their suffering is caused by their sins he thinks I should not follow their paths but should abide in the true Dharma I will be reborn at will as a human And even be reborn in the highest heaven to enjoy the bliss of meditation Riders of the VoiceHearer Vehicle the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle and the Buddha Vehicle Achieve their goals because they take the path of the ten good karmas Pondering in this way he exercises selfrestraint Observes the precepts and teaches others to do the same His sight of sentient beings in suffering Increases his great compassion Ordinary beings and the foolish do not have the right understanding But harbor hatred seek dispute And grasp desire objects never satiated I should enable them to eradicate the three poisons Shrouded by the darkness of delusion They have fallen into the web of wrong views on the treacherous path And are imprisoned in the cage of birth and death I should enable them to annihilate the māras like thieves They are drifting and sinking in the four torrential flows Undergoing immeasurable suffering in the Three Realms of Existence And imagining that they have a self residing in the five aggregates like a house I should diligently train in accordance with the Dharma in order to deliver them They seek to transcend the Three Realms of Existence But choose not to seek the supreme Buddha wisdom because of their lowly minds I should make energetic progress tirelessly And enable them to ride the Mahāyāna A Bodhisattva abiding on this ground accumulates merit He sees innumerable Buddhas and makes offerings to Them all After training for koṭis of kalpas his mind becomes more and more radiant Like genuine gold refined by strong substances A Buddhason abiding on the second ground usually becomes a Wheel Turning King He universally transforms sentient beings by teaching them to do the ten good karmas He trains to do all good dharmas In order to acquire the Ten Powers to rescue all in the world If he wishes to abandon his kingship and wealth He can renounce family life to follow the Buddha Dharma Making energetic progress with bold valor in one thought He enters  samādhis and sees  Buddhas A Bodhisattva on this ground can display All kinds of transcendental powers Through the power of his vows what he can do far exceeds these things As he delivers sentient beings with immeasurable ease He who benefits all in the world Does the supreme Bodhisattva training Thus I have described the virtues of the second ground To Buddhasons  The Third Ground the Radiant Ground  When Buddhasons heard the training on this ground  They realized that the state of a Bodhisattva was inconceivable Reverent and joyful They showered flowers down from the sky as an offering They praised  Very good The wonderful trainings of Bodhisattvas are Really the same without differences To benefit sentient beings Your explanations are the purest We pray that the one to whom gods and humans make offerings Will expound the third ground We hope that you will explain completely The wisdomguided karmas that accord with the Dharma We pray that you will expound the Dharma taught by the Buddha such as almsgiving observance of precepts Endurance of adversity energetic progress meditation and development of wisdom As well as skillful means and the path of lovingkindness and compassion And the pure action vows of a Buddha Then Liberation Moon requested Vajra Store the fearless great one I pray that you will explain how one can enter the third ground And that you will reveal the virtues of such a one with a gentle mind  Cultivating Ten Profound Minds  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva told Liberation Moon Bodhisattva BuddhaSon after a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has purified the second ground if he wishes to enter the third ground the Radiant Ground  he should cultivate ten profound minds What are these ten With these ten minds this Bodhisattva enters the third ground  Observing the True Reality of Saskṛta Dharmas  BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abiding on the third ground observes the true reality of all saskṛta dharmas He sees they are processes that are impermanent painful impure unstable deteriorating and transient undergoing birth and death from moment to moment neither born in the past nor going to the future nor abiding in the present He observes that a sentient being is such a process without reliance or rescue and lives in anxiety sorrow pain and distress Fettered by love and hate it experiences increasing sorrow without a respite In the blazing fire of greed anger and delusion it is bound by its afflictions day and night though they are illusions Based on these observations he loathes saskṛta dharmas He seeks Buddha wisdom because he sees that Buddha wisdom is inconceivable immeasurable unexcelled unadulterated and hard to acquire It frees one from anxiety and distress leads one on the path of no regress to the city of fearlessness and can rescue innumerable suffering sentient beings  Ten Reasons for Eliciting Compassion  This Bodhisattva who has seen the immeasurable benefits of Tathāgata wisdom and the immeasurable faults of saskṛta dharmas elicits compassion for sentient beings for ten reasons What are these ten He activates the mind of compassion because he sees that  sentient beings have no skillful means to achieve liberation These are the ten This Bodhisattva who sees the immeasurable suffering in the realm of sentient beings makes energetic progress  He thinks I should rescue liberate purify and deliver these sentient beings I should put them in a good place and enable them to live in peace and joy to have the right knowledge and views to tame their minds and to attain nirvāṇa  This Bodhisattva who loathes saskṛta dharmas and has compassion for sentient beings knows the excellent benefits of  the knowledge of all knowledge Wishing to rely on Tathāgata wisdom to deliver sentient beings he thinks These sentient beings are in horrendous suffering because of their afflictions What are the skillful means to rescue them and enable them to abide in the ultimate bliss of nirvāṇa  He next thinks The skillful means to enable sentient beings to abide in nirvāṇa are not apart from the hindrancefree liberation wisdom The hindrancefree liberation wisdom is not apart from the realization of the true reality of dharmas The realization of the true reality of dharmas is not apart from the radiant wisdom that dharmas have no birth and no action The radiant wisdom that dharmas have no birth and no action is not apart from the wisdom arising from skillfully chosen observations during meditation The wisdom arising from skillfully chosen observations during meditation is not apart from hearing much of the Dharma  Hearing the Dharma and Training Accordingly  Having learned from his observations this Bodhisattva seeks and learns the Dharma with double diligence Day and night he delights in hearing the Dharma He enjoys treasures follows ponders understands relies on complies with abides in and practices the Dharma As this Bodhisattva diligently seeks the Buddha Dharma he never begrudges his wealth or treasures He does not see anything as valuable or hard to acquire but thinks that a Dharma expounder is hard to encounter Therefore seeking the Buddha Dharma this Bodhisattva can give away as alms all his internal and external wealth There is no reverence that he cannot show no arrogance that he cannot discard no endeavor that he cannot undertake and no toil that he cannot accept If he hears a stanza of the Dharma never heard before his great joy surpasses the joy of acquiring treasures that fill the ThreeThousandLargeThousandfoldWorld and exceeds the joy of becoming a WheelTurning King Why Because if he hears a stanza of the Dharma never heard before he can purify his Bodhisattva training This benefit surpasses that of becoming the godking akra who lives for countless hundreds of thousands of kalpas Suppose someone says to him I have a Dharma sentence spoken by the Buddha which can purify your Bodhisattva training If you jump into a pit of fire to undergo tremendous pain I will give it to you This Bodhisattva thinks If I could purify my Bodhisattva training with a Dharma sentence spoken by the Buddha in order to receive it in person I would even jump from a Brahma heaven down into a massive fire that fills the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World Why should I be deterred by a pit of fire Seeking the Buddha Dharma I should accept even all the suffering in hell not to mention a small pain in the human world  Thus this Bodhisattva makes energetic progress in seeking and learning the Buddha Dharma He makes observations and trains in accordance with the Dharma he has heard Having heard the Dharma meditating in an open place he subdues his mind and thinks One acquires the Buddha Dharma by training according to its teachings One cannot achieve purity merely by talking about the Dharma  Attaining the Four Dhyānas the Four Samādhis and the Four Immeasurable Samādhis  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on the Radiant Ground trains in the four dhyānas of the form realm First he discards all evil dharmas of the desire realm meditates with coarse and fine perceptions and experiences great joy  as he abides in the first dhyāna Then he discards his coarse and fine perceptions purifies his focused mind and experiences exuberant joy  as he abides in the second dhyāna Then he discards the exuberant joy meditates with right mindfulness and experiences superb bliss throughout his body as he abides in the third dhyāna Then he discards the superb bliss and joy and anxiety meditates with a pure mind in equability and experiences neither pain nor pleasure as he abides in the fourth dhyāna  Then he discards all perceptions of form and opposites Without perceptions he enters the Samādhi of Boundless Space  and abides in it Then he exits this samādhi enters the Samādhi of Boundless Consciousness and abides in it Then he exits this samādhi enters the Samādhi of Nothingness and abides in it Then he exits this samādhi enters the Samādhi of Neither with Nor without Perception and abides in it However training in accordance with the Dharma he is not attached to his meditation state BuddhaSon a Bodhisattvas mind follows his lovingkindness which is immeasurable vast and nondual  It has no enemy or opponent no hindrance or distress It pervades everywhere throughout the dharma realm the domain of space and the entire world In the same way his compassion sympathetic joy and equability are immeasurable and vast  Acquiring Transcendental Powers  BuddhaSon such a Bodhisattva has acquired immeasurable transcendental powers He can move the great earth manifest his one body as many bodies and merge them all into one body He can appear or disappear and pass through cliffs or mountains hindrance free as if they were the open sky He can sit crosslegged in the open sky and fly away like a bird He can enter into the ground as if it were water he can walk on the water as if it were the ground He can emit smoke and flames from his body as does a massive pillar of fire he can produce water from his body as do clouds He can touch the sun and the moon in the sky with his hands He has such command of his body even in the Brahma World This Bodhisattva has the godear which is purer than the human ear He can hear the sounds of gods and humans anywhere far or near and even the sounds of insects such as flies and mosquitoes He has telepathic knowledge of sentient beings minds If they have greed he truly knows that they have it If they have discarded their greed he truly knows that they have discarded it He truly knows their minds whether they have anger or have discarded it have delusion or have discarded it have other afflictions or no other afflictions have a small mind a broad mind a magnanimous mind or an immeasurable mind have a restrained mind or an unrestrained mind have a scattered mind or an organized mind have a focused mind or an unfocused mind have a liberated mind or a fettered mind have an aspiring mind or a retiring mind have a tainted mind or an untainted mind have a broad mind or a narrow mind Thus this Bodhisattva has telepathic knowledge of sentient beings minds He has the godeye which is purer than the human eye For every sentient being he sees its birth and death its good or evil body and its good or evil lifepath If a sentient being has done evil body karmas evil voice karmas or evil mind karmas has slandered sages or holies has held the wrong views or has the causes and conditions for karmas induced by the wrong views after death it will definitely go down an evil lifepath reborn in hell If a sentient being has done good body karmas good voice karmas and good mind karmas has never slandered sages or holies has held the right views or has the causes and conditions for karmas induced by the right views after death it will definitely go up a good lifepath reborn in heaven Events such as these this Bodhisattvas godeye truly sees This Bodhisattva can easily enter and exit a dhyāna samādhi or samāpatti However he will not be driven by the power of his meditation to be reborn  Through the power of his will he can choose to be reborn where he can train to complete all elements of bodhi  Training under All Buddhas  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on the Radiant Ground through the power of his vows comes to see many Buddhas hundreds of Buddhas thousands of Buddhas hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and even hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas With a magnanimous and profound mind he reveres honors and attends all Buddhas and makes offerings to Them He offers Them lifesupporting things including clothing food and drink beds and bedding and medicine He also makes these offerings to all monks Then he transfers his roots of goodness to his attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi Under every Buddha he reverently hears the Dharma upholds it and does his best to train accordingly He observes all dharmas and sees that they have neither birth nor death but arise through causes and conditions Then the bondage of the Three Realms of Existencedesire form and formlessand the bondage of ignorance become weak By his not accumulating afflictions for  koṭi nayuta kalpas his greed anger and delusion end and his roots of goodness become more radiant and pure BuddhaSon when one refines genuine gold by skillful means its weight does not decrease but the gold becomes more lustrous and pure Likewise for a Bodhisattva abiding on this Radiant Ground because he does not accumulate greed anger and delusion they end and his roots of goodness become more radiant and pure Also more radiant and pure become his minds such as the adversityenduring mind the gentle mind the congenial mind the pleasant mind the angerfree mind the unwavering mind the clear mind the mind that does not compare high and low the mind that expects no requital the mind that requites kindness the sycophancyfree mind the deceitfree mind and the unbiased mind Of the Four Drawingin Dharmas  he employs beneficial actions more than the other three dharmas Of the ten pāramitās he practices the third pāramitā the endurance pāramitā  more than the other nine pāramitās It is not that he refuses to practice them but that he practices them according to his ability and at his discretion  Becoming the GodKing of the Second Desire Heaven  BuddhaSon this third ground is called the Radiant Bodhisattva Ground A Bodhisattva abiding on this ground usually becomes the godking of the ThirtythreeHeavens  He can use skillful means to enable sentient beings to discard their greed As he carries out almsgiving loving words beneficial actions and collaborative work  he constantly thinks of the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha and even of acquiring sarvajñajñāna the knowledge of all knowledge He thinks Among all sentient beings I should be excellent especially excellent wonderful especially wonderful superb especially superb To all sentient beings I should be leader guide general and teacher I should even be the reliance for those who seek the knowledge of all knowledge  If he makes energetic progress in one thought he enters  samādhis sees  Buddhas and knows the spiritual power of  Buddhas He can move  Buddha Lands and manifest  bodies It cannot be known by figuring for   or  kalpas or even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  Summarizing Stanzas  Then to restate his meaning Vajra Store Bodhisattva spoke in verse Equipped with the pure mind the abiding mind the affliction loathing mind The desirediscarding mind the noregress mind the firm mind the radiant mind The valiant mind the broad mind and the magnanimous mind This wise man enters the third ground A Bodhisattva abiding on this Radiant Ground Observes that saskṛta dharmas are processes impermanent and painful That they are impure deteriorating and transient and That they are fragile neither coming nor going nor abiding He observes that saskṛta dharmas are like a severe illness That is bound up with anxiety sorrow pain and distress The blazing fire of the three poisons  Has never died down since time without a beginning He loathes the Three Realms of Existence completely unattached to them And seeks without second thoughts Buddha wisdom Which is unimaginable inconceivable and unexcelled As well as immeasurable boundless and free from distress Seeing the benefits of Buddha wisdom he pities sentient beings Because they are forlorn without reliance or rescue Burning in the three poisons they are in deprivation Transmigrating in the Three Realms of Existence as if in prison they undergo suffering Bound by their afflictions they are like the eyeless I should make energetic progress in order to rescue them Seeking wisdom in order to benefit sentient beings He ponders what skillful means can enable them to achieve liberation He realizes that such skillful means are not apart from Tathāgatas hindrancefree wisdom Which arises from the wisdom of the no birth of dharmas and That this wisdom comes from hearing the Dharma He ponders this to push himself to be assiduous And hears the Dharma day and night without interruption Holding the Dharma in the highest esteem In reverence of the Dharma This Bodhisattva can relinquish all precious things Such as a kingdom wealth and treasures Wife retinues and kingship He does not think that it is hard to relinquish His head eyes ears nose tongue and teeth His hands feet bone marrow heart blood and flesh He thinks that being able to hear the Dharma is the hardest thing Suppose someone says to this Bodhisattva If you can throw yourself into a pit of fire I will give you the Dharma treasures of Buddhas He will throw himself into the fire with no fear Even if a fire fills the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World He will jump from the Brahma World down into the fire Seeking the Dharma he does not think that this pain is too hard to bear Much less the small pains in the human world From his initial resolve to his attainment of Buddhahood To hear the Dharma he can accept all suffering Even that in Avīci Hell Not to mention the pains in the human world Having heard the Dharma he ponders it in the right way And attains the four dhyānas  and the four samādhis  From which arise the four immeasurable samādhis and the five transcendentalpowers However he will not be reborn under their power A Bodhisattva abiding on this ground sees many Buddhas To whom he makes offerings and from whom he hears the Dharma He is resolved to end his afflictions and purify his mind Like refining gold without losing its substance He usually becomes the godking of TrayastrisaHeaven  He teaches and transforms innumerable sentient beings Enabling them to discard greed abide in goodness And singlemindedly seek

bodies It cannot be known by figuring for   or  kalpas or even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  Summarizing Stanzas  Then to restate his meaning Vajra Store Bodhisattva spoke in verse Having purified the third

One Requested Vajra Store the Fearless One BuddhaSon I pray that you will describe The features of the training on the fifth ground  Cultivating Ten Pure Minds  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva told Liberation Moon Bodhisattva BuddhaSon after a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has completed his training on the fourth ground if he wishes to enter the fifth ground the HardtoConquer Ground  he should cultivate ten pure minds founded on equality What are these ten With these ten pure minds founded on equality this BodhisattvaMahāsattva enters the fifth ground  Acquiring the Mind of No Regress  BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abiding on this HardtoConquer ground acquires the mind of no regress because he excels in training to complete the elements of bodhi and in purifying his profound mind because he seeks higher training because he trains in accord with true suchness because he is supported by the power of his vows because out of lovingkindness and compassion he never abandons sentient beings because he accumulates merit and wisdom to support his attaining bodhi because he trains diligently without rest because he produces skillful means because he studies and understands the higher grounds because he is protected and remembered by Tathāgatas because he is supported by the power of his wisdom  Knowing Various Truths  BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows the FourNobleTruths He truly knows  the path to cessation of suffering He also knows well the worldly truths and the highest truth as well as the truth of appearances differentiations  makeup  events birth ending afflictions and karmic rebirths entering the path to wisdom completing all Bodhisattva grounds in the proper order and acquiring Tathāgata wisdom This Bodhisattva knows the worldly truths because he gives sentient beings happiness according to their preferences He knows the highest truth because he understands the one true reality of all dharmas He knows the truth of appearances because he perceives the appearances of dharmas both the unique and common appearances He knows the truth of differentiations because he perceives the differences among dharmas He knows the truth of makeup because he excels in differentiating a sentient beings five aggregates twelve fields and eighteen spheres He knows the truth of events because he perceives the suffering of body and mind He knows the truth of birth because he observes the continuity of rebirths as lifepaths He knows the truth of ending afflictions and karmic rebirths because he will ultimately end his afflictions He knows the truth of entering the path to wisdom because he realizes the nondual state  He knows the truth of completing all Bodhisattva grounds in the proper order because he correctly observes his mental activities He even knows the truth of acquiring Tathāgata wisdom through the power of his faith understanding and knowledge though not through the power of his ultimate wisdom  Penetrating the Falsity of Saskṛta Dharmas  BuddhaSon having acquired such kinds of wisdomknowledge this BodhisattvaMahāsattva truly knows that all saskṛta dharmas are false and deceptive yet captivating to the foolish Therefore he elicits increased great compassion for sentient beings illuminating them all with its radiance BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva with such power of wisdom always seeks Buddha wisdom and never abandons sentient beings He observes all saskṛta processes from their past to their future as they truly are Because of ignorance and thirsty love of being a sentient being transmigrates through its cycle of birth and death each time trapped in a body composed of the five aggregates which make one aggregate of suffering Apart from a self with its belongings a sentient being is a process with no self no everlasting soul no nurturer  and no entity nothing that can repeatedly assume a body for the next lifejourney from past into future One can end  only if one discards ones greed for all false dharmas and truly knows whether or not one still has any  Training for Merit and Wisdom to Rescue Suffering Sentient Beings  This Bodhisattva thinks Ordinary beings are foolish deluded and pitiable They have no fear of the four domains  which are like four venomous snakes They cannot pull out  the arrow of arrogance and the wrong views They cannot extinguish the fire of greed anger and delusion They cannot dispel the darkness of ignorance They drift with the waves of their perceptions in the ocean of birth and death  BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva next thinks Sentient beings undergo such immeasurable suffering forlorn and distressed They have neither rescue nor reliance neither island nor shelter neither guidance nor sight but are shrouded by their ignorance and enveloped in darkness To rescue all sentient beings I now train for merit and wisdom and train to complete the elements of bodhi I am resolved to go alone without seeking companions I transfer this merit to sentient beings enabling them to achieve ultimate purity and acquire a Tathāgatas Ten Powers and hindrancefree wisdom  BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva develops wisdom and

them in enable them to leave their suffering behind enable them to become pure tame them and enable them to enter parinirvāṇa  Receiving Good Names  BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahasattva abiding on this

spiritual power of  koṭi Buddhas He can move  koṭi Buddha Lands and manifest  koṭi bodies It cannot be known by figuring for   or  kalpas or even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  Summarizing Stanzas  Then to

makeup events birth ending of afflictions entering the path And even acquiring the hindrancefree wisdom of Tathāgatas Although his observations of the truths are wonderful He has not achieved hindrancefree liberation Nevertheless because such observations bring great merit They surpass worldly wisdom Through observations of the truths he knows that saskṛta dharmas Are false and deceptive in nature not firm Carrying some of the radiance of Buddhas lovingkindness and compassion He seeks Buddha wisdom in order to benefit sentient beings He observes saskṛta processes from their past to their future and sees that Sentient beings live in the darkness of ignorance and are fettered by love Each an aggregate of suffering Transmigrating as a process with no self and no everlasting soul they undergo suffering because of love and grasping Unable to find the edge  And that they drift in confusion with no ending in sight I should deliver these pitiable ones The fire of desire blazing in

makes offerings to  koṭi Buddhas And enters  koṭi samādhis and can move  koṭi Buddha Lands Through the power of his vows what he can do far exceeds these things Thus the fifth ground the HardtoConquer Ground Is the supreme true path in the world For the sake of Buddhasons I have explained it through the power of various skillful means Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment Chapter The Ten Grounds   Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Tang Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master ikṣānanda from Yutian   Fascicle     The Sixth Ground the Revealing Ground  After the Bodhisattvas heard the excellent training  As an offering to the Tathāgata they joyfully showered wonderful flowers Emitted pure radiance and scattered precious jewels As they praised Him A multitude of  gods celebrated And showered treasures from the sky They offered the Buddha garlands necklaces banners Jeweled umbrellas and solid perfumes The godking of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven  Together with his retinue joyfully stood in the sky He scattered treasures to form a cloud as an offering And urged Vajra Store BuddhaSon speak at once Innumerable goddessdaughters stood in the sky And praised the Buddha with music and songs All the tones say these words Following the words of the Buddha can remove ones afflictions Dharmas by nature are in nirvāṇa and have no appearance Like the open sky which never differentiates Beyond ones attachment and verbal descriptions They are forever equal and pure  To fully understand the nature of dharmas Ones mind should remain unmoved by  existence or nonexistence Training diligently to rescue all in the world A true Buddhason is born from the Buddhas mouth He gives alms without grasping appearances And faithfully observes the precepts to end all evildoing Understanding that dharmas are harmless he endures adversity Knowing that dharma nature is apart from perception he makes energetic progress He ends his afflictions and practices meditation Whoever has ended his evildoing is called a great man After praising Vajra Store Bodhisattva with a million tones They silently gazed upon the Buddha with reverence Liberation Moon Bodhisattva then asked Vajra Store Bodhisattva Through what training can a Bodhisattva enter the next ground  Ten Reasons for the Equality of Dharmas  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva told Liberation Moon Bodhisattva BuddhaSon after a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has completed his training on the fifth ground if he wishes to enter the sixth ground the Revealing Ground  he should observe that dharmas are equal for ten reasons What are these ten Having observed the equality of all dharmas in their intrinsic purity and accepted it without any objection this Bodhisattva enters the sixth ground the Revealing Ground With a radiant and keen mind he acquires high Endurance in Accord but not Endurance in the No Birth of Dharmas  Repeated Birth and Death and the View of Having a Self  BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva having made these ten observations to be led by his great compassion and to increase it to its fullest then observes the appearances of birth and death in the world He thinks One is repeatedly reborn in the world because one is fixated on  a self If one can end this fixation one will no longer be  reborn  He next thinks Ordinary beings have no wisdom Fixated on a self they follow their perceptions of existence and nonexistence These actions driven by afflictions and grasping increase and accumulate the  seeds in their minds which bring subsequent birth old age and death As ignorance shrouds  karmas are the field and consciousness retains the  seeds Thirsty love  provides the moisture arrogance waters the seeds and the web of wrong views helps them grow The seeds sprout name and form  which develop the six faculties Contact of these faculties with their corresponding objects and consciousnesses produces sensory reception sensory experiences spark love of sense objects Growing love leads to grasping and grasping fuels the karmic force for being When one assumes a body composed of the five aggregates it is called birth When one matures it is called old age When ones life ends it is called death At death driven by the heat of afflictions in the midst of suffering one laments with anxiety and sorrow When such causes and conditions gather there is no gatherer When they naturally dissipate there is no dissipater  In this way this Bodhisattva observes the appearances of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising At death still foolishly attached to life when one feels discomfort in the chest it is called sorrow when one weeps and wails it is called lamentation when one suffers in ones body it is called pain when one suffers in ones mind it is called anxiety Increased pain and anxiety are called distress This process  is like a tree of suffering with no self no belongings no doer and no recipient  He next thinks If there is a doer there must be doings If there is no doer there are no doings According to the highest truth neither doer nor doings can be captured  Encompassed in the Mind  BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva next thinks As all things in the Three RealmsofExistence are encompassed in the mind so too are the TwelveLinksof DependentArising expounded by the Tathāgata Doing Different Karmas  BuddhaSon ignorance does two karmas it causes one to take karmic actions Karmic actions do two karmas they cause consciousness to arise  Consciousness does two karmas it causes ones name and form to arise Name and form do two karmas they produce ones six faculties The six faculties do two karmas they cause contact to arise Contact with an object does two karmas it causes sensory reception to arise Sensory reception does two karmas it causes love  to arise Love does two karmas it causes grasping to arise Grasping does two karmas it fuels the karmic force for being The karmic force for being does two karmas it causes birth to arise Birth does two karmas it causes old age to arrive Old age does two karmas it causes death to arrive Death does two karmas it causes one unconsciously to begin the next life Continuing or Ending Together  BuddhaSon each of these twelve links is thus the condition for the next link to arise from ignorance as the condition for karmic actions to birth as the condition for old age and death because each link leads to the next Conversely if ignorance ends then karmic actions end if birth ends then old age and death end because each link ends with the end of its preceding link Summarized as Three Paths  BuddhaSon among the twelve links ignorance love and grasping until ended are the path of afflictions When one stops differentiating between past and future these three paths end Without a self with its belongings as weak as a bundle of reeds these three paths continue or end Connecting Ones Past Present and Future Lives  The first two links ignorance and karmic actions are the karmic cause produced in ones past life The next five links from consciousness to sensory reception are the karmic fruit received in ones present life Conversely this chain reaction ceases when ending ignorance causes ending of karmic actions Bringing Three Kinds of Suffering  These twelve links bring three kinds of suffering The first five links from ignorance to six sense faculties bring suffering of continuous change in every process The next two links from contact with sense objects to sensory reception bring suffering of pain with a cause Conversely these three kinds of suffering end when ending ignorance causes ending of karmic actions Continuing or Ending through Causes and Conditions  Ignorance causes karmic actions because ignorance leads to karmic actions Conversely ending ignorance causes ending of karmic actions because absence of ignorance leads to absence of karmic actions The same is true for the other links Continuing or Ending Bondage  Because ignorance causes karmic actions the bondage  continues Conversely because ending ignorance causes ending of karmic actions this bondage ends The same is true for the other links Karmic Existence or Its Termination  That ignorance causes karmic actions is an observation of  existence That ending ignorance causes ending of karmic actions is an observation of its termination The same is true for the other links BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva thus observes in the conforming way  and the nonconforming way  the ten features of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising  The Three Liberation Doors Are Revealed  BuddhaSon after observing the ten features of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising this BodhisattvaMahāsattva realizes that a sentient being is empty in nature with no self no everlasting soul no doer and no recipient Then the Liberation Door of Emptiness is revealed to him He next observes that the nature of dharmas is nirvāṇa which is in ultimate liberation with no appearance Then the Liberation Door of No Appearance is revealed to him Then the Liberation Door of No Wish is revealed to him Thus this Bodhisattva enters these ThreeLiberation Doors and discards the perception of self versus others doer versus recipient and existence versus nonexistence  PrajñaPāramitā Is Revealed  BuddhaSon with expanding compassion this BodhisattvaMahāsattva energetically trains to complete all the elementsofbodhi He thinks All saskṛta dharmas arise upon convergences of causes and conditions and perish upon their divergences They cannot arise without convergences of causes of conditions Knowing the multitudinous faults of saskṛta dharmas I should stop their causes and conditions from converging However in order to bring sentient beings to  achievement I would not end any saskṛta processes  BuddhaSon as this Bodhisattva observes saskṛta dharmas with their multitudinous faults he sees that they have no selfessence and have neither birth nor death Eliciting great compassion he never abandons sentient beings Abiding in the radiance of hindrancefree wisdom as he trains to complete the elements of bodhi he does not abide in saskṛta dharmas Although he observes that the nature of saskṛta dharmas is nirvāṇa he does not abide in nirvāṇa because he has not yet completed the elements of bodhi  Entering All Samādhi Doors of Emptiness No Appearance and No wish  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on this Revealing Ground enters ten samādhis the Samādhi of Emptiness That Is and Is Not Separated  Through these ten Samādhi Doors of Emptiness  Samādhi Doors of Emptiness are revealed to him Moreover through ten Samādhi Doors of No Appearance and ten Samādhi Doors of No Wish  Samādhi Doors of No Appearance and  Samādhi Doors of No Wish are revealed to him  Cultivating Ten Minds  BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva abiding on this Revealing Ground next cultivates ten minds BuddhaSon with these minds in accord with Buddha bodhi this Bodhisattva has no fear of nonBuddhist doctrines He enters wisdom grounds never to follow the path of the TwoVehicles He heads for Buddha wisdom undeterred by māras including his afflictions Abiding in the radiance of Bodhisattva wisdom he excels in practicing the Three Samādhis BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on this Revealing Ground does advanced practice of prajñāpāramitā and achieves Endurance in Accord at the third level because he follows the true reality of dharmas without any objection  Training under All Buddhas  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on this Revealing Ground through the power of his great vows comes to see many Buddhas hundreds of Buddhas and even hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas With a vast and profound mind he reveres honors and praises all Buddhas and makes offerings to Them He offers Them lifesupporting things including clothing food and drink beds and bedding and medicine He also makes these offerings to all monks Then he transfers his rootsofgoodness to his attaining the unsurpassed bodhi Under every Buddha he reverently hears the Dharma accepts it and upholds it Then he acquires the Samādhi of True Reality As he trains with the radiance of his wisdom he retains what he has acquired without losing anything He thus acquires the profound Dharma store of Buddhas After  or  kalpas or even  koṭi nayuta kalpas his roots of goodness become more radiant and pure As an analogy genuine gold polished time and again with precious aquamarine becomes more lustrous and pure Likewise as a Bodhisattva abiding on this ground observes dharmas using his applied wisdomknowledge his roots of goodness become more radiant and pure They are in nirvāṇa and are unrivaled  As an analogy moonlight indestructible by the four wind wheels shines on sentient beings bodies cooling them Likewise the roots of goodness of a Bodhisattva on this ground indestructible by the four kinds of māras can extinguish the fire of the afflictions of  koṭi nayuta sentient beings Of the tenpāramitās this Bodhisattva practices the sixth pāramitā the wisdom pāramitā  more than the other nine pāramitās It is not that he refuses to practice them but that he practices them according to his ability and at his discretion  Becoming the GodKing of the Fifth Desire Heaven  BuddhaSon this is a brief description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattva training on the sixth ground the Revealing Ground A Bodhisattva abiding on this ground usually becomes the godking of Nirmāṇarati Heaven  and always does everything with ease He is never at a loss facing the challenging questions raised by voicehearers He can enable sentient beings to destroy their arrogance and to delve into the dependent arising of dharmas As he carries out almsgiving loving words beneficial actions and collaborative work  he constantly thinks of the Buddha the Dharma the Saṅgha and even of acquiring sarvajñajñāna the knowledge of all knowledge He thinks Among all sentient beings I should be excellent especially excellent wonderful especially wonderful superb especially superb To all sentient beings I should be leader guide general and teacher I should even be the reliance for those who seek the knowledge of all knowledge  If this Bodhisattva makes energetic progress in one thought he enters  koṭi samādhis and manifests  koṭi Bodhisattvas as his retinue Through the power of his excellent vows what this Bodhisattva can do with ease far exceeds these things It cannot be known by figuring for   or  kalpas or even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  Summarizing Stanzas  Then to restate his meaning Vajra Store Bodhisattva spoke in verse Having completed his training on the fifth ground This Bodhisattva observes that dharmas have neither selfessence nor appearance With neither birth nor death they have always been pure Beyond ludicrous doctrines and beyond acceptance and rejection Nirvāṇa being their essence they are like illusions Free from differentiation and the duality of existence and nonexistence Making such observations in accord with the nature of dharmas He acquires wisdom and enters the sixth ground With wisdom and high endurance in accord with the Dharma He observes the appearances of birth and death in the world Through the power of ignorance one is born into the world If ignorance ends ones world is no more Although the essence of causes and conditions is emptiness It neither prevents their convergences nor eliminates their false names With no doer no recipient and no perceiver All dharmas are processes that arise like clouds Not knowing the truth  is called ignorance Thoughts and karmas are the fruit of ignorance Arising with consciousness are name and form Which lead to an aggregate of suffering As the Three Realms of Existence rely on the mind So too do the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising As birth and death are produced by the  mind They end if such a mind ends Ones ignorance does two karmas Producing delusion about objects and causing karmic actions As each link from ignorance to old age and death leads to the next link Ones suffering is endless Ignorance is the condition that is hard to end If this condition ends with it end all other conditions Ignorance love and grasping are the path of afflictions The first five links from ignorance to the six faculties bring suffering of continuous change in every process The next two links contact and sensory reception bring suffering of pain with a cause The last five links from love to old age and death bring suffering of deterioration of pleasure If one sees that one has no self the three kinds of suffering end Ignorance is the condition for the bondage of birth and death Ending this condition ends this bondage Because ending the cause that produces the effect ends the effect Based on this observation this Bodhisattva knows that emptiness is the nature  By continuing ones ignorance one continues karmic existence By ending ones ignorance one ends karmic existence As this exists so that exists as this exists not so that exists not Through ten observations his mind is freed from attachment  The twelve successive links for existence are encompassed in the mind Each doing two karmas they are summarized as three paths  Connecting ones past present and future lives they bring three kinds of suffering arising through causes and conditions While continuing the twelve links ensures endless bondage ending them breaks the bondage The chain reaction of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising With neither doer nor recipient Is unreal like illusions dreams and reflections And like mirages pursued by the foolish Through such observations he realizes the emptiness of dharmas And knows that  they have no appearance Understanding their falsity he has no wish  Except for great compassion for sentient beings Knowing that all saskṛta dharmas arise upon convergences of causes and conditions He is resolved to train diligently for bodhi As the Liberation Door of Emptiness leads to more doors So too do the Liberation Door of No Appearance and the Liberation Door of No Wish With his advanced practice of prajñāpāramitā and his Endurance in Accord He fully achieves liberation and acquires wisdom With a profound mind he makes offerings to Buddhas And trains for bodhi in accordance with the Buddha Dharma He thus acquires the Dharma store of Buddhas and expands his roots of goodness which are Like genuine gold polished with aquamarine And like moonlight indestructible by the four wind wheels Cooling all sentient beings A Bodhisattva on this ground transcends the path of māras And can extinguish the fire of sentient beings afflictions He usually becomes the godking of the fifth desire heaven And always teaches sentient beings to destroy their arrogance Whatever he does he does to acquire the knowledge of all knowledge Because he has transcended the path of voicehearers A Bodhisattva on this ground makes energetic progress Enters  koṭi samādhis And sees innumerable Buddhas who are Like the sun in the midsummer sky a Bodhisattva on the sixth ground is Profound wonderful and hard to know Beyond the understanding of voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas BuddhaSon I have expounded it to you  The Seventh Ground the FarGoing Ground  At that time the multitude of gods were filled with joy They scattered treasures to form a cloud in the sky And emitted various kinds of wonderful sounds That praised the purest one  With supreme wisdom You understand the highest meaning And have acquired merit measured by the hundreds thousands and koṭis Like a taintfree lotus flower among men You expound the profound training to benefit all sentient beings In the sky the godking of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven  Emitted great radiance shining on the Buddhas body He also formed a cloud of most exquisite fragrance As an offering to the one who removes anxiety and distress All gods rejoiced And emitted beautiful tones that praised  After hearing the virtues of this ground  We have already received great benefits In joyful celebration Goddessdaughters played ten million kinds of musical tones By the spiritual power of the Tathāgata  In unison the tones said these words His quiet deportment unexcelled He can tame those hard to tame and is worthy of offerings from the world Having transcended the world He walks in the world and reveals the wonderful path Although he manifests countless bodies He knows that in true reality they are empty He skillfully expounds the Dharma with words But is not captivated by the appearances of their sounds He visits hundreds of thousands of worlds And makes splendid offerings to Buddhas With wisdom free from attachment He has no perception of a self or a Buddha Land Although he diligently teaches sentient beings He has no perception of self versus others Although he has cultivated great goodness He is not attached to good dharmas Having seen the blazing fire of greed anger and delusion In  the world He discards such perceptions Elicits great compassion and proceeds with dynamic power After all gods and goddessdaughters Had made all kinds of offerings and completed their praises They fell silent And reverently gazed upon the WorldHonored One hoping to hear the Dharma Then Liberation Moon Bodhisattva requested Vajra Store Bodhisattva The minds of this huge multitude are pure I pray that the Buddhason will describe The features of the training on the seventh ground  Ten Excellent Trainings That Arise from Applied Wisdom  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva told Liberation Moon Bodhisattva BuddhaSon after a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has completed his training on the sixth ground if he wishes to enter the seventh ground the FarGoing Ground  he should do ten excellent trainings that arise from applied wisdom What are these ten First as he practices the Three Samādhisemptiness no appearance and no wishhe elicits lovingkindness and compassion for sentient beings and never abandons them Second as he understands that Buddhas are equal he delights in making offerings to Them all Third as he has entered the wisdom door to observe the emptiness  he diligently accumulates merit Fourth as he has transcended the Three Realms of Existence he adorns them  Fifth as he knows that ones flaming afflictions are in nirvāṇa he teaches sentient beings how to eradicate their afflictions including greed anger and delusion Sixth as he knows that dharmas have no selfessence like illusions dreams reflections echoes mirages conjurations moons in the water and images in the mirror he does countless different karmas according to his mind Seventh as he knows that all Buddha Lands are like the open sky he adorns them with his wonderful pure actions Eighth as he knows that a Buddhas dharma body has no appearance he adorns his body with good appearances Ninth as he knows that Buddha sounds by nature are empty silent and indescribable to communicate with sentient beings he uses various pure sounds Tenth as he has learned from Buddhas that past present and future are but one thought he does training with various features at various times and in various kalpas to suit sentient beings understandings and differentiations  Through these ten excellent trainings that arise from applied wisdom this Bodhisattva ascends from the sixth ground to the seventh ground Because these ten trainings are always present he is said to be abiding on the seventh ground the FarGoing Ground  Entering Immeasurable Realms  BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abiding on this seventh ground enters these realms This Bodhisattva thinks Such immeasurable realms of Tathāgatas cannot be known by figuring for even  koṭi nayuta kalpas I should enter them all with the mind of no effort and no differentiation  BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva observes  as he diligently and persistently does the excellent training that arises from his applied wisdom without even a single moment of rest or laxity Whether he walks stands still sits lies down or even sleeps he continues this resolve never succumbing to any mental coverings  Practicing the Ten Pāramitās  Thought after thought this Bodhisattva practices the ten pāramitās Because each of his thoughts is led by great compassion as he trains in accordance with the Buddha Dharma to head for Buddha bodhi To seek Buddha bodhi he gives sentient beings his roots of goodness as alms because he practices the almsgiving pāramitā  He can end all his afflictions because he practices the precept pāramitā  Led by lovingkindness and compassion he never harms sentient beings because he practices the endurance pāramitā  He unceasingly seeks to do good dharmas because he practices the progress pāramitā  He always maintains awareness of all wisdom paths before him because he practices the meditation pāramitā  He can endure the truth that all dharmas have neither birth nor death because he practices the wisdom pāramitā  He can access immeasurable wisdomknowledge because he practices the skillfulmeans pāramitā  He earnestly seeks the supreme wisdom because he practices the earnestwish pāramitā  He cannot be destroyed by māras or nonBuddhist doctrines because he practices the power pāramitā  He knows all dharmas as they truly are because he practices the wisdomknowledge pāramitā  These are the ten pāramitās that this Bodhisattva fully practices thought after thought Likewise thought after thought he carries out the Four Drawingin Dharmas the Four Supports the Three Liberation Doors and the Thirtyseven Elements of Bodhi Thought after thought he trains to complete all of them  Training to Complete All Elements of Bodhi  Then Liberation Moon Bodhisattva asked Vajra Store Bodhisattva BuddhaSon does a Bodhisattva train to complete all elements of bodhi on the seventh ground only or on all ten grounds  Vajra Store Bodhisattva answered BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva trains to complete all elements of bodhi on all ten grounds However his attainment on the seventh ground is the most outstanding Because on the seventh ground he completes the training that requires effort  and enters the path of wisdom and transcendental powers BuddhaSon on the first ground a Bodhisattva trains to complete the elements of bodhi because he vows to master the entire Buddha Dharma on the second ground he trains to complete the elements of bodhi because he removes his taints on the third ground he trains to complete the elements of bodhi because with expanding vows he acquires dharma illumination on the fourth ground he trains to complete the elements of bodhi because he enters the right path on the fifth ground he trains to complete the elements of bodhi because he follows worldly ways on the sixth ground he trains to complete the elements of bodhi because he enters profound Dharma Doors On the seventh ground he trains to complete the elements of bodhi because the entire Buddha Dharma is revealed to him Because on the first through seventh grounds a Bodhisattva arduously trains to develop his wisdom Using this power on the eighth through tenth grounds he completes his training without effort  Neither with nor without Afflictions  BuddhaSon as an analogy there are two worlds impure and pure It is hard to cross their border except for a Bodhisattva equipped with great skillful means transcendental powers and the power of his will It is hard to cross that border except for a Bodhisattva with great wisdom skillful means and the power of his great vows  Liberation Moon Bodhisattva asked BuddhaSon is the training of a Bodhisattva on the seventh ground impure or pure  Vajra Store Bodhisattva answered BuddhaSon on the first through seventh grounds a Bodhisattvas training is free from karmas driven by his afflictions because he transfers his merit to attaining the unsurpassed bodhi and to walking the path of equality However he has not transcended his afflictions BuddhaSon as an analogy a WheelTurningKing rides his precious elephant to visit the fourcontinents Although he knows those in poverty and suffering he is not tainted by their troubles However he has not transcended the status of a human If he discards his human body is reborn as a god in a Brahma heaven and rides his celestial palace to visit a thousand worlds displaying a Brahma gods radiance and awesome virtue then he has transcended the status of a human BuddhaSon likewise training on the first through seventh grounds a Bodhisattva rides his vehicle of pāramitās to visit the world Although he knows the faults of sentient beings afflictions he is not tainted by them because he travels the right path However he has not transcended actions driven by his afflictions If he completes the training that requires effort ascends from the seventh ground to the eighth ground rides a pure Bodhisattva vehicle to visit the world and remains untainted by the faults of sentient beings afflictions then he has transcended his afflictions BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on the seventh ground transcends many afflictions such as greed but he is said to be neither with afflictions nor without afflictions He is not with afflictions because they are inactive He is not without afflictions because his quest for Tathāgata wisdom has not yet been fulfilled  Entering Great Bodhisattva Samādhis  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on the seventh ground with a profound pure mind does  body karmas voice karmas and mind karmas He has discarded all evil karmas denounced by every Tathāgata and he does all good karmas praised by every Tathāgata Without effort he naturally applies all worldly doctrines and skills that he has acquired on the fifth ground This Bodhisattva is an illuminated teacher in the ThreeThousandLargeThousandfoldWorld His profound mind and wonderful actions are unsurpassed except by those of Tathāgatas and Bodhisattvas on higher grounds All meditations samādhis samāpattis spiritual powers and liberations are revealed to him However these attainments come from training not as karmic

doing immeasurable body karmas voice karmas and mind karmas free from appearances He thus acquires the radiance of Endurance in the Realization of the No Birth of Dharmas  Surpassing Riders of the Two Vehicles  Liberation Moon Bodhisattva asked BuddhaSon even for a Bodhisattva on the first ground have his body voice and mind karmas not already transcended those of riders of the Two Vehicles  Vajra Store Bodhisattva answered BuddhaSon yes they have However it is because of his aspiration to seek the Buddha Dharma not because of the power of his wisdom developed from observation On the seventh ground this Bodhisattvas karmas surpass those of riders of the Two Vehicles because of the power of his wisdom As an analogy a prince is born from the queen into the royal family and he is fully endowed with kingly features As soon as he is born he surpasses all ministers However it is because of the kings power not his own power After he has grown up and completed his training in all areas he surpasses all others because of his own power Likewise as soon as a Bodhisattva resolves to seek the great Dharma he surpasses all voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas However on the seventh ground he surpasses all riders of the Two Vehicles because of the power of his wisdom  Abiding in Nirvāṇa but Not Entering Nirvāṇa  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on this seventh ground goes far and deep and

Bodhisattva asked BuddhaSon on what ground can a Bodhisattva enter the Samādhi of Nirvāṇa  Vajra Store Bodhisattva answered BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva on the sixth ground can enter the Samādhi of Nirvāṇa On the seventh ground thought after thought he can enter or exit this samādhi without entering nirvāṇa Therefore this Bodhisattva is accomplished in inconceivable  body voice and mind karmas and he abides in the true reality of dharmas but does not enter nirvāṇa As an analogy someone sails a ship across the ocean Through the power of his skills and knowledge he averts water disasters Likewise a Bodhisattva on the seventh ground sails the ship of pāramitās across the ocean of true reality Through the power of his vows he does not enter nirvāṇa BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva has acquired this samādhi and the power of wisdom Although he manifests his birth and death by skillful means he abides in nirvāṇa Although he is surrounded by retinues he is not attached to them Although he is repeatedly reborn in the Three Realms of Existence through the power of his vows he is not tainted by worldly ways Although his mind abides in nirvāṇa  by skillful means it still glows though it does not blaze Although he follows Buddha wisdom he may visit the ground of voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas Although he has acquired the Dharma store of Buddhas he may manifest māra states Although he has transcended the path of māras he may display the ways of māras Although he displays nonBuddhist ways he never abandons the Buddha Dharma Although he displays conformity with worldly ways he constantly does supraworldly dharmas Although the magnificent things he does surpass those of Dharma protectors in eight classesgods dragons gandharvas asuras yakṣas garuḍas kinaras and mahoragasand those of humans and nonhumans as well as those of the four godkings  akra  and godkings of Brahma heavens he never abandons his delight in the Dharma  Training under All Buddhas  BuddhaSon this Bodhisattva has acquired great wisdom and abides on this FarGoing Ground Through the power of his vows he comes to see many Buddhas hundreds of Buddhas and even hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas With a magnanimous and superb mind he reveres honors and praises all Buddhas and makes offerings to Them He offers Them lifesupporting things including clothing food and drink beds and bedding and medicine He also makes these offerings to all monks Then he transfers his roots of goodness to his attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi Under every Buddha he reverently hears the Dharma accepts it upholds it and trains accordingly Then he acquires radiant wisdom and the Samādhi of True Reality He protects and upholds the true Dharma of Buddhas and is praised by Them He never flinches from the challenging questions raised by riders of the Two Vehicles With pure enduranceofdharmas he benefits all sentient beings After  koṭi nayuta kalpas his roots of goodness become more superb As an analogy genuine gold adorned with mixed jewels becomes more splendid and lustrous unrivaled by other ornaments Likewise arising from applied wisdom the roots of goodness of a Bodhisattva abiding on this seventh ground become more radiant and pure unrivaled by those of riders of the Two Vehicles BuddhaSon as an analogy sunlight moonlight and starlight are unexcelled and they can dry the muddy puddles in Jambudvīpa Likewise unrivaled by riders of the Two Vehicles a Bodhisattva on this FarGoing Ground can remove sentient beings afflictions like drying muddy puddles Of the ten pāramitās this Bodhisattva practices the seventh pāramitā the skillfulmeans pāramitā  more than the other nine pāramitās It is not that he refuses to practice them but that he practices them according to his ability and at his discretion  Becoming the GodKing of the Sixth Desire Heaven  BuddhaSon this is a brief description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattva training on the seventh ground the FarGoing Ground A Bodhisattva abiding on this ground usually becomes the godking of the sixth desire heaven He excels in teaching sentient beings how to develop true wisdom and enables them to succeed As he does good karmas such as almsgiving loving words beneficial actions and collaborative work  he constantly thinks of the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha and even of acquiring sarvajñajñāna the knowledge of all knowledge He thinks Among all sentient beings I should be excellent especially excellent wonderful especially wonderful superb especially superb To all sentient beings I should be leader guide general and teacher I should even be the reliance for those who seek the knowledge of all knowledge  If this Bodhisattva makes energetic progress in one thought he enters  koṭi nayuta samādhis and manifests  koṭi nayuta Bodhisattvas as his retinue Through the power of his excellent vows what this Bodhisattva can do with ease far exceeds these things It cannot be known by figuring for even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  Summarizing Stanzas  Then to restate his meaning Vajra Store Bodhisattva spoke in verse On the path of samādhi and the highest wisdomknowledge This Bodhisattva has completed his training on the sixth ground He immediately acquires applied wisdom With which he enters the seventh ground As he enters the Three Liberation Doors he elicits lovingkindness and compassion As he understands that Tathāgatas are equal he diligently makes offerings to Them all As he observes the emptiness of dharmas he accumulates merit Thus this Bodhisattva ascends to the seventh ground Having transcended the Three Realms of Existence he adorns them  Having extinguished the fire of afflictions his mind glows  Knowing that dharmas are free from the duality  he diligently does good karmas Understanding that the body  has no appearance he plants the seeds of good appearances He acquires understanding by observing dharmas And widely benefits those who are deluded He enters the boundless realm of sentient beings And does the immeasurable Buddha work of teaching and transforming He can enter worlds dharmas and kalpas And know sentient beings understandings preferences and mental activities Expounding without reservation the ways of the Three Vehicles He teaches and transforms sentient beings As this Bodhisattva diligently seeks the supreme bodhi In motion or stillness he never abandons his applied

is observance of precepts His not harming sentient beings is endurance of adversity His tireless pursuit of goodness is energetic progress His unshakable resolve to attain bodhi is meditation On the fourth ground he enters the bodhi path On the fifth ground he follows worldly ways On the sixth ground his wisdom that dharmas have no birth shines forth On the seventh ground he fully acquires the merit required for bodhi And makes all kinds of great vows As if between two worlds  He is like a WheelTurning King who though untainted by the world Has not yet transcended the status of a human Only on the eighth wisdom ground Does a Bodhisattva transcend his mental states Then he is like the godking of a Brahma heaven who has transcended the status of a human And like a lotus flower which rises above the water untainted Although his afflictions are inactive His yet unfulfilled quest for Buddha bodhi means that he is not without afflictions He masters all worldly knowledge and skills And understands worldly texts and theories Through training he is accomplished in Meditation samādhi and transcendental powers A Bodhisattva training on the seventh ground Surpasses riders of the Two Vehicles Unlike a Bodhisattva on the first ground who relies on his vows He is like a prince who has fully developed his power With such profound attainment he continues to head for bodhi His mind in nirvāṇa he does not enter nirvāṇa Like someone sailing a ship across the ocean But not drowned in the water No one in the world can understand The merit he acquires by taking actions with applied wisdom As he makes offerings to many Buddhas he mind becomes more radiant Like genuine gold adorned with mixed jewels A Bodhisattva on this ground has radiant wisdom Like sunlight that can dry the water of ones love  He usually becomes the godking of the sixth desire heaven And always teaches and guides sentient beings to acquire true wisdom If he makes energetic progress he enters many samādhis and sees many Buddhas Numbering  koṭi nayuta Through the power of his vows what he can do with ease far exceeds these things This is the FarGoing Bodhisattva Ground The pure path of wisdom and skillful means No god human voicehearer Or Pratyekabuddha in the entire world can know it  Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment fascicle  Translated from the digital Chinese Canon    The Eighth Ground the Motionless Ground  At that time the godking  and the multitude of gods Were delighted to have heard the excellent training  As an offering to the Tathāgata And innumerable great Bodhisattvas They showered down flowers banners canopies Fragrances chaplets necklaces and exquisite garments In countless millions of varieties All adorned with jewels Goddessdaughters played celestial music Emitting various wonderful tones As an offering to the Buddha and Buddhasons They praised in unison with these words The allseeing one the most honored one among gods and humans Out of compassion for sentient beings displayed his spiritual power Enabling us to hear the wonderful tones of Various kinds of celestial music On the tip of a hair there are worlds as numerous as The dust particles in  koṭi nayuta worlds Where reside innumerable Buddhas Who expound the wondrous Dharma Inside each pore  there are countless worlds Each containing four continents and  immense oceans Which encircle Mount Sumeru and are encircled by the iron mountain range  All worlds are not crowded  On the tip of a hair there are the six lifepaths Three evil ones  Which are taken by sentient beings such as gods asuras humans and dragons As requitals for their karmas In each of these worlds there is A Tathāgata who emits wondrous sounds Turning the supreme pure Dharma wheel According to sentient beings minds Each world contains sentient beings with different bodies And each body contains various worlds Sentient beings that take different lifepaths such as gods and humans are different And their Buddha knows all their differences and expounds the Dharma to them At His thought a big world changes into a small one And a small world changes into a big one Then with great joy all fell silent And singlemindedly gazed upon the Buddha hoping to hear His teachings Then Liberation Moon Bodhisattva requested Vajra Store Bodhisattva All in this multitude are now quiet I pray that you will describe The features of the training on the eighth ground  Acquiring the Foremost Endurance  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva told Liberation Moon Bodhisattva BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva on the seventh ground excels in cultivating applied wisdom purifying his actions and training to complete the elements of bodhi He excels in purifying his profound mind and thoughts and acquires merit and wisdom He elicits great lovingkindness and great compassion and never abandons sentient beings He enters the path to immeasurable wisdom and realizes the true reality of all dharmas seeing that as always they have no birth no arising no appearance no formation no destruction no ending and no change Having no selfessence they are equal before during and after   All Efforts of Body Voice and Mind Are No Longer Needed  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva who has acquired this endurance immediately enters the eighth ground the Motionless Ground  and becomes a Bodhisattva of profound action whose attainment is hard to know He has left behind all differentiations appearances perceptions and attachments No voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha can compare with him All mental noises having ended quietness is revealed to him As an analogy a bhikṣu with transcendental powers is in command of his mind He enters samādhi one after another into  the Samādhi of Total Halt during which all mental activities such as thinking memory and differentiation come to a halt Likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abiding on the Motionless Ground leaves behind all training that requires effort His body voice and mind remaining motionless he has acquired the effortless way as requital for past effort As an analogy someone dreams of swimming across a wide river He applies bold valor and skillful means which wake him up Upon waking all his efforts come to an end Likewise this Bodhisattva who is resolved to rescue sentient beings in the four torrential flows summons bold valor and makes energetic progress Because of these efforts he reaches the Motionless Ground Upon arrival all his efforts come to an end and the two trainings and all perceptual activities are no longer in motion BuddhaSon for someone reborn as a god in the Brahma World desirerealm afflictions no longer arise in him For this BodhisattvaMahāsattva even the Bodhisattva mind the Buddha mind the bodhi mind and the nirvāṇa mind no longer arise much less the worldly mind  Seven Guiding Instructions from All Buddhas  BuddhaSon for a Bodhisattva on this ground because of the power of his original vows all BuddhaBhagavāns appear before him and give him Tathāgata wisdom enabling him to enter the Dharma stream They say these words Very good Very good Good man this Endurance  is foremost in accord with the Buddha Dharma However you have not yet acquired a Buddhas Ten Powers Four Fearlessnesses and Eighteen Exclusive Dharmas To acquire these abilities you should make energetic progress and never abandon this door of endurance Moreover good man although you have attained nirvāṇa and achieved liberation ordinary beings have not done so All kinds of afflictions arise in them and all kinds of perceptions drive them You should pity them Moreover good man you should remember your original vows to benefit all sentient beings and enable them to enter the inconceivable wisdom door Moreover good man whether or not a Buddha appears in the world dharma nature ever abides without change Buddhas are called Tathāgatas not solely on account of their realization of the changelessness of dharma nature because riders of the TwoVehicles too can realize that dharma nature has no differentiation Moreover good man you should observe our sublime physical appearances immeasurable wisdom countless Buddha Lands countless skillful means immeasurable radiance immeasurable purity and immeasurable sounds Moreover good man you now have acquired just one kind of dharma illumination  all dharmas have no birth and no difference Good man a Tathāgatas dharma illumination includes countless entrances countless ways and immeasurable variations which cannot be known by figuring for  koṭi nayuta kalpas You should train to acquire such illumination Moreover good man you should observe in the tendirections the differences among countless worlds innumerable sentient beings and immeasurable dharmas You should know these things as they truly are  BuddhaSon BuddhasBhagavāns thus give this Bodhisattva countless wisdomproducing doors enabling him to do various karmas guided by wisdom  Doing WisdomGuided Karmas without Effort  BuddhaSon if Buddhas did not give this Bodhisattva wisdomproducing doors he would immediately enter nirvāṇa and give up doing karmas to benefit sentient beings However because Buddhas give him countless boundless wisdomproducing doors his wisdomguided karmas that arise in one thought surpass his karmas done since his initial resolve  by training through the first seven grounds By comparison the latter karmas are less than one hundredth one thousandth one hundredthousandth one koṭith one nayutath one asakhyeyath and one kalā of the former or less than the former karmas by any analogy calculation or upaniṣad  measure Why BuddhaSon because this Bodhisattva who began his training with one body is now on this eighth ground Using the motionless way he manifests innumerable bodies emits countless sounds acquires immeasurable wisdom manifests innumerable births visits countless pure worlds teaches innumerable sentient beings makes offerings to innumerable Buddhas enters countless Dharma Doors masters immeasurable transcendental powers attends assemblies in countless different bodhimaṇḍas does immeasurable body voice and mind karmas and does all Bodhisattva training BuddhaSon as an analogy someone wants to sail a ship across the ocean Before entering the ocean he expends a great deal of effort  After he has entered the ocean he sails away with the wind without using human power The distance he covers in one day surpasses the distance he would travel for one hundred years to get to the ocean BuddhaSon likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva develops great rootsofgoodness and gathers abundant provisions in order to sail the ship of Mahāyāna in the ocean of great wisdom which is sailed by all Bodhisattvas Using his wisdomknowledge of effortlessness in one thought he enters the realm of  knowledge of all knowledge He cannot achieve this in  koṭi nayuta kalpas by doing training that requires effort  Acquiring the Differentiating WisdomKnowledge of All Things  BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva abiding on this eighth ground uses his great applied wisdom to do effortless training in observing all things in the realm of all wisdomknowledge He observes the formation of a world the

the desire realm the form realm and the formless realm as well as their destruction He also knows the appearances of the desire realm the form realm and the formless realm such as small large immeasurable and diverse Thus he acquires the differentiating wisdomknowledge for observing the ThreeRealmsofExistence  Manifesting Different Bodies to Teach Sentient Beings  BuddhaSon this

godking protectors of the world the godking akroDevānāmIndra  Brahma gods gods from pure abode heavens the godking Maheśvara  and godsons thought If this Bodhisattva has such wisdom and transcendental

transcendental powers have fallen into a web of doubts Benevolent One to resolve their doubts please show a few magnificent things as a demonstration of a Bodhisattvas spiritual power  Then Vajra Store Bodhisattva immediately entered the Samādhi of the Essence of All Buddha Lands during which all Bodhisattvas and all others in the huge multitude saw themselves inside Vajra Store Bodhisattvas body They saw a bodhi tree with the circumference of  ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Worlds the height of a million ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Worlds and branches and leaves that could shade a koṭi ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Worlds Matching the trees measurements was a lion throne on which sat a Buddha called All Wisdom and Power King All in this huge multitude saw this Buddha sitting

Liberation Bodhisattva asked BuddhaSon if a Bodhisattvas transcendental powers can produce such great outcomes what about a Buddhas transcendent powers  Vajra Store Bodhisattva answered BuddhaSon as an analogy someone takes a small chunk of dirt from a world with four continents and asks Which is bigger the dirt in the boundless world or this chunk of dirt Your question is similar A Tathāgatas wisdom is boundless and matchless How can it be compared with a Bodhisattvas Moreover the chunk of dirt taken from the fourcontinent world is small while the rest of the dirt there is immeasurable In countless kalpas I can describe only a small part of the wisdom and transcendental powers of a Bodhisattva on this Dharma Cloud Ground much less those  on the Tathāgata Ground BuddhaSon I now use examples to help you understand the attainments of a Tathāgata BuddhaSon suppose in each of the ten directions there are Buddha Lands as numerous as the dust particles in countless worlds Each Buddha Land is filled with Bodhisattvas on this ground who are as numerous as sugar canes rice plants bamboos reeds forests and hemp The wisdom developed by these Bodhisattvas after training on the

realm the wisdomknowledge that pervades all worlds the wisdomknowledge that illuminates all worlds the wisdomknowledge to think of all sentient beings with lovingkindness and even the wisdomknowledge of all knowledge Of the tenpāramitās he practices the tenth pāramitā the wisdomknowledge pāramitā  more than the other nine pāramitās BuddhaSon this is a brief description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattva

especially superb To all sentient beings I should be leader guide general and teacher I should even be the reliance for those who seek the knowledge of all knowledge  If he makes energetic progress in one thought he enters samādhis as numerous as the dust particles in a million koṭi nayuta worlds and manifests as his retinue Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in those worlds Through the power of his excellent vows what this Bodhisattva can do with ease far exceeds these things His spiritual training faith understanding adornments karmas bodies words radiance faculties sounds and actions cannot be known by figuring for even  koṭi nayuta kalpas  The Ten Grounds   The Ten Grounds Compared to the Ten Mountains  BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva does his training on the Ten

Dharma Door Because one must hear this virtuous Dharma Door that leads to the knowledge of all knowledge in order to have faith and understanding accept and uphold it and train accordingly Then one will arrive at the ground of knowledge of all knowledge  Then through the spiritual power of the Buddha as the way things naturally are in the ten directions worlds as numerous as the dust particles

Buddha Lands Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in ten koṭi Buddha Lands came to this assembly They said Very good very good Vajra Store Bodhisattva you have well expounded the features of

own worlds through the spiritual power of the Tathāgata we expound this Dharma Door Our assemblies equal this assembly and the words and meanings we pronounce are the same as those pronounced here

together with Vairocana Tathāgata they all had taken Bodhisattva actions to develop their rootsofgoodness  Seeking to See Samantabhadra Bodhisattva  Then Universal Eye BodhisattvaMahāsattva through the spiritual power of the Buddha rose from his seat bared his right shoulder and knelt his right knee on the floor Joining his hands he asked the Buddha WorldHonored One I have some questions to ask the Tathāgata the SamyakSabuddha May I have Your permission  The Buddha answered You may ask any questions you wish I will answer them to make you happy  Universal Eye Bodhisattva asked How many samādhis are attained by Samantabhadra Bodhisattva and Bodhisattvas who constantly carry out his universally worthy action vows How do they enter exit or abide in their great samādhis If a Bodhisattva excels in entering and exiting inconceivable great samādhis he achieves command of all samādhis and displays transcendental powers without rest  The Buddha answered Very good Universal Eye you ask about these meanings to benefit past present and future Bodhisattvas Samantabhadra Bodhisattva who is rarely encountered is here now He has achieved inconceivable command of transcendentalpowers surpassing all other Bodhisattvas He is born from immeasurable Bodhisattva actions He has purified his great Bodhisattva vows and his actions never regress He has acquired immeasurable pāramitā doors dhāraṇī doors and eloquence doors all of which are pure and hindrance free Through the power of his original vows he tirelessly benefits all sentient beings with great compassion throughout the endless future You should ask him to describe his samādhi mastery and liberation  When the Bodhisattvas in the assembly heard Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas name they immediately attained countless inconceivable samādhis and their minds became quiet motionless and hindrance free Their wisdom vast and immeasurable and their profound state unexcelled they all saw innumerable Buddhas present before them and acquired the powers of Tathāgatas With the same Tathāgata nature they clearly saw into past present and future They acquired endless merits and full transcendental powers With reverence for Samantabhadra Bodhisattva these Bodhisattvas longed to see him They looked all around the assembly but could see neither him nor his seat This was caused by the Tathāgatas spiritual power as well as by Samantabhadras transcendental power Then Universal Eye Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One where is Samantabhadra Bodhisattva now  The Buddha answered Universal Eye Samantabhadra Bodhisattva is now amid the multitude in this bodhimaṇḍa He is near where I am and has not moved  Then Universal Eye and the other Bodhisattvas again scanned the assembly in this bodhimaṇḍa looking for him everywhere They said to the Buddha WorldHonored One we still cannot see Samantabhadra Bodhisattva or his seat  The Buddha said Indeed Good men why can you not see him Good men because Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas attainment is profound and indescribable He has acquired the boundless wisdom door and entered the Samādhi of a Lions Thrust He has achieved unsurpassed command of uses  and entered the pure and hindrancefree state He produces a Tathāgatas Ten Powers uses the dharma realm as his body and receives the protection and concern from all Tathāgatas In one thought he can access the differentiationfree wisdomknowledge of past present and future Buddhas That is why none of you can see him  Upon hearing the Tathāgatas description of Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas pure virtues Universal Eye Bodhisattva attained  asakhyeya samādhis Using the power of samādhi he again scanned everywhere anxious to see Samantabhadra Bodhisattva Yet he still could not see him nor could the other Bodhisattvas Then Universal Eye Bodhisattva rose from his samādhi and said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I entered  asakhyeya samādhis seeking to see Samantabhadra but still could not see him Nor could I perceive his body and body karmas his voice and voice karmas or his mind and mind karmas Nor could I see his seat or his place  The Buddha said Indeed indeed Good man know that Samantabhadra Bodhisattva abides in the power of inconceivable liberation Universal Eye what is your opinion Can anyone describe the places of the illusions given in a book of magic  No no one can  The Buddha said Universal Eye if even the appearances of illusions cannot be described how can anyone enter and see Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas secret states of body voice and mind Why not Because Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas attainment is profound inconceivable immeasurable and beyond measure In all Samantabhadra Bodhisattva with his vajra wisdom enters everywhere in the dharma realm but neither walks nor abides in any world He knows that neither coming nor going the bodies of sentient beings  are no body He has achieved command of indestructible and differentiationfree transcendental powers With no reliance no action and no motion he has reached the ultimate edge of the dharma realm Good man whoever comes to see Samantabhadra Bodhisattva hear his name attend him ponder his teachings think of him elicit faith in  and acquire an understanding of it make observations seek or find the right directions or make vows endlessly will receive benefits His effort will never be futile  Then Universal Eye and the other Bodhisattvas who admired Samantabhadra Bodhisattva and longed to see him said Namo Samantabhadra Bodhisattva Three times they spoke these words as they bowed their heads down to the floor Then the Buddha told Universal Eye Bodhisattva and the other Bodhisattvas in the assembly BuddhaSons you all should bow to Samantabhadra and earnestly beseech him You should also intently observe in the tendirections visualize Samantabhadra appearing before you and think that he is everywhere in the dharma realm With profound faith and understanding you should discard everything and resolve to make the same action vows as Samantabhadras To enter into the truth that dharmas are nondual  to manifest bodies in all worlds to know sentient beings diverse capacities and to collect the universally worthy ways everywhere If you make such a great vow you will come to see Samantabhadra Bodhisattva  Following the Buddhas words Universal Eye and the other Bodhisattvas all made prostrations beseeching to see the great one Samantabhadra  Appearance of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva  Then Samantabhadra Bodhisattva using the transcendental power of liberation responded by revealing his body He enabled all Bodhisattvas there to see that he was near the Tathāgata and was seated on a lotus flower amid the Bodhisattvas They also saw him coming from where all Buddhas were in other worlds They also saw him in places where all Buddhas were expound all Bodhisattva actions indicate the path of  the knowledge of all wisdomknowledge explain all Bodhisattva transcendental powers differentiate the awesome virtues of all Bodhisattvas and manifest as all past present and future Buddhas Upon seeing these spiritual displays Universal Eye Bodhisattva and the other Bodhisattvas felt exuberance and great joy in their hearts They all bowed down to Samantabhadra Bodhisattva with great respect as if seeing all Buddhas  in the ten directions Then through the awesome spiritual power of the Buddha the power of faith and understanding of the Bodhisattvas and the power of the original vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva from  kinds of clouds the sky rained down flowers chaplets incense powdered incense canopies garments ornaments jewels burning incense and colorful fabrics Countless worlds quaked in six different ways Celestial music played and was heard in countless distant worlds Vast radiance illuminated countless worlds purifying them all ending the three evil lifejourneys and enabling innumerable Bodhisattvas to begin their universally worthy actions to complete their universally worthy actions and to fulfill their universally worthy action vows and attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Then Universal Eye Bodhisattva said to the Buddha WorldHonored One Samantabhadra Bodhisattva is one who abides in great awesome virtues in being unequaled in being unexcelled in having  no regress in the equality  in indestructibility in differentiated dharmas in

the door of Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas action vows the wishfulfilling door of keen transcendental powers the door of eloquence and total retention  the door of differentiating past present and future dharmas the door of all Buddhas appearances in worlds the door of establishing all sentient beings in sarvajña the door of purifying all worlds by a Buddhas spiritual power If a Bodhisattva enters these samādhis he acquires the endless power of the dharma realm and walks across the open sky hindrance free He acquires with immeasurable ease the position of a Dharma king like being enthroned in

Using applied wisdomknowledge he manifests attainment of Buddhahood but continues to train endlessly on the Bodhisattva Way He abides in the overall wisdomknowledge and uses skillful means to display various great transcendental powers Therefore Samantabhadra you should expound in detail the ten great samādhis of all Bodhisattvas All in this assembly wish to hear you  The First Great Samādhi the Samādhi of Universal Radiance  Then Samantabhadra Bodhisattva at the Tathāgatas command looked upon Universal Eye and the other Bodhisattvas and said BuddhaSon what is a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas Samādhi of Universal Radiance A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi has endless wisdomknowledge of ten dharmas What are these ten BuddhaSon these are called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas  ten dharmas BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva activates ten boundless minds What are these ten They are  the boundless mind to manifest various bodies with ease and enter the assemblies in all Tathāgatas bodhimaṇḍas These are the ten BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva has the wisdomknowledge to enter this samādhi in ten different ways What are these ten These are the ten BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva has ten kinds of useful wisdomknowledge to enter this great samādhi What are these ten Fifth in each small world he manifests  koṭi bodies Sixth each body enters hundreds of koṭis of ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Worlds Seventh in each small world contained in those Worlds he manifests hundreds of koṭis of Bodhisattvas training for bodhi Eighth through training each Bodhisattva acquires hundreds of koṭis of clear understandings All manifested bodies are neither one nor many and enter and exit this samādhi without any confusion BuddhaSon for example the asuraking Rahula has a body  yojanas tall and can manifest a body  yojanas tall Rising above the ocean the top half of this body is as tall as Mount Sumeru BuddhaSon an asuraking has greed anger and delusion as well as arrogance However even he can manifest bodies not to mention a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has a deep understanding that mental activities are like illusions all things in the world are like dreams the appearances of Buddhas in worlds are like reflections all worlds are like manifestations and spoken words and other sounds are like echoes When he sees seemingly real dharmas he uses them as his body He knows that all dharmas are inherently pure and that body and mind have no substance As his body everywhere abides in an immeasurable state he uses the vast radiance of Buddha wisdom to do all trainings for bodhi BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi transcends the world and has no attachment to it Nothing can disturb him and no one can surpass him For example as a bhikṣu visualizes the impurities inside his body he sees his body filled with impurities Likewise as a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abiding in this samādhi observes his dharma body he sees all worlds entering his body Although he clearly sees in his body all worlds and their adornments he has no attachment to them BuddhaSon this is a description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas first great samādhi the Samādhi of Universal Radiance and his useful wisdomknowledge  The Second Great Samādhi the Samādhi of Wondrous Radiance  BuddhaSon what is a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas Samādhi of Wondrous Radiance In each world he manifests bodies as numerous as the dust particles in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World Each body emits beams of light as numerous as the dust particles in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World Each beam displays colors as numerous as the dust particles in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World Each color illuminates worlds as numerous as the dust particles in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World and tames sentient beings as numerous as the dust particles in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World This Bodhisattva knows all these worlds and their differences such as impurities purities causes formations continuations radiant colors and comings and goings As this Bodhisattva enters all these worlds likewise they enter his body Yet they do not become chaotic and their various adornments are not destroyed BuddhaSon as an analogy the sun rises revolves around Mount Sumeru and shines on the seven treasure mountain ranges which encircle Mount Sumeru The sun shines on these seven treasure mountain ranges and casts its reflection in each ocean between every two mountains As the sun shining on the seven treasure mountain ranges casts its reflections in the seven oceans these reflections shine on the seven treasure mountain ranges One can say that the sun rises at the seven treasure mountain ranges or the seven oceans One can also say that the sun enters the seven treasure mountain ranges or the seven oceans However there are no boundaries between the suns appearances and its reflections They have neither substance nor no substance They neither abide in the mountain ranges nor are apart from them they neither abide in the water nor are apart from it BuddhaSon likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this great Samādhi of Wondrous Radiance destroys neither the established worldly dharmas nor their appearances He abides neither inside nor outside the world He neither differentiates nor destroys the appearances of worldly dharmas He observes that all dharmas abide in the one appearance of no appearance but do not lose their own appearances He abides in truesuchness of dharma nature never leaving it BuddhaSon as an analogy a magician versed in the art of illusion performs tricks at crossroads He changes the present day or moment into a day or a night seven days or seven nights a half month or a whole month a year or a hundred years He can conjure up things at will such as cities villages springs streams rivers seas the sun the moon clouds rains palaces and houses The long duration of the conjured years does not destroy the actual day or moment and the short duration of the actual day or moment does not preclude the conjured days months or years As the conjurations appear the actual time scale is not destroyed Likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this great Samādhi of Wondrous Radiance manifests an asakhyeya worlds that enter one world Each of these worlds has earth water fire and wind  and is complete with various adornments such as oceans mountains cities villages gardens houses and palaces of gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras and mahoragas Each world comprises the desire realm the form realm and the formless realm  as well as the small thousandfold world and the large thousandfold world Sentient beings receive requitals for their karmas as they die in one place and are reborn in another place Each world has its time scales such as a moment a day and a night a half month a whole month a year a hundred years the formation kalpa and the destruction kalpa Each world can be an impure land a pure land a vast land or a small land Buddhas appear in pure Buddha Lands and are surrounded by Bodhisattvas in their assemblies Buddhas display commanding spiritual powers and teach and transform sentient beings Wherever a world is it is filled with innumerable sentient beings in diverse shapes making different lifejourneys These sentient beings are innumerable countless and inconceivable Through the power of their past present and future pure karmas immeasurable treasures appear This Bodhisattva manifests all such things When he enters one world he sees all things clearly When he enters all worlds using his endless wisdomknowledge he observes ponders and knows all things as they truly are The multiplicity of worlds does not destroy a single world and the singularity of a world does not destroy multiple worlds Why Because this Bodhisattva knows that every dharma has no self he is called one who enters no lifespan and no action Because he trains in having no contention in the world he is called one who abides in having no self Because he truly sees that all bodies arise from conditions he is called one who abides in being no sentient being Because he knows that all dharmas undergoing birth and death arise through causes and conditions he is called one who abides in being no pudgala  Because he knows that all dharmas are equal  he is called one who abides in having no intention to be reborn and abides in having no mānava  Because he knows that all dharmas are quiet by nature he is called one who abides in nirvāṇa Because he knows that all dharmas have the one appearance  he is called one who abides in making no differentiations Because he knows that the dharma realm has no differentiated dharmas he is called one who abides in inconceivable dharmas Because he diligently trains to acquire all skillful means to tame sentient beings he is called one who abides in great compassion BuddhaSon thus this Bodhisattva can put an asakhyeya worlds into one world know the various differences among sentient beings see innumerable Bodhisattvas each setting off on the Way observe that innumerable Buddhas appear everywhere see that each Tathāgata expounds the Dharma which is accepted by Bodhisattvas and see himself training amid them However he does not leave this place to see that place nor does he leave that place to see this place There is no difference between his body there and his body here because both are in the dharma realm He diligently makes observations without rest and never abandons his wisdom which never regresses As an analogy when a magician performs tricks in an actual place his conjured place does not destroy the actual place and his conjured day does not destroy the actual day Likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva manifests a world where there is no world and manifests the disappearance of an existing world He manifests sentient beings where there is no sentient being and manifests the disappearance of existing sentient beings He manifests forms where there is no form and manifests the disappearance of existing forms How things were before does not disrupt how they appear later how things appear later does not disrupt how things were before This Bodhisattva knows that all worldly dharmas are like illusions Knowing that dharmas are illusory he knows that knowledge is illusory Knowing that knowledge is illusory he knows that karmas are illusory Knowing that knowledge and karmas are illusory he acquires the wisdomknowledge of illusion An illusion is not displayed outside a place and a place is not outside an illusion Likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva does not enter a world from outside the open sky nor does he enter the open sky from outside a world Because there is no difference between the world and the open sky As he abides in the world so too he abides in the open sky A BodhisattvaMahāsattva in the open sky can see and do diverse magnificent karmas in the world In one thought he can know countless worlds in formation or destruction as well as the succession of kalpas In one thought he can manifest countless kalpas without lengthening that thought A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who acquires the wisdomknowledge of inconceivable liberation from illusions arrives at the opposite shore Abiding in the understanding of illusion he enters worldly illusions and ponders that all dharmas are illusory Not going against the illusory world he applies his wisdomknowledge of illusion He knows that past present and future are but illusions and that the mind is boundless As Tathāgatas abide in the wisdomknowledge of illusion with Their minds in equability likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all worldly things are illusory With no fixation on having a self and its belongings he has no attachment to any place When a magician performs tricks he does not live with his conjurations nor is he captivated by them Likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all dharmas are already on the opposite shore He does not need to calculate in order to enter dharmas nor does he become confused by them This is a description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas second great samādhi the Samādhi of Wondrous Radiance and his useful wisdomknowledge  Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment fascicle  Translated from the digital Chinese Canon    Chapter b  The Ten Samādhis Continued   The Third Great Samādhi the Samādhi of the Transcendental Power to Go to All Buddha Lands   BuddhaSon what is a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas Samādhi of the Transcendental Power to Go to All Buddha Lands A Bodhisattva passes countless worlds in the east and passes worlds as numerous as the dust particles in those worlds In all worlds passed he enters this samādhi He enters it for a kṣaṇa or a moment or again and again for one fourhour period whether morning midday afternoon evening midnight or postmidnight for one day or five days for a half month or a whole month for one year or   or  years for one koṭi or  koṭi years or  nayuta koṭi years for one kalpa or  or  kalpas or  nayuta koṭi kalpas for countless kalpas measureless kalpas boundless kalpas unequaled kalpas uncountable kalpas indefinable kalpas inconceivable kalpas immeasurable kalpas ineffable kalpas or ineffably ineffable kalpas A Bodhisattva enters this samādhi for a long or short time but does not differentiate between them With no attachment he does not identify dharmas as dual or nondual or by their general or particular features Though making no differentiations when he skillfully uses his transcendental power to rise from this samādhi he never forgets anything experienced As an analogy the sun moves incessantly day and night After sunrise it is called day after sunset it is called night Day is not the suns birth and night is not its death Likewise in countless worlds a Bodhisattva enters this Samādhi of Transcendental Power during which he clearly sees countless worlds BuddhaSon this is a description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas third great samādhi the Samadhi of the Transcendental Power to Go to All Buddha Lands and his useful wisdomknowledge  A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi knows that the number of Buddhas equals that of sentient beings and sees Buddhas more numerous than the dust particles in an asakhyeya worlds To every Tathāgata he makes all kinds of offerings such as choice incense wonderful flowers canopies as immense as an asakhyeya Buddha Lands superb adornments that surpass those in all worlds fabulous treasures ornaments that decorate the places for walking meditation countless stores of superb jewels excellent objects of offering collected from all Buddha Lands by using his spiritual power and superb food and drink like those manifested through a Buddhas spiritual power which surpass celestial food and drink To every Tathāgata with reverence and veneration he bows his head and prostrates himself on the ground He asks questions about the Buddha Dharma praises the equality of Buddhas and extols Their vast merits In the place of every Buddha He enters into the great compassion that Buddhas enter into and acquires the hindrancefree power that Buddhas equally have In one thought in all places where Buddhas are he diligently seeks the wondrous Dharma He knows that appearances such as a Buddhas being born into the world and His entering parinirvāṇa cannot be captured As an unfocused mind discerns objects it is not concerned about what conditions cause it to rise or fall Likewise this Bodhisattva never differentiates appearances such as a Buddhas being born into the world and His entering parinirvāṇa It stays neither on land nor in the water It is neither existent nor nonexistent neither good nor bad neither clear nor unclear neither pure nor impure It has neither substance nor no substance neither taste nor no taste Because of certain conditions a mirage appears like water as perceived by ones consciousness Likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva does not try to capture the appearances of a Tathāgatas being born into the world and His entering parinirvāṇa A Buddhas appearance and disappearance are differentiations of the mind BuddhaSon this samādhi is called Samādhi of Pure and Profound Mental Abilities If a BodhisattvaMahāsattva enters this samādhi when he rises from it he does not lose it As an analogy someone awakes from his sleep and remembers his dream Although the things in his dream are not present in his waking state he remembers them and does not forget them Likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva enters this samādhi sees Buddhas and hears the Dharma After he rises from this samādhi he remembers everything He uses what he has learned to enlighten multitudes in all bodhimaṇḍas and to adorn all Buddha Lands He achieves a clear understanding of the immeasurable meanings and tenets  purifies all Dharma Doors lights the torch of great wisdom grows the Buddha seeds achieves fearlessness acquires endless eloquence and expounds the teachings in the profound Dharma store This is a description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas fourth great samādhi the Samādhi of Pure and Profound Mental Abilities and his useful wisdomknowledge  The Fifth Great Samādhi the Samādhi of the Knowledge of the Store of Past Adornments  BuddhaSon what is a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas Samādhi of the Knowledge of the Store of Past Adornments A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi can know the appearances of past Buddhas This means that he knows successive worlds in successive kalpas successive kalpas of successive worlds successive appearances of Buddhas in successive kalpas Their successive expounding of the Dharma during Their successive appearances Their changing preferences for Their successive expounding of the Dharma Their successive faculties that empowered Their changing preferences Their successive taming  using Their successive faculties Their successive lifespans for Their successive taming  and successive koṭis of nayutas of years of Their successive lifespans BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva systematically acquires boundless wisdomknowledge Therefore he knows past Buddhas past worlds past Dharma Doors past kalpas past dharmas past minds past understandings past procedures past sentient beings past afflictions and past purities BuddhaSon this samādhi is also called the Samādhi of the Store of Past Purities In one thought he can enter   or  kalpas or  koṭi nayuta kalpas can enter countless kalpas measureless kalpas boundless kalpas unequaled kalpas uncountable kalpas indefinable kalpas inconceivable kalpas immeasurable kalpas ineffable kalpas or ineffably ineffable kalpas BuddhaSon when a BodhisattvaMahāsattva enters this samādhi he neither destroys the present nor depends on the past BuddhaSon when he rises from this samādhi he receives ten blessings with nectar poured on his head by Tathāgatas As he acquires them is purified by them achieves them enters them realizes them fulfills them and keeps them he truly knows the purity of a Buddhas three wheels  What are these ten First his explanations do not contradict his statements Second he endlessly expounds the Dharma Tenth he masters the wondrous Dharma When a BodhisattvaMahāsattva rises from this samādhi he immediately receives these blessings from Tathāgatas without interruption when a kalala  enters the womb in one thought its consciousness comes to life Likewise when a BodhisattvaMahāsattva rises from this samādhi in one thought he receives these ten blessings BuddhaSon this is a description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas fifth great samādhi the Samādhi of the Store of Past Adornments and his useful wisdomknowledge  The Sixth Great Samādhi the Samādhi of the Store of Wisdom Light  BuddhaSon what is a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas Samādhi of the Store of Wisdom Light A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi can know all Buddhas in all future worlds in all future kalpas though They have or have not been identified have or have not received the prophecy of Buddhahood He knows Their various names such as countless names measureless names boundless names unequaled names uncountable names inconceivable names immeasurable names and ineffable names They will appear in worlds benefit sentient beings become Dharma kings do Buddha work explain its benefits praise goodness expound the meanings of white  karmas purify evils abide in virtues reveal the highest truth  enter the position to receive blessings with nectar poured on their heads and acquire  the overall wisdomknowledge These Tathāgatastobe will do perfect training make perfect vows acquire perfect wisdomknowledge be followed by perfect multitudes be equipped with perfect adornments accumulate perfect merits master the perfect Dharma harvest perfect fruit acquire perfect physical appearances and attain perfect enlightenment He knows everything about Them such as Their clans and family names skillful means displays of transcendental powers bringing of sentient beings to  maturity and entrance into parinirvāṇa In one thought this Bodhisattva can enter one kalpa or   or  kalpas or  koṭi nayuta kalpas or kalpas as numerous as the dust particles in Jambudvīpa  a world comprising four continents a small thousandfold world a medium thousandfold world or a large thousandfold world He can enter kalpas as numerous as the dust particles in one Buddha Land  Buddha Lands or  koṭi nayuta Buddha Lands in countless Buddha Lands measureless Buddha Lands indefinable Buddha Lands inconceivable Buddha Lands immeasurable Buddha Lands ineffable Buddha Lands or ineffably ineffable Buddha Lands Thus this Bodhisattva has the wisdomknowledge of all worlds in all future kalpas Because of this wisdomknowledge his mind enters ten retention doors What are these ten First entering the retention door of Buddhas he receives the protection and concern of Buddhas as numerous as the dust particles in an ineffable number of Buddha Lands Second entering the retention door of the Dharma he acquires the radiance of ten dhāraṇīs of endless eloquence Third entering the retention door of action he makes excellent and perfect vows Fourth entering the retention door of power he becomes unsurpassed and insuperable Fifth entering the retention door of wisdomknowledge he carries out the Buddha Dharma hindrance free Sixth entering the retention door of great compassion he turns the pure Dharma wheel of  no regress Seventh entering the retention door of skillful differentiation of words he turns the wheel of words and purifies the ground of all Dharma Doors Eighth entering the retention door of a lions birth he opens the locks on the Dharma and leaves the mire of desires Ninth entering the retention door of the power of wisdom he trains on the Bodhisattva Way without rest Tenth entering the retention door of a good friends power he enables all sentient beings to achieve purity Eleventh entering the retention door of the power to abide nowhere he enters ineffably ineffable kalpas Twelfth entering the retention door of the power of the Dharma with his hindrancefree applied wisdom he knows that all dharmas are inherently pure BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi skillfully abides in ineffably ineffable kalpas and worlds He skillfully knows ineffably ineffable kinds of sentient beings their ineffably ineffable different appearances their ineffably ineffable same or different karmic requitals and their ineffably ineffable energetic progresses capacities habits different actions and pure and impure thoughts He skillfully knows the various meanings of the ineffably ineffable Dharma countless words and spoken expressions He skillfully knows the ineffably ineffable appearances of Buddhas in worlds including Their clans timings physical appearances teachings Buddha work and entering of parinirvāṇa BuddhaSon as an analogy at sunrise one with eyes can see all kinds of things in the world such as villages cities palaces houses mountains lakes birds animals woods flowers and fruits BuddhaSon the impartial sunlight enables ones eyes to see various appearances Likewise the essence of this great samādhi is impartiality Free from making differentiations it enables a Bodhisattva to know  koṭi nayuta different appearances that are ineffably ineffable BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva with such wisdomknowledge enables sentient beings to benefit from ten kinds of nonemptiness What are these ten First the nonemptiness of views enables sentient beings to develop roots of goodness Second the nonemptiness of hearing  enables them to come to  maturity Third the nonemptiness of abiding  enables them to tame their minds Fourth the nonemptiness of initiative enables them to do what they say they will do in order to understand the meanings of the Dharma Fifth the nonemptiness of action enables them to purify countless worlds Sixth the nonemptiness of staying close to  enables them in the places of Tathāgatas in ineffably ineffable Buddha Lands to end their ineffably ineffable doubts Seventh the nonemptiness of wishing enables them to make excellent offerings in order to fulfill their wishes Eighth the nonemptiness of skillful means enables them to abide in the pure wisdomknowledge of hindrancefree liberation Ninth the nonemptiness of pouring Dharma rains motivates him to reveal skillfully the overall wisdomknowledge to sentient beings with ineffably ineffable capacities enabling them to walk the path to Buddhahood Tenth the nonemptiness of appearances motivates him to manifest countless appearances to illuminate all sentient beings BuddhaSon when a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi uses these ten kinds of nonemptiness godkings come to bow to him dragonkings spread great clouds of fragrance yakṣakings bow their heads down at his feet asurakings respectfully make offerings to him garuḍakings surround him Brahmakings come to beseech him kinarakings and mahoragakings praise him gandharvakings stay close to him and human kings attend him and make offerings to him BuddhaSon this is a description of a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas sixth great samādhi the Samādhi of the Store of Wisdom Light and his useful wisdomknowledge  The Seventh Great Samādhi the Samādhi of the Knowledge of Buddha Adornments in All Worlds  BuddhaSon what is a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas Samādhi of the Knowledge of Buddha Adornments in All Worlds Buddhason why is this samādhi called Knowledge of Buddha Adornments in All Worlds He can enter all worlds and see Buddhas there and Their spiritual powers playful deeds vast virtues supreme freedom lions roar actions various adornments and displays of spiritual power He also sees assemblies of Bodhisattvas and their purity magnificence oneappearance many appearances locations places docility  maturity and awesome virtues He clearly sees all these He also sees that the size of those assemblies equals that of Jambudvīpa  a world comprising four continents a small thousandfold world a medium thousandfold world or a ThreeThousandLarge ThousandfoldWorld He also sees that those assemblies fill  koṭi nayuta or an asakhyeya Buddha Lands fill Buddha Lands as numerous as the dust particles in  or  Buddha Lands or  koṭi nayuta Buddha Lands fill Buddha Lands as numerous as the dust particles in countless Buddha Lands measureless Buddha Lands boundless Buddha Lands unequaled Buddha Lands uncountable Buddha Lands indefinable Buddha Lands inconceivable Buddha Lands immeasurable Buddha Lands ineffable Buddha Lands or ineffably ineffable Buddha Lands He also sees Buddhas in assemblies held in Their bodhimaṇḍas manifesting transcendental powers various appearances shapes times worlds changes adornments enterprises and control This BodhisattvaMahāsattva also sees himself present in those assemblies and sees himself expounding the Dharma accepting and upholding every Buddhas words knowing well the dependent arising of dharmas standing in the open sky and abiding in his dharma body free from attachment differentiation and weariness He also sees himself entering all wisdomknowledge knowing all meanings  entering all grounds  making all lifejourneys knowing all skillful means standing before all Buddhas and entering all powers truesuchness no contention and all dharmas As he sees such things he does not differentiate among worlds among sentient beings among Buddhas or among dharmas and he has no attachment to bodies body karmas minds or mindsets As an analogy although dharmas do not differentiate their natures or the sounds  they do not lose their natures or names Likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva abandons neither his actions nor the ways of the world but he has no attachment to either of them BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva sees a Buddhas immeasurable colorful radiance and His immeasurable physical appearances which are perfectly formed and equally pure He clearly sees each and every feature He sees a Buddhas body with all kinds of radiance a Buddhas body with a halo one yojana across or a Buddhas body in boundless pure colors golden reddish blue or the color of wonderful light a full sun a vajra or a great blue jewel

radiance pervading the dharma realm illuminating all in the dharma realm and enabling all to acquire unsurpassed wisdom He sees that a Buddhas body has no taints or hindrances and is sublime and pure BuddhaSon although this Bodhisattva sees a Buddhas body in different sizes His body does not become larger or smaller As an analogy as the open sky does not diminish in a worm hole in a mustard seed it does not expand in countless worlds Likewise a Buddhas body does not become larger when seen large nor does it become smaller when seen small BuddhaSon as an analogy the moon does not become smaller when people in Jambudvīpa see it small nor does it become larger when people living on the moon see it large Likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi follows the pleasures of his mind As he sees Buddhas manifest various appearances hears Them expound the Dharma and accepts Their teachings and remembers them each Tathāgatas body neither increases nor decreases As an analogy when someone is about to be reborn he see pure things because he is not apart from his mind Likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva sees pure things because he is not apart from this profound samādhi BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi achieves ten kinds of swiftness What are these ten BuddhaSon this BodhisattvaMahāsattva also acquires ten Dharma seals to endorse all dharmas What are these ten BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has the door of skillful means to know Buddha adornments in all worlds is one with no teacher Untaught by another he masters the entire Buddha Dharma on his own He is a man who can enlighten all sentient beings He is a pure one who knows that the mind is innately pure He is a foremost one who can deliver all in the world He is a comforter who can open all sentient beings minds He is a settler who enables whose who have not abided in the Buddha charactertype to abide in it He is a true knower who enters the door of the overall wisdomknowledge He is one without second thoughts who does not speak contradictory words He is one who abides in the Dharma store and vows to master the entire Buddha Dharma He is a pourer of Dharma rains which benefit sentient beings according to their preferences BuddhaSon as an analogy the godking akra has an extraordinary jewel placed on his topknot Through the power of this jewel his awesome light becomes more radiant When he acquired this jewel he acquired ten dharmas that surpass those of all other gods in the Thirtythree Heavens  What are these ten His ten dharmas surpass those of all other gods in the Thirtythree Heavens Likewise when a BodhisattvaMahāsattva attains this samādhi he acquires the store of ten kinds of vast wisdomknowledge What are these ten BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in this samādhi also acquires a pure body with ten most pure and awesome virtues What are these ten First to illuminate ineffably ineffable worlds it emits ineffably ineffable orbs of radiance Second to purify all worlds it emits ineffably ineffable orbs of radiance in innumerable colors Third to tame sentient beings it emits ineffably ineffable orbs of radiance Fourth to stay close to all Buddhas it manifests ineffably ineffable bodies Fifth to attend and make offerings to all Buddhas it showers down ineffably ineffable kinds of wonderful fragrances and flowers like clouds Sixth to attend and make offerings to all Buddhas and to tame all sentient beings it emits ineffably ineffable kinds of music from each of its pores Eighth to ask all Buddhas  in the tendirections who assume various names questions about the Dharma it takes one step to go to ineffably ineffable worlds Ninth to enable sentient beings to know that what they see and hear is not empty it manifests ineffably ineffable kinds of pure physical bodies Tenth to reveal secret dharmas to sentient beings it emits ineffably ineffable kinds of sounds and words BuddhaSon a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has a body with these ten pure and awesome virtues can enable sentient beings to accomplish ten things What are these ten BuddhaSon after a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has enabled sentient beings to accomplish these ten things he does ten kinds of Buddha work for them What are these ten First to bring sentient beings to  maturity he does Buddha work using sounds Second to tame them he does Buddha work using shapes and forms Third to purify them he does Buddha work with mindfulness Fourth to enable them to leave the evil lifepaths he does Buddha work by shaking the world Fifth to enable them not to lose mindfulness he does Buddha work using skillful awareness Sixth to enable them to abide in right mindfulness he does Buddha work by appearing in their dreams Seventh to draw in all sentient beings he does Buddha work by emitting vast radiance Eighth to enable them to abide in excellent vows he does Buddha work as he trains on the Bodhisattva Way Ninth to enable them

BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has ten endurances If he acquires these ten endurances he arrives on the ground of all Bodhisattvas hindrancefree endurance and masters the entire Buddha Dharma hindrance free What are these ten They are  endurance in skylikeness All past present and future Buddhas have pronounced do pronounce and will pronounce these ten endurances  The First Endurance the Endurance in the Sounds  BuddhaSons what is meant by a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in hearing the sounds It means that when he hears the Dharma pronounced by Buddhas he is neither shocked nor

the Endurance in IllusionLikeness  BuddhaSons what is meant by a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in illusionlikeness BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all dharmas are like illusions because they arise through causes and conditions Through one dharma he understands many dharmas through many dharmas he understands one dharma Knowing that dharmas are like illusions this Bodhisattva fully understands worlds sentient beings and the dharma realm He fully understands the equality of dharmas in the world the equality of Buddhas appearing in worlds and the equality of the three time frames  He displays various transcendental powers and produces manifestations An illusion is neither an elephant nor a horse neither a chariot soldier nor a foot soldier neither a man nor a woman neither a boy nor a girl neither a tree nor a leaf neither a flower nor a fruit neither earth nor water neither fire nor wind neither day nor night neither the sun nor the moon neither a half month nor a whole month neither one year nor a hundred years neither one kalpa nor many kalpas neither stable nor unstable neither pure nor impure neither same nor different neither wide nor narrow neither many nor few neither measurable nor immeasurable neither coarse nor fine An illusion is none of these Various things are not an illusion an illusion is not various things However an illusion can appear to be various things This BodhisattvaMahāsattva observes that all worlds are like illusions such as the world of karmas the world of afflictions the world of Buddha Lands the world of dharmas the world of time frames the world of lifejourneys the world of formations  the world of destructions  the world of actions and the world of fabrications When he observes that all worlds are like illusions he sees that sentient beings worlds and dharmas have neither birth nor death He sees neither that the past can be differentiated nor that the future has the act of arising nor that the present can abide in a thought He neither observes nor grasps at bodhi He sees neither the appearance nor the parinirvāṇa of a Buddha He sees neither his abiding in great vows nor his entering the

BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in miragelikeness BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all dharmas in the world are like mirages A mirage has neither directions nor locations It is

them and fully realizes their true reality This is called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas fifth endurance the endurance in miragelikeness  The Sixth Endurance the Endurance in DreamLikeness  BuddhaSons what is meant by a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in dreamlikeness BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all dharmas in the world are like dreams A dream has neither birth nor death It is neither impure nor pure neither of nor not of the world neither in the desire realm nor in the form realm nor in the formless realm Yet it appears This BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all dharmas in the world are the same as dreams without any difference because they have the nature and appearances of a dream As does a dream they have no selfessence and through ones perceptions entertain ones delusions differentiations and attachments They come to nothing like being awakened from a dream This is called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas sixth endurance the endurance in dreamlikeness  The Seventh Endurance the Endurance in EchoLikeness  BuddhaSons what is meant by a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in echolikeness BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva hears the Dharma expounded by Buddhas observes dharma nature trains for spiritual attainment and arrives at the opposite shore He knows that all sounds are like echoes neither coming nor going yet appearing BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva understands that a Tathāgatas sounds come from neither inside nor outside nor both Although he knows that sounds come from neither inside nor outside nor both he skillfully speaks like an echo arising through conditions not contradicting dharma nature and enables sentient beings to achieve understanding that suits their kind and to train and learn accordingly For example the godking akras queen an asuradaughter is named akrī As her one tone encompasses a thousand tones she does not need to think in order to voice such tones Likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva enters the realm of no differentiation skillfully voices tones that suit different kinds of sentient beings and constantly turns the Dharma wheel in countless worlds He is well able to observe all sentient beings and using his wideranging and farreaching tongue expounds the Dharma with hindrancefree sounds that reach everywhere in worlds in the ten directions enabling the hearers to hear different teachings according to their needs Although he knows that sounds have no birth he emits sounds everywhere Although he knows that there is nothing to expound he widely expounds teachings in wonderful tones which equally enable different kinds of sentient beings to achieve different understandings through their intellect This is called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas seventh endurance the endurance in echolikeness  The Eighth Endurance the Endurance in ReflectionLikeness  BuddhaSons what is meant by a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in reflectionlikeness BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva neither is born nor dies in the world He is neither inside nor outside the world neither the same as nor different from the world neither coming nor not coming to the world neither abiding nor not abiding in the world He is neither worldly nor supraworldly neither real nor unreal He neither walks nor does not walk in the world neither trains in Bodhisattva actions nor abandons his great vows Although he carries out the teachings of the entire Buddha Dharma he still can have many worldly accomplishments He neither follows the worldly stream nor abides in the Dharma stream As an analogy the sun the moon men women houses mountains and forests can cast their reflections in water oil crystal or a clear mirror A reflection neither flows away in a river nor sinks in a pond or well However observers know that a particular reflection appears in a particular place not elsewhere Objects far from and near a medium can cast their reflections which are neither far nor near as are the objects themselves This BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all his and others states are states of wisdom He does not perceive himself and others as dual objects However he can simultaneously appear everywhere in his world and other worlds A seed does not contain roots stems branches or leaves but it can grow these things Likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva can use skillful means to identify nondual dharmas as dual hindrance free This is called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas eighth endurance the endurance in reflectionlikeness A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has acquired this endurance can appear in all Buddha Lands in the ten directions though he does not actually travel to them He neither leaves one place nor arrives at another place Like reflections that appear everywhere his actions are hindrance free He enables sentient beings to see different bodies appear to be as solid as the world However such differences are no difference because there is no barrier between differences and no difference This Bodhisattva is born from the Tathāgata charactertype and his body voice and mind are hindrance free Therefore he can acquire a pure body with countless physical appearances  The Ninth Endurance the Endurance in ManifestationLikeness  BuddhaSons what is meant by a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in manifestationlikeness BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that all dharmas in the world are like manifestations This means that all sentient beings mind karmas are like manifestations because they arise from perceptions all actions in the world are like manifestations because they arise from differentiations all pains and pleasures are like manifestations because they arise from delusion and attachments all dharmas in the world are like manifestations because they are shaped by words all afflictions and differentiations are like manifestations because they arise from thinking taming sentient beings is like a manifestation because it displays the purity of no differentiation ones past present and future lives are like manifestations because they are equal in their no birth the power of a Bodhisattvas vows is like a manifestation because it arises from his vast spiritual training a Tathāgatas great compassion is like a manifestation because it is displayed by skillful means turning the Dharma wheel by skillful means is like a manifestation because the Dharma is expounded with wisdom fearlessness and eloquence Thus this Bodhisattva knows that the worldly and the supraworldly are like manifestations His wisdomknowledge  which arises from his realization of things as they truly are is vast boundless effortless and true It cannot be changed by wrong views or corrupted even when following the worldly ways It neither circulates in the world nor leaves the world It is tied to neither one place nor many places It is neither measurable nor immeasurable neither tiring nor ceasing nor untiring or unceasing It is neither ordinary nor holy neither impure nor pure neither alive nor dead neither wise nor foolish neither seen nor unseen neither relying on the world nor entering the dharma realm neither quickwitted nor dullwitted neither grasping nor not grasping neither sasāra nor nirvāṇa neither existent nor nonexistent Thus this BodhisattvaMahāsattva uses skillful means to walk in the world and train on the Bodhisattva Way He knows the worldly ways and manifests copies of his body With no attachment to the world he has no attachment to himself because he does not differentiate between the world and himself He neither abides in nor leaves the world neither abides in nor separates from dharmas Because of his original vows he neither abandons even one sentient being nor tames only a few sentient beings He neither differentiates nor does not differentiate dharmas He knows that dharma nature has neither comings nor goings Although dharmas are like manifestations neither existent nor nonexistent he is equipped with the Buddha Dharma BuddhaSons when a BodhisattvaMahāsattva abides in his endurance in manifestationlikeness he can complete the bodhi path of Buddhas and benefit sentient beings This is called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas ninth endurance the endurance of manifestationlikeness If a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has acquired this endurance whatever he does is like a manifestation Like a manifested person he has neither reliance on any Buddha Land nor attachments in the world nor does he differentiate the teachings of the Buddha Dharma Yet he heads for Buddha bodhi without idling or tiring and trains in Bodhisattva actions without holding any inverted views Although he has no body he manifests all bodies BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva is called a liberated one because he does not rely on any dharma he is called a subduer because he has discarded all faults he is called one with transcendental powers because without motion or change he enters all assemblies of every Tathāgata he is called one with no regress because he has acquired endurance in his realization that dharmas have no birth he is called a hindrancefree one because he has acquired all powers and because even Mount Sumeru and the iron mountain range cannot hinder him  The Tenth Endurance the Endurance in SkyLikeness  BuddhaSons what is meant by a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas endurance in skylikeness BuddhaSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that the entire dharma realm is like the open sky because it has no appearance the whole world is like the open sky because it has no birth all dharmas are like the open sky because they are nondual  the actions of all sentient beings are like the open sky because all actions are no action all Buddhas are like the open sky because they are no different all powers of Buddhas are like the open sky because they are no different all meditations are like the open sky because past present and future are equal all teachings pronounced are like the open sky because they are beyond words all bodies of Buddhas are like the open sky because they have no attachments and no hindrances Thus this Bodhisattva uses the apt analogy of the open sky to understand that all dharmas are nonexistent BuddhaSons when this BodhisattvaMahāsattva uses his enduring wisdomknowledge of skylikeness to understand all dharmas he acquires a skylike body and body karmas a skylike voice and voice karmas and a skylike mind and mind karmas As the open sky relied upon by all dharmas has neither birth nor death likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas dharma body has neither birth nor death As the open sky is indestructible likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas wisdom and powers are indestructible As the open sky though relied upon by the whole world itself relies on nothing likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva though relied upon by all dharmas himself relies on nothing As the open sky with neither birth nor death can sustain the whole world with births and deaths likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva with neither aspirations nor attainments can reveal his aspirations and attainments inspiring the world to train for purity As the open sky with neither directions nor reaches can allow boundless directions and reaches likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva with neither karmas nor karmic requitals can manifest various karmas and karmic requitals As the open sky neither moving nor abiding can display various splendors likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva neither walking nor standing still can differentiate among all actions As the open sky neither a form nor not a form can display various forms likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva in neither a worldly nor a supraworldly form can manifest all forms As the open sky born neither a long time nor a short time ago can abide for a long time and display all things likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva born neither a long time nor a short time ago can abide for a long time and display all Bodhisattva actions As the open sky neither pure nor impure is not separate from the purities and impurities of worlds likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva neither with nor without hindrances is not separate from hindrances and no hindrances The open sky has all worlds appearing there but to it their appearances are no appearance Likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has all dharmas appearing before him but to him their appearances are no appearance As the open sky enters everywhere and has no boundaries likewise a BodhisattvaMahāsattva enters all dharmas and his mind has no boundaries Why Because whatever this Bodhisattva does is like the open sky His training his purities and his attainments are equal in one essence one flavor and one kind measuring like the open sky and with purity pervading everywhere Thus he observes all dharmas but does not differentiate them purifies all Buddha Lands perfects his body that relies on nothing and knows all directions without confusion He acquires powers that cannot be destroyed acquires all boundless virtues reaches the depths of dharmas and achieves all pāramitās He sits in all vajra seats voices all  tones that suit the hearers kind and turns the Dharma wheel for the whole world at the right times This is called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas tenth endurance the endurance in skylikeness A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has acquired this endurance acquires a body that does not come because it does not go acquires a body with no birth because it has no death acquires an immovable body because it does not perish acquires an unsubstantial body because it is free from false appearances acquires a body with one appearance because it has no appearance acquires an immeasurable body because the power of Buddhas is immeasurable acquires a body that equals all other bodies because each is an appearance of suchness acquires a body free from differentiation because he observes the equality of the three time frames acquires a body that goes everywhere because his pure eye equally illuminates all places hindrance free acquires a body with no desire  because he knows that all dharmas neither converge nor diverge acquires a boundless body that equals the open sky because his endless store of merit and wisdom is like the open sky acquires a body with eloquence that equals the uninterruptible and endless dharma nature because he knows that all appearances of dharmas are only one appearance and that dharma nature is no nature like the open sky acquires a body that emits countless sounds hindrance free like the open sky acquires a body fully equipped with all skillful Bodhisattva actions because it has no hindrances anywhere like the open sky acquires a body that continues to sail the ocean of the entire Buddha Dharma because it is endless like the open sky acquires a body that displays in every Buddha Land countless Buddha Lands because he is free from greed and attachment like the open sky acquires a body that without rest displays all dharmas with ease because it is like the open sky acquires an indestructible firm and powerful body because it sustains the whole world like the open sky acquires an indestructible vajra body with keen faculties because it is like the open sky which cannot be burnt away by the fires at the end of a kalpa acquires a body with the power to support the whole world because the power of his wisdom is like the open sky BuddhaSons these are called a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas ten endurances  Summarizing Verses  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse When someone in a world hears The location of a treasure store Delight rises in his mind Because he can acquire the treasures When a Bodhisattva a true Buddhason Who has great wisdom Hears the Buddha Dharma As an appearance of profound nirvāṇa His mind finds peace and calm In the profound Dharma He is neither shocked nor terrified Nor is he even anxious When a great one who aspires to bodhi Hears the sounds  His pure mind can endure in hearing them And harbor no doubts He knows that by hearing The profound wondrous Dharma He will acquire  the overall wisdomknowledge And become a great guiding teacher to gods and humans When a Bodhisattva hears these sounds With great joy in his mind He makes a firm resolve To seek the Dharma of Buddhas Because he delights in attaining bodhi His mind is gradually tamed As his faith grows stronger He never opposes or maligns the Dharma Therefore when he listens to the sounds  His mind can endure in hearing them Abiding in the Dharma without motion He trains in Bodhisattva actions To seek bodhi He walks only the bodhi path Making energetic progress without thoughts of turning back He never abandons good precepts To seek bodhi His mind has no fear Hearing the Dharma increases his bold valor And He makes offerings to Buddhas to delight Them           If someone greatly fortunate Has found a store of pure gold To satisfy his personal needs He makes gold ornaments Likewise a Bodhisattva who hears The profound meanings of the Dharma Ponders them to increase the ocean of his wisdomknowledge And to train in accordance with the Dharma Thus he knows dharmas in existence And dharmas in nonexistence Following truesuchness He knows dharmas as they truly are He acquires a pure mind which is Lucid and filled with great joy Knowing that dharmas arise through conditions He diligently trains to Observe all dharmas with the same impartiality And understand their nature Never damaging the store of the Buddha Dharma He realizes  all dharmas His aspirations always firm He adorns Buddha bodhi Immovable as Mount Sumeru He singlemindedly seeks true enlightenment Resolved to make energetic progress He trains in profound samādhi For countless kalpas he diligently trains Without regress or failure The dharmas this Bodhisattva enters Are the places walked by Buddhas He fully understands them His mind neither tiring nor idling Following the words of the unsurpassed one He impartially observes all dharmas Only by acquiring endurance in equality Can he acquire the wisdomknowledge of equality Following the words of Buddhas He attains this endurance He knows dharmas as they truly are But does not differentiate them           In the ThirtythreeHeavens  All gods use The same vessels for food But each eats different food Their various kinds of food Do not come from the ten directions But naturally appear in their vessels According to the karmas they have done Thus a Bodhisattva observes That all dharmas Arise through causes and conditions Because there is no birth there is no death Because there is no death there is no end Because there is no end there are no taints Thinking only of the Buddha Dharma His mind is neither distracted nor swayed Honoring vows made out of compassion He skillfully acts in the world Diligently seeking to acquire the TenPowers He follows the ways of the world but does not abide in the world Neither coming nor going He well expounds the Dharma by skillful means With this supreme endurance  He understands that dharmas have no end He truly enters the dharma realm Knowing that his entrance is no entrance A Bodhisattva who abides in this endurance Sees all Tathāgatas Simultaneously bestowing upon him the prophecy Called receiving a Buddhas position He fully understands that past present and future dharmas Are pure appearances of nirvāṇa He can transform sentient beings And set them on the path of goodness           Various dharmas in the world Are all like illusions With this understanding His mind is never moved by anything Karmas are born from the mind So the mind is said to be like an illusion If one discards differentiation Ones lifejourneys in the Three Realms of Existence come to an end As an analogy an artist Paints colorful images Which merely satisfy the greed and pleasure of multitudes Who however cannot obtain anything portrayed in a painting Likewise all things in the world Are like illusions With no selfessence and no birth They appear to be various things Although illusions are not sentient beings Sentient beings are no different from illusions Sentient beings worlds And dharmas in the past present and future Are all like illusions With no exception An illusion can appear to be a man a woman An elephant a horse a cow a sheep A house a pond a spring A garden a flower a fruit or anything else An illusion has no awareness Nor does it have a place It is in ultimate nirvāṇa But appears according to ones differentiations A Bodhisattva can see that Existent or nonexistent All dharmas in the world Are like illusions Sentient beings and worlds Are produced by various karmas He enters the realm of illusions But has no attachment to them Standing on the hindrancefree ground  He displays awesome powers everywhere           Buddhasons who are boldly valiant Should follow and enter the wondrous Dharma And observe their perceptions which are like A fettering net in their worlds Perceptions are like mirages Which lead sentient beings to misconceptions A Bodhisattva should know well his perceptions And discard all inverted views Sentient beings are different and Do not come in only one shape or one kind He fully understands that all such differences Are perceptions and hence unreal Sentient beings  in the ten directions are All shrouded by their perceptions If they can discard their inverted views They can end perceptions of their worlds The world is like a mirage And ones perceptions produce differences  If one knows that the world abides in ones perceptions One will be free from the three inversions As an analogy when a mirage appears in hot air It is perceived by the world as water Actually there is no water And the wise should not seek it Likewise sentient beings should know that Their worlds and lifejourneys are nonexistent They are like mirages that abide in perceptions Which do not hinder the states of the mind If one discards ones perceptions One will be free from ludicrous statements And can enable the foolish who are attached to their perceptions To achieve liberation Discarding arrogance Abandoning perceptions of worlds And ending what is endless Are a Bodhisattvas skillful means           A Bodhisattva knows that dharmas in the world Are all like dreams Neither with nor without a place Their essence is nirvāṇa Dharmas are beyond differentiation Like dreams which are no different from the mind Worlds and the three time frames Are all like dreams The essence of a dream has neither birth nor death Nor does it have a direction or place Those who see the essence of the Three Realms of Existence in the same light Liberate their minds A dream is neither in the world Nor not in the world If one does not differentiate between these two One enters the ground of endurance  As one sees in a dream Various appearances Likewise one sees them in the world No different from those in a dream He who abides in the Dream Samādhi Knows that the world is like a dream All things are neither same nor different Neither one nor various Whether they are worlds sentient beings or their karmas He knows that all of them Pure or impure Are like dreams Whether they are a Bodhisattvas actions Or great vows He knows that all of them are like dreams As is the world Although he knows that the world is empty He does not destroy dharmas in the world Such as long and short things As if they are in a dream This is called endurance in dreamlikeness Through which he understands dharmas in the world Quickly acquires the hindrancefree wisdomknowledge And widely delivers sentient beings Training in these actions Brings him profound understanding of The nature of dharmas With no attachment to them           Various sounds in The whole world Are neither internal nor external dharmas And are like echoes When hearing various sounds Ones mind should not differentiate them Hence when a Bodhisattva hears sounds His mind does not differentiate them He beholds Tathāgatas with reverence And listens to Their Dharma tones As They pronounce countless sūtras He has no attachment to what he hears As echoes come from nowhere Likewise do the sounds heard Nevertheless he can differentiate dharmas Not contradicting their meanings He well understands sounds But does not differentiate them Knowing that sounds are empty He voices pure tones Understanding that dharmas are beyond words He enters the wordless state Nevertheless he speaks words which are Like echoes pervading the world He knows that usage of words Includes sounds Although he Knows that the nature of sounds is empty He speaks words in worldly tones As all sounds in the world Are presented as differentiated dharmas His tones reach everywhere To enlighten sentient beings When a Bodhisattva attains this endurance  His pure tones transform the world He skillfully explains past present and future And has no attachment to the world To benefit the world He is resolved to attain bodhi He enters dharma nature But does not differentiate it He observes that all dharmas in the world Have no selfessence and are in nirvāṇa To benefit sentient beings He trains for bodhi with an unwavering resolve He neither abides in the world Nor leaves the world He does not rely on the world Because the place for reliance cannot be found He knows the nature of the world But has no attachment to this nature Although he does not rely on the world He transforms all in the world and enables them to transcend the world He knows the true nature of All dharmas in the world He knows that dharmas are nondual But has no attachment to nonduality His mind neither abides in the world Nor leaves the world He does not train outside the world To acquire the overall wisdomknowledge           As a reflection in the water Is neither inside nor outside the water A Bodhisattva who seeks bodhi Understands that the world is not the world as perceived He neither abides in nor leaves the world Because the world is ineffable Neither inside nor outside  The world appears as does a reflection He who fathoms this profound meaning Has discarded taints and become lucid Never abandoning his original vows He illuminates everything as does a wisdom lamp Countless dharmas in the world Are equal in  wisdomknowledge He transforms all sentient beings And enables them to discard their attachments He studies the profound Dharma And benefits sentient beings Then he enters into wisdomknowledge And trains for bodhi           A Bodhisattva observes dharmas And knows that they are like manifestations Nevertheless he takes manifestationlike good actions And never abandons them Following manifestationlike natures He trains on the bodhi path As all dharmas are like manifestations So too are Bodhisattva actions All things in the world And immeasurable karmas Are equally like manifestations And forever abide in nirvāṇa All past present and future Buddhas Are also like manifestations A Bodhisattva trains for bodhi to fulfill his original vows And transforms into a Tathāgata A Buddha out of His great lovingkindness and compassion Using the power of manifestation expounds the Dharma And delivers manifestationlike sentient beings Whose deliverance is also like a manifestation He who knows that all things in the world are like manifestations Does not differentiate them Differences in manifestationlike things Are all caused by different karmas He who trains in Bodhisattva actions is Adorned with the store of manifestations Using immeasurably good adornments He does good karmas for the world A manifestation is beyond differentiation And does not differentiate dharmas As manifestations and dharmas are both in nirvāṇa So too are Bodhisattva actions Wisdomknowledge reveals the ocean of manifestations And the nature of manifestations imprints the world As manifestations have neither birth nor death So too does wisdom           The tenth endurance is acquired by clearly seeing that The essence of sentient beings and dharmas Is nirvāṇa Which is like the sky without a place He who acquires this wisdomknowledge of skylikeness Forever discards grasping and attachment What is like the sky has no varieties And no hindrance in the world He who acquires the power of endurance in skylikeness Is like the endless sky All mental objects are like the open sky Beyond differentiation The open sky has neither selfessence Nor termination Nor varieties And the power of wisdomknowledge is like the open sky The open sky has no beginning No middle and no end As it cannot be measured So too a Bodhisattvas wisdomknowledge cannot be measured Observing dharma nature in this way He sees that all dharmas acquired by a Bodhisattva Are like the open sky With neither birth nor death He abides in skylike dharmas And explains their skylikeness to sentient beings He subjugates all māras Using his endurance in skylikeness as skillful means All different appearances in the world Are empty and are no appearance He enters the place of no appearance where All appearances are equal Using only one skillful means He enters all worlds Because he knows that the three time frames Are equal in the nature of the open sky So too wisdom sounds And a Bodhisattvas bodies Are equal in the nature of the open sky Because all dharmas are in nirvāṇa           These ten endurances Are a Buddhasons trainings His mind well abiding in them He expounds them to sentient beings Developing and learning well these endurances He acquires vast power The power of the Dharma and the power of wisdomknowledge Are the skillful means to attain bodhi He who enters this door of endurances Acquires the hindrancefree wisdomknowledge Surpassing all multitudes He turns the unsurpassed Dharma wheel The vast actions he trains in Are beyond measure Only a Buddha a tamerteacher who has an ocean of wisdomknowledge Can know them all He who discards fixation on having a self and trains for bodhi Enters the profound dharma nature His mind abiding in pure dharmas He gives them as alms to all sentient beings Although the number of sentient beings and dust particles in a world Can be known The limits of a Bodhisattvas virtues Cannot be determined If a Bodhisattva can acquire These ten endurances No sentient being can comprehend His wisdom and actions Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment   Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Tang Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master ikṣānanda from Yutian   Fascicle     Chapter   The Ineffable  At that time Mind King  Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One BuddhaTathāgatas use numbers such as asakhyeya measureless boundless unequaled uncountable indefinable inconceivable immeasurable ineffable and ineffably ineffable WorldHonored One what are their meanings from asakhyeya to ineffably ineffable  The Buddha told Mind King Bodhisattva Very good very good Good man to enable the world to fathom the meanings of numbers only Buddhas know you ask the Tathāgata the SamyakSabuddha Good man hearken hearken I will explain to you Ponder what I say  Then Mind King Bodhisattva said Yes I accept your teachings  The Buddha said Good man a hundred lakṣa is a koṭi A koṭi times a koṭi is an ayuta A nirabhilapya times a nirabhilapya is a nirabhilapya parivarta A nirabhilapya parivarta times a nirabhilapya parivarta is an ineffably ineffable  A nirabhilapya nirabhilapya times a nirabhilapya nirabhilapya is a nirabhilapya nirabhilapya parivarta  Then to Mind King Bodhisattva the WorldHonored One spoke in verse The ineffably ineffable Fills all that is ineffable In an ineffable number of kalpas A description of what is ineffable cannot be finished Suppose an ineffable number of Buddha Lands Are pulverized into dust particles In one dust particle there are an ineffable number of worlds As it is with one so it is with all It is ineffable that this ineffable number of worlds Are pulverized into dust particles in one thought Also ineffable is that they are pulverized thought after thought Throughout an ineffable number of kalpas As it is ineffable that a dust particle contains worlds Even more ineffable is that they are pulverized into dust particles Using an ineffable method of calculation  calculate these numbers for an ineffable number of kalpas Or for kalpas as numerous as dust particles Using one dust particle to represent  kalpas If you praise one Samantabhadra Bodhisattva throughout those kalpas You still cannot finish praising his virtues As it is with one hair So it is with all hairs in the dharmarealm As the worlds on the tip of one hair Are countless and ineffable So too are worlds on The tips of hairs across space The worlds on the tip of a hair Are of countless kinds There are ineffably different kinds of worlds And ineffably same kinds of worlds On the ineffable tip of a hair There are an ineffable number of pure worlds With an ineffable number of diverse adornments And an

Mount Sumeru The treasures that appear in every radiance Are ineffably ineffable As one Sumeru Mountain of wonderful treasures displays An ineffable number of worlds So all Sumeru Mountains of treasures without exception Display an ineffable number of worlds When a world is pulverized into dust particles The physical appearance of a dust particle is ineffable Likewise the appearances of dust particles of pulverized worlds Are ineffably ineffable The various appearances of these dust particles Emit an ineffable number of radiances In such radiances appear an ineffable number of Buddhas And the Dharma They expound is ineffable The wonderful stanzas in the Dharma are ineffable Hearers of these stanzas achieve ineffable understanding Every thought with ineffable understanding Affirms the ineffable truereality  And reveals all future Buddhas Who will endlessly expound the Dharma Every Buddhas Dharma is ineffable His various purities are ineffable He voices an ineffable

Ineffable words of different kinds In His sphere of action His taming sentient beings thought after thought is ineffable All his miraculous manifestations are ineffable All his appearances are ineffable Such manifestations are produced in ineffable kalpas And have ineffable differences While a Bodhisattva can explain all these things in detail No one else though versed in calculation can figure them out Worlds on the tip of a hair are large or small Pure or impure coarse or fine Although all such worlds are ineffable He knows every one of them and can describe each in detail Suppose a world is pulverized into dust particles Whose countless numbers are ineffable Worlds as numerous as these dust particles Gather on the tip of a hair This ineffable number of worlds Gathered on the tip of a hair are not too crowded Nor do they cause the tip of the hair to enlarge In order for them to gather there The shapes and appearances of All these worlds remain the same as before without any disorder As one world is not in disorder So all worlds are not in disorder The domain of space is boundless And filled with hairs A Bodhisattva can describe in one thought Worlds on the tips of all

ineffable number of kalpas can come to an end Praising Their ineffable virtues can never end Even if an ineffable number of Tathāgatas With Their ineffable number of tongues Praise the ineffable virtues of Buddhas They cannot finish praising in an ineffable number of kalpas Suppose that all sentient beings  in the ten directions Simultaneously attain true enlightenment Every Buddha in this group Can manifest an ineffable number of bodies Every one of the ineffable number of bodies manifests An ineffable number of heads Every one of the ineffable number of heads manifests An ineffable number of tongues Every one of the ineffable number of tongues emits An ineffable number of sounds Every one of the ineffable number of sounds Abides for an ineffable number of kalpas As it is with

Buddhas for an ineffable number of kalpas Although an ineffable number of kalpas can come to an end Praising the virtues of Buddhas can never end In every dust particle There are an ineffable number of lotus flower worlds In every lotus flower world There is an ineffable Tathāgata a worthy leader Throughout the dharma realm All dust particles contain Worlds in formation or destruction Whose

one time Or at various times He visits all these worlds and Beholds an ineffable number of Tathāgatas there He realizing the one truesuchness is ineffable His entering the Buddha seed is ineffable Although there are an ineffable number of Buddha Lands He can visit all of them and attain bodhi in all of them Although worlds sentient beings and Buddhas Have different natures which are ineffable And although past present and future things are ineffable A Bodhisattva clearly sees them all  Chapter   Time Scales  Then Mind King BodhisattvaMahāsattva told the other Bodhisattvas in the assembly BuddhaSons a kalpa in this SahāWorld which is ākyamuni Buddhas land is a day and a night in the World of Ultimate Bliss which is Amitābha Buddhas land A kalpa in the World of Ultimate Bliss is a day

Characteristics  At that time the WorldHonored One told Jewel Hand  Bodhisattva BuddhaSon a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha has a secondary characteristic called the perfect king The vast radiance it emits is called the glowing magnificence which has seven million asakhyeya beams of light as its retinue BuddhaSon when I was a Bodhisattva in the palace of Tuṣita Heaven  I emitted vast radiance called the radiance banner king illuminating worlds as numerous as the dust particles in ten Buddha Lands When hell dwellers in those worlds encountered this radiance they gained a respite from suffering and acquired ten purities of their eyes ears noses tongues bodies and minds With great joy they celebrated with exuberance After death they were reborn in Tuṣita Heaven The drum in that heaven called the most enjoyable made sounds telling them GodSons through restraining your minds planting your roots of goodness in the places of Tathāgatas and staying close to beneficent learned friends and through Vairocana Bodhisattvas great spiritual power after you died in hell you have been reborn in this heaven  BuddhaSon on each of this Bodhisattvas soles is  a wheel with a thousand spokes called the universal radiance king It has a secondary characteristic called the perfect king which constantly emits forty beams of light One of them is called the pure virtue which can illuminate worlds as numerous as the dust particles in a koṭi nayuta Buddha Lands It enables sentient beings to come to  maturity according to their karmic actions and various preferences When sentient beings in extreme pain in AvīciHell encountered this radiance after death they were reborn in Tuṣita Heaven Then they heard the sounds of the celestial drum telling them Very good very good GodSons Vairocana Bodhisattva has entered the TaintFree Samādhi You should salute him  When these godsons heard the celestial drums instruction they thought How extraordinary Why did it emit such mysterious sounds  Teachings of the Celestial Drum  Then the celestial drum told them My sounds are produced by the power of your roots of goodness GodSons when I say I I have no attachment to a self or its belongings It is the same with all Buddhas When They say that They are Buddhas They have no attachment to a self or its belongings GodSons my sounds do not come from east south west or north nor the four intermediate directions nor above or below Likewise receiving karmic requitals or attaining Buddhahood does not come from the ten directions GodSons for example when you were in hell hell and your hell bodies did not come from the ten directions but from your evil karmas and the bondage of your ignorance Your bodies born in hell had no roots and did not come from anywhere GodSons Vairocana Bodhisattva emitted vast radiance because of the power of his virtues and his radiance did not come from the ten directions GodSons likewise my sounds the sounds of the celestial drum do not come from the ten directions I make these pure sounds and display command of spiritual powers through the power of samādhi roots of goodness and the virtues of prajñāpāramitā GodSons as analogy atop Mount Sumeru the king of mountains is Trayastriśa Heaven  Its splendid palaces contain various pleasurable things which do not come from the ten directions Likewise my sounds the sounds of the celestial drum do not come from the ten directions GodSons suppose worlds as numerous as the dust particles in a koṭi nayuta Buddha Lands are pulverized into dust particles As I expound the Dharma to sentient beings as numerous as these dust particles according to their preferences and make them happy I never tire of it cringe become proud or abandon selfrestraint GodSons it is the same with Vairocana Bodhisattva who abides in the TaintFree Samādhi From the excellent mark on his right palm he emits radiance displaying command of immeasurable spiritual powers Even voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas cannot know them much less sentient beings GodSons you should visit that Bodhisattva attend him and make offerings to him Do not be greedy for or even attached to pleasurable objects of the fivedesires because attachment to the pleasures of the five desires hinders your roots of goodness GodSons as an analogy when the fire at the end of a kalpa blazes even Mount Sumeru is burnt away leaving nothing behind Likewise greed and desire fetter the mind and keep it from thinking of Buddhas GodSons you should acknowledge kindness received and requite it GodSons those who do not requite kindness die accidental deaths and are reborn in hell GodSons when you were in hell you received light shining upon you so you left there and were reborn here You now should transfer  to expanding your roots of goodness GodSons as I the celestial drum neither male nor female can do immeasurable boundless and inconceivable things likewise you godsons and goddessdaughters neither male nor female can enjoy various splendid celestial palaces and gardens As I the celestial drum have neither birth nor death so too  form sensory reception perception mental processing and consciousness have neither birth nor death If you can understand these meanings know that you will enter the Samādhi of the RelianceFree Seal  When these godsons heard these words they gained what they never before had They forthwith manifested  flower clouds  fragrance clouds  music clouds  banner clouds  canopy clouds and  praise clouds After manifesting these clouds they went to the palace where Vairocana Bodhisattva was staying respectfully joined their palms and stood on one side They wanted to behold him but could not see him Then a godson said Vairocana Bodhisattva has left here and been born in the human world into King śuddhodanas family Riding in a sandalwood tower he has entered Queen Māyās womb  Then these godsons saw with their godeyes that this Bodhisattva was in the human world in King śuddhodanas family and that Brahma gods and desirerealm gods attended him and made offerings to him They thought We should go to greet this Bodhisattva and ask him about his daily life and should not have even one thought of attachment to our celestial palace  When these godsons each with a retinue of ten nayuta were about to descend to Jambudvīpa the celestial drum made sounds telling them GodSons this BodhisattvaMahāsattva did not die here in order to be born there Using transcendental powers he enables sentient beings to see him according to the capacities of their minds GodSons as I who cannot be seen by  eyes can emit sounds likewise this BodhisattvaMahāsattva in the TaintFree Samādhi  who cannot be seen by  eyes can manifest his births everywhere free from differentiation pride and attachment GodSons you should activate the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind purify your minds carry out good deportments and remove all hindrances caused by your karmas afflictions requitals and wrong views Using your bodies heads tongues and good body voice and mind karmas each as numerous as sentient beings in the dharma realm you should remove all hindrances by repenting of your sins  When these godsons heard its words they gained what they never before had With great joy in their hearts they asked How does a BodhisattvaMahāsattva repent of and expunge his sins  Through the power of this Bodhisattvas samādhi and roots of goodness the celestial drum made sounds answering them GodSons this Bodhisattva knows that ones karmas do not come from east south west or north nor the four intermediate directions nor above or below They arise from inverted views and have no abode He definitely sees this with clarity without any doubt GodSons as I the celestial drum expound karmas requitals actions precepts samādhis joy and nirvāṇa likewise Buddhas and Bodhisattvas expound a self and its belongings sentient beings greed anger delusion and various karmas However a self and its belongings the six lifepaths karmas and karmic requitals are nonexistent They cannot be found if one seeks in the ten directions GodSons as an analogy my sounds with neither birth nor death cannot be heard by gods who do evil They can hear only wakeup calls from hell Likewise all karmas have neither birth nor death GodSons my sounds the sounds of the celestial drum are endless and uninterrupted for countless kalpas and their comings and goings cannot be captured GodSons if there is neither coming nor going there is neither perpetuity nor cessation No Buddha ever expounds perpetuity or cessation except when using it as a skillful means to bring sentient beings to  maturity GodSons for example my sounds follow the minds of sentient beings in countless worlds enabling them to hear me Likewise all Buddhas follow the minds of sentient beings enabling them to see Them GodSons suppose there is a mirror called the reflector It is pure and clear and as huge as ten worlds In it appear the reflections of all mountains rivers and sentient beings including hell dwellers animals and hungry ghosts GodSons what is your opinion Can these reflections enter into the mirror and exit from it  They answered No  GodSons likewise all karmas come from nowhere and go to nowhere though they bring karmic requitals GodSons as a magician can fool peoples eyes so too can karmas If you know this it is a true repentance which purifies all sins  Benefits Received from Hearing the Teachings  When this teaching was pronounced godsons in Tuṣita Heavens in worlds as numerous as the dust particles in  koṭi nayuta Buddha Lands acquired endurance in realizing that dharmas have no birth innumerable asakhyeya inconceivable godsons in the sixdesireheavens activated the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind all goddessdaughters in the six desire heavens abandoned female form and assumed male form and resolved to attain the unsurpassed bodhi When these godsons heard Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas vast transference  they ascended to the tenth Bodhisattva ground and were adorned with powers and samādhis By doing pure body voice and mind karmas as numerous as sentient beings they repented of their

sitting crosslegged emitting vast radiance Every secondary mark on those Bodhisattvas emitted beams of light as numerous as sentient beings In the radiance appeared Buddhas as numerous as sentient beings sitting crosslegged expounding the Dharma according to sentient beings minds without displaying even a little power of the TaintFree Samādhi Using those lotus flowers these godsons made an

who have attained dhyāna at other levels A BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in the position of Pure Gold Web WheelTurning King emits pure radiance from his jeweled topknot If sentient beings encounter this radiance they will ascend to the tenth Bodhisattva ground acquire immeasurable radiant wisdom and acquire ten pure eyes ten pure minds countless profound samādhis and pure physical eyes BuddhaSon suppose someone pulverizes a koṭi nayuta Buddha Lands into dust particles Then he pulverizes into dust particles Buddha Lands as numerous as those dust particles Holding these dust particles in his left hand he travels east Each time he passes worlds in the number of these dust particles he drops a dust particle He continues east until he finishes all these dust particles Then he does the same traveling south west north in the four intermediate directions above and below Suppose all worlds in the ten directions  whether or not they have been hit by a dust particle are merged into one Buddha Land Jewel Hand what is your opinion Is this immense and immeasurable Buddha Land conceivable  No this Buddha Land immense immeasurable rare and extraordinary is inconceivable However it would be even more rare and extraordinary if sentient beings could elicit faith and achieve understanding after hearing this analogy  The Buddha said Jewel Hand indeed indeed it is as you say If there are good men and good women who elicit faith after hearing this analogy upon them I will bestow the prophecy that they will definitely attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi and acquire the unsurpassed Tathāgata wisdom Jewel Hand suppose someone pulverizes into dust particles worlds as numerous as the dust particles in  koṭi Buddha Lands each the size of the immense Buddha Land just described As in the preceding analogy he drops off all these dust particles one by one and merges all Buddha Lands  into one Buddha Land Then he repeats this process eighty times A Bodhisattva with pure karmic requitals in one thought can clearly see with his physical eye the dust particles in all such immense Buddha Lands He also can see Buddhas as numerous as the dust particles in  koṭi vast Buddha Lands just as the pure radiance of a crystal mirror illuminates worlds as numerous as the dust particles in ten Buddha Lands BuddhaSon all  arise from Pure Gold Web WheelTurning Kings profound samādhi virtuous works and roots of goodness  Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment fascicle  Translated from the digital Chinese Canon    Notes      Chapter   Universally Worthy Actions  At that time Samantabhadra BodhisattvaMahāsattva told the other Bodhisattvas in the assembly BuddhaSons what has just been revealed according to sentient beings capacities is a brief description of a small part of a Tathāgatas state BuddhaBhagavāns appear in worlds because sentient beings have no wisdom do evil imagine a self and its belongings have attachment to their bodies hold inverted views harbor doubts make differentiations are driven by their afflictions and drift in the stream of birth and death far away from the Tathāgata path  Anger Causing Hindrances to Bodhi  BuddhaSons I do not see even one fault as severe as a Bodhisattva getting angry with other Bodhisattvas Because BuddhaSons if a Bodhisattva gets angry with other Bodhisattvas he opens the door of a million hindrances to bodhi What are these one million hindrances Moreover not practicing a Bodhisattvas equal almsgiving leads to the hindrance of inability to relinquish anything not observing Tathāgatas precepts leads to the hindrance of violating the precepts not developing endurance  leads to these hindrances delusion anger and hurtful behavior not making a Bodhisattvas energetic progress leads to the hindrance of indolence not attaining samādhi leads to the hindrance of a chaotic mind not practicing prajñāpāramitā leads to these hindrances evil wisdom inability to determine wisely what is right or wrong no skillful means to deliver sentient beings inability to observe a Bodhisattvas wisdom and inability to know a Bodhisattvas ways to achieve liberation Moreover not acquiring a Bodhisattvas ten vast eyes leads to the hindrance of having eyes like those born blind not hearing the hindrancefree Dharma leads to the hindrance of having a mouth like a dumb goats not being equipped with the excellent marks  leads to the hindrance to the sense of smell inability to comprehend sentient beings words leads to the hindrance to the sense of taste despising sentient beings leads to the hindrance to the sense of touch allowing the mind to rampage leads to the hindrance to the mind Moreover doing any of the three evil karmas  leads to the hindrance of  body karmas Constantly committing any of the four faults leads to the hindrance of  voice karmas Harboring greed anger and wrong views leads to the hindrance of  mind karmas the hindrance of seeking the Dharma with a thieving mind the hindrance of turning away from the Bodhisattva state the hindrance of cringing from a Bodhisattvas bold valor the hindrance of being indolent on a Bodhisattvas liberation path the hindrance of giving up a Bodhisattvas radiant wisdom door the hindrance of becoming too weak to have a Bodhisattvas power of mindfulness the hindrance of inability to retain a Tathāgatas teachings the hindrance of inability to stay on the Bodhisattva Way which can end his rebirths in the ThreeRealmsofExistence the hindrance of inability to train on the indestructible Bodhisattva Way the hindrance of seeking the right position  of riders of the TwoVehicles the hindrance of turning away from families of past present and future Buddhas and Bodhisattvas BuddhaSons if a Bodhisattva gets angry with other Bodhisattvas he opens the door of a hundred million hindrances Because BuddhaSons I do not see even one fault as severe as a Bodhisattva getting angry with other Bodhisattvas  Universally Worthy Actions  Therefore a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who wants to complete Bodhisattva actions quickly should diligently practice ten dharmas What are these ten These are the ten BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in these ten dharmas has ten purities What are these ten These are the ten BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in these ten purities has ten kinds of vast wisdomknowledge  What are these ten

perception one perception enters all perceptions All sounds of words enter the sound of one word the sound of one word enters the sounds of all words The three time frames  enter one time frame one time frame enters all three time frames These are the ten BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has seen these ten entrances abides in ten superb minds What are these ten BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who abides in these ten superb minds has Buddhas ten skillful means What are these ten These are the ten BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has heard these teachings  should resolve to accept and retain them with respect Because a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who retains these teachings will with a little effort quickly attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi and acquire the entire Buddha Dharma which is the same as that of all past present and future Buddhas  The Testimony of Other Bodhisattvas  Then through the Buddhas spiritual power as the way things naturally are in the tendirections worlds as numerous as the dust particles in a million koṭi nayuta ineffable Buddha Lands quaked in six different ways The sky rained down like clouds all adornments such as flowers

clouds that ineffably fortified the bodhi mind clouds that radiated ineffable light clouds that expounded the Dharma through ineffable spiritual powers It was in this world with fourcontinents in the palace in the bodhimaṇḍa under the bodhi tree that Bodhisattvas saw the Tathāgata attain samyaksabodhi and expound this dharma  and the same transpired in all worlds in the ten directions Then through the Buddhas spiritual power as the way things naturally are from the ten directions beyond worlds as numerous as the dust particles in ten ineffable worlds Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in ten Buddha Lands came to visit this world Filling  the ten directions they said  Very good very good BuddhaSon only you can expound this profound dharma of BuddhaTathāgatas greatest vow

bodhimaṇḍa to testify for you As we Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in ten Buddha Lands came to testify in this bodhimaṇḍa we do the same in all worlds in the ten directions  Then Samantabhadra Bodhisattva through the spiritual power of the Buddha and the power of his own roots of goodness scanned everywhere in worlds in the ten directions throughout the dharma realm He spoke in verse to teach Bodhisattva actions to reveal the realm of Buddha bodhi to reveal the realm of great vows to account for the kalpas of all worlds to describe Buddhas timely appearances to explain

Appearance in the World   The Buddha Empowers a Bodhisattva to Request Teachings  At that time the WorldHonoredOne emitted from the white hair between His eyebrows vast radiance called the appearance of a Tathāgata accompanied by a retinue of countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of beams of light This radiance illuminated all worlds in the tendirections throughout the domain of space and the dharmarealm Ten times it circled  clockwise displaying a Tathāgatas immeasurable mastery enlightening innumerable Bodhisattvas shaking all worlds in the ten directions ending the suffering on all evil lifepaths obscuring  all māra palaces revealing all BuddhaTathāgatas seated on bodhi seats and attaining samyaksabodhi and displaying all assemblies in Their bodhimaṇḍas Having done these things it returned circled this assembly of Bodhisattvas clockwise and entered the top of the head of the Bodhisattva called Wondrous Virtues Arising from Tathāgata Nature Meanwhile the huge multitude in this bodhimaṇḍa felt great and exuberant joy in body and mind They thought How extraordinary Now that the Tathāgata has emitted vast radiance He definitely will expound the profound great Dharma  Then Wondrous Virtues Arising from Tathāgata Nature Bodhisattva bared his right shoulder knelt on his right knee on his lotus flower seat and joined his palms Intent upon facing the Tathāgata he spoke in verse Great wisdom arising from the virtue of  true enlightenment He masters all states and arrives at the opposite shore as an equal of All past present and future Tathāgatas Hence I now make reverent obeisance Having realized that dharmas have no appearance He displays His wondrous appearance in a sublime body He emits a thousand beams of taintfree light Entirely destroying the māra troops Worlds in the ten directions are Shaken without exception But not even one sentient being is terrified Such is the awesome power of the Sugata He abides in the dharma nature

practices for countless kalpas He has attained unsurpassed bodhi Having acquired hindrancefree wisdomknowledge  of all things He has become an equal of all Buddhas This guiding teacher emits vast radiance And shakes worlds in the ten directions After displaying immeasurable transcendental powers His radiance returns and enters my head Innumerable Bodhisattvas who can learn well The definitive

untainted Such worthy elites have come to assemble This honored guiding teacher benefits the world His wisdom and vigor being immeasurable He now illuminates this huge multitude with vast radiance Enabling me to ask for  the unsurpassed Dharma Who can truly describe The profound state of a Buddha Who is the eldest son in the Buddha Dharma I pray that the WorldHonored One will tell us  The Buddha Empowers Samantabhadra Bodhisattva to Expound the Dharma  Then the Tathāgata emitted from His mouth vast radiance called the fearless and hindrance free accompanied by a retinue of  koṭi asakhyeya beams of light It illuminated everywhere in all worlds in the ten directions throughout the domain of space and the dharma realm Ten times it circled  clockwise displaying a Tathāgatas various kinds of mastery enlightening innumerable Bodhisattvas shaking all worlds in the ten directions ending the suffering on all evil lifepaths obscuring the radiance of all māra palaces revealing all BuddhaTathāgatas seated on bodhi seats and attaining samyaksabodhi and displaying all assemblies in Their bodhimaṇḍas Having done these things it returned circled this assembly of Bodhisattvas clockwise and entered Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas mouth After this radiance had entered his mouth Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas body and lion throne became a hundredfold larger than their former size and the size of the other Bodhisattvas but not that of the Tathāgata Then Wondrous Virtues Arising from Tathāgata Nature Bodhisattva asked Samantabhadra BodhisattvaMahāsattva BuddhaSon the Buddha has delighted Bodhisattvas with these vast miraculous manifestations but they are inconceivable and unknowable to the world What is  this auspicious sign  Samantabhadra BodhisattvaMahāsattva answered BuddhaSon in the past I saw that after Tathāgatas also called Arhats and SamyakSabuddhas had produced such vast miraculous manifestations They at once expounded the Dharma Door of the appearance of a Tathāgata I think that because the Tathāgata has displayed this sign He will give this teaching As he spoke these words the entire great earth shook displaying immeasurable radiance called requesting teachings  Requesting Teachings on a Tathāgatas Appearance  Then Wondrous Virtues Arising from Tathāgata Nature Bodhisattva asked Samantabhadra Bodhisattva BuddhaSon what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva know about the appearances of BuddhaTathāgatas also called Arhats and SamyakSabuddhas Please tell me BuddhaSon These countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Bodhisattvas in this assembly have long trained in doing pure karmas fully developed mindfulness and wisdom and arrived at the shore of ultimate great splendor They behave like Buddhas and rightly think of Buddhas never forgetting Them With great compassion they observe sentient beings and they definitely know great Bodhisattvas states and transcendental powers Supported by Buddhas spiritual powers they can retain the wondrous Dharma of all Tathāgatas These Bodhisattvas with such immeasurable virtues have come to assemble BuddhaSon you have attended and made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas completed supreme Bodhisattva actions achieved command of samādhi entered the secrets of Buddhas mastered the Dharma of Buddhas ended your doubts received the support of Buddhas spiritual powers known the capacities of sentient beings taught them the true ways to achieve liberation according to their preferences expounded the Buddha Dharma in accord with Buddha wisdom and arrived at the opposite shore You have done such immeasurable virtuous works Very good BuddhaSon I pray that you will describe a Tathāgatas appearance in the world His physical form speech and mental state His attaining bodhi doing Buddha work turning the Dharma wheel and entering parinirvāṇa and the rootsofgoodness developed by those who see hear or stay close to Him Please describe these things  Then to restate his meaning Wondrous Virtues Arising from Tathāgata Nature Bodhisattva spoke to Samantabhadra Bodhisattva in verse Great is the one with vast hindrancefree wisdom Who has realized the boundless equality  I pray that you will describe a Buddhas immeasurable actions Buddhasons who hear you will rejoice What should a Bodhisattva know about BuddhaTathāgatas appearances in worlds What are the states of Their body voice and mind How do Buddhas attain true enlightenment How do Tathāgatas turn the Dharma wheel How do Sugatas enter parinirvāṇa The multitude that hears you will be delighted If someone sees a Buddha a great Dharma King Or stays close to Him his roots of goodness will expand Please describe a sentient beings store of merits Acquired by seeing a Buddha Suppose someone comes to hear the names of a Tathāgata Whether He is in the world or in parinirvāṇa And elicits profound belief in his store of merits Please describe the benefits he has received All these Bodhisattvas join their palms Gazing reverently upon the Tathāgata you  and me Please describe the state of a Buddha an ocean of great virtues Who

great bodhi mind End their doubts and acquire wisdomknowledge as pure as the open sky Buddhas appear in sublime bodies Throughout all worlds Please use wonderful tones and analogies To describe Buddha bodhi They have attained In tens of millions of worlds in the ten directions Through countless koṭis of nayutas of kalpas It is hard to see The Bodhisattvas who now have assembled All these Bodhisattvas are reverent Longing to hear the wondrous meanings I pray that you will expound with pure mind The great matter of a Tathāgatas appearance  Ten Past Things Contributing to a Tathāgatas Appearance  Then Samantabhadra Bodhisattva told Wondrous Virtues Arising from Tathāgata Nature Bodhisattva and the other Bodhisattvas in the assembly BuddhaSons this matter is inconceivable because a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha appears in the world through countless dharmas Because a Tathāgatas appearance is not accomplished through one condition or one thing but through ten kinds of countless hundreds of thousands of asakhyeyas of things in the past What are these ten BuddhaSons upon completion of such countless asakhyeyas of Dharma Doors a Bodhisattva becomes a Tathāgata  Ten Characteristics of a Tathāgatas Appearance  First BuddhaSons a ThreeThousandLargeThousandfoldWorld does not form through one condition or one thing but through countless conditions and countless things such as forming and spreading enormous clouds pouring down massive rains and relying on four wind wheels What are these four The first is called holder because it can hold massive waters The second is called remover because it can remove massive waters The third is called maker because it makes all places The fourth is called adorner because it skillfully distributes adornments All these wind wheels arise from sentient beings collective karmas and Bodhisattvas roots of goodness enabling all sentient beings to enjoy the world according to their needs BuddhaSons through such countless causes and conditions a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World forms Such is the nature of dharmas There is no producer no maker no knower and no accomplisher Nevertheless a world forms Likewise a Tathāgatas appearance is not accomplished through one condition or one thing but through countless causes and conditions and countless things such as hearing accepting and retaining past Buddhas great Dharma clouds and rains which can activate a Tathāgatas four wind wheels of great wisdomknowledge What are these four The first is the wind wheel of great wisdomknowledge to retain and not to forget dhāraṇīs because this wheel can hold all Tathāgatas great Dharma clouds and rains The second is the wind wheel of great wisdomknowledge to practice śamatha and vipaśyanā because this wheel can remove all afflictions The third is the wind wheel of great wisdomknowledge to transfer merits with skillfulness because this wheel can develop all roots of goodness The fourth is the wind wheel of great wisdomknowledge to produce various taintfree adornments because this wheel can enable all sentient beings taught in the past to be adorned with pure roots of goodness and to acquire the power of a Tathāgatas afflictionfree roots of goodness This is how a Tathāgata attains true enlightenment It is attained without birth or act because such is the nature of dharmas BuddhaSons this is the first characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Second BuddhaSons when a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World is forming enormous clouds pour down rains called the downpour which cannot be held by any place except by a large thousandfold world when it is forming BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha forms great Dharma clouds and pours down great Dharma rains called accomplishing the appearance of a Tathāgata They cannot be retained by the narrow minds of riders of the TwoVehicles unless through the sustaining power of great Bodhisattvas minds BuddhaSons this is the second characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Third BuddhaSons because of the power of sentient beings karmas enormous clouds pour down rains which come from nowhere and go to nowhere Likewise a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha because of the power of Bodhisattvas roots of goodness forms great Dharma clouds and pours down great Dharma rains which also come from nowhere and go to nowhere BuddhaSons this is the third characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Fourth BuddhaSons when enormous clouds pour down massive rains no sentient being in a large thousandfold world can know their quantity If someone tries to calculate it he will go mad Only the godking Maheśvara the ruler of a large thousandfold world because of the power of his past roots of goodness can know it not missing even one raindrop BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha forms great Dharma clouds and pours down great Dharma rains which sentient beings voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas cannot know If they try to ponder them their minds will go wild Only BodhisattvaMahāsattvas rulers of the entire world because of the power of their past cultivation of bodhi wisdom know them clearly not missing even one word or phrase that enters a sentient beings mind BuddhaSons this is the fourth characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Fifth when enormous clouds pour down massive rains the massive rain called extinguisher can extinguish fires the massive rain called producer can produce massive waters the massive rain called stopper can stop massive waters the massive rain called maker can make treasures such as gems the massive rain called differentiator can differentiate  the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World He forms great Dharma clouds and pours down great Dharma rains The great Dharma rain called extinguisher can extinguish  all sentient beings afflictions the great Dharma rain called producer can produce all sentient beings roots of goodness the Dharma rain called stopper can stop all sentient beings wrong views the great Dharma rain called maker can make all Dharma treasures of wisdom the Dharma rain called differentiator can differentiate all sentient beings minds and preferences BuddhaSons this is the fifth characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Sixth BuddhaSons although massive clouds rain down the oneflavored water the rains have countless differences BuddhaSons it is similar for the appearance of a Tathāgata Although He rains down the oneflavored Dharma water of great compassion He gives sentient beings appropriate teachings with countless differences BuddhaSons this is the sixth characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Seventh BuddhaSons when a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World forms the celestial palaces in the form realm form first then those in the desire realm form and then the abodes of humans and other sentient beings form BuddhaSons it is similar for appearance of a Tathāgata He first enables Bodhisattvas to develop their wisdom through training then enables Pratyekabuddhas to develop their wisdom through training and then enables voicehearers to develop their roots of goodness and their wisdom through training Then He enables other sentient beings to develop through causes and conditions their roots of goodness and their wisdom through training BuddhaSons as enormous clouds rain down the oneflavored water the palaces formed for sentient beings differ according to their different roots of goodness Likewise a Tathāgatas oneflavored Dharma rains taste different according to sentient beings different capacities BuddhaSons this is the seventh characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Eighth BuddhaSons when a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World is forming massive water pervades it and produces a huge lotus flower called the precious adornment of virtues of a Tathāgatas appearance It spans the massive water and its radiance illuminates all worlds in the ten directions When the godking Maheśvara and gods in the pureabode heavens see this flower they definitely know that in this kalpa Buddhas will appear in the world BuddhaSons then wind wheels arise The wind wheel called pure radiance can build the celestial palaces in the form realm the wind wheel called pure light that adorns can build the celestial palaces in the desire realm the wind wheel called firm and indestructible can build the vajra mountain range and other large and small concentric mountain ranges the wind wheel called supremely tall can build Mount Sumeru the king of mountains The wind wheel called immovable can build the ten kings of mountains What are these ten They are  Snow Mountain The wind wheel called abider can build the great earth the wind wheel called adorner can build the palaces of dragons gandharvas and gods who reside on the earth the wind wheel called inexhaustible store can build all immense oceans in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World the wind wheel called store of universal radiance can make treasures in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World the wind wheel called strong root can grow all wishfulfilling trees BuddhaSons the oneflavored water poured down from enormous clouds does not differentiate its drinkers However because sentient beings roots of goodness are different the wind wheels are different because the wind wheels are different the worlds are different BuddhaSons it is similar for the appearance of a Tathāgata Adorned with the virtues of all roots of goodness He emits radiances of unsurpassed great wisdomknowledge such as  the radiance called indestructible which can produce a Tathāgatas extraordinary lifespan as endless as the domain of space and the dharma realm BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas oneflavored water of great compassion does not differentiate its drinkers However because of sentient beings different desires preferences and capacities it activates various wind wheels of great wisdomknowledge enabling Bodhisattvas to become Tathāgatas and appear in the world BuddhaSons all Tathāgatas have the same nature and Their wheels of great wisdomknowledge emit various radiances of wisdom BuddhaSons you all should know that a Tathāgata produces from the one flavor of liberation various immeasurable and inconceivable virtuous works Sentient beings may think that these are produced by a Tathāgatas spiritual power BuddhaSons these are not produced by a Tathāgatas spiritual power BuddhaSons it is impossible for any Bodhisattva to acquire a little Tathāgata wisdom without planting his roots of goodness under a Buddha It is through the power of Buddhas aweinspiring virtues that sentient beings are enabled to acquire a Buddhas virtues Yet BuddhaTathāgatas make no differentiations knowing that there is neither construction nor destruction neither doer nor doing BuddhaSons this is the eighth characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Ninth BuddhaSons four wind wheels abide in the open sky and can hold the water wheel What are these four The first is called abiding the second ever abiding the third everlasting the fourth unyielding These four wind wheels can hold the water wheel The water wheel can hold the great earth not letting it disintegrate or decay Hence the earth wheel relies on the water wheel the water wheel relies on the wind wheels the wind wheels rely on the open sky the open sky relies on nothing Although it relies on nothing it can let a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World abide BuddhaSons it is similar for the appearance of a Tathāgata A Buddhas four wind wheels of great wisdomknowledge arise from His radiant hindrancefree wisdom and can sustain all sentient beings roots of goodness What are these four These are the four BuddhaBhagavāns with great lovingkindness rescue all sentient beings and with great compassion deliver all sentient beings They benefit all of them with great lovingkindness and compassion However great lovingkindness and compassion rely on great skillful means great skillful means rely on a Tathāgatas appearance a Tathāgatas appearance relies on His radiant hindrancefree wisdom His radiant hindrancefree wisdom relies on nothing BuddhaSons this is the ninth characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance Tenth BuddhaSons after a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Word forms it benefits innumerable sentient beings Aquatic sentient beings benefit from the water land sentient beings benefit from the earth sentient beings that reside in palaces benefit from the palaces sentient beings that reside in the open sky benefit from the open sky It is similar for a Tathāgatas appearance which benefits innumerable sentient beings in various ways Those who delight in seeing a Buddha benefit from their delight those who abide by the pure precepts benefit from the pure precepts those who abide in meditation and the Four Immeasurable Minds benefit from acquiring supraworldly great transcendental powers those who abide in the radiance of Dharma Doors benefit from the indestructible cause and effect those who abide in the truth of the emptiness  benefit from the indestructibility of all dharmas That is why I say A Tathāgatas appearance benefits all innumerable sentient beings BuddhaSons this is the tenth characteristic of the appearance of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His appearance BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who knows a Tathāgatas appearance in the world knows that it is immeasurable Knowing that it encompasses immeasurable works he knows that it is vast Knowing that it pervades  the ten directions he knows that it neither comes nor goes Knowing that it is free from arising abiding and perishing he knows that it is free from doing and from what is done Knowing that it is beyond mind intellect and consciousness he knows that it has no body Knowing that it is like the open sky he knows that all dharmas are equal  Knowing that all sentient beings have no selves he knows that it has no end Knowing that it endlessly pervades all worlds he knows that it never retreats Knowing that it ceaselessly pervades the endless future he knows that it never decays Knowing that Tathāgata wisdom is unexcelled he knows that it is nondual Knowing the equality of dharmas by observing saskṛta and asaskṛta dharmas he knows that a Tathāgatas appearance in the world benefits all sentient beings because it is the natural fulfillment of His transferring  past actions  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse This great hero with the TenPowers is unsurpassed Like the unequaled open sky His state is vast and immeasurable and His virtuous works are foremost transcending the world Limitless are His virtuous works Beyond the measure of the mind and intellect No Dharma Door of this lion among men Can be known by sentient beings in a koṭi kalpas Suppose worlds in the ten directions are pulverized into dust particles Perhaps someone can calculate their number The virtues of one hair of this Tathagata Cannot be described in a million koṭi kalpas Suppose someone uses a ruler to measure the open sky and His companion calculates its size As the boundary of the open sky can never be captured The state of a Tathāgata can never be captured Suppose someone can know in a kṣaṇakṣaṇa The minds of past present and future sentient beings He cannot know in kalpas as numerous as sentient beings Even one thought of a Buddha Because the dharma realm pervades everywhere One should not take as entire what one perceives True suchness is free from delusion and always quiet With neither birth nor death it pervades everywhere Likewise the essence of Buddhas states is equality With neither increase nor decrease The true state  is no state As it pervades the past present and future there is nothing that pervades Likewise this guiding teachers state Pervades the past present and future hindrance free Dharma nature neither acts nor changes Like the open sky which is always pure Likewise the nature of Buddhas is pure Their inherent nature is no nature beyond existence and nonexistence Dharma nature does not hinge upon words Because it is nirvāṇa free from words Buddhas know that dharma nature is nirvāṇa Like traces of birds flying in the sky Through the power of Their original vows Buddhas appear in physical forms Enabling sentient beings to see Their great miraculous manifestations If someone wants to see a Buddhas state He should make his mind as pure as the open sky Discard deluded perceptions and wrong views And head for bodhi hindrance free Hence Buddhasons should hearken I will use a few analogies to describe a Buddhas state Although the virtuous works of a hero with the Ten Powers are immeasurable I now will briefly describe them to enlighten sentient beings I will describe a guiding teachers displays of the pure states of Body karmas voice karmas and mind karmas His turning the wondrous Dharma wheel His entering parinirvāṇa And all His roots of goodness The formation of a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World Is not accomplished through one cause and condition But through countless skillful means Causes and conditions Likewise a Tathāgatas appearance in the world Is accomplished through immeasurable virtuous works While minds of sentient beings as numerous as dust particles can be known The causes and conditions of a Buddhas appearance cannot be measured At the beginning of a formation kalpa clouds pour down rains And four wind wheels arise Through sentient beings roots of goodness and Bodhisattvas powers A ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World forms where sentient beings reside Likewise a Buddhas Dharma clouds Activate His wind wheels of wisdomknowledge that purify  minds And guide those to whom in the past He had transferred His merits Enabling them to harvest the unsurpassed  fruit The massive rains called the downpour Cannot be held by any place Except through the power of great winds in the pure open sky When a world is forming It is similar for the appearance of a Tathāgata He pours down Dharma rains that pervade the dharma realm They cannot be retained by lowly minds Only by vast pure minds Massive rains that fall from the sky Have neither makers nor recipients Coming from nowhere and going to nowhere They naturally pervade everywhere Likewise a Buddhas Dharma rains Neither come nor go nor act Bodhisattvas with vast minds accept them Through the power of their primary training When massive rains fall from clouds in the sky No one can count the raindrops But Maheśvava the ruler of a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World Knows their number because of the power of his virtues Likewise a Sugatas Dharma rains Cannot be measured by sentient beings But a Dharma King Sees them as clearly as a jewel in His palm Massive rains that fall from clouds in the sky Can extinguish  produce  and stop  They make all treasures And differentiate  a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World They make the Dharma treasures of wisdom And differentiate sentient beings minds and preferences The rains that fall from the sky come in only one flavor But they have countless differences The rains do not differentiate their drinkers But they naturally give rise to different things A Tathāgatas Dharma rains are neither same nor different Impartial and quiet they do not differentiate their drinkers To different sentient beings ready to be transformed They naturally provide different teachings When a world forms The celestial palaces in the form realm form first Then those in the desire realm form and then the abodes in the human realm form Gandharva palaces form last It is similar for the appearance of a Tathāgata He first activates immeasurable Bodhisattva actions Then transforms Pratyekabuddhas who delight in quietness  Then teaches voicehearers and then sentient beings When gods see the lotus flower  an auspicious sign They rejoice because they know that Buddhas will appear in the world Rains activate winds and winds bring forth a world Where palaces mountains and rivers form A Tathāgata emits radiance which skillfully differentiates Bodhisattvas And bestows upon them the prophecy  His wheels of wisdomknowledge are pure Each expounding the Dharma of Buddhas Trees rely on the earth in order to exist The earth relies on water in order not to disintegrate Water relies on wind and wind relies on the open sky The open sky relies on nothing The entire Buddha Dharma relies on lovingkindness and compassion Lovingkindness and compassion rely on skillful means Skillful means rely on wisdomknowledge and wisdomknowledge relies on wisdom The hindrancefree wisdom body  relies on nothing After a world forms All sentient beings receive its benefits Those who reside on earth in water or in the sky and Those with two feet or four feet all receive its benefits It is similar for the appearance of a Dharma King Because all sentient beings receive its benefits He enables those who see hear or stay close to Him To end their afflictions A Tathāgatas appearance is Inconceivable and unknowable to the world To enlighten sentient beings I have used analogies to describe that which is beyond analogies  Ten Characteristics of a Tathāgatas Body  BuddhaSons how should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva see the body of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should use no measure to see a Tathāgatas body Because a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should not see a Tathāgata through only one dharma one thing one body one world or one sentient being but through all things First BuddhaSons the open sky pervades everywhere in realms with or without form though it neither arrives nor does not arrive Because the open sky has no body Likewise a Tathāgatas body pervades all places all sentient beings all dharmas and all worlds though it neither arrives nor does not arrive Because a Tathāgatas body is no body To benefit sentient beings He manifests His body BuddhaSons this is the first characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Second BuddhaSons the open sky is vast and formless but it can display all forms Yet the open sky neither differentiates among them nor makes ludicrousstatements about them Likewise a Tathāgatas body illuminates the world with the radiance of wisdom enabling sentient beings to fully develop worldly and supraworldly roots of goodness Yet a Tathāgatas body neither differentiates among them nor makes ludicrous statements about them Because it has always been free from all attachments and all ludicrous statements BuddhaSons this is the second characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Third BuddhaSons the sun rises in Jambudvīpa and benefits all sentient beings in countless ways such as dispelling darkness removing coldness and wetness nurturing trees and grass ripening grains and crops lighting the open sky opening flowers enabling travelers to see their way and inhabitants to do their work Because the sun emits immeasurable radiance BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata a wisdom sun appears in the world and benefits all sentient beings in countless ways such as ending their evil to produce good changing their stupidity into wisdom rescuing and protecting them with great lovingkindness delivering them with great compassion expanding their capacities strengths and aspirations for bodhi He enables them to elicit profound belief and discard the muddled mind to see and hear  without destroying causes and conditions to acquire the godeye to see the places of their births and deaths to acquire the hindrancefree mind without damaging their roots of goodness to develop wisdom and open the flower of enlightenment and to activate the bodhi mind to complete all Bodhisattva actions Because a Tathāgatas body is a vast wisdom sun which emits immeasurable radiance to illuminate all BuddhaSons this is the third characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Fourth when the sun rises in Jambudvīpa it first illuminates Mount Sumeru and all great kings of mountains then the black mountain then plateaus and then the entire great earth The sun does not think I first illuminate this then that Because the mountains and the ground each have variations in height it illuminates them in this order Likewise a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha acquires in the boundless dharma realm the wheels of wisdomknowledge which constantly emit the radiance of hindrancefree wisdom The radiance first illuminates BodhisattvaMahāsattvas who are like great kings of mountains then Pratyekabuddhas and then voicehearers Then it illuminates sentient beings definitely on the bodhi path imparting to them vast wisdomknowledge according to their capacities Then it illuminates all other sentient beings even those definitely on the wrong paths providing the causes and conditions for them to receive future benefits and come to  maturity However the radiance of a Tathāgata a wisdom sun does not think I should illuminate Bodhisattvas first and sentient beings definitely on the wrong paths last It impartially emits radiance to illuminate all hindrance free and differentiation free BuddhaSons when the sun or the moon rises it impartially illuminates tall mountains and deep valleys Likewise a Tathāgatas wisdom illuminates all without discrimination However the radiance of His wisdomknowledge differs according to sentient beings preferences and capacities BuddhaSons this is the fourth characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Fifth BuddhaSons when the sun rises sentient beings born blind cannot see it Although they have never seen the sun they still benefit from sunlight Because sunlight enables them to know day and night and seasons to enjoy food and drink and lifesupporting things such as clothing and to make their bodies comfortable and free from troubles such as illnesses from coldness or dampness It is similar for a Tathāgata a wisdom sun Those with no belief and no understanding violate the precepts malign the right views live an evil way of life and cannot see a Buddha a wisdom sun because like the born blind they have no eye of belief Although they do not see a Buddha a wisdom sun they still benefit from that wisdom sun Because a Buddhas awesome power enables sentient beings to end their physical suffering and their afflictions which are the cause of suffering in their future lives BuddhaSons a Tathāgata emits various radiances One radiance is called accumulating merits one is called illuminating all one is called illuminating with purity and ease one is called emitting loud wonderful tones one is called understanding all languages to delight all one is called displaying the commanding state that ends all doubts forever one is called the reliancefree wisdomknowledge that illuminates all with ease one is called the commanding wisdomknowledge that ends all ludicrous statements one is called responsively emitting wonderful tones one is called emitting pure and commanding tones to adorn worlds and bring sentient beings to  maturity BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas every pore emits a thousand kinds of such radiances Five hundred radiances illuminate below five hundred radiances illuminate above When Bodhisattvas in various places of Buddhas in various worlds see these radiances they at once attain a Tathāgatas state Every Bodhisattvas ten heads ten eyes ten ears ten noses ten tongues ten bodies ten hands ten feet Ten Grounds and ten kinds of wisdomknowledge are purified Because he sees these radiances his earlier attainments on Bodhisattva grounds become purer and all his roots of goodness mature as he heads for all wisdomknowledge Riders of the Two Vehicles end all their afflictions a few sentient beings born blind experience happiness in their bodies and their minds become pure gentle and docile capable of cultivating mindfulness all other sentient beings on various lifepaths including hell dwellers hungry ghosts and animals experience happiness are liberated from myriad suffering and after death will be reborn as gods or humans BuddhaSons those sentient beings do not know through what causes and conditions or what spiritual power they have been reborn as gods or humans Those born blind in their previous life think I am a Brahma god I am manifested by a Brahma god Then a Tathāgata who abides in the Samādhi of Universal Command voices sixty kinds of wonderful tones telling them All of you are neither Brahma gods nor manifestations of a Brahma god nor products of the godking akra or the fourgodkingprotectors of the world Your fortunate rebirth is accomplished through a Tathāgatas awesome spiritual power When those sentient beings hear these words through that Buddhas spiritual power they come to know their past lives and great joy arises in their hearts Because of their joy  they naturally form clouds of utpala flowers fragrances music garments canopies banners cylindrical banners powdered incense treasures halfmoonshaped towers with lion banners songs and praises and various adornments and they make that offering to that Tathāgata with reverent minds Because those sentient beings have acquired the pure eye Then that Tathāgata bestows upon them the prophecy of attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi BuddhaSons in this way a Tathāgata a wisdom sun benefits sentient beings born blind enabling them to acquire roots of goodness and come to  maturity BuddhaSons this is the fifth characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Sixth BuddhaSons the moon has four extraordinary and unprecedented abilities What are these four It outshines all stars It displays waxing and waning It casts its reflection in clear waters in Jambudvīpa All viewers see it before them but the moon neither differentiates among them nor makes ludicrous statements about them BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgatas body has four extraordinary and unprecedented abilities What are these four According to sentient beings different needs it displays different lifespans though its life neither lengthens nor shortens Its reflection appears in  bodhi vessels the pure minds of sentient beings in all worlds When sentient beings see it they say The Tathāgata appears before me alone A Tathāgata expounds the Dharma to sentient beings according to their preferences enables them to achieve liberation according to their  levels and enables those ready to be taught to see a Buddhas body Yet a Tathāgatas body neither differentiates among them nor makes ludicrous statements about them as it completes Buddha work BuddhaSons this is the sixth characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Seventh BuddhaSons the great Brahma king of a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Word using a few skillful means enables all sentient beings to see him present before them though he neither makes copies of his body nor has various bodies BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata neither makes copies of his body nor has various bodies As He appears in a body according to sentient beings preferences He does not think about manifesting a certain number of bodies BuddhaSons this is the seventh characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Eighth BuddhaSons there is a medicine king who well knows many medicines and mantras He uses the inexhaustible medicines in Jambudvīpa the power of roots of goodness developed in his past lives and the power of great mantras Using these skillful means he cures illnesses of sentient beings that come to see him When that great medicine king realizes that his life is ending he thinks After my death sentient beings have no one to rely on Now I should demonstrate some skillful means Then he prepares medicine spreads it on his body and recites mantras enabling his body after his death neither to decompose nor to dry out It continues to do things and to see and hear no different from before All the diseases it has treated are cured BuddhaSons it is similar for a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha who is an unsurpassed medicine king Through countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of kalpas He has completed His development of Dharma medicine acquired all skillful means and illumination mantras and arrived at the opposite shore He is skilled in curing sentient beings diseases ie ending their afflictions and in sustaining His life for countless kalpas His body is pure free from deliberation and consumption as it does Buddha work without rest Sentient beings that see it can have their afflictiondiseases cured BuddhaSons this is the eighth characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Ninth BuddhaSons the immense ocean has a great gem called the solar store that collects all radiance If sentient beings touch its light they take on its color if they see it their eyes are purified In every place illuminated by its light the sky rains down a jewel called peace and joy which frees sentient beings from their suffering and gives them comfort BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgatas body is a great gem a store of all virtuous works and vast wisdom If sentient beings touch the precious wisdom light of a Buddhas body they take on the  color of the Buddha body If they see it they acquire the pure Dharmaeye In every place illuminated by its light it frees sentient beings from the suffering of poverty and gives them joy even the joy of Buddha bodhi BuddhaSons as a Tathāgatas dharma body does great Buddha work for all sentient beings it neither differentiates among them nor makes ludicrous statements about them BuddhaSons this is the ninth characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body Tenth BuddhaSons the immense ocean has a wishfulfilling king of jewels called the store of all worldly adornments that can do a million virtuous works Wherever it is it ends sentient beings tribulations and fulfills their wishes However this wishfulfilling jewel cannot be seen by sentient beings with meager merits Likewise a Tathāgatas body called able to delight all sentient beings is a wishfulfilling jewel If sentient beings see His body hear His name or praise His virtue they are enabled to leave behind the painful tribulations of birth and death forever If all sentient beings in all worlds at the same time singlemindedly wish to see a Tathāgata they will be enabled to see Him and have their wishes fulfilled BuddhaSons a Buddhas body cannot be seen by sentient beings with meager merits unless they are ready to be tamed by His spiritual power If after seeing Buddhas body sentient beings can plant their roots of goodness they will be enabled to see a Tathāgatas body in order to bring them to  maturity BuddhaSons this is the tenth characteristic of a Tathāgatas body In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should see His body  because His mind is immeasurable and pervades  the ten directions because His actions are hindrance free like the open sky because He enters everywhere in the dharma realm because He abides in true reality because He has neither birth nor death because He simultaneously abides in the past present and future because He has forever discarded all differentiations because He carries out His vows throughout the endless future because He purifies all worlds because He adorns every one of His Buddha bodies   Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse The open sky extends in the ten directions As if physical but nonphysical as if existent but nonexistent Countless bodies of past present and future sentient beings Are everywhere in all worlds Likewise the true bodies  of Buddhas Pervade all dharma realms Invisible and impossible to capture To transform sentient beings they take shapes Although the open sky cannot be captured It allows sentient beings to do karmas It never thinks about what it does Why it does anything or for whom it does anything Likewise a Buddhas body karmas Enable sentient beings to do good dharmas They never think I have done various things for them The sun rises in Jambudvīpa And its radiance dispels darkness without exception Mountains trees lakes flowers other things on earth And various sentient species receive its benefits Likewise the rise of a Buddha sun Enables the good works of gods and humans to increase Dispels the darkness of ignorance forever and brings sentient beings the radiance of wisdom For them to find glory and joy When sunlight appears It first illuminates the kings of mountains then other mountains Then plateaus and then the great earth Yet the sun never differentiates among them Likewise the radiance of a Sugata First illuminates Bodhisattvas then Pratyekabuddhas Then voicehearers and then other sentient beings Yet a Buddha never thinks even one thought Those born blind cannot see the sun But sunlight still benefits them Enabling them to know seasons enjoy food and drink Leave troubles behind and enjoy comfort Likewise nonbelievers cannot see a Buddha But a Buddha still benefits them Those who hear His name or touches His radiance Will for this reason attain bodhi The pure moon in the sky Outshines stars and displays its waxing and waning It casts its reflection in all waters and All viewers think that the moon is before them Likewise a Tathāgata a pure moon Outshines the Two Vehicles and displays an appropriate lifespan His reflection appears in the water contained in all bodhi vessels the pure minds of gods and humans Who say that He is before them Although the Brahma king remains in his palace He appears everywhere in a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World Although all humans and gods see him He does not make copies of his body for them Likewise a Buddha appears everywhere In worlds in the ten directions Although His bodies are countless He neither makes copies of His body nor differentiates the viewers There is a medicine king versed in healing arts and Those who see him are cured of their illnesses He spreads medicine on this body so that After death he can continue to work as before Likewise a Buddha a supreme medicine king Equipped with skillful means all wisdomknowledge And  past wondrous actions appears in a Buddhas body Sentient beings that see it end their afflictions The king of jewels in the ocean Emits immeasurable radiance Those who touch its radiance take on its color Those who see its radiance open the pure eye It is similar for a Buddha a supreme treasure king Those who touch His radiance take on His  color Those who see His radiance open the five eyes Dispel the darkness of ignorance and abide on the Buddha ground A wishfulfilling jewel Fulfills all wishes Sentient beings with meager merits cannot see it But this king of jewels never discriminates against them Likewise a Sugata a supreme treasure king Fulfills all wishes Nonbelievers cannot see a Buddha But a Sugata never abandons them  Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment fascicle  Translated from the digital Chinese Canon    Notes    Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment   Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Tang Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master ikṣānanda from Yutian   Fascicle     Chapter b  A Tathāgatas Appearance in the World Continued   A Tathāgatas Voice   BuddhaSons what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva know about the voice of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that a Tathāgatas voice is pervasive encompassing countless tones a Tathāgatas voice delights its hearers according their preferences because it clearly expounds the Dharma a Tathāgatas voice delights its hearers according to the levels of their faith and understanding because it cools their minds a Tathāgatas voice gives timely teachings that are heard by those ready to hear them a Tathāgatas voice has neither birth nor death because it is like an echo a Tathāgatas voice has no master because it arises from His past good karmas a Tathāgatas voice is profound because it is beyond measure a Tathāgatas voice is never twisted because it arises from the dharmarealm a Tathāgatas voice is ceaseless because it enters everywhere in the dharma realm a Tathāgatas voice never changes because it conveys the ultimate truth BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that a Tathāgatas voice is neither measurable nor immeasurable has neither a master nor no master and neither expresses nor does not express anything  Ten Characteristics of a Tathāgatas Voice  First BuddhaSons when a world is in the process of destruction without a master or a maker four sounds naturally arise What are these four The first sound says All of you  should know that the peace and joy of the first dhyāna are free from desire and evil surpassing those of the desire realm After hearing these words sentient beings naturally attain the first dhyāna abandon their desirerealm bodies and are reborn as gods in a Brahma heaven The second sound says All of you should know that the peace and joy of the second dhyāna are free from perception and observation surpassing those of a Brahma heaven After hearing these words sentient beings naturally attain the second dhyāna abandon their Brahma bodies and are reborn in Pure Radiance  Heaven The third sound says All of you should know that the peace and joy of the third dhyāna are free from faults surpassing those of Pure Radiance Heaven After hearing these words sentient beings naturally attain the third dhyāna abandon their bodies with pure radiance and are reborn in Pervasive Splendor  Heaven The fourth sound says All of you should know that the quietness of the fourth dhyāna surpasses that of Pervasive Splendor Heaven After hearing this sentient beings naturally attain the fourth dhyāna abandon their bodies with pervasive splendor and are reborn in Massive Fruition  Heaven BuddhaSons these four sounds have neither a master nor a maker but are produced by the power of sentient beings good karmas BuddhaSons it is similar for a Tathāgatas voice It has neither a master nor a maker it neither enters nor exists anywhere nor does it differentiate  However through the power of a Tathāgatas virtuous works four pervasive sounds arise What are these four The first sound says All of you should know that all sentient beings as processes  undergo suffering such as the suffering of hell dwellers the suffering of animals the suffering of hungry ghosts the suffering of lacking merits the suffering of fixation on having a self and its belongings and the suffering of doing evil Those who wish to be reborn as gods or humans should plant rootsofgoodness in order to be reborn in heaven or the human world away from difficult places After hearing these words sentient beings discard their inverted views train in good actions leave difficult places and are reborn as gods or humans The second sound says All of you should know that all processes experience burning pains like hot iron pellets While processes are impermanent and always deteriorate to an end nirvāṇa is quiet peaceful and joyful free from burning pains and blazing suffering beyond causes and conditions After hearing these words sentient beings diligently train in good dharmas and acquire the endurance in hearing the sounds The third sound says All of you should know that riders of the VoiceHearer Vehicle follow others words because their wisdom is low There is a higher vehicle called the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle whose riders realize the truth without a teacher You should learn to ride it After hearing these words those who prefer a higher path abandon the path of voicehearers and ride the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle The fourth sound says All of you should know that a vehicle higher than the first two vehicles is the Mahāyāna Its riders are Bodhisattvas who practice the sixpāramitās ceaselessly take Bodhisattva actions never abandon the bodhimind and tirelessly undergo countless births and deaths Higher than the TwoVehicles this vehicle is called the Mahāyāna the foremost vehicle the excellent vehicle the supreme vehicle the superior vehicle the unexcelled vehicle and the vehicle that benefits all sentient beings After hearing these words sentient beings activate the bodhi mind if they have great faith and understanding vigorous and keen faculties roots of goodness planted in their past lives higher aspirations the longing to attain Buddhahood and the support of Tathāgatas spiritual power BuddhaSons this is the first characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Second BuddhaSons an echo arises from a sound in a valley It has neither shape nor form cannot be seen and never differentiates  Yet it follows speech sounds It is similar for a Tathāgatas voice It has neither shape nor form cannot be seen and has neither a location nor no location Yet it arises according to sentient beings wishes and understandings Its nature is the ultimate  without words or expressions and cannot be described BuddhaSons this is the second characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Third BuddhaSons gods have a great Dharma drum called the awakener When gods act without selfrestraint it makes sounds in the sky telling them All of you should know that all pleasures are impermanent unreal and inverted perishing in a short while Yet they swindle fools into becoming attached to them You should never abandon selfrestraint If you abandon it you will be reborn to go down an evil lifepath Then your remorse will come too late When selfindulgent gods hear these words out of anxiety and fear they relinquish the pleasures in their celestial palaces and go to their godking asking for ways to seek bodhi BuddhaSons that celestial drums sounds have neither a master nor a maker they neither arise nor perish but they can benefit innumerable sentient beings It is similar for a Tathāgatas voice To awaken sentient beings without selfrestraint He voices immeasurable wondrous Dharma sounds such as the sound of no attachment the sound of exercising selfrestraint the sound of impermanence  the sound of suffering the sound of no self the sound of impurity the sound of eradication  the sound of nirvāṇa the sound of immeasurable innate wisdomknowledge  the sound of indestructible Bodhisattva actions and the sound that arises from the ground of a Tathāgatas effortless wisdomknowledge and reaches everywhere He voices such sounds that pervade the dharma realm to awaken sentient beings After hearing these sounds innumerable sentient beings feel joy and diligently train in good dharmas each seeking liberation through his chosen vehicle whether the VoiceHearer Vehicle the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle or the unsurpassed Bodhisattva Vehicle the Mahāyāna Yet a Tathāgatas voice abides in no location and contains no words BuddhaSons this is the third characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Fourth BuddhaSons the godking Maheśvara has a beautiful attendant called Benevolent Mouth When her mouth emits a sound it accords with  kinds of music each producing  different tones BuddhaSons as Benevolent Mouth can emit from her mouth a sound that produces countless tones so too can a Tathāgata Each of His sounds produces countless tones that reach all sentient beings according to their various preferences enabling them to understand  BuddhaSons this is the fourth characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Fifth BuddhaSons the godking Great Brahmā resides in his Brahma palace and emits Brahma sounds which are heard by all Brahma gods but not others All Brahma gods think The godking Great Brahmā speaks to me alone It is similar for a Tathāgatas voice The multitude in His bodhimaṇḍa hears His wondrous voice but it does not go outside that multitude Why not Because those with immature capacities should not hear it All hearers think The TathāgataBhagavān speaks to me alone BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas voice neither arises nor abides but it can accomplish all works This is the fifth characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Sixth BuddhaSons all waters have the same flavor but can be differentiated according to their vessels Yet water neither thinks nor differentiates  Likewise a Tathāgatas speaking voice has only one flavor the flavor of liberation but it has countless differences according to sentient beings different mind vessels Yet His voice neither thinks nor differentiates  This is the sixth characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Seventh BuddhaSons the dragonking Anavatapta  forms enormous dense clouds and pours down rains throughout Jambudvīpa enabling all grains and crops to grow and filling rivers and lakes This vast rainwater does not come from that dragonkings body or mind but it can benefit sentient beings in various ways He forms clouds of great compassion that cover worlds in the tendirections and pours down everywhere Dharma rains of unsurpassed sweet dew delighting all sentient beings expanding their good works and sustaining all vehicles  BuddhasSons a Tathāgatas voice comes from neither inside nor outside but it can benefit all sentient beings This is seventh characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Eighth BuddhaSons when the dragonking Manasvin  wants to pour down rains he does not do it immediately He first forms enormous clouds that cover the open sky for seven days waiting for sentient beings to finish their work Because that great dragonking has lovingkindness and compassion and does not want to disturb or distress sentient beings After seven days he sprinkles light rains to wet and nurture the great earth When He wants to pour down Dharma rains He does not do it immediately He first forms Dharma clouds to bring sentient beings to  maturity enabling them not to be astonished or terrified After they have come to maturity He pours down everywhere Dharma rains of sweet dew expounding the profound and wondrous Dharma enabling sentient beings gradually to satiate themselves with the unsurpassed Dharma flavor of a Tathāgatas  knowledge of all wisdomknowledge BuddhaSons this is the eighth characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Ninth BuddhaSons in the ocean is a greatdragon king called Great Magnificence When he pours down rains he pours down    or even  kinds of magnificent rains BuddhaSons the rainwater is the same but that dragonking uses his inconceivable power to make the rains magnificent with  or even countless differences When He showers down the sweet dew of the Dharma He voices     or  tones to expound  actions or even countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of tones to expound the Dharma delighting the hearers However a Tathāgatas voice never differentiates its hearers Because Buddhas have achieved perfect purity in the profound dharma realm They can voice various speech tones to delight sentient beings according to their capacities BuddhaSons this is the ninth characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Tenth BuddhaSons when the dragonking Sāgara  wants to display a dragonkings commanding power to benefit and delight sentient beings he forms a huge web of clouds that covers all places from the fourcontinents to the sixth desire heaven These clouds come in countless different colors such as the radiant colors of Jambūnada gold aquamarine  silver crystal musāragalva  emerald red pearl superb treasures immeasurable fragrances taintfree garments pure waters and various adornments After this web of clouds has spread everywhere all clouds flash lightning in various colors

lightning in the colors of pure waters multicolored clouds flash onecolored lightning onecolored clouds flash multicolored lightning After flashing lightning these clouds rumble various thunders to delight sentient beings according to their minds These thunders sound like gods playing music goddessdaughters singing dragondaughters singing gandharvadaughters singing kinaradaughters singing the great earth quaking waves of ocean tides lapping animalkings roaring songbirds chirping or countless other sounds After rumbling thunders these clouds blow cool breezes to delight sentient beings hearts Then they pour down various kinds of rains to benefit innumerable sentient beings bringing them peace and joy They pour down different rains in different places from the sixth desire heaven to the earth Into the immense ocean they rain down clear and cool water called endless in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven  they rain down various kinds of music called beautiful such as pipe and flute music

garments called coverings in dragonkings palaces they rain down red pearls called gushing radiance in asuras palaces they rain down weapons called conquering enemies in Uttarakuru  they rain down various flowers called blooming in the other three continents they pour down different rains befitting different places Although different rains fall in different places that dragonking has an impartial mind and never differentiates between this and that Because sentient beings roots of goodness differ the rains differ BuddhaSons it is similar for a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha In order to use the true Dharma to teach and transform sentient beings he forms clouds of bodies that pervade the dharma realm and appears in different bodies according to sentient beings desires and preferences For sentient beings He forms the cloud of bodies that arrive through birth the cloud of miraculously manifested bodies the cloud of bodies sustained by spiritual power the cloud of physical bodies the cloud of bodies with excellent characteristics the cloud of merit bodies the cloud of wisdom bodies the cloud of indestructible bodies the cloud of fearless bodies or the cloud of dharmarealm bodies BuddhaSons a Tathāgata forms clouds of countless bodies that cover all worlds in the ten directions According to sentient beings preferences such clouds each flash various kinds of radiant lightning For sentient beings they flash radiant lightning called reaching everywhere radiant lightning called boundless light radiant lightning called entering a Buddhas secret teachings radiant lightning called reflected radiance radiant lightning called pure luminosity radiant lightning called entering endless dhāraṇī doors radiant lightning called rightmindfulness undistracted radiant lightning called ultimately indestructible radiant lightning called willingly entering lifepaths or radiant lightning called fulfilling all wishes to make all happy BuddhaSons after flashing such countless kinds of radiant lightning a Tathāgata according to sentient beings preferences rumbles thunders of countless samādhis such as thunder of the samādhi of enlightenment wisdomknowledge  thunder of the samādhi of the radiant and taintfree ocean thunder of the samādhi of command of all dharmas thunder of the samādhi of vajra wheels thunder of the samādhi of Mount Sumeru banners thunder of the samādhi of the ocean seal thunder of the samādhi of the sun lamp thunder of the samādhi of the inexhaustible store or thunder of the samādhi of the power of indestructible liberation BuddhaSons after a Tathāgatas clouds of bodies have rumbled thunders of countless different samādhis before pouring down Dharma rains these clouds display an auspicious sign to enlighten sentient beings they display the wind wheel of a Tathāgatas great wisdomknowledge  called enabling all sentient beings to have inconceivable joy and comfort which arises from His hindrancefree mind of great lovingkindness and compassion After this sign is displayed all Bodhisattvas and sentient beings bodies and minds cool down Then a Tathāgatas great cloud of dharma body great cloud of lovingkindness and compassion and great inconceivable cloud pour down great Dharma rains purifying all sentient beings bodies and minds The great Dharma rain for Bodhisattvas who are seated in bodhimaṇḍas  is called the nodifferentiation dharma realm The great Dharma rain for Bodhisattvas in their final bodies  is called Bodhisattvas who playfully handle a Tathāgatas secret

beings The great Dharma rain for sentient beings that seek the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle is called knowing deeply that realization of dependent arising of dharmas is free from duality  and leads to indestructible liberation The great Dharma rain for sentient beings that seek the VoiceHearer Vehicle is called using the sword of great wisdom to sever all afflictions The great Dharma rain for those who expand their roots of goodness and those who are decisive or indecisive about their paths is called going through various Dharma doors with great joy BuddhaSons BuddhaTathāgatas follow sentient beings minds to pour down such great Dharma rains filling countless worlds Because sentient beings capacities differ His Dharma rains display differences This is the tenth characteristic of a Tathāgatas voice In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice Moreover BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas voice is immeasurable like ten things What are these ten His voice is immeasurable  like a Buddhas state because it enters a Buddhas dharma realm BuddhaSons the voice of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha is immeasurable for asakhyeya reasons In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His voice  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse When a ThreeThousandLargeThousandfoldWorld is in the process of destruction Through the power of sentient beings good karmas a sound arises telling them that The fourth dhyāna heaven  is quiet and free from suffering Advising them to leave the desire realm It is similar for a WorldHonoredOne who has the TenPowers He voices wonderful tones that pervade the dharma realm Telling sentient beings that all processes are painful and impermanent Advising them to cross the ocean of birth and death for good A huge valley in a deep mountain Responds to sounds with echoes Although an echo follows someones speech It never differentiates its hearers It is similar for a Buddhas voice Which is heard by sentient beings with mature capacities Enabling them to be docile and joyful But has no thought that it can speak The celestial drum called the awakener Rumbles Dharma sounds in the sky Admonishing godsons without selfrestraint Enabling them to discard their attachments It is similar for a Buddhas Dharma drum It makes various wonderful sounds Awakening all sentient beings Enabling them to harvest bodhi fruit The godking Maheśvara has a precious female attendant Whose mouth emits various kinds of music Each sound of music produces  tones and Each tone in turn produces  tones It is similar for a Sugatas voice His voice produces all tones Which differ according to sentient beings natures and desires Enabling the hearers to end their afflictions The godking Brahmā emits a sound Which delights all Brahma gods But does not go outside them Every Brahma god thinks that he alone hears it It is similar for a Buddha a Dharma King Whose speaking voice fills the dharma realm It benefits only those in His assemblies not those outside Because nonbelievers do not accept it Various kinds of water are of the same nature And even waterwiththeeightvirtues tastes the same Water tastes of different flavors Because of its different places or vessels It is similar for the voice of one with all wisdomknowledge Although dharma nature has only one flavor Sentient beings hear different teachings Because of their different ways The great dragonking Anavatapta Pours down rains to water the earth of Jambudvīpa Enabling trees and grass to grow But the rainwater does not come from his body or mind It is similar for a Buddhas wondrous voice It pours down Dharma rains to fill the dharma realm Enabling sentient beings to stop doing evil and to do good But His voice comes from neither inside nor outside The dragonking Manasvin Before pouring down rains forms clouds for seven days Waiting for sentient beings to finish their work Then he pours down rains to benefit them He transforms sentient beings bringing them to  maturity Then He expounds the profound Dharma Enabling the hearers not to be astonished or terrified The dragonking Great Magnificence lives in the ocean He pours down    Or even  kinds of magnificent rains Although the rainwater comes in only one flavor the magnificent rains have differences He expounds     Or even countless Dharma Doors But He never thinks about differentiating their users The unexcelled dragonking Sāgara Forms clouds that cover the four continents Pours down different rains in different places But never has any thought of differentiating them It is similar for a Buddha a Dharma King He forms the cloud of great compassion that pervades everywhere in worlds in the ten directions Pours down different Dharma rains for those who take different actions But never differentiates them  Ten Characteristics of a Tathāgatas Mind  BuddhaSons what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattvas know about the mind of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas mind intellect and consciousness cannot be captured You should come to know a Tathāgatas mind through His immeasurable wisdom First all things rely on the open sky but the open sky relies on nothing Similarly all worldly and supraworldly wisdomknowledge relies on a Tathāgatas wisdom but a Tathāgatas wisdom relies on nothing BuddhaSons this is the first characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Second BuddhaSons the dharma realm sees the liberation of voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and Bodhisattvas but the dharma realm neither increases nor decreases It is similar for a Tathāgatas wisdom It produces various kinds of worldly and supraworldly wisdomknowledge but a Tathāgatas wisdom neither increases nor decreases BuddhaSons this is the second characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Yet the immense ocean never thinks I provide them with water It is similar for the water in a Buddhas ocean of wisdom It flows into all sentient beings minds If they observe their mental states and go through Dharma Doors they will acquire radiant wisdom Yet a Tathāgatas ocean of wisdom is impartial and never thinks I give sentient beings wisdom Because their mental activities are different they acquire different kinds of wisdom BuddhaSons this is the third characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Fourth BuddhaSons the immense ocean has four precious gems They have countless virtues and can produce all treasures in the ocean If the immense ocean did not have these gems it could not have even one treasure What are these four The first is called accumulating treasures the second is called inexhaustible store the third is called free from burning the fourth is called full of splendors BuddhaSons ordinary beings dragons and gods cannot see these four precious gems Why not Because the dragonking Sāgara keeps them in a secret place in his palace BuddhaSons it is similar for the ocean of great wisdom of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha It has four precious gems of great wisdom They have immeasurable merit and wisdom hence can produce gems of wisdom for all sentient beings voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas those who are still learning  those who have nothing more to learn  and Bodhisattvas What are these four They are  the gem of great wisdom to transform sentient beings at the right times If a Tathāgatas ocean of great wisdom did not have these four precious gems not even one sentient being could ride the Mahāyāna However sentient beings with a meager store of merits cannot see these four gems of great wisdom Why not Because they are kept in a Tathāgatas secret store Impartial upright pure and superb these four gems of wisdom can benefit all Bodhisattvas enabling them to acquire radiant wisdom BuddhaSons this is the fourth characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Fifth BuddhaSons at the bottom of the immense ocean are four jewels with glowing radiance They are extremely hot and can absorb the water poured in from hundreds of rivers Hence the immense ocean neither increases nor decreases What are these four The first is called solar store the second is called removing water the third is called light of flames the fourth is called nothing left behind BuddhaSons if the immense ocean did not have these four jewels all places from the four continents to Akaniṣṭha Heaven  would be submerged BuddhaSons when the radiance of the solarstore jewel touches ocean water ocean water becomes milk when the radiance of the removingwater jewel touches milk milk becomes cream when the radiance of the lightofflames jewel touches cream cream becomes butter when the radiance of the nothingleftbehind jewel touches butter like blazing fire burning away everything butter becomes ghee BuddhaSons it is similar for a Tathāgatas ocean of great wisdom It has four jewels of great wisdomknowledge They have immeasurable virtue and radiance Their light touches Bodhisattvas and enables them to acquire a Tathāgatas great wisdomknowledge What are these four The first is the jewel of great wisdomknowledge of stopping all waves of intermittent goodness the second is the jewel of great wisdomknowledge of ending all love of dharmas  the third is the jewel of great wisdomknowledge of illuminating all with wisdom light the fourth is the jewel of great wisdomknowledge that equals a Tathāgatas boundless and effortless wisdomknowledge BuddhaSons when Bodhisattvas train to complete all bodhi elements they stir up countless waves of intermittent goodness that cannot be stopped by gods asuras or humans in the entire world Then a Tathāgata uses the radiance of the jewel of great wisdomknowledge of stopping all waves of intermittent goodness to touch these Bodhisattvas enabling them to discard the waves and focus their minds on only one object abiding in samādhi Then He uses the radiance of the jewel of great wisdomknowledge of ending all love of dharmas to touch these Bodhisattvas enabling them to discard their attachment to the experience of samādhi and acquire vast transcendent powers Then He uses the radiance of the jewel of great wisdomknowledge of illuminating all with wisdom light to touch these Bodhisattvas enabling them to relinquish their vast transcendental powers and take radiant and effortful actions Then He uses the radiance of the jewel of great wisdomknowledge that equals a Tathāgatas boundless and effortless wisdomknowledge to touch these Bodhisattvas enabling them to outgrow their radiant and effortful actions and arrive on the Tathāgata ground of equality completely ending all effort with nothing left behind BuddhaSons unless touched by the radiance of a Tathāgatas four jewels of great wisdomknowledge not even one Bodhisattva can arrive on the Tathāgata ground BuddhaSons this is the fifth characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Sixth BuddhaSons between the water wheel  and Neither with Nor without Perception Heaven  a large thousandfold world where all sentient beings reside in the desire realm form realm and formless realm arises from and abides in the open sky Because the open sky pervades everywhere Yet the open sky which contains the ThreeRealmsofExistence makes no differentiations Because all wisdomknowledge whether of voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas Bodhisattvas saskṛta actions or asaskṛta actions arises from and abides in a Tathāgatas wisdom Because a Tathāgatas wisdom pervades everywhere Although it contains immeasurable wisdomknowledge it makes no differentiations BuddhaSons this is the sixth characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Seventh BuddhaSons atop the Snow  Mountain is a great medicinal tree called endless roots Its roots arise from the water wheel  yojanas below the vajra ground  When this medicinal tree grows its roots it makes all trees in Jambudvīpa grow their roots When it grows its stems it makes all trees in Jambudvīpa grow their stems Similarly it grows its branches leaves flowers and fruits Its roots grow its stems its stems grow its roots Because its roots have no end it is called endless roots BuddhaSons this medicinal tree fosters growth everywhere except two places the abyss of hell and the midst of the water wheel However this tree never abandons them BuddhaSons it is similar for the great medicinal tree of a Tathāgatas wisdom It uses wisdom and all good dharmas activated and accomplished in its past to cover the realm of all sentient beings It uses as its roots the vast vow of compassion to end the suffering on all evil lifepaths It uses as its stems firm and unwavering skillful means that arise from all Tathāgatas true wisdom and charactertype BuddhaSons why is this great medicinal tree of a Tathāgatas wisdom called endless roots Because it never rests and it never stops guiding Bodhisattva actions Bodhisattva actions are Tathāgata nature Tathāgata nature is Bodhisattva actions Hence this great medicinal tree of a Tathāgatas wisdom is called endless roots BuddhaSons when its roots grow it enables all Bodhisattvas to grow their roots ie to expand their great lovingkindness and compassion that never abandon sentient beings When its stems grow it enables all Bodhisattvas to grow their stems ie to develop their firm vigorous and profound minds When its branches grow it enables all Bodhisattvas to grow their branches ie to enhance their practice of all pāramitās When its leaves grow it enables all Bodhisattvas to grow their leaves ie to acquire the virtues of a dhūta  who observes his precepts with purity and has little desire but much contentment When its flowers bloom it enables all Bodhisattvas to open their flowers ie to be equipped with roots of goodness excellent  marks and adornments When its fruits ripen it enables all Bodhisattvas to harvest their fruits ie to have endurance in realizing that dharmas have no birth and endurance in knowing that Buddhas have poured sweet dew on the crowns of their heads BuddhaSons in only two places does this great medicinal tree of a Tathāgatas wisdom fail to foster growth the water of greed and tremendously wrong views in which are drowned those who are not Dharma vessels and those with broken roots of goodness However this tree never abandons them BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas wisdom neither increases nor decreases because its roots abide well and keep growing without rest BuddhaSons this is the seventh characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Eighth BuddhaSons when the fire at end of the kalpa of a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Word ignites it burns away all grass and woods Even the Iron Mountain Range and the Great Iron Mountain Range are burnt away with nothing left behind BuddhaSons if someone throws some dried grass into that fire will it fail to burn  No it will burn  BuddhaSons even if it were possible that the dried grass would fail to burn it is impossible that a Tathāgatas wisdom fails to know something because it knows all past present and future sentient beings all worlds all kalpas and all dharmas There is nothing that it does not know Because a Tathāgatas wisdom knows all things with equal clarity BuddhaSons this is the eighth characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Ninth BuddhaSons when the wind catastrophe begins to destroy a world a huge wind called the disintegrator rises and it can destroy a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World because it breaks all things including the Iron Mountain Range into dust particles Another huge wind called the blocker arises and it can confine the disintegrator wind to a given ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World blocking it from going to worlds in other directions BuddhaSons without this blocker wind all worlds in the ten directions would be destroyed It is similar for a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha He has a wind of great wisdomknowledge called the terminator and it can terminate all Bodhisattvas afflictions and habits He has another wind of great wisdomknowledge called the skillful supporter It skillfully supports Bodhisattvas who have immature capacities and prevents the terminator wind of great wisdomknowledge from terminating all their afflictions and habits BuddhaSons without a Tathāgatas skillfulsupporter wind of great wisdom knowledge innumerable Bodhisattvas would fall onto the ground of voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas Because of this wind all Bodhisattvas are enabled to transcend the ground of the Two Vehicles ultimately to assume the position of a Tathāgata BuddhaSons this is the ninth characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind Tenth BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas wisdom is everywhere Because all sentient beings have a Tathāgatas wisdom However because of their deluded perceptions inverted views and attachments they do not realize it If they can discard their deluded perceptions then their  overall wisdomknowledge innate wisdomknowledge and hindrancefree wisdomknowledge will be revealed It contains exhaustive records of all things about a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World such as things about the Great Iron Mountain in a record the size of this mountain things about the great earth in a record the size of the earth things about a small thousandfold world in a record the size of that world and things about a medium thousandfold world in a record the size of that world This file contains records of all things about all places whether the four continents the immense ocean Mount Sumeru gods palaces on earth celestial palaces in the desire realm celestial palaces in the form realm or celestial palaces in the formless realm the record of every place being the size of the place Although this enormous file is the size of a large thousandfold world it abides in a tiny dust particle As it is with one dust particle so it is with all Then someone with radiant wisdom and the pure godeye sees that this file contained in a dust particle does not provide any benefit to sentient beings He thinks I should use the power of my vigor to break that tiny dust particle and release this file enabling it to benefit all sentient beings Having had this thought he breaks that dust particle and releases this great file enabling all sentient beings to receive its benefits As it is with one dust particle so it is with all BuddhaSons it is similar for a Tathāgatas wisdom It is immeasurable and hindrance free and can benefit all sentient beings It is fully contained in sentient beings bodies However the ordinary and the foolish have attachments and deluded perceptions and neither know it nor are aware of it so they cannot receive its benefits Then a Tathāgata observes all sentient beings in the dharma realm with His hindrancefree pure wisdomeye and speaks these words Amazing Amazing Why do these sentient beings deluded and confused not know and not see that they have a Tathāgatas wisdom I will teach them the holy path enabling them to discard forever their attachments and deluded perceptions Then they will be able to see within themselves vast Tathāgata wisdom no different from a Buddhas Then He teaches sentient beings to train on the holy path enabling them to discard their deluded perceptions After discarding their deluded perceptions they realize their immeasurable Tathāgata wisdom benefit all others and bring them peace and joy BuddhaSons this is the tenth characteristic of a Tathāgatas mind In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know His mind BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva through such immeasurable hindrancefree inconceivable and vast characteristics can know the mind of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse To know a Buddhas mind You should observe a Buddhas wisdom Bodhisattvas applied wisdomknowledge and Sentient beings various pleasures Rely on Buddha wisdom But Buddha wisdom relies on nothing The dharma realm sees The liberation of voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and Buddhas But the dharma realm neither increases nor decreases It is similar for a Buddhas wisdom It produces all wisdomknowledge But it neither increases nor decreases And has neither birth nor death As water flows under the ground Those who seek water will get it Water has neither thinking nor ending But it is useful everywhere in the ten directions It is similar for a Buddhas wisdom Which is fully contained in sentient beings minds Those who diligently train for bodhi Will quickly acquire radiant wisdom A dragonking has four gems That can produce all treasures They are kept in a deep and secret place And cannot be seen by ordinary beings It is similar for a Buddhas four kinds of wisdomknowledge That produce all other kinds of wisdomknowledge No one can see them Except great Bodhisattvas The ocean has four jewels That can absorb all water Enabling the ocean not to overflow Or to increase or decrease It is similar for a Tathāgatas wisdom It can stop all waves  and end all love of dharmas It is vast and boundless And can give birth to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas Between the water wheel and the top heaven in the formless realm The desire realm the form realm and the formless realm Rely on the open sky But the open sky makes no differentiations The wisdomknowledge of voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas And Bodhisattvas Relies on a Buddhas wisdom But a Buddhas wisdom makes no differentiations The medicinal tree in the Snow Mountain Is called endless roots It can make all trees Grow their roots stems leaves flowers and fruits It is similar for a Buddhas wisdom Which is born from the Tathāgata seed After it is revealed It produces Bodhisattva actions Suppose someone throws dried grass Into the fire blazing at the end of a kalpa Which burns even the Vajra Mountain down to nothing How can the dried grass fail to burn Even if it were possible that the grass would fail to burn It is impossible that a Buddha fails to know something He knows all past present and future sentient beings In all kalpas and in all worlds At the end of a kalpa arises a wind called the disintegrator Which can destroy a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World If it were not blocked by another wind It could destroy countless worlds It is similar for a Tathāgatas wind of great wisdomknowledge That terminates Bodhisattvas afflictions There is an enormous file The size of a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World As it is contained in one dust particle So it is contained in all dust particles A wise man with the pure godeye Sees it clearly He breaks the dust particle and releases the file To benefit all sentient beings It is similar for a Buddhas wisdom Which pervades sentient beings minds Sentient beings fettered by their deluded perceptions Neither know it nor are aware of it Out of great lovingkindness and compassion Buddhas enable sentient beings to end their deluded perceptions Reveal their Buddha wisdom And benefit all others  Mahāvaipulya Sūtra of Buddha Adornment fascicle  Translated from the digital Chinese Canon    Notes    See eighteenheavensintheformrealm in the glossary A similar description of the destruction of a world is given in the Sūtra of the Upāsaka Precepts fascicle   BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has acquired hindrancefree wisdom knows that the state of a Tathāgata is the state of the entire world the state of the three time frames  the state of all worlds the state of all dharmas the state of all sentient beings the state of differentiationfree truesuchness the state of the hindrancefree dharmarealm the state of boundless true reality the state of the immeasurable open sky and the state of no state BuddhaSons as these states from the state of the entire world and the state of the three time frames to the state of no state are immeasurable so too is the state of a Tathāgata As the state of no state contains nothing everywhere so too does the state of a Tathāgata BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that the state of a Tathāgata is the state of ones mind As the state of ones mind is immeasurable and boundless with neither bondage nor liberation so too the state of a Tathāgata is immeasurable and boundless with neither bondage nor liberation Because through thinking and differentiation immeasurable things manifest BuddhaSons a great dragonking follows his mind to pour down rains and the rains come from neither inside nor outside Likewise a Tathāgata follows His thinking and differentiation and immeasurable things manifest They do not come from anywhere  in the tendirections BuddhaSons the water in the immense ocean arises from the power of the dragonkings mind Likewise BuddhaTathāgatas ocean of all wisdomknowledge arises from Their past great vows BuddhaSons the ocean of all wisdomknowledge is immeasurable boundless inconceivable and ineffable However I will briefly describe it with an analogy You should hearken BuddhaSons in Jambudvīpa   rivers flow into the immense ocean in Aparagodānīya   rivers flow into the immense ocean in Pūrvavideha   rivers flow into the immense ocean in Uttarakuru   rivers flow into the immense ocean BuddhaSons on these four continents  rivers continuously flow into the immense ocean Is the water not copious  Very copious  BuddhaSons the dragonking Ten Beams of Light pours into the immense ocean twice the amount of water poured by all those rivers The dragonking Hundred Beams of Light pours into the immense ocean twice the amount of water poured by Ten Beams of Light Moreover there are eighty koṭi great dragonkings such as the dragonkings Great Magnificence Manasvin  Thunder Rumble Nanda Upananda Immeasurable Radiance Timely Rain Great Victory and Great Thrust One after another they pour down rains into the immense ocean each dragonking pouring twice the amount of water poured by the preceding dragonking The dragonking Sāgaras  crown prince Jambū Banner pours into the immense ocean twice the amount of water poured by the last of those dragonkings BuddhaSons the water that flows into the immense ocean from the palace of the dragonking Ten Beams of Light is twice the amount poured by Jambū Banner The water that flows into the immense ocean from the palace of the dragonking Hundred Beams of Light is twice the amount from the palace of Ten Beams of Light The eighty koṭi great dragonkings such as the dragonkings Great Magnificence Manasvin Thunder Rumble Nanda Upananda Immeasurable Radiance Timely Rain Great Victory and Great Thrust live in their own palaces The water that flows into the immense ocean from each palace is twice the amount from its preceding palace The water that flows into the ocean from the palace of the dragonking Sāgaras crown prince Jambū Banner is twice the amount from the palace of the last of those dragonkings The dragonking Sāgara pours into the immense ocean twice the amount of water that flows from Jambū Banners palace The water that flows into the immense ocean from Sāgaras palace is twice the amount poured by him This water is violet in color and surges according to a schedule That is why ocean tides are regular BuddhaSons such an immense ocean contains immeasurable water countless treasures and innumerable sentient beings The great earth it relies on is also immeasurable BuddhaSons what is your opinion Is this ocean immeasurable  It is immeasurable beyond analogy  BuddhaSons the immeasurability of this immense ocean is less than one hundredth one thousandth and even one upaniṣadth  of the immeasurability of a Tathāgatas ocean of wisdom Analogies can be made according to sentient beings minds but a Buddhas state is beyond analogy BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that a Tathāgatas ocean of wisdom is immeasurable because He has taken all Bodhisattva actions ceaselessly since His initial activation of the bodhimind he should know that a Tathāgata has accumulated immeasurable treasures because all bodhi elements  and the seeds of the ThreeJewels never end he should know that a Tathāgata benefits innumerable sentient beings because Pratyekabuddhas voicehearers those who are still learning  and those who have nothing more to learn  appreciate the Dharma he should know that the abiding grounds revealed by a Tathāgata are immeasurable because Bodhisattvas abide on these grounds from the first ground the Joyful Ground to the ultimate hindrancefree ground  BuddhaSons to develop immeasurable wisdom and benefit all sentient beings in this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know the state of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse As the state of ones mind is immeasurable So too is the state of a Buddha As the state of ones mind arises from consciousness One should observe the state of a Buddha through the state of ones mind A dragonking that does not leave its own place Pours down massive rains through the power of his mind The rainwater that comes from nowhere and goes to nowhere Falls copiously according to the dragonkings mind Likewise a Buddha who has the Tenpowers Comes from nowhere and goes to nowhere To those with pure minds He appears In a body the size of the dharma realm which can enter a pore As the oceans treasures are immeasurable So too are its sentient beings and the great earth Although ocean water comes in only oneflavor Sentient beings that live in it receive various benefits It is similar for a Tathāgatas ocean of wisdom Because it is immeasurable Those who are still learning those who have nothing more to learn And those who abide on the Bodhisattva grounds receive its benefits  A Tathāgatas Actions  BuddhaSons what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva know about the actions of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas actions are hindrancefree actions and actions of true suchness BuddhaSons as true suchness was not born in the past will not change in the future and does not arise in the present likewise a Tathāgatas actions have no birth no change and no arising As the dharma realm is neither measurable nor immeasurable because it is formless likewise a Tathāgatas actions are neither measurable nor immeasurable because they are formless BuddhaSons suppose a bird flies in the sky for a hundred years The areas of the sky it has traversed and has not traversed are immeasurable Because the open sky has no boundaries It is similar for a Tathāgatas actions Suppose someone speaks for  koṭi nayuta kalpas What he has revealed and has not revealed is immeasurable Because a Tathāgatas actions have no boundaries BuddhaSons a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha takes hindrancefree actions which abide nowhere He displays His actions to all sentient beings and enables those who see them to leave all paths laden with hindrances BuddhaSons the goldenwinged king of birds circles in the open sky Using its keen eye it observes dragon palaces in the ocean With great valor and strength it uses its wings to stir up and part the ocean water Then it snatches male and female dragons whose lives are ending He persistently takes hindrancefree actions Using His pure Buddhaeye He observes all sentient beings in their places in the dharma realm looking for those with mature rootsofgoodness Boldly using His Ten Powers He uses His two wings śamatha and vipaśyanā to part the water of love  in the ocean of birth and death Then He snatches those with mature roots of goodness and settles them in the Buddha Dharma enabling them to end all deluded perceptions and ludicrousstatements and to take a Tathāgatas actions which are free from differentiation and hindrance BuddhaSons the sun and the moon have no companions As they travel across the open sky benefiting sentient beings they never think I come from somewhere and go to somewhere Likewise the nature of BuddhaTathāgatas has always been nirvāṇa free from differentiation They display their travels throughout all dharma realms To benefit sentient beings They do Buddha work without rest I come from there and go to there BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should use such immeasurable skillful means and immeasurable characteristics to know the actions of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse As true suchness has neither birth nor death Nor location and cannot be seen Likewise a Tathāgatas actions Transcend the three time frames and are immeasurable As the dharma realm is neither a realm nor not a realm Neither measurable nor immeasurable Likewise a Tathāgatas actions Are neither measurable nor immeasurable because He has no body Suppose a bird flies for a thousand koṭi years The open sky before and after its flight remains the same Likewise suppose someone expounds a Tathāgatas actions for kalpas What he has expounded and has not expounded is immeasurable A goldenwinged bird hovers in the sky observing the immense ocean Then it parts the water and snatches male and female dragons Likewise a Buddha who has the Ten Powers snatches those with roots of goodness Out of the ocean of karmic existence and ends their delusions The sun and the moon travel across the open sky Illuminating all without differentiation Likewise a Tathāgata travels throughout the dharma realm Teaching sentient beings without differentiating them  A Tathāgatas True Enlightenment  BuddhaSons what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva know about the true enlightenment of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a Tathāgata has attained  true enlightenment because He knows all dharmas and has no doubts about the equality of dharmas He has attained unsurpassed enlightenment which has no appearance no action no regress no measure and no limit free from opposites and abiding in the Middle Way  He knows all sentient beings mental activities natures desires and preferences In one thought He knows all dharmas in the past present and future BuddhaSons the immense ocean can faithfully reflect the physical images of all sentient beings on the four continents so it is called the immense ocean Likewise Buddha bodhi reflects all sentient beings thoughts natures desires and preferences but does not display anything Therefore it is called Buddha bodhi BuddhaSons Buddha bodhi cannot be described by words expressed by sounds or explained by languages but can be revealed through skillful means to those ready to be taught BuddhaSons when a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha attains true enlightenment He acquires a body that equals all sentient beings all dharmas all worlds all three time frames all Buddhas all languages all vows all actions true suchness the dharma realm the domain of space the hindrancefree realm and the realm of nirvāṇa BuddhaSons as He acquires such a body so too He acquires such a voice and such a mind He acquires countless such pure three wheels   BuddhaSons when a Tathāgata attains true enlightenment in His body He sees all sentient beings activate the bodhi mind train in Bodhisattva actions attain true enlightenment and even enter parinirvāṇa These events have the same nature ie no selfessence Therefore dharmas have no appearance no end no birth and no death All dharmas such as a self a sentient being the dharma realm the open sky bodhi and attainment of bodhi have no selfessence Knowing that all dharmas have no selfessence He acquires all wisdomknowledge and endless great compassion to deliver sentient beings BuddhaSons the open sky neither increases nor decreases whether worlds form or perish Because the open sky has no birth Likewise Buddha bodhi neither increases nor decreases whether anyone attains or does not attain true enlightenment Because bodhi is beyond appearance and no appearance one and many BuddhaSons suppose someone can manifest minds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and every mind manifests Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges who have no form no shape and no appearance He does so without rest for kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges BuddhaSons what is your opinion How many minds and Buddhas has he manifested  Wondrous Virtues Arising from Tathāgata Nature Bodhisattva answered According to my understanding of your meaning there is no difference between what he manifests and what he does not manifest Why do you ask me about their numbers  Samantabhadra Bodhisattva said Very good very good BuddhaSon truly as you say if all sentient beings attain true enlightenment in one thought bodhi remains the same as when no one attains true enlightenment Because bodhi has no appearance If it has no appearance it neither increases nor decreases BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that attainment of samyaksabodhi is the same as bodhi in the oneappearance of no appearance When a Tathāgata attains true enlightenment through skillful means He enters the Samādhi of Perfect Enlightenment After He has entered this samādhi His vast body of true enlightenment manifests in itself bodies as numerous as all sentient beings As one vast body of true enlightenment does so so too do all vast bodies of true enlightenment BuddhaSons a Tathāgata has countless doors for attaining true enlightenment Therefore the bodies He manifests are countless Because they are countless a Tathāgatas bodies constitute an immeasurable realm which equals the realm of sentient beings BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that contained in a pore on a Tathāgatas body are Buddha bodies as numerous as sentient beings Because a Tathāgata has acquired the enlightenment body with neither birth nor death As it is with one pore so it is with all pores Know that there is not even a little place where there is no Buddha body Because a Tathāgata has attained true enlightenment which pervades everywhere Using His ability and power seated on the lion throne under the bodhi tree in His bodhimaṇḍa He attains samyaksabodhi in His various bodies BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that in his mind thought after thought there are Buddhas attaining true enlightenment Because BuddhaTathāgatas attainment of true enlightenment is never apart from ones mind As it is so in ones own mind so too in all sentient beings minds there are Tathāgatas endlessly attaining true enlightenment everywhere without rest and entering the Dharma Door of inconceivable skillful means BuddhaSons in this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know a Tathāgatas true enlightenment  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse A Tathāgata knows that all dharmas Are equal free from duality Their true nature is as pure as the open sky Free from differentiation between self and nonself Because the ocean reflects sentient beings bodies It is called the immense ocean Because bodhi reflects all sentient beings mental activities It is called true enlightenment As worlds form and perish The open sky neither increases nor decreases As all Buddhas appear in worlds Bodhi remains in the one appearance of no appearance Suppose someone manifests minds which manifest Buddhas Manifestation and no manifestation are no different in nature Suppose all sentient beings attain bodhi at the same time Bodhi neither increases nor decreases whether or not anyone attains bodhi Under the bodhi tree a Buddha enters The Samādhi of Perfect Enlightenment He emits beams of light as numerous as sentient beings Enlightening all sentient beings like lotus flowers blooming Manifested in His body are The three time frames kalpas worlds and sentient beings And their thoughts faculties and desires Therefore true enlightenment is called immeasurable  A Tathāgatas Turning of the Dharma Wheel  BuddhaSons what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva know about a Tathāgatas turning of the Dharma wheel BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that a Tathāgata uses His minds commanding power which neither arises nor turns anything to turn the Dharma wheel because all dharmas never arise He uses the three turnings  that end what should be ended to turn the Dharma wheel because He knows that all dharmas are free from diametric views  He transcends dharmas in or not in any states to turn the Dharma wheel because He realizes the emptiness of all dharmas He turns the Dharma wheel without using words because He knows that no dharma can be described He enters nirvāṇa to turn the Dharma wheel because He knows that the true nature of all dharmas is nirvāṇa He uses all words and all languages to turn the Dharma wheel because a Tathāgatas voice reaches everywhere He uses His knowledge that sounds are like echoes to turn the Dharma wheel because He knows the true reality of dharmas He voices one tone that produces all tones to turn the Dharma wheel because He has no master He faultlessly and endlessly turns the Dharma wheel because He has no attachments inside or outside BuddhaSons all words and languages continue without end throughout future kalpas Likewise a Buddhas turning of the Dharma wheel established and expressed with words continues without interruption without end BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas Dharma wheel pervades all words and languages but abides nowhere Words are used in all matters all languages and all calculations in all worldly and supraworldly spheres but abide nowhere Likewise a Tathāgatas voice reaches all places all sentient beings all dharmas all karmas and all karmic requitals but abides nowhere All sentient beings various languages are encompassed in the sound of a Tathāgatas Dharma wheel Because all sounds are the sound of the Dharma wheel BuddhaSons in this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know a Tathāgatas turning of the Dharma wheel Moreover BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who wants to know a Tathāgatas turning of the Dharma wheel should know the source of the Dharma wheel What is the source of a Tathāgatas Dharma wheel BuddhaSons it is sentient beings countless different preferences and mental activities following which a Tathāgata voices certain tones to turn the Dharma wheel After He has entered this samādhi the mouth of every one of His bodies of true enlightenment emits speech sounds as numerous as all sentient beings every sound producing myriad different tones In this way He turns the Dharma wheel delighting all sentient beings If someone knows that the Dharma wheel is turned in this way he follows the Buddha Dharma If he does not know it he is not following the Buddha Dharma BuddhaSons in this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that a Tathāgata turns the Dharma wheel to enter everywhere in the realm of innumerable sentient beings  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse As a Tathāgata turns the Dharma wheel throughout the three time frames His turning is no turning and the three time frames neither arise nor can be captured As words continue to be used without end Likewise a Buddhas Dharma wheel turns without end As words enter everywhere and arrive at nowhere So too does a Buddhas Dharma wheel Entering all speech sounds it enters nowhere But can delight all sentient beings A Buddha has a samādhi called Ultimate Fearlessness and Freedom from Hindrance After entering this samādhi He expounds the Dharma Although sentient beings are innumerable He voices tones and enables them to understand  Every tone produces Countless different speech tones The one with great command in the world makes no differentiations But enables all to hear His voice according to their preferences Words come from neither inside nor outside They neither are lost nor accumulate It is amazing that a Buddha turns the Dharma wheel to benefit sentient beings With such extraordinary ease  A Tathāgatas Parinirvāṇa  BuddhaSons what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva know about the parinirvāṇa of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who wants to know a Tathāgatas great parinirvāṇa should know the root nature  The nirvāṇa of a Tathāgata is the nirvāṇa of true suchness the nirvāṇa of true reality the nirvāṇa of the dharma realm the nirvāṇa of the domain of space the nirvāṇa of dharma nature the nirvāṇa of the desirefree state the nirvāṇa of the appearancefree state the nirvāṇa of the selves  and the nirvāṇa of dharma nature Why Because nirvāṇa is not a dharma subject to birth or death If a dharma has no birth then it has no death nor does it go away somewhere BuddhaSons a Tathāgata does not describe to Bodhisattvas how Tathāgatas enter nirvāṇa Nor does He display to them such an event Because He wants them to see all Tathāgatas always present before them and to see in one thought all past and future Buddhas in perfect physical appearances as if in the present without perceiving them as same or different Because a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should discard his attachment to perceptions for good BuddhaSons to delight sentient beings BuddhaTathāgatas appear in worlds to make sentient beings admire and think of Them They demonstrate entering nirvāṇa In truth a Tathāgata neither leaves the world nor enters nirvāṇa Because a Tathāgata always abides in the pure dharma realm although He demonstrates entering nirvāṇa according to sentient beings minds BuddhaSons the sun rises and illuminates everywhere in the world Its reflection neither coming nor going appears everywhere in pure water contained in all vessels except broken vessels BuddhaSons what is your opinion Is it the suns fault that its reflection fails to appear in such vessels  No it is not the suns fault Those vessels are broken  BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata a wisdom sun neither coming nor going appears everywhere in the dharma realm He appears in all sentient beings clean mindvessels A clean mindvessel always sees Him a tainted or broken mindvessel does not see Him BuddhaSons if there are sentient beings that should be delivered through  nirvāṇa a Tathāgata demonstrates  nirvāṇa for them In truth a Tathāgata has neither birth nor death nor parinirvāṇa BuddhaSons fire does its work in the entire world If fire in one place is extinguishedwhat is your opiniondoes it mean that fire everywhere in the entire world is extinguished  No  BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha does Buddha work in all worlds If he has completed His work in one world and demonstrates entering nirvāṇa does it mean that BuddhaTathāgatas in all worlds enter nirvāṇa BuddhaSons in this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know the great parinirvāṇa of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a magician skilled in conjuration uses his magic power to conjure bodies in cities and villages in all worlds in a ThreeThousandLarge ThousandfoldWorld and to sustain them for kalpas However in places where he has ended his show he discards his conjured bodies BuddhaSons what is your opinion If that great magician discards his body conjured in one place does it mean that he discards all such bodies conjured in all places  No  BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha who has immeasurable wisdom and skillful means and knows various magic tricks manifests bodies everywhere in the entire dharma realm and enables them to abide throughout the future He may finish his work in one place and demonstrate entering nirvāṇa according to sentient beings minds Can you say that His demonstration of entering nirvāṇa in one place means His entering nirvāṇa everywhere BuddhaSons in this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know the great parinirvāṇa of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha Moreover BuddhaSons when a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha demonstrates entering nirvāṇa He enters the Motionless Samādhi After he has entered this samādhi every one of His bodies emits countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of huge beams of light In every beam of light appear an asakhyeya lotus flowers Every lotus flower has an ineffable number of stamens made of wonderful treasures Standing on every stamen is a lion throne If sentient beings with mature roots of goodness see a Buddhas body they will accept His teachings Every Buddha body abides throughout the future and delivers all sentient beings at the right times BuddhaSons a Tathāgatas body has no location and is neither real nor unreal Through the power of His original vows it appears to sentient beings ready to be delivered In this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know the great parinirvāṇa of a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a Tathāgata abides in the immeasurable hindrancefree and ultimate dharma realm the domain of space true suchness dharma nature and true reality and has neither birth nor death but He may appear to sentient beings at any time Sustained by His original vows He never rests and never abandons any sentient beings any worlds or any dharmas  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse The sun illuminates the dharma realm But its reflection does not appear in broken vessels without water Likewise sentient beings without faith See a supreme wisdom sun enter parinirvāṇa  Fire does its work in the entire world But sometimes it may be extinguished in a city A supreme one among men does Buddha work throughout the dharma realm But He demonstrates entering parinirvāṇa in a place where His work is finished A magician conjures bodies in all worlds But ends his show in a particular place Likewise a Buddha enters parinirvāṇa after His work is finished in one world But He is seen in other worlds A Buddha has a samādhi called Motionless After delivering sentient beings He enters this samādhi In one thought His body emits countless beams of light In every beam of light appear countless lotus flowers and seated upon every flower is a Buddha These countless Buddha bodies pervade the dharma realm And can be seen by fortunate sentient beings Every one of these countless bodies Has a lifespan and excellent adornments As dharmas have no birth a Buddha appears As dharmas have no death a Buddha enters parinirvāṇa The whole meaning is complete and unequaled Beyond words and analogies  Planting Roots of Goodness under a Tathāgata  BuddhaSons what should a BodhisattvaMahāsattva know about ones roots of goodness planted by seeing hearing or staying close to a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that ones roots of goodness planted by seeing hearing or staying close to a Tathāgata are true because they enable one to develop endless bodhi wisdom remove all hindrances and difficulties definitely bring the ultimate liberation and fulfill all wishes because they enable one not to end saskṛta actions but to follow the wisdomknowledge  of that which is asaskṛta develop Buddha wisdom throughout the future complete all kinds of excellent actions and arrive on the ground of effortless wisdomknowledge BuddhaSons suppose someone swallows a little vajra  It cannot be digested and must pass through his body to exit Vajra does not stay in a physical body filled with impurities Likewise the few roots of goodness planted under a Tathāgata must pass through a body filled with afflictions that drive saskṛta actions in order to arrive at the ultimate place of the wisdomknowledge of that which is asaskṛta Because roots of goodness however few do not coexist with afflictions and saskṛta actions driven by afflictions BuddhaSons suppose dried grass is piled high like Mount Sumeru If a fire as small as a mustard seed is thrown into this pile it will be burnt away Because it is the nature of fire to burn Likewise a few roots of goodness planted under a Tathāgata definitely can burn away all afflictions so that one will ultimately enter the nirvāṇa without remnant Why Because it is the nature of roots of goodness however few to reach the ultimate goal BuddhaSons in the snow mountain is a medicinal tree called good sight Whoever sees it gains a pure sense of sight whoever hears about it gains a pure sense of hearing whoever smells it gains a pure sense of smell whoever tastes it gains a pure sense of taste whoever touches it gains a pure sense of touch whoever takes some of its soil can cure his illnesses BuddhaSons likewise a Tathāgata also called an Arhat and a SamyakSabuddha who is a supreme medicine king can do anything to benefit sentient beings Whoever sees His physical body gains pure eyes whoever hears His name gains pure ears whoever smells the fragrance of His precepts gains a pure nose whoever tastes the flavor of His Dharma gains a pure tongue which becomes broad and long and speaks all languages whoever touches His radiance gains a pure body and will ultimate realize the unsurpassed dharma body whoever thinks of Him attains the Samādhi of Thinking of Buddhas Whoever makes offerings to the ground walked by a Tathāgata or to His memorial pagodas  acquires roots of goodness ends the trouble of his afflictions and experiences the joy experienced by sages and holies BuddhaSons I now tell you this If sentient beings see or hear a Buddha though they do not elicit faith or delight because they are fettered by karmahindrances they still plant their roots of goodness without fail and will ultimately enter nirvāṇa BuddhaSons in this way a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should know that ones roots of goodness planted by seeing hearing or staying close to a Tathāgata are free from all evil dharmas and imbued with good dharmas BuddhaSons a Tathāgata uses analogies to explain various things but no analogy can explain this Dharma Door Because it is inconceivable to the way of ones intellect Buddhas and Bodhisattvas according to sentient beings minds delight them with analogies which are not definitive explanations BuddhaSons this Dharma Door is called a Tathāgatas secret place it is called unknowable to the world it is called entering the Tathāgata seal it is called opening the door of great wisdomknowledge it is called revealing the Tathāgata charactertype it is called bringing all Bodhisattvas to achievement it is called indestructible in the world it is called always in accord with a Tathāgatas state it is called able to purify the realm of all sentient beings it is called the inconceivable ultimate dharma that reveals a Tathāgatas root nature BuddhaSons a Tathāgata does not expound this Dharma Door to all sentient beings but only to Bodhisattvas who ride the Mahāyāna the inconceivable vehicle This Dharma Door does not fall into the hands of all sentient beings but only into those of BodhisattvaMahāsattvas BuddhaSons a WheelTurningKing owns seven treasures which prove that he is a WheelTurning King These treasures will fall only into the hands of his crown prince who born from the queen bears distinctive features to become a WheelTurning King If the WheelTurning King did not have his crown prince with such virtues then within seven days of his death his treasures would vanish BuddhaSons likewise this precious sūtra falls only into the hands of a Dharma Kings true sons who have been born into the Tathāgata family and planted roots of goodness to acquire a Tathāgatas appearance BuddhaSons without these true Buddhasons this Dharma Door will soon vanish Because no rider of the TwoVehicles hears this sūtra much less accepts upholds reads and recites copies or expounds it Only BodhisattvaMahāsattvas can do these things Therefore when a BodhisattvaMahāsattva hears this Dharma Door he should feel great joy and accept it with the highest esteem and reverence Because a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who believes and delights in this sūtra will soon attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi BuddhaSons suppose for countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas a Bodhisattva practices the sixpāramitās and trains to complete various bodhi elements If he has not heard this Dharma Door of immeasurable inconceivable hindrancefree wisdom or after hearing it he does not believe understand follow or enter it he is not called a true Bodhisattva because he cannot be born into the Tathāgata family Suppose someone comes to hear this Dharma Door and after hearing it he believes understands follows and enters it Know that this person is born into the Tathāgata family in accord with a Tathāgatas state and equipped with Bodhisattva dharmas and that he abides in the sphere of all wisdomknowledge turns away from all worldly dharmas supports a Tathāgatas actions understands the nature of all Bodhisattva dharmas has no doubts about a Buddhas command  abides on the teacherfree ground and goes deep into a Tathāgatas hindrancefree state BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has heard this Dharma Door can use the wisdomknowledge of equality  to know countless dharmas can use his upright mind to make no differentiations  can use his excellent aspirations to see Buddhas at once can use the power of his will to enter the domain of impartial space can use his commanding thought to travel throughout the boundless dharma realm can use the power of his wisdom to do all virtuous works can use his innate wisdomknowledge  to turn away from all impurities in the world can use the bodhi mind to enter webs of worlds in the ten directions can use the power of his vast observation powers to know that past present and future Buddhas have the same nature can use his wisdomknowledge to transfer his roots of goodness to entering such dharmas without entering them can use one dharma to observe all dharmas without attachment to even one dharma BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who has accomplished such virtuous works acquires with little effort the teacherfree innate wisdomknowledge  Then to restate his meaning Samantabhadra Bodhisattva spoke in verse Someone swallows a little vajra but It can never be digested and must exit his body The merit acquired by making offerings to Buddhas Enables one to eradicate ones afflictions and acquire vajra wisdom knowledge Although a pile of dried grass is as tall as Mount Sumeru A fire as tiny as a mustard seed will burn it away The little merit acquired by making offerings to Buddhas Definitely will enable one to eradicate ones afflictions and attain nirvāṇa In the snow mountain is a medicinal tree called good sight Those who see hear about smell or touch it have their illnesses cured Those who see a Buddha or hear His teachings Acquire excellent merit and Buddha wisdom  Displays of the Earth and the Sky  Then through the Buddhas spiritual power as the way things naturally are a million koṭi nayuta ineffable worlds in each of the ten directions moved in six different ways lifting in the east sinking in the west lifting in the west sinking in the east lifting in the south sinking in the north lifting in the north sinking in the south lifting at the edges sinking in the middle lifting in the middle sinking at the edges These movements displayed eighteen characteristics moving everywhere moving everywhere equally moving rising everywhere rising

jewels and other things that surpassed their celestial counterparts It formed clouds such as clouds of Bodhisattvas praises clouds of ineffable Bodhisattvas in different bodies clouds that displayed attainment of true enlightenment clouds that purified inconceivable worlds and clouds of Tathāgatas speech sounds pervading the boundless dharma realm The Tathāgatas spiritual power was displayed in this way on the four continents  to delight Bodhisattvas and the same transpired throughout all worlds in the ten directions  Testimony of Other Bodhisattvas  Meanwhile from everywhere beyond worlds as numerous as the dust particles in eight million koṭi nayuta ineffable Buddha Lands Tathāgatas as numerous as the dust particles in eight million koṭi nayuta ineffable Buddha Lands who were all called Samantabhadra appeared before Samantabhadra Bodhisattva and said Very good BuddhaSon Through the Buddhas awesome power in accord with dharma nature you have expounded this inconceivable dharma of a Tathāgatas appearance BuddhaSon we Buddhas with the same name who are as numerous as the dust particles in eight million koṭi nayuta ineffable Buddha Lands also expound this dharma Whatever we expound the same do all Buddhas in worlds in the ten directions BuddhaSon in this assembly BodhisattvaMahāsattvas as numerous as the dust particles in  Buddha Lands have acquired all transcendental powers and samādhis of a Bodhisattva We bestow upon them the prophecy of attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi in their next life Moreover sentient beings as numerous as the dust particles in a Buddha Land have activated the anuttarasamyaksabodhimind We bestow upon them the prophecy that after kalpas as numerous as the dust particles in an ineffable number of Buddha Lands they will become Buddhas and assume the same name Superb Buddha State To enable future Bodhisattvas to hear this dharma we jointly protect and preserve it As we deliver sentient beings on the four continents of this world so too we deliver sentient beings in countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of worlds in the ten directions and even in all worlds in the ineffably ineffable dharma realm and the domain of space through the awesome spiritual power of Buddhas  in the ten directions the power of Vairocana Buddhas original vows and the power of  roots of goodness because it is the way things naturally are because Tathāgatas elicit wisdomknowledge without eliciting thoughts because Tathāgatas respond to different conditions without fail because Tathāgatas enlighten Bodhisattvas at the right times because Tathāgatas past works are never lost because Tathāgatas enable Bodhisattvas to take Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas great actions because Tathāgatas display mastery of all wisdomknowledge  Moreover from beyond worlds in each of the ten directions which are as numerous as the dust particles in a million koṭi nayuta ineffable Buddha Lands Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust particles in a million koṭi nayuta ineffable Buddha Lands came to visit this world They filled all dharma realms in the ten directions displayed their great magnificence emitted webs of vast radiance shook all worlds in the ten directions destroyed all māra palaces ended the suffering on all evil lifepaths revealed the aweinspiring virtues of all Tathāgatas hymned praises of Tathāgatas countless virtuous works showered down all kinds of  rains manifested countless different bodies and received the Dharma of innumerable Buddhas Only you can expound this indestructible dharma of a Tathāgatas appearance We came here from the world called Universal Radiance where Universal Banner Command Tathāgata resides This dharma is expounded everywhere in that world Its words meanings explanations and definitiveness are the same as those given here neither more nor less Through the Buddhas spiritual power because we have received this dharma we came here to testify for you As we came here to do so we do the same in all fourcontinent worlds in the ten directions throughout the dharma realm and the domain of space  Then Samantabhadra Bodhisattva through the Buddhas spiritual power observed all Bodhisattvas in the

with ease and a gentle mind This is his fifth mountainlike higher mind A BodhisattvaMahāsattva performs works of higher merit which bring higher requitals such as higher rebirth as a god or human

no dharma reverently makes offerings to all Buddhas no dharma attained does attain or will attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi no dharma expounded does expound or will expound the Dharma Neither the Dharma expounder nor the Dharma can be captured However he never abandons his resolve to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Why not Because a Bodhisattva seeks to realize that there is nothing to capture or attain

sees all sentient beings in any world encounter a Buddha hear the Dharma accept and recite His teachings remember and ponder His teachings and increase their understanding and wisdom In this way he observes all worlds in the ten directions without any misunderstanding of the Buddha Dharma Because a BodhisattvaMahāsattva knows that Buddhas are like dreams Therefore he visits all Buddhas and reverently makes offering to Them with no attachment to himself Buddhas Dharma assemblies hearing the Dharma or kalpas He continues to see Buddhas hear the Dharma observe worlds and enter kalpas never satiated This is his eighth kind of oceanlike wisdomknowledge He in each of an ineffably ineffable number of kalpas reverently makes offerings to an ineffably ineffable number of Buddhas as he displays his death here and rebirth there He makes offerings that surpass all those in the ThreeRealmsofExistence to Buddhas as well as Bodhisattvas voicehearers and all multitudes After each Buddhas parinirvāṇa he makes unexcelled offerings to His relics and widely gives alms to gratify sentient beings BuddhaSons a BodhisattvaMahāsattva to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi uses the inconceivable mind

faultless dharmas dharmas with afflictions dharmas without afflictions saskṛta dharmas and asaskṛta dharmas This is his seventh kind of precious abiding He knows that Buddhas Bodhisattvas sentient beings and dharmas cannot be captured Why not Because he makes skillful observations and knows all sentient beings states and roots of goodness He guides them by skillful means to attain nirvāṇa because he wants to fulfill his vow to transform sentient beings and to vigorously train in Bodhisattva actions This is his eighth kind of precious abiding He knows that skillful expositions of the Dharma demonstrations of entering nirvāṇa and skillful means for delivering sentient beings are established by the thinking mind and are not inverted or false Because a Bodhisattva knows all dharmas the equality of the three time frames and that dharmas in true reality are motionless and abide nowhere Therefore he does not see even one sentient being that was transformed is being transformed or will be transformed He also knows that his spiritual training is no training and that the birth and death of any dharma cannot be captured However he relies on all dharmas so that his aspirations will not come to nothing This is his ninth kind of precious abiding He hears from every one of inconceivably innumerable Buddhas the ineffably ineffable prophecy of his attaining bodhi under different names in different kalpas He often hears this prophecy in one kalpa and even in an ineffably ineffable number of kalpas Having heard it he trains to attain bodhi neither shocked nor scared neither

This is his sixth vajralike mind to fulfill the Mahāyāna vows If sentient beings scold slander beat or club a BodhisattvaMahāsattva or cut off his hands feet ears or nose or dig out his eyes or take his head he will endure all these things and never gets angry or vindictive He will train in Bodhisattva actions for an ineffable number of kalpas and deliver sentient beings never abandoning them

bodhi in order to benefit all sentient beings This is his eighth vajralike mind to fulfill the Mahāyāna vows He then thinks Anuttarasamyaksabodhi is founded on the mind If ones mind is pure one can complete all roots of goodness feel at ease with Buddha bodhi and attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi at will Therefore I could end all the conditions for my continuing  and complete the oneway path Although I aspire to Buddha bodhi I choose not to attain it right away Because to fulfill my original vows I take Bodhisattva actions in all worlds to transform sentient beings This is his ninth vajralike mind to fulfill the Mahāyāna vows He knows that Buddhas Bodhisattvas sentient beings dharmas saskṛta dharmas asaskṛta dharmas all things in the world actions bodhi the mind past present and future cannot

abandons his great vows the resolve to realize sarvajña  Bodhisattva actions the pāramitās attending Buddhas expounding the Dharma adorning all worlds or teaching transforming and taming sentient beings Why not Because a BodhisattvaMahāsattva has made great vows Although he knows  all dharma appearances his mind of great lovingkindness and compassion increases even more He acquires

beings How can I now abandon my great compassion Besides I have already made a vast vow to benefit all sentient beings develop all roots of goodness skillfully transfer my merits acquire profound

Great actions as garments The Dharma as a silk scarf that adorns his topknot And all wisdomknowledge as a jewel Fully adorned with his merits He receives blessings with nectar poured on this head and ascends to the kings throne He uses the pāramitās as the gold wheel Transcendental powers as the elephant The power of instant arrival anywhere as the horse Wisdom as the divine jewel Wonderful actions as the exquisite maidens The Four Drawingin Dharmas as the treasure minister And skillful means as the military minister He uses samādhi as his city Emptiness as his palace Lovingkindness as his armor wisdom as his sword Mindfulness as his bow and clarity as his arrows He sets up the transcendentalpower canopy And erects the wisdom banner The power of his endurance  being immovable He annihilates the legions of the māraking He uses dhāraṇī as the level ground Actions as river waters Pure wisdomknowledge as a gushing spring Wondrous wisdom as a cool forest Emptiness as a pure pond And the elements of bodhi as lotus flowers He adorns himself with transcendental powers And enters samādhi for recreation He uses pondering the Dharma as beautiful maidens Sweet dew  as fine food And the flavor of liberation as syrup As he playfully rides the Three Vehicles For countless kalpas He trains in Bodhisattva actions That subtly multiply Never tiring or feeling that he has done enough He makes offerings to all Buddhas Purifies all worlds And enables all multitudes To abide in all wisdomknowledge The number of the dust particles in all worlds Can be known A grain of sand in the entire domain of space Can be measured The number of thoughts in All sentient beings minds can be counted One can never finish describing The merits of a Buddhason If you want to acquire such merits And the wondrous Dharma If you want to enable sentient beings To end their suffering and have peace and joy And if you want your body voice and mind To equal those of Buddhas You should activate the vajra mind And take such meritorious actions Mahāyāna Sūtra of Consciousness Revealed Translated in the Tang Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master DivākaraThus I have heard At one time the Bhagavān was in the Karaṇḍa Bamboo Garden of the city of Rājagṛha together with  great bhikṣus All of them were Arhats who had ended their afflictions and the discharges thereof and achieved freedom With their minds completely liberated and their wisdom fully unfolded like the great dragon they saw the past future and present hindrance free Taught by the Buddha they had completed their undertaking  and shed the enormous heavy burden They had acquired benefits for themselves having ended their suffering in transmigrating through their cycle of birth and death With the power of true knowledge they were adept in identifying the proclivities of sentient beings At the head of the multitude of such great voicehearers was the Elder āriputra Also in this assembly was an innumerable multitude of BodhisattvaMahāsattvas In the presence of the WorldHonored One the bhikṣus were tired and drowsy losing their color and too exhausted to hold up Then the face of the WorldHonored One lit up like a blooming lotus flower Forthwith the bhikṣus all became alert each straightening up and thinking The BuddhaBhagavān now looks resplendent his face glowing with light What dharmaeye will He open to give us great benefits The youth  Worthy Protector Superior complete with fine qualities such as robust good looks gentleness and radiance surrounded by  merchant lords together with attendants with rumbling sounds like an earthquake came to the Buddha Seeing the BuddhaBhagavān silent and peaceful as the store of virtues and majestic and radiant like a towering golden tree he pondered as he joined his palms with profound faith and reverence He thought As praised by all the Buddha who is allknowing and allseeing is truly the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha It is not false He bowed his head down at the feet of the Buddha then gazed at Him Worthy Protector then acquired fearlessness He circled the Buddha three times and again bowed his head down at the Buddhas feet He said to the Buddha I pray only that the WorldHonored One will teach me with compassion It is only today that I have acquired pure faith here where the Buddha is The WorldHonored One is allknowing and allseeing The appearance of a Buddha in the world is rare and hard to encounter As a wishfulfilling jewel can give happiness to sentient beings the Buddha is the greatest wishfulfilling jewel All sentient beings depend upon the Buddha to acquire great peace and bliss He is the great parent and sentient beings root of goodness Because of the Buddhaparent one will be able see the right path I pray only that out of sympathy He will remove my doubts and darkness The Buddha told Worthy Protector You may ask anything about your doubts I will resolve them separately for you Worthy Protector having received the Buddhas permission stood on one side to concentrate on his questions Meanwhile the Elder nanda seeing the radiance and good features of the youth Worthy Protector said to the Buddha A sight never encountered before This youth Worthy Protector has great merit whose radiance and glow outshine the awesome appearances of kings The Buddha told nanda This youth Worthy Protector Superior because of his meritorious karma enjoys splendid celestiallife requital while living in the human world He can frolic and enjoy peace and pleasure totally at will like the godking akra No one in Jambudvīpa can compare with him except for the youth Moon Reality nanda asked the Buddha I pray only that we be told about the youth Worthy Protector concerning his current resources as karmic requital and the roots of goodness he has planted in the past The Buddha told nanda You should hear the pleasurerequital in the form of enormous resources that Worthy Protector now enjoys and learn the contributing causes from his past nanda this youth Worthy Protector is attended by  merchant lords who have an abundance of assets and an accumulation of gold and jewels They respectfully accept his instructions and follow him at his service  beds with wellarranged bedding blankets fine linens and pillows in various colors beautiful and magnificent All around are columns jeweled carvings colorful silk curtains and other decorations as gorgeous as those in a painting There are  artistic ladies dressed in silk in a variety of colors adorned with golden jewelry and necklaces in dazzling colors so fine and delicate to the touch that they are like celestial crystal Their weight can be light or heavy suiting the wearers mood Playing laughing talking singing these ladies entertain and serve their master with gentleness prudence and respect They withdraw their love and desire for others lowering their heads with humility or covering their heads for modesty Moreover there are  women who serve him food such as rice bread and so forth in various colors The aromas and flavors are as wonderful as those of celestial food As requital for his merit such food cooked without labor arrives at his wish The water there has the eight virtues pleasing to ones mind and soothing to ones body and it cleanses filth and removes diseases His mansions and towers are adorned with  beautifully arranged jewels such as precious gems and aquamarine Bells suspended from ribbons jingle harmoniously in the winds The ground is like aquamarine showing myriad reflections with various flowers scattered around is cool and pleasant inviting leisurely strolls to relax ones mind There are musical instruments such as paṇava drums sitars pipes and brass cymbals playing  kinds of melodies The beautiful sounds are harmonious and loud resonating far and wide Joy and happiness brought by meritorious karma flow nonstop Doves and other birds are flying around their various calls enjoyable to ones mind and pleasant to ones ear Flowering vines climb up on the towers adorning them with bright flowers and lush leaves The tones of bells and musical instruments sound like those in a celestial palace The halls are spacious like a cavern of Mount Sumeru where divine medicine flows The raucous sounds of trade shake the entire city In the lush gardens and forests there are large and small trees vines medicinal herbs and flowers in full bloom the clear waters of which reflect shimmering light like a sheet of colorful brocade Hundreds and thousands of elephants horses and carriages move endlessly throughout the city nanda in these  cities the noble and the famous as well as the wealthy and the merchant lords praise the youth Worthy Protector every day broadcasting his merit They respectfully join their palms and make obeisance to him in reverence Prasenajit the king of Kauśala is wealthy because of the power of his merit but he is poor in comparison with Worthy Protector The youth Moon Reality is surrounded by  artistic attendants serving him respectfully and entertaining him with music and frolics Even the godking śakra is a billion times less fortunate than Moon Reality Likewise the youth Worthy Protector with his robust highcolored good looks wealth ease peace and pleasures is also a billion times less fortunate than Moon Reality Their fortunes in each case are not acquired by force but are a response to their past merits nanda the youth Worthy Protector has a wishfulfilling carriage inlaid with celestial jewels radiating bright light like celestial gold or vajra It is decorated with various kinds of treasures mixed as beautifully as stars It moves swiftly like the wind like the flight of the goldenwinged bird Riding this jeweled carriage he arrives at any treasure island on a thought He asked the Buddha What roots of goodness did the youth Worthy Protector plant and what meritorious karma did he do now to own enormous assets and to enjoy this great pleasurerequital living in such magnificent mansions decorated with extraordinary treasures The Buddha told nanda The youth Worthy Protector because he planted in the past meritorious karma in the Buddha Dharma has now received this enormous pleasurerequital In the past there was a Buddha called Blissful Light the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha Knowledge and Conduct Perfected Sugata Understanding the World Unsurpassed One Tamer of Men Teacher to Gods and Humans Buddha the WorldHonored One Worthy Protector renounced family life and became a bhikṣu called Dharma Topknot in the Dharma of that Buddha He was inadequate in observing the precepts for conduct However he clearly understood the profound teachings in the Tripiṭakathe Sūtras the Vinaya and the Abhidharmaand he excelled in expounding them He always pronounced the teachings to sentient beings in solemn beautiful tones endlessly giving the Dharma as alms He was forthright and brilliant in his eloquent exposition and the hearers delighted in the Dharma they heard They pondered the teachings and trained themselves accordingly and those who saved themselves from taking the evil lifejourneys were innumerable nanda the bhikṣu Dharma Topknot because of his merit of giving the Dharma enjoyed the celestiallife requital for ninety kalpas In addition when Dharma Topknot saw thin and frail bhikṣus who observed their precepts purely he always gave them food drink shoes and so forth Because he gave alms courteously and sincerely with a pure mind he now has received this pleasurerequital in the form of great wealth magnificent mansions and extraordinary jeweled carriages Moreover Dharma Topknot later encountered Kāśyapa Tathāgata who gave him teachings and guidance and told him You will receive a prophecy from the future Buddha ākyamuni Hence he is seeing me now and I will pronounce the Dharma to him to bring him to maturity nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One the youth Worthy Protector Superior has command of such an abundance of riches gold and treasures It is extraordinary that he is gentle and modest without any pride or arrogance The Buddha said nanda one with great wisdom does not become arrogant because of wealth treasures and sensory pleasures Worthy Protector has long trained in good works Supported by good dharmas he always has fortune fruits to eat Worthy Protector having been praised by the Buddha and nanda joined his palms reverently and bowed down at the feet of the Buddha He implored the Buddha Please pity accept and protect all sentient beings I request permission to ask a few questions The Buddha told Worthy Protector You have my permission You may ask me about your doubts I will explicate them to you Worthy Protector said to the Buddha WorldHonored One although sentient beings know that there is consciousness it is like a jewel kept in a box unrevealed and unknowable WorldHonored One I do not know the form of this consciousness nor the reason that it is called consciousness When a person dies his hands and feet may convulse and the look of his eyes changes uncontrollably As ones faculties perish the four domainsearth water fire and winddisperse Where does ones consciousness go after it has left the current body What is its essence What is its form How does it assume the next body after leaving this body After this body is abandoned how does consciousness carry ones faculties in order to accept the next requital which can be a body of any kind WorldHonored One how does a sentient being grow new faculties after the expiration of this body Why does one accumulate meritorious karma in this life only to receive its requital in the next life The current body does meritorious karma and the next body will eat  How does ones consciousness nourish ones body and keep it alive How do consciousness and faculties develop according to ones body The Buddha said Very good Very good Worthy Protector these are good questions Ponder this well I will explain to you Worthy Protector said to the Buddha WorldHonored One affirmatively I accept Your teachings The Buddha told Worthy Protector The process and transference of  consciousness are like the wind which is formless shapeless and unidentifiable However the wind can activate myriad things and display myriad conditions whether making loud sounds as it shakes the forest or breaks off branches or causing pleasure or pain as it touches with cold or hot the bodies of sentient beings The wind does not have hands feet face or shape Nor does it have various colors such as black white red or yellow Worthy Protector the same is true for the domain of consciousness It is formless shapeless not revealed by light However through causes and conditions it can manifest various kinds of functions Know that the dharma realms of sensory reception and perception are also formless and shapeless Through causes and conditions various functions manifest Worthy Protector after the death of a sentient being the dharma realms of sensory reception and perception and the domain of  consciousness abandon the body The way  consciousness carries the dharma realms of sensory reception and perception to accept another body is like a gust of wind sweeping across wonderful flowers The flowers stay put but their fragrance will flow far The wind in essence does not grasp the fragrance of the flowers Worthy Protector after a persons death his  consciousness carries the dharma realms of sensory reception and perception to the next rebirth which is conditioned upon his parents entrusted by his  consciousness In this way the dharma realms of sensory reception and perception accompany  consciousness Because of the quality of the flowers ones nose can detect their scent Because of ones olfactory power one smells fragrance a sense object The wind touches the flowers because of its power Because of the power of the wind fragrance can flow far Likewise from consciousness sensory reception arises from sensory reception perception arises and by perception mental objects are differentiated Then one knows good and evil Worthy Protector by analogy a painter applies pigments to the wall and he can paint pictures as neatly and properly as he wishes The consciousness and intellect of the painter are both formless and shapeless but they can create various kinds of extraordinary images and shapes Thus ones consciousness and intellect project the six percepts The eye sees sights and the eye consciousness is formless and shapeless the ear hears sounds which are formless and shapeless the nose detects odors which are formless and shapeless the tongue tastes flavors which are formless and shapeless and the body knows tactile sensations which are formless and shapeless As ones faculties and perceptions are formless and shapeless so too ones consciousness is formless and shapeless Worthy Protector when  consciousness abandons ones current body to accept another life it is still bound by karma hindrances at the moment of ones death When ones current requital ends with death  is as if in the Samādhi of Total Halt When an Arhat enters the Samādhi of Total Halt his sensory reception and perception are suspended Thus when  consciousness of the dying one abandons the body and its  domains it does so with the power of memory Upon dying ones consciousness replays clearly from memory all the karmas one has done in ones entire life Both body and mind are under stress Worthy Protector what is the meaning of consciousness consciousness means seed which can sprout a karmic body of any kind Perception thinking and memory are also sprouted from  consciousness It is called consciousness because it knows pleasure pain good and evil as well as good and evil objects You ask me how ones  consciousness leaves this body to accept the next requital Worthy Protector each body sprouted from ones  consciousness is like the reflection of a face in a mirror like the markings in the mud imprinted by a stamp As an analogy the light of sunrise removes darkness which returns after sunset Darkness has no mass no shape neither permanent nor impermanent but it is always there The same is true for consciousness Having no mass and no shape it is revealed through sensory reception and perception Nor does she know whether it looks black white or yellow whether it has complete faculties whether it has normal hands feet ears and eyes However stimulated by hot food and drink  the fetus will move because it feels pain The presence of consciousness is evident as sentient beings come or go bend or extend stare or blink speak or laugh carry heavy loads or do things However they do not know the whereabouts of consciousness in their bodies nor its form Worthy Protector the consciousness in essence permeates the sensory fields but it is not tainted by them Consciousness permeates the six faculties the six sense objects and the the five aggregates but it is not tainted by them Through them the functions of consciousness are evident Worthy Protector it is like a mechanism which enables a wooden machine to perform various kinds of tasks whether talking leaping jumping or dancing What is your opinion By whose power is this wooden machine enabled to work Worthy Protector replied to the Buddha My wisdom and knowledge are too shallow to determine this The Buddha told Worthy Protector We should know that it is by ones power to do karmas The power for doing karmas is formless but directed by ones intellect Thus a bodymachine can do things with the power of consciousness Whether ṛṣis gandharvas dragons humans asuras or sentient beings on other lifejourneys all depend on it to do karmas consciousness can form the body as a work machine Consciousness without any form or mass can uphold the dharma realm By analogy the pervasive sunlight shines equally on sentient beings with evil karma corpses impure things and stinking things but it is not tainted by evils Neither is  consciousness Even when it is in the body of a dog or a pig which eats impure things or in the body of anyone taking an evil lifejourney it is never tainted Worthy Protector  consciousness abandons this body and moves away to accept the next requital according to good or evil karma By analogy when the wind exits a remote mountain or a steep gorge and sweeps across a forest of fragrant campaka trees it carries fragrance When the wind sweeps across a place of feces corpses rot or filth it carries stench When it passes through both places it carries both fragrance and stench The stronger scent will be manifested first Yet the wind can carry both fragrance and stench far Likewise  consciousness abandons this body carrying good and evil karmas to accept the next requital It is just like the wind carrying fragrance and stench to another place It is also like a dreamer who sees myriads of images and does various kinds of karmas in a dream unaware that he is lying asleep When a virtuous person dies the transference of his  consciousness is peaceful and unconscious in the same way as his going somewhere in a dream without any fear The exit of  consciousness is not through ones throat mouth or other orifices Its exit and route are unknown The youth Worthy Protector Superior bowed down at the feet of the Buddha He asked the Buddha Where does  consciousness enter into the embryo inside the egg of a chicken or goose the shell of which is impenetrable If the embryo dies within the egg and if the eggshell has no crack or hole where does  consciousness exit The Buddha replied to Worthy Protector By analogy if black sesame seeds are processed with campaka flowers the oil will become aromatic and be called campaka oil It is far superior to ordinary sesame oil The oil initially does not contain any aroma but becomes aromatic after the seeds have been processed with the flowers The fragrance does not crack the sesame seeds in order to enter or to exit nor does it leave any substance in the oil However because of the force of causes and conditions the fragrance is blended into the oil and the oil becomes aromatic The way  consciousness moves into or out of the embryo of a chicken or a goose despite the eggshell is like the infusion of the campaka fragrance into the oil The transference of  consciousness is like the way the sun shines a jewel sparkles or wood blazes When a seed is planted and transformed in the ground its sprouts stem branches and leaves will successively emerge above the ground Then flowers in a variety of colors such as white offwhite and red will appear fruits in a variety of flavors will ripen The same great earth providing the four domainsearth water fire and windgrows different things according to their seeds Similarly the dharma realm of  the one consciousness manifests a sentient being successively reborn with black white yellow or red skin with different characters gentle or violent to undergo birth and death Worthy Protector consciousness has neither hands nor feet neither joints nor speech In its dharma realm the power of memory is strong Upon the death of a sentient being  consciousness abandons the current body and with the power of memory it becomes the seed for the next life Apart from consciousness there is no dharma realm apart from dharma realm there is no consciousness consciousness moves away along the  wind together with the dharma realm including the realms of memory and sensory reception Worthy Protector further asked the Buddha If so why does WorldHonored One say that consciousness is formless The Buddha replied Worthy Protector there are two kinds of form the internal and the external Eye consciousness is internal and eye is external Similarly ear consciousness is internal and ear is external nose consciousness is internal and nose is external tongue consciousness is internal and tongue is external body consciousness is internal and body is external Worthy Protector suppose a person born blind dreams of a beautiful woman and he clearly sees her hands feet and beautiful features He loves the sights as he dreams When the nights sleep is over and daylight arrives the blind man describes to a crowd the pleasing things in his dream saying I saw a beautiful woman whose features were uniquely exquisite a garden with lush flowers and hundreds and thousands of welladorned people who frolicked merrily Their skin was lustrous their shoulders were plump and their arms were long and rounded like an elephant trunk I gained great happiness from my dream and my heart was gladdened Worthy Protector this man was born blind who has never seen anything with his eyes Why can he perceive sights in his dream Worthy Protector replied I pray that You will indicate the reason The Buddha told Worthy Protector What one sees in a dream are internal eye objects differentiated by ones intellect not through the physical eye These internal eye objects manifest temporarily in the blind mans dream because of the power of memory He also recalls the dream with the power of memory With the right memory at death one sees internal forms projected by consciousness Furthermore Worthy Protector the transference of consciousness upon ones death is like a seed discarded on the ground With the support of the four domains it gradually transforms into sprout seedling stem branches and leaves Likewise ones consciousness is supported by these four dharmas memory receptiveness good and evil By analogy a crystal jewel placed alongside something black or white will appear black or white Likewise  consciousness supported by good or evil karmas will transfer somewhere to receive corresponding requitals good or evil Worthy Protector next asked the Buddha Where does ones body hold consciousness The Buddha replied Worthy Protector consciousness neither accumulates nor gathers nor does it grow is like the birth of a sprout The sprout is born neither before the seed is transformed nor after the seed is destroyed Worthy Protector what is your opinion Where does the seed stay A seed giving birth to a sprout is likened to consciousness becoming dimly aware  The formation of flower buds is likened to consciousness becoming receptive The stage from blooming of flowers to bearing of fruits is likened to  consciousness forming a body The way  consciousness forms a body is throughout all parts of the body Worthy Protector by what force does the reflection appear in a mirror Worthy Protector replied to the Buddha It is by the decision of the person Because of his face there is its reflection The form of the reflection is like that of the persons face Its sense organs whether complete or incomplete are like those on his face The Buddha said The persons face is the cause of the reflection and the mirror is the condition of the reflection The reflection appears because of the convergence of causes and conditions Likewise  consciousness is the cause of ones sensory reception perception mental processing and mental functions and the parents are the conditions As the causes and conditions converge a body appears  As for the person and the mirror when the person moves away his mirror reflection is also gone The person may cast his reflection elsewhere perhaps in the water Similarly carrying good and evil karmas  consciousness abandons this body and moves away to accept the next requital As another analogy the seed of a banyan tree or a ficus tree is small but it can grow a huge tree The tree again bears seeds The new seed then abandons the old tree to grow a new tree As the old tree grows weak over time with its sap exhausted it will dry out and decay After  consciousness abandons the body of a sentient being  it will accept a huge body of some kind according to karma It is also like many kinds of seeds such as barley wheat sesame mung bean and legume Because a seed is planted sprout stem flowers and fruits will grow and ripen Similarly because  consciousness has moved into a sentient being of some kind this being has awareness and sensory reception The way  consciousness holding good and evil karmas successively accepts a variety of bodies is also like a bee that stops over flowers With love pleasure and attachment it sucks the flavor of a flower for nourishment The bee then abandons this flower to seek other flowers at other places Whether it abandons fragrance for stench or it abandons stench for fragrance it cannot help loving and coveting the object it stops over Likewise  consciousness may acquire a celestial body to enjoy the fortune fruit of meritorious karma It may then abandon the celestial body to enter into hell to accept the misfortune fruit of evil karma As sasāra turns various kinds of bodies are  formed  consciousness is like the white seed of a red or blue tulip or a puṇḍarīka flower If one cracks open the seed one will find no sprout no flower and no color consciousness abandons a dead body including its fleshy frame facial features faculties and sensory fields because it no longer sees the convergence of their causes and conditions With its special vision hearing smelling tasting and tactility as well as its memory  consciousness knows the good and evil karmas one has done according to which it will accept a requital body As a silkworm constructs a cocoon binding itself by its own doing so too does  consciousness construct a body to bind itself It will then abandon that body and transfer into a new body as the next requital Because of a flower seed there will be a new plant with colorful and fragrant flowers Likewise after  consciousness has abandoned a body wherever it goes along with it goes the dharma realm including faculties and sensory reception Wherever a wishfulfilling jewel is it is accompanied by pleasing objects Wherever the sun is it is accompanied by bright light Likewise wherever consciousness transfers to it is accompanied by the dharma realm including sensory reception and perception After abandoning a body  consciousness without a body of flesh and bones takes the cause of form as its body It has faculties sensory reception and subtle thinking and can grasp good or evil Various kinds of fruits such as dates pomegranates mangoes and the like may taste pungent bitter sour sweet salty or tart With a distinct flavor each fruit serves a different purpose Thus as the  consciousnessseed transfers it is accompanied by sensory reception memory and good and evil karmas It is called consciousness because it knows that it has abandoned this body in order to accept the next requital body It is called consciousness because it knows that it is accompanied by good and evil karmas and that carrying these karmas it transfers to accept  requital It is called consciousness because it knows all about what the body does By analogy the wind has no form to grasp and no mass to get hold of but through causes and conditions it can do karmas The wind can carry cold or hot carry fragrance or stench shake the woods or violently devastate anything in its path Likewise consciousness has no form or mass and cannot be detected by sight or hearing However through causes and condition the appearance of consciousness is revealed Because ones consciousness maintains ones body the body knows pain or pleasure Looking radiant and energetic ones body can walk or stand speak or laugh and feel happy or sad Seeing clearly the karmas done we should know that there is consciousness Fascicle   At that time in the assembly the youth Moon Reality Superior rose from his seat and joined his palms He asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how does one see the cause of form How does one see the cause of desire How does one see the cause of perception How does one see the cause of grasping certain precepts The Buddha told Moon Reality The wise see objects wisely the foolish see objects foolishly When the wise see an attractive body they understand that it is filth only an assemblage of flesh bundles tendons bones membranes pus secretion and blood with large veins small veins and hollow and solid organs such as large intestine small intestine bladder stomach spleen gall bladder liver brain heart kidneys and lungs as well as hair and nails Also wrapped in a thin skin are abominable disgusting impure discharges such as bile phlegm mucus saliva feces and urine A form is composed of the four domains and they are the cause of form Moon Reality taking the body born from parents as an example its solidity is in the earth domain its moisture in the water domain its warmth in the fire domain and its motion in the wind domain Its perception and memory as well as its sensory fields such as sounds scents flavors and tactile sensations are all in the consciousness domain The youth Moon Reality next asked the Buddha Why does ones consciousness abandon the current body upon its death How does it transfer into the next body How does it know when to abandon this body The Buddha told Moon Reality A sentient being receives requital according to karma and the stream of consciousness continuously maintains each requital body Using watery milk as an example when it is heated with fire milk water and fat will separate Thus Moon Reality when a sentient beings life ends because of dissolution of the karmic force the physical form consciousness faculties and their spheres all separate from one another As the only reliance  consciousness then carries the dharma realm including memory and ones good and evil karmas and goes on to accept the next requital Moon Reality taking the highly auspicious butter as an example when  butter is cooked with various good medicines it turns into the highly auspicious butter with medicinal flavors and healing power Shedding its ordinary quality the butter now holds the strength of good medicine with six flavors pungent bitter sour salty tart and sweet With its substance aromas and flavors it can benefit ones body Similarly after abandoning the body  consciousness carrying its dharma realm and good and evil karmas moves away to accept the next requital Moon Reality the substance of the butter is like ones body Blending medicines with the butter turning it into the highly auspicious butter is like joining sense objects and faculties to do karma The medicinal flavors mixed into the butter are like good karma that supports consciousness If one eats the highly auspicious butter one will look robust energetic radiant fine and peaceful without any trouble It is like enjoying a pleasurerequital because good karma is stored in ones consciousness If one eats butter made with the wrong medicine ones features will turn grim without healthy colors chalky like the dead It is like receiving a painrequital because evil karma is stored in ones consciousness Moon Reality the auspicious precious butter does not have hands feet or eyes but it can retain the strength of the substance aromas and flavors of good medicines It can see the six desire heavens and the sixteen hells It can see its  body with shapely hands and feet and fine sense organs It also can see the abandoned corpse and recognize it as the body of its former life It also can see tall magnificent celestial palaces with various kinds of adornments surrounded by flowers fruits and trees and covered with vines so radiant and gorgeous that they are like new gold chains set with jewels Having seen these things it will be very joyous Because of great joy and love  consciousness will entrust itself to this  When a person with good karma abandons his body to assume another body it is peaceful and painless It is like a horseman abandoning one horse to ride another It is like a warrior armed with military strategy When the enemy troops approach he puts on his sturdy armor and fearlessly rides off on his steed Likewise  consciousness supported with ones roots of goodness abandons the inhalation and exhalation of this body as well as its spheres and moves away to experience fabulous pleasures by rebirth in heaven whether a Brahma heaven or even the top heaven heaven in the form realm At that time in the assembly Prince Great Medicine rose from his seat and joined his palms He asked the Buddha What form and image does consciousness assume after it has abandoned the body The Buddha replied Very good Great Medicine what you now ask is in the great profound realm of a Buddha Except for the Tathāgata no one can understand Then the youth Worthy Protector Superior said to the Buddha Prince Great Medicines question is very profound His wisdom is wonderful keen and brilliant The Buddha told Worthy Protector This prince Great Medicine has planted his roots of goodness under Vipaśyin Buddha For five hundred lives he was reborn in nonBuddhist families When he was a nonbeliever he often pondered the meaning of consciousness what consciousness is and why it is consciousness For five hundred lives he was unable to solve his problem unable to find clues as to the coming and going of consciousness I will today shatter his web of doubts and make him understand Then the youth Worthy Protector Superior said to Prince Great Medicine Very good Very good Your question is wonderful and profound The meaning of Moon Realitys questions is shallow and narrow like a child whose mind wanders in the midst of external objects not knowing his internal realm It is rare to hear the true Dharma and it is hard to encounter a Buddha whose vast knowledge and profound wisdom are unfathomable We should especially request the Buddha to give the utmost wonderful teachings Seeing the Buddhas radiant and pleasant features like an autumn lotus flower opening Prince Great Medicine was exuberant and joyful He joined his palms singlemindedly and said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I love the profound Dharma and I thirst for the profound Dharma I always have the fear of the Tathāgata entering parinirvāṇa and of my not hearing the true Dharma Then I would have to be among the sentient beings in the world of the five turbidities too ignorant to know good versus evil too ignorant to be aware of the good versus the evil and of maturity versus immaturity  I would have to transmigrate in confusion through the painful journeys of birth and death The Buddha told Prince Great Medicine The true Dharma of the Tathāgata is hard to encounter and hard to acquire In a past life for the sake of half a stanza  I climbed up a mountain and plunged down abandoning my life For the sake of the true Dharma I underwent immeasurable millions of koṭis of various kinds of suffering and tribulations Great Medicine you may ask all the questions you wish I will explicate them to you Prince Great Medicine said to the Buddha Affirmatively I accept Your teachings WorldHonored One what is the appearance of consciousness I pray that You will grant me an explanation The Buddha told Great Medicine Its appearance is like a persons reflection in the water Indistinguishable as existent or nonexistent it cannot be grasped It is like the shape of a cloud like an image of  thirsty love Prince Great Medicine asked the Buddha What is thirsty love The Buddha replied When ones eyes follow a pleasing sight it is called thirsty love When one holds a mirror one sees the reflection of ones face When the face in front of the mirror is gone so is its reflection The transference of  consciousness is similar and consciousness and good and evil karmas have no form or shape to see As a person who is born blind does not know sunrise sunset night day light or dark likewise one cannot see ones consciousness Nor can one see in ones body thirsty love sensory reception perception or memory The  domains the  faculties and the  aggregates constituting a sentient being are all consciousness The physical eyes ears nose tongue and body together with sights sounds scents flavors and tactile sensations as well as the nonphysical experience of pain or pleasure are all consciousness Great Medicine for example one tastes food with ones tongue to detect all six flavors sweet bitter pungent sour salty and tart The tongue and the food have shapes and forms but flavors are formless One detects sensations because of ones body with its bones marrows flesh and blood Through ones body one can know consciousness as well as the fortune fruit or misfortune fruit it holds At that time the youth Worthy Protector Superior bowed down at the feet of the Buddha and asked WorldHonored One can one see ones consciousness and know ones fortune or misfortune in store The Buddha replied Hearken well No one can see consciousness without first seeing the truth Unlike a mango in ones palm consciousness cannot be seen Consciousness is not inside ones sense organs such as the eye If consciousness were inside any sense organ such as the eye one would be able to see it by dissecting the eye Worthy Protector as Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges all see that consciousness is formless so too I see that consciousness is formless Consciousness cannot be seen by the ordinary and the foolish It can be revealed  only by analogy Worthy Protector to know ones sin or merit stored in consciousness you now should hearken Suppose a person is possessed whether by a deity such as a gandharva or by a spirit such as a skandha Worthy Protector what is your opinion Can one see the possessor whether a deity or a spirit Worthy Protector replied to the Buddha No WorldHonored One the possessor a deity or a spirit has no form or shape One cannot see it inside or outside that persons body  Worthy Protector if a person is possessed by a great deity with superb merit he will receive fragrant flowers and choice incense and will have aromatic fine food and drink served properly with handsome clean offering paraphernalia Likewise because  consciousness has a store of merits one will receive  fruit in the form of dignity peace and happiness whether as a king among men a state minister a dignitary with reputation a person in command of wealth an elder a merchant lord or a god who enjoys splendid celestial life Ones body receiving pleasurerequital because ones consciousness has a store of merits is like a person possessed by a benign deity When the deity receives an offering of wonderful flowers choice incense and aromatic fine food and drink he will be delighted and the possessed patient will be soothed Therefore if a person acquires command of rank and wealth in life we should know that his body enjoys fortune fruit because his consciousness has stored merit Worthy Protector if a person is possessed by a sordid evil spirit such as a pūtana which loves feces spit rot filth and other impure things offering these to the spirits pleasure will suit that person Because of the power of the spirit the possessed patient follows its desires and loves impurity stench rot and feces Likewise if  consciousness is laden with sin one will be reborn  in poverty or will take an evil lifejourney of some kind as a hungry ghost or an animal that eats filthy things Worthy Protector one who is possessed by a superior deity a formless and shapeless entity receives various kinds of fragrant and pure offerings Similarly one receives pleasurerequital because ones  consciousness is stored with meritorious karma By contrast one who is possessed by an evil spirit such as a pūtana receives impure filthy gross food and drink Similarly one receives painrequital because ones  consciousness is laden with sinful karma Worthy Protector we should know that a body possessed by a deity or a spirit receives fine or gross food and drink is like one who receives pleasurerequital or painrequital for ones merit or sin stored  Prince Great Medicine asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how does one see the cause of desire The Buddha replied Great Medicine desire is born from complementary causes like two pieces of wood rubbed against each other by human effort to produce fire Thus desire is born from consciousness together with male and female sights sounds scents flavors and tactile sensations As an analogy fruit is born from flower However there is no fruit in a flower When the fruit is born the flower has perished Although consciousness is evident because of the body it cannot be seen by searching throughout the body When the  karmic fruit is born in consciousness the body perishes Bones marrow and impure things will all decompose along with the body For example carrying the form aroma flavor and feel of the future fruit a seed leaves the tree to grow Likewise  consciousness abandons the current body carrying good and evil karmas sensory reception perception and thinking to accept the next life as requital The process is also like a man and a woman who go separate ways after their pleasure meeting of love and desire Consciousness joined with karma engages in love attachment play craving greed and stinginess When the current karmic requital is exhausted consciousness will accept the next requital according to karma With the conditions of the parents matched during the intermediate state  karmic force will enable  consciousness to acquire a body fruit  These are the cause of desire Great Medicine what is the cause for one to grasp the precepts These preceptsno killing no stealing no sexual misconduct no lying and no drinking alcoholare stipulated by a teacher Grasping these precepts is caused by a  view that because of observing these precepts one will achieve holy fruits becoming a Srotāpanna a Sakṛdāgāmin or an Anāgāmin However because of grasping one will instead gain a good rebirth assuming human form or celestial form is goodness with discharges  not goodness without discharges because goodness without discharges will not yield such a fruit a body composed of the five aggregates Therefore grasping the precepts means planting an impure seed Consciousness that holds both good and evil karmas is impure and it suffers from feverish distress because of afflictions This is the cause of grasping the precepts Great Medicine asked the Buddha How does consciousness assume the form of a god or a helldweller The Buddha replied Great Medicine  consciousness in the intermediate state has extraordinary vision which does not depend on the physical eye for sight This special vision joined with a fortunate condition sees merrymaking with desire and pleasure in a celestial palace Consciousness will delight in and be attached to what it sees and will think I should go there Impure love and attachment are the cause of being When consciousness sees its dead body lying in the place for corpses it will then think Because it has accumulated good karmas I now will receive the celestiallife requital Great Medicine asked the Buddha WorldHonored One this consciousness deeply loves the corpse Why does it not use it The Buddha asked Great Medicine Taking the cut hair and beard as an analogy although they are still black and lustrous can you plant them on the body to make them grow again Great Medicine replied to the Buddha No WorldHonored One the abandoned hair and beard cannot be planted on the body to make them grow again The Buddha said Likewise Great Medicine the corpse that  consciousness has abandoned cannot be reused as the next requital Great Medicine further asked the Buddha This consciousness is invisible and profound without any mass or shape to find How does it maintain the large body of a sentient being such as an elephant which is hard like vajra How does it enter into and maintain the body of a strong man who can fight off nine elephants The Buddha replied Great Medicine the wind without mass or shape stays in a hidden valley or crevice It can break out with violent force breaking Mount Sumeru into dust Great Medicine what are the form and appearance of the wind that can destroy Mount Sumeru Great Medicine replied to the Buddha The wind is intangible without mass or shape The Buddha said Great Medicine as the wind is intangible without mass or shape so too is  consciousness without mass or shape However it can maintain a body whether large or small whether of an elephant or of a mosquito As a bright lamp dispels darkness in a large or small room likewise consciousness maintains a large or small body according to karma Great Medicine asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what is the appearance of karma Through what causes and conditions does it manifest The Buddha replied Great Medicine ones rebirth in a celestial palace to eat wonderful celestial food in peace and happiness is the appearance of a karmic fruit As an analogy two thirsty people wander in wilderness One of them finds cool good water the other finds nothing and has to endure thirst and suffering One of them acquires cool water not given by anyone the other in thirst is not obstructed by anyone from finding water Each person receives pleasurerequital or painrequital for karmic reasons Great Medicine this is the way to see ones good or evil karma which is white or black like the two distinct phases of the moon in the sky It is also like the color of a fruit which changes as the fruit ripens with the power in its fire domain Thus because of abundance of merit one is reborn into a noble family with an outstanding physical appearance plentiful assets and an overflow of gold and treasures Or one may be reborn in a celestial palace to enjoy happiness and ease As an analogy a seed is planted in the ground but fruits appear at the top of the tree The seed does not go from branch to branch to reach the tree top nor does anyone place the seed on a branch One cannot find the seed by cutting open the tree trunk Even if the tree is chopped down one still cannot find the seed As an analogy the seed is the cause of the flower but inside the seed there is no flower The flower is the cause of the fruit but inside the flower there is no fruit As the flower and the fruit grow neither growth shows its cause Likewise because of the body there is karma and because of karma there is the body When the flower falls at maturity the fruit with its seed will appear when the body expires at maturity the karmic seed will leave it As the seed is the cause of flowers and fruits likewise is the body the cause of good and evil karmas Karma has no shape no appearance of maturity like the shadow of ones body with neither mass nor obstruction The shadow is not held by or fastened to a person but it moves along with the person Never has anyone seen the shadow coming out of his body Likewise there are body and karma but karma cannot be seen as something attached to the body Yet without the body there cannot be karma As an analogy medicine which tastes pungent bitter or tart can purge all diseases and make ones body glow with healthy color and radiance and people will know on sight that  has taken good medicine The flavor of medicine can be experienced but its curative merit is formless cannot be seen and cannot be captured However it can improve a persons skin tone and glow Likewise good karma which has no mass or shape can enrich ones body One who is fortified with good karma is endowed with food drink and plentiful internal and external assets One has facial features and shapely normal hands and feet lives in a luxurious house piled up with treasures such as jewels gold and silver and enjoys peace happiness and merriment at will We should know that this is the appearance of good karma By contrast if one is reborn with repulsive features stays in a squalid place in a fringe country in poverty and lowliness subsists on gross food and drink or has nothing to eat lacks resources envying others enjoyment we should know that this is the appearance of evil karma As a clear mirror displays the fineness or grossness of ones face the reflection in the mirror has no mass and cannot be captured As  consciousness has a store of good and evil karmas accordingly one is reborn as a god or a human or is reborn as an animal or a helldweller Great Medicine this is the way to see karma and  consciousness transfer together Great Medicine asked WorldHonored One how does amazing consciousness acquire a large body and maintain its sense organs The Buddha replied Great Medicine as an analogy a hunter goes into a mountain forest and shoots an elephant with a poisonous arrow The poison on the arrow enters into the blood stream of the elephant disables the body and destroys its faculties The poison is lethal and the body turns bluered like clotted blood Having killed the elephant the poison is spent What is your opinion How does the quantity of poison compare with the size of the elephants body Can they compare Great Medicine replied to the Buddha WorldHonored One the poison and the elephant have too wide a disproportion to compare quantity or size It is like comparing a mustard seed with Mount Sumeru Great Medicine likewise  consciousness abandons the current body and its spheres and moves on to develop the faculties  according to karma Great Medicine further asked the Buddha Why is the subtle consciousness not fatigued by maintaining a large body The Buddha replied Great Medicine Sumeru the king of mountains stands at  yojanas The two dragonkings Nanda and Upananda each circle it three times They then shake Mount Sumeru with a huge breath turning the waters of its surrounding sea into poison These two dragonkings are gigantic and strong and the two dragonkings Vāsuki and Takṣaka are their equals What is your opinion Is there any difference in quantity between the consciousness of any of the four dragonkings and that of a mosquito Great Medicine replied WorldHonored One there is no difference between the consciousness of any of the four dragonkings and that of a mosquito Great Medicine if a small drop of deadly poison enters the mouth of each of the four dragons they all will die What is your opinion Between a small drop of deadly poison and the venom in the mouth of a dragon which is stronger Great Medicine replied to the Buddha The venom in the dragons mouth is stronger and the strength of a small drop of poison is weaker Great Medicine even for a strong sentient being that can fight off nine elephants amazing consciousness with neither form nor shape not measurable by quantity maintains its body according to karma Although the seed of a banyan tree is tiny after being planted it can grow into a magnificent huge tree with hundreds and thousands of branches What is your opinion Are the seed and the tree of the same size Great Medicine replied WorldHonored One the seed and the tree have a vast difference in size like that between a hole in the lotus root and the domain of space Thus Great Medicine the seed cannot be found in the tree Yet without the seed the tree cannot be born As a tiny banyan seed can grow a huge tree so too amazing consciousness can grow a huge body One cannot find consciousness in the body Yet without consciousness the body cannot be Great Medicine further asked the Buddha Why does consciousness which is indestructible like an adamantine vajra stay in a fragile quicktodecay body The Buddha replied Great Medicine as an analogy a poor man acquires a wishfulfilling jewel By the power of the jewel spontaneously appear resources and pleasure objects such as ornately sculpted towers splendid palatial mansions lush gardens full of flowers and fruits elephants and horses and female attendants Later he loses the wishfulfilling jewel and all the resources and pleasure objects vanish Although the wishfulfilling jewel is so strong and durable that it cannot be destroyed by a thousand vajras the resources it produces are false and impermanent which quickly disperse and perish Likewise  consciousness is strong and indestructible but the body it produces quickly decays and perishes Great Medicine asked WorldHonored One how does gentle consciousness penetrate a dense hard form The Buddha said to Great Medicine Water is a gentle substance but its flow can penetrate mountain rocks What is your opinion How do you compare the quality of softness and hardness in water and rock Great Medicine replied WorldHonored One the quality of a rock is hard like vajra The quality of water is soft pleasant to the touch Great Medicine Consciousness is like water most wondrous and most soft but it can penetrate a strong large body accepting it as requital Great Medicine next asked the Buddha WorldHonored One after sentient beings have abandoned their bodies how are they reborn in heaven and how are they reborn in hell The Buddha replied to Great Medicine Upon the death of a person if he has stored meritorious karma he will abandon his original eyesight and acquire the wonderful celestial vision With the wonderful celestial vision he will see the six desire heavens the six lifejourneys and the movement of his body He will see celestial palaces with all amenities and joyous gardens where flowers are always in bloom He will also see beautiful goddessattendants make merry in the lotus hall wearing flowers and silk garments adorned with bangles bracelets and other ornaments Once he sees the goddessdaughters in a heaven his mind will be filled with happiness and gratification as well as attachment As a good sign he will see a huge hall in the sky lined with hundreds and thousands of colorful columns with beautiful carvings The magnificent jeweled hall will be decorated with various kinds of fragrant flowers and draped with nets from which hang bells playing beautiful refreshing tones to gentle winds Frolicking in the hall will be celestial youths adorned with jewels Having seen these things he will smile contentedly showing his teeth like flowers in a painting He might even see with delight and reverence the honored visage of a Buddha He will joyfully bid farewell as if to take a short trip Then he will return to comfort his family and friends helping them not to mourn the way existence flows telling them not to have sorrow caused by differentiation because where there is birth there must be death Great Medicine a person with good karma before his death will delight in giving alms in reciting various stanzas and praises and in understanding various explanations and teachings of the true Dharma He will abandon his life peacefully not in sleep but as if in sleep As the person is about to abandon his life his celestial parentstobe will be seated together on one seat Flowers will naturally appear in the hands of his goddess mothertobe Seeing these flowers she will say to his fathertobe What an auspicious extraordinary victory fruit You should know that a time is approaching for joyful celebration for a son His goddess mothertobe will then shake the flowers with her hands As she plays with the flowers the persons life will end It is like wood producing fire It is like the moon casting its reflection in clear water His  consciousness with a store of good karmas will accept a celestial life a requital It will be swiftly delivered by  wind into a flower and his celestial parentstobe seated together on one seat will both look at the flower After the wind of desire blows sweet dew on the flower for seven days a bright clean godchild adorned with jewels will appear lively and radiant in the hands of his goddessmother Great Medicine asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how does formless consciousness bring a form into being through the power of causes and conditions Fire is born from the convergence of causes and conditions Without causes and conditions fire cannot be produced Examining the wood one cannot find the appearance of fire Yet one can see fire rising from the wood Indeed Great Medicine  consciousness brings a physical form into being through ones parents as the conditions Searching through ones body one cannot find consciousness Yet apart from ones body there is no consciousness Great Medicine before the kindling of fire the appearance of fire is not there Nor are there such qualities as heat that can be felt Thus without a body Great Medicine there cannot be consciousness sensory reception perception or mental processing Great Medicine when ordinary beings see the bright light of the sun they do not see the substance of the sun whether it is black white yellow white or yellow red They know only that the sun alternately rising and setting radiates light and heat They know the sun through its functions Consciousness too is known by its functions Great Medicine asked the Buddha What are the functions of consciousness The Buddha replied to Great Medicine Sensory reception perception mental processing thinking and feeling anxiety agony or distress are functions of consciousness Furthermore habitual good and evil karmas become seeds stored in consciousness which manifest as functions Great Medicine asked the Buddha How does  consciousness leave one body and quickly accept another body If it has abandoned one body but has not yet accepted a new body what appearance does consciousness assume during this interval The Buddha replied Great Medicine as an analogy a warrior with long arms clad in sturdy armor rides a horse swift as the wind into a battle formation and fights bravely with his weapon Although he falls off his horse in a moment of inattention he immediately jumps back on because of his good training in martial arts Likewise  consciousness abandons one body and immediately accepts another body It is also like a coward who upon seeing the enemy out of fear immediately rides his horse to escape Likewise when  consciousness with a store of good karmas sees its celestial parentstobe seated together on the same seat it quickly entrusts its rebirth to them Great Medicine you ask what appearance consciousness assumes during the interval after it has abandoned its old body but has not yet accepted a new body Great Medicine by analogy a persons reflection in the water has no mass to grasp Yet its hands feet facial features and other shapes are no different from the persons The reflection has no mass nor does it do karmas It has neither sense of hot or cold nor sense of touch Great Medicine this explains how  consciousness with a store of good karmas is reborn in heaven Great Medicine asked the Buddha How is  consciousness reborn in hell The Buddha replied Great Medicine in regard to how those who have done evil karmas enter into hell you should hearken Great Medicine sentient beings that have accumulated roots of evil will have this thought upon dying I now die here with immense anxiety and suffering abandoning my beloved parents relatives and friends They will see hells and see themselves doomed to fall into them headfirst They will see a place covered with blood and will relish its flavor on sight Conditioned upon their appetite for blood they will be reborn in hell The way  consciousness deposits itself in the midst of such conditions as putrid evil water and stinking filth is analogous to the birth of maggots through the power of such conditions as feces filth spoiled cream and putrid liquor in a stinking place Likewise those who enter into hell are reborn there through foul things The youth Worthy Protector Superior joined his palms and asked the Buddha What forms and appearances do helldwellers assume Those who are reborn in a moat will have bodies like black clouds Those who are reborn in a milk river will have bodies dotted in various colors and their bodies will be very delicate like an infant of nobility Their bodies will measure more than eight elbows in height with long head hair and body hair trailing behind Their hands feet and facial features will be crooked and incomplete People in Jambudvīpa will die if they see them in the distance Great Medicine asked the Buddha What food do helldwellers eat The Buddha replied Great Medicine sentient beings in hell receive no pleasure from eating food Running about with fear they will see in the distance red molten copper Mistaking it for blood they will rush for it They will also hear a call saying that the hungry can come quickly to eat They will then go there and hold their hands as cups before their mouths The hell warden will pour hot molten copper into their cupped hands and force them to drink it down into their abdomens Their bones and joints will burst and crack open their bodies entirely in flames Great Medicine the food eaten by sentient beings in hell only augments their suffering without affording even a little comfort or happiness Such are the agonies of sentient beings in hell However ones  consciousness never gives up nor is it damaged Pressed by the agony of hunger and thirst they will see a lush green garden with an abundance of thriving trees flowers and fruits Seeing this they will laugh and say to one another This lush garden is green and the wind is cool The multitude will hasten into the garden seeking a moment of pleasure However the tree leaves flowers and fruits will all change into knives and swords to hack and slash these sinners While some of them will be hit and their bodies cut in two others will scream as they run in the four directions Chasing after the sinners the wardens will say to them Where are you going You can stay here How can you escape to the east or the west This garden is adorned with your karmas Is it possible to leave Indeed Great Medicine sentient beings in hell undergo various kinds of suffering They die every seven days and are reborn again in hell Because of the power of karma they are like worker bees that return to their original place after collecting honey from flowers Sentient beings with sinful karma are doomed to enter into hell As they begin to die they will see death agents arrive who will lasso their necks and pull them As if being captured by bandits they will experience immense suffering in body and mind as they enter vast darkness wailing these words Oh oh Disaster I now abandon relatives friends and various kinds of loves in Jambudvīpa to enter into hell I now do not see the road to heaven but see wretched things Like a silkworm that produces silk to bind itself to death I am bound by my own sinful karma With a noose fastened around my neck I am dragged and driven into hell Worthy Protector such are the miserable appearances of sentient beings with sinful karma being reborn in hell Worthy Protector and Prince Great Medicine having heard these words were astounded their hair standing on end They rose together joined their palms and said We today take refuge in the Buddha and entreat for His rescue and protection We pray that because of the merit of hearing this Dharma before we are liberated from the stream of existence under the wheel of birth and death we will not go down the three evil lifepaths never into hell Worthy Protector further implored the Buddha I pray only that You will grant our wish The Buddha said You may ask anything you wish Worthy Protector asked the Buddha What is accumulation What is gathering What are the aggregates What is the meaning of no transference into a body The Buddha replied Worthy Protector the body is composed of four realms intellect perception mental faculty and ignorance Including these four realms in ones consciousness is called accumulation Gathering refers to the six domains and the six faculties with their six corresponding objects There are three causes of existence in the Three Realms and there are two causes for understanding Gathering also means the assemblage of hair beard nails skin flesh pus blood mucus saliva bile phlegm secretion fat marrow and fluids as well as hands feet face and large and small joints It is called gathering because it is like grain legume sesame and wheat collected and amassed into large piles The six domains are earth water fire wind space and consciousness The six faculties are eye ear nose tongue body and mental faculty their corresponding objects are sights sounds scents flavors tactile sensations and mental objects The three causes of ones existence in the Three Realms are greed anger and delusion while the three causes  are wind bile and phlegm The two causes for understanding are precepts and faith another two are equability and almsgiving another two are energetic progress and samādhi and another two are good and evil Sensory reception perception mental processing and consciousness are called the four formless aggregates Sensory reception leads to experiencing pain pleasure or neither of the two Perception refers to cognition of pain or pleasure Mental processing refers to thinking attention and sensory contact No transference  pertains to ones attainment of the bodhi fruit because ones body voice and mind are purified After death ones  consciousness abandons the aggregates of existence and moves away joyfully It no longer undergoes  existence transmigrating through lifejourneys No more transference  is called no transference Then Worthy Protector and Prince Great Medicine bowed down at the feet of the Buddha and said WorldHonored One this Dharma nugget pronounced by the Buddha the Omniscient One will bring great benefits peace and joy to sentient beings in the future The Buddha said The Dharma store of the Tathāgata abides for eternity never ceasing The omniscient one knows everything because I have developed wisdom light through immeasurable assiduity and suffering I now pronounce this sūtra on this trueDharma day to shine brilliant light on sentient beings and to let virtue and renown flow everywhere from the ocean of omniscience I pronounce it for the sake of those who are able to control their mind streams Wherever this sūtra is wherever it is being recited or explained gods spirits asuras and mahoragas will all come to make obeisance and to give support Bhikṣus from this day forward do not pronounce this sūtra to nonbelievers Nor should you show it to those who intend to find fault with this sūtra Nor should you pronounce it to nonBuddhists such as Nirgranthaputra and the Nirgrantha group Nor should you pronounce it to those who request it with disrespect Those who disobey my instructions damage Dharma work and in effect damage the Tathāgata Bhikṣus if there are those who make obeisance and offerings to this sūtra you should respect them and honor them with gifts because they uphold the Tathāgata store Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Be brave to transcend the burden of afflictions Train assiduously in the true teachings of the Buddha Annihilate the legions of death Like the elephant trampling on reeds Uphold the Dharma observe its precepts And progress singlemindedly without negligence or indolence In order to cease the flow of rebirth Reaching the edge of agonizing existence After the Buddha pronounced this sūtra the youth Worthy Protector Superior Prince Great Medicine bhikṣus and BodhisattvaMahāsattvas as well as gods humans asuras gandharvas and others in the huge assembly having heard the Buddhas words rejoiced and reverently carried out the teachings Vaipulya Sūtra of rīmālās Lions Roar That Reveals the Great Skillful Means of the One Vehicle Translated in the Liu Song Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master GuṇabhadraChapter   A Tathāgatas Virtues  Thus I have heard At one time the Buddha was outside rāvastī  staying in the Jetavana garden which was purchased for the Buddha from Prince Jeta by Anāthapiṇḍika the Elder At that time King Prasenajit and his queen Mallikā had not been believers in the Dharma for long He said to his queen Queen rīmālā  is our daughter She is kind intelligent and endowed with a keen capacity If she sees the Buddha she will quickly understand the Dharma without harboring doubts We should send her a letter at the right time to inspire her to seek the Dharma The queen said Now is the time Then the king and queen wrote a letter briefly praising the Tathāgatas immeasurable virtues They ordered a palace attendant named Candra to deliver the letter to rīmālā Upon arriving in the kingdom of Ayodhyā Candra entered the palace and respectfully handed the letter to Queen rīmālā She joyfully accepted it with the highest reverence by touching it to the crown of her head After reading it inspired by its rare information rīmālā spoke to Candra in verse I have heard that a Buddhas voice Is hard to encounter in the world If this letter reveals the truth I should make an offering to you  If that BuddhaBhagavān Has appeared in the world to benefit all He should pity me And enable me to see Him As soon as she had this thought the Buddha appeared in the sky in His unparalleled body and emitted vast radiance rīmālā and her retinue prostrated themselves at His feet With a pure mind they praised the Buddhas virtues as she spoke in verse The Tathāgatas sublime body Is unequaled unparalleled And inconceivable in the world So I now pay homage As the Tathāgatas physical form is endless So too is His wisdom And His Dharma is ever abiding You have removed the faults of Your mind And the four faults of Your body And arrived on the inconceivable ground  So I now pay homage to the Dharma King You have learned jñeya  And Your wisdom body is hindrance free And encompasses all dharmas So I now pay homage I pay homage to Your immeasurable virtues I pay homage to Your unequaled virtues I pay homage to Your boundless Dharma I pay homage to Your inconceivable  I pray that You will pity and protect me And enable the Dharma seeds to grow in me I pray that You will accept and support me In this life and future lives I have performed meritorious works And will continue in this life and future lives With these roots of goodness I pray that You will accept and support me Then rīmālā and her retinue bowed down to the Buddha In their midst the Buddha bestowed upon her a prophecy Because of the roots of goodness you have acquired by praising the Tathāgatas virtues you will be reborn as a commanding king of gods and humans for countless asakhyeyas of kalpas Wherever you will be reborn you will always see me and praise me as you do now You will make offerings to innumerable asakhyeyas of Buddhas After  asakhyeya kalpas you will become a Buddha called Universal Light the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha In His Buddha Land there will be no evil lifepaths and no suffering such as old age illness deterioration distress or unpleasant experiences nor will there be evils or the names of evil karmas Sentient beings in that world will have good appearances and strength live long lives and enjoy the five desires Their happiness will surpass that of gods in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven  and they will ride only the Mahāyāna  Those in the Three Realms of Existence who cultivate roots of goodness will gather there When rīmālā received this prophecy innumerable sentient beings such as gods and humans aspired to be reborn in that world Then the WorldHonored One bestowed upon them the prophecy of their rebirth there Chapter   Accepting Ten Precepts After rīmālā received the prophecy she stood respectfully and accepted ten vast precepts She vowed WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will never entertain the thought of violating the precepts I have accepted WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will never harbor arrogance toward my teachers WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will never harbor anger toward sentient beings WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will never harbor jealousy of others appearances or things WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will never harbor stinginess about giving away internal or external things WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will never accept or accumulate things for myself Anything I accept will be for relieving sentient beings in need WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will practice the Four Drawingin Dharmas never for receiving good requitals but for benefiting all sentient beings My mind free from greedy desire complacency and hindrances I will draw in sentient beings WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi when I see sentient beings in forlornness confinement shackles sickness tribulation or hardship I will not abandon them even for a short while but will properly benefit them until they are free from suffering WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi when I see those who make an evil livelihood such as hunting or raising animals  or those who violate a Tathāgatas pure precepts I will not abandon them Wherever I see such sentient beings if I have the power  I will tame those who should be tamed and draw in those who should be drawn in Because taming them and drawing them in will enable the Dharma to abide in the world for a long time If the Dharma abides in the world for a long time there will be more gods and humans and fewer sentient beings taking the evil lifepaths Then all will be able to follow the Dharma wheel a Tathāgata turns Because I see this benefit I will draw them in not abandoning them WorldHonored One from now on until I attain bodhi I will uphold the true Dharma  and never forget or lose it Because forgetting or losing the Dharma means forgetting the Mahāyāna Forgetting the Mahāyāna means forgetting the pāramitās Forgetting the pāramitās means not wanting to ride the Mahāyāna If a Bodhisattva is indecisive about riding the Mahāyāna he has no motivation to accept the true Dharma and enter it with delight Then he will never be able to transcend the ground of ordinary beings As I see this immeasurable loss I also see the immeasurable benefits received by a BodhisattvaMahāsattva who accepts the true Dharma Therefore I accept these ten vast precepts May the Dharma King the WorldHonored One be my present witness because at present only the BuddhaBhagavān knows  Sentient beings have small and weak roots of goodness They form a web of doubts because these ten vows are hard to carry out or they do evil karmas in the long night and suffer the dire consequences To settle their minds before the Buddha I now make a truthful vow If I fully observe these ten vast precepts this multitude will see a rain of celestial flowers and hear celestial sounds As soon as she spoke these words the open sky rained down celestial flowers and wonderful sounds were heard saying Indeed indeed What you say is true not false Upon seeing the celestial flowers and hearing the celestial sounds all in the assembly removed their doubts They rejoiced exuberantly and said that they wished always to be with rīmālā and to do the same as she would Then the WorldHonored One bestowed upon the multitude the prophecy of the fulfillment of their wish Chapter   The Three Vast Vows Then rīmālā made three vast vows before the Buddha She said I will benefit endless innumerable sentient beings through the power of these true vows In all my lives I will use my roots of goodness to acquire the wisdomknowledge  of the true Dharma This is my first vast vow After I have acquired the wisdomknowledge of the true Dharma I will tirelessly expound it to sentient beings This is my second vast vow I accept the true Dharma and will relinquish my body life and wealth to protect and uphold it This is my third vast vow Then the Buddha said to rīmālā Your three vast vows are like the domain of space which encompasses all dharmas Hence a Bodhisattvas vows as numerous as the sands of Ganges are all encompassed in these three vast vows These three vast vows are truly vast Chapter   Accepting the True Dharma Then rīmālā said to the Buddha Through the Buddhas awesome power I would like to condense my vast vows into what they truly are The Buddha said You have my permission to speak rīmālā said to the Buddha All vows as numerous as the sands of the Ganges which are made by a Bodhisattva are encompassed in one vast vow the vow of accepting the true Dharma Accepting the true Dharma is truly a vast vow The Buddha praised rīmālā Very good very good Your wisdom and skill are profound and wonderful because you have planted roots of goodness in the long night Of future sentient beings only those who have long planted roots of goodness can understand your words You can expound  accepting the true Dharma just as past Buddhas expounded it present Buddhas do expound it and future Buddhas will expound it As I now have attained the unsurpassed bodhi I too often expound  accepting the true Dharma Indeed I say that as the merit acquired by accepting the true Dharma is boundless so too a Tathāgatas wisdom and eloquence are boundless Because accepting the true Dharma has great virtues and great benefits The Vast Meaning of Accepting the True Dharma rīmālā said to the Buddha Through the Buddhas spiritual power I would like to expound the vast meaning of accepting the true Dharma The Buddha said Speak rīmālā said The vast meaning of accepting the true Dharma is immeasurable Accepting the true Dharma means acquiring the entire Buddha Dharma and gathering  Dharma Doors  As an analogy when a new kalpa begins vast clouds form and send down colorful rains and various treasures Likewise accepting the true Dharma rains down immeasurable fortunate requitals and countless roots of goodness WorldHonored One as another analogy when a new kalpa begins vast waters gather and form a ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World with  koṭi continents of different kinds Likewise accepting the true Dharma gives rise to the Mahāyānas store of immeasurable realms the transcendental powers of all Bodhisattvas worldly security happiness gratification and ease supraworldly peace and joy and even virtues gods and humans have never before had What are these four They are  sentient beings Likewise a good man or woman who accepts the true Dharma can like the great earth perform four heavy tasks What are these four They are  giving the Mahāyāna to those who seek it These are the four heavy tasks that a good man or woman who accepts the true Dharma can like the great earth perform Indeed WorldHonored One a good man or woman who accepts the true Dharma can like the great earth perform these four heavy tasks befriend sentient beings unasked pity and comfort sentient beings with great compassion and become a Dharma mother of the world As another analogy the great earth has four treasure stores What are these four They are treasures of  pricelessness These are the great earths four treasure stores Likewise a good man or woman who accepts the true Dharma has like the great earth four supreme treasures What are these four They are  giving the Mahāyāna to those who seek it From a good man or woman who accepts the true Dharma a sentient being can receive such great treasures which are extraordinary and rare benefits WorldHonored One producing great treasure stores is accepting the true Dharma WorldHonored One what is meant by accepting the true Dharma accepting the true Dharma is no different from the true Dharma The true Dharma is  accepting the true Dharma Practicing the Pāramitās Is Accepting the True Dharma WorldHonored One practicing the pāramitās is no different from accepting the true Dharma Accepting the true Dharma means practicing the pāramitās For those who should be brought to  maturity through almsgiving he or she gives them alms not even sparing his or her body parts to bring them to  maturity according to their mentalities and enable them to abide in the true Dharma This is called dānapāramitā  For those who should be brought to  maturity through observing the precepts he or she protects his six faculties purifies his or her body voice and mind karmas and displays the four majestic deportments  to bring them to  maturity according to their mentalities and enable them to abide in the true Dharma This is called śīlapāramitā  For those who should be brought to  maturity through enduring adversity he or she endures their abusive words insults slanders and threats with an altruistic mind and the foremost endurance without anger or even changing color to bring them to  maturity according to their mentalities and enable them to abide in the true Dharma This is called kṣāntipāramitā  For those who should be brought to  maturity through making energetic progress he or she helps them with a tireless mind makes the foremost energetic progress with great aspirations and displays the four majestic deportments to bring them to  maturity according to their mentalities and enable them to abide in the true Dharma This is called vīryapāramitā  For those who should be brought to  maturity through practicing meditation he or she uses an undisturbed mind an undistracted mind and the foremost right mindfulness that never forgets what he or she did or said long ago to bring them to  maturity according to their mentalities and enable them to abide in the true Dharma This is called dhyānapāramitā  For those who should be brought to  maturity through developing wisdom he or she uses a fearless mind to answer their questions about all meanings of the Dharma and expounds to them all doctrines all studies and even various technical skills to bring them to  maturity according to their mentalities and enable them to abide in the true Dharma This is called prajñāpāramitā  Therefore WorldHonored One practicing the pāramitās is no different from accepting the true Dharma Accepting the true Dharma means practicing the pāramitās Relinquishing Three Things to Accept the True Dharma WorldHonored One through the Buddhas awesome spiritual power I would like to further expound the vast meaning  The Buddha said Speak rīmālā said to the Buddha What is meant by accepting the true Dharma A good man or woman who accepts the true Dharma is  accepting the true Dharma Why Because to accept the true Dharma a good man or woman relinquishes three things What are these three They are  wealth He or she relinquishes his or her body throughout future births and deaths leaving behind old age illness and death to acquire a Tathāgatas indestructible everabiding and changeless dharma body  with inconceivable virtues He or she relinquishes his or her life throughout future births and deaths to become absolutely free from death acquire the limitless everabiding and inconceivable virtues and fully understand the entire profound Buddha Dharma He or she relinquishes his or her wealth to acquire the endless neverdiminishing everabiding and inconceivable virtues unavailable to other sentient beings and to receive excellent offerings from other sentient beings WorldHonored One a good man or woman who relinquishes these three things to accept the true Dharma is remembered by all Buddhas and respected by all sentient beings WorldHonored One when the Dharma is ending while bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās will destroy the Saṅgha split into factions dispute and disperse a good man or woman who accepts the true Dharma without sycophancy deceit or falsity will delight in the true Dharma and join Dharma friends Joining Dharma friends means that he will definitely receive a good prophecy from Buddhas WorldHonored One I see the great power of accepting the true Dharma I also know and see that the Buddha is the true eye the one with true wisdomknowledge the root of the true Dharma the imparter of the true Dharma and the reliance of the true Dharma Immeasurable Virtues and Benefits of Accepting the True Dharma Then the WorldHonored One expressed sympathetic joy over rīmālās words about the great awesome power of accepting the true Dharma He said Indeed rīmālā indeed as you say accepting the true Dharma has great awesome power As an analogy whoever is even lightly touched by a strong man feels a great deal of pain Likewise rīmālā accepting even a little of the true Dharma can distress māras Indeed rīmālā I do not see any other good dharmas that can worry māras as can accepting even a little of the true Dharma As another analogy the shape and color of the oxking are unparalleled and surpass those of all other oxen Likewise the roots of goodness of a rider of the Mahāyāna who accepts even a little of the true Dharma surpass those of riders of the Two Vehicles Because accepting the true Dharma has vast virtues As another analogy Mount Sumeru king of mountains surpasses all other mountains in size and majesty Likewise the roots of goodness of a new rider of the Mahāyāna who accepts the true Dharma with an altruistic mind not even sparing his life or wealth surpass those of longtime riders of the Mahāyāna who are attached to their lives and wealth not to mention those of riders of the Two Vehicles Because accepting the true Dharma has vast virtues Therefore rīmālā you should expound  accepting the true Dharma to teach and establish sentient beings Indeed rīmālā accepting the true Dharma brings such great benefits such great blessings and such great spiritual fruits rīmālā for countless asakhyeyas of kalpas I expounded the virtues and benefits of accepting the true Dharma but never reached their limit Indeed accepting the true Dharma has immeasurable and limitless virtues Chapter   The One Vehicle The Buddha told rīmālā You now should further expound  accepting the true Dharma as expounded by all Buddhas rīmālā said to the Buddha Very good WorldHonored One I gladly obey Your command Accepting the True Dharma Is Accepting the Mahāyāna Then she said to the Buddha WorldHonored One accepting the true Dharma is accepting the Mahāyāna Because the Mahāyāna brings forth all voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and worldly and supraworldly good dharmas WorldHonored One as Lake Anavatapta  issues eight great rivers likewise the Mahāyāna brings forth all voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and worldly and supraworldly good dharmas WorldHonored One as all seeds depend on the ground to grow likewise all voicehearers Pratyekabuddhas and worldly and supraworldly good dharmas depend on the Mahāyāna to grow Therefore WorldHonored One abiding in and accepting the Mahāyāna are abiding in and accepting the Two Vehicles and all worldly and supraworldly good dharmas WorldHonored One You have expounded six things What are these six To expound the Mahāyāna You have expounded these six things To expound the Mahāyāna You have expounded the abiding of the true Dharma because the abiding of the Mahāyāna is the abiding of the true Dharma To expound the Mahāyāna You have expounded the end of the true Dharma because the end of the Mahāyāna is the end of the true Dharma Prātimokṣa and the Vinaya have the same meaning but have different names The Vinaya is Mahāyāna teachings Because one relies on a Buddha to renounce family life and accept the complete monastic precepts Therefore Mahāyāna precepts encompass the Vinaya renouncing family life and accepting the complete monastic precepts However an Arhat has no need to renounce family life and accept the complete monastic precepts Because an Arhat has taken refuge in a Tathāgata to renounce family life and accept the complete monastic precepts Only a Tathāgata Has Attained Nirvāṇa An Arhat takes refuge in a Buddha because he has fear Because an Arhat has fear even as he abides in freedom from actions  as if someone would harm him with a sword Therefore an Arhat has no ultimate joy Because he relies on the one who never seeks refuge  Just as sentient beings that have no reliance have various fears and seek refuge because of their fears likewise an Arhat has fear and relies on a Tathāgata because of his fear WorldHonored One an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha has fear Because his changeable birth and death are not ended his rebirth continues Because his Brahma way of life is not fully established his training on the path is not entirely pure Because his undertaking to attain nirvāṇa is not fully accomplished he still has something to do  Because he has not fully crossed the ocean of birth and death he still has something  to end Because he has not ended certain afflictions he is still far from the realm of nirvāṇa Only a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha has attained nirvāṇa because He has acquired all merits while an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha has not acquired all merits Saying that he has attained nirvāṇa is a Buddhas skillful means of expression Only a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha has attained nirvāṇa because He has acquired immeasurable merits while an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha has acquired measurable merits Saying that he has attained nirvāṇa is a Buddhas skillful means of expression Only a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha has attained nirvāṇa because He has acquired inconceivable merits while an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha has acquired conceivable merits Saying that he has attained nirvāṇa is a Buddhas skillful means of expression Only a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha has attained nirvāṇa because He has removed all faults that should be removed and has achieved the foremost purity while an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha has remaining faults and has not achieved the foremost purity Saying that he has attained nirvāṇa is a Buddhas skillful means of expression Only a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha has attained nirvāṇa and is revered by all sentient beings and His state surpasses that of any Arhat Pratyekabuddha or Bodhisattva Therefore an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha is still far from the realm of nirvāṇa Saying that an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha observes his level of liberation acquires the four kinds of wisdomknowledge and arrives at the reviving rest place  is also a Tathāgatas skillful means of expression which has something remaining unsaid and is not definitive The Two Kinds of Birth and Death Why Because there are two kinds of birth and death What are these two They are  changeable birth and death which are inconceivable An ordinary being undergoes karmic birth and death An Arhat a Pratyekabuddha or a holy Bodhisattva undergoes the inconceivable changeable birth and death in his mindcreated bodies  until his eventual attainment of the unsurpassed bodhi Because an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha has ended his karmic birth and death he declares that his rebirth is ended Because he has attained nirvāṇa with remnants he declares that his Brahma way of life is established Because he has ended certain afflictions which all ordinary beings cannot end and voicehearers in the first seven ranks have not yet completely ended he declares that his undertaking is accomplished Because has ended the afflictions that drive his karmic rebirths he declares that he will not undergo a subsequent existence However although he declares that he will not undergo a subsequent existence he has ended neither all afflictions nor all rebirths Because there are certain afflictions that an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha cannot end The GroundAbiding Afflictions and Their Ensuing Afflictions There are two kinds of afflictions What are these two They are  their ensuing afflictions There are four kinds of groundabiding afflictions What are these four They are  groundabiding love of existence From these four kinds of groundabiding afflictions ensue all afflictions which respond to ones mind from moment to moment groundabiding ignorance  without a beginning the root affliction which does not respond to ones mind WorldHonored One the power of these four kinds of groundabiding afflictions is the reliedupon seed for all ensuing afflictions to grow However it cannot compare with the power of groundabiding ignorance by any measure or analogy Indeed WorldHonored One groundabiding ignorance is far more powerful than the four groundabiding afflictions As an analogy the appearance strength lifespan retinue accouterments and transcendental powers of the celestial māraking Pāpīyān surpass those of gods in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven  Likewise the power of groundabiding ignorance surpasses that of the four groundabiding afflictions Ensuing afflictions as numerous as the sands of the Ganges depend on groundabiding ignorance to arise and it enables the four groundabiding afflictions to abide for a long time The wisdom of an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha cannot end it Only a Tathāgatas bodhi wisdom can end it Indeed WorldHonored One groundabiding ignorance is the strongest WorldHonored One through grasping as the condition and afflictiondriven karmas as the cause an ordinary being transmigrates in different karmic bodies in the Three Realms of Existence Likewise through groundabiding ignorance as the condition and afflictionfree karmas as the cause an Arhats a Pratyekabuddhas or a holy Bodhisattvas three kinds of mindcreated body appear His afflictionfree karmas and three kinds of mindcreated body depend on his groundabiding ignorance to arise not without conditions Indeed WorldHonored One his groundabiding ignorance is the condition for his afflictionfree karmas and three kinds of mindcreated body to arise Only a Tathāgata Can End His GroundAbiding Ignorance Indeed WorldHonored One the four groundabiding afflictions and afflictiondriven karmas are different from groundabiding ignorance Because groundabiding ignorance is apart from the four groundabiding afflictions it can be ended only on the Buddha Ground by a Buddhas bodhi wisdom Because an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha has ended his four kinds of groundabiding afflictions but has not completely ended all his afflictions has not acquired the power to end them and has not attained nirvāṇa That his afflictions are not completely ended means that his groundabiding ignorance remains WorldHonored One because an Arhat a Pratyekabuddha or a holy Bodhisattva in his final body  is still hindered by his groundabiding ignorance he does not clearly know or see the truth of various dharmas Because he does not clearly know or see it he cannot completely end what should be ended Therefore he achieves liberation with remaining faults not liberation free from all faults he achieves purity with remnants not total purity he acquires merits with remnants not all merits Because he achieves liberation with remnants achieves purity with remnants and acquires merits with remnants his knowledge of suffering has remnants  the end of his accumulation of afflictions has remnants the cessation of his suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa has remnants and the completion of his training on the path has remnants Therefore he attains lesser nirvāṇa called toward the realm of nirvāṇa If one knows all suffering ends all ones accumulations of afflictions ends all ones suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa and completes ones training on all paths one will attain the everabiding nirvāṇa in a world plagued by destruction through impermanence and by the disease of impermanence and become the protection and refuge for a world without protection and refuge Because one attains nirvāṇa when one sees that dharmas are equal  neither good nor bad wisdom is equal  liberation is equal  purity is equal  Therefore nirvāṇa has one flavor the same flavor called the liberation flavor WorldHonored One if ones groundabiding ignorance is not completely ended one cannot attain nirvāṇa which has one flavor the same flavor the liberation flavor Why not Because if ones groundabiding ignorance is not completely ended afflictions that should be ended which are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges cannot be completely ended Because these afflictions that should be ended are not completely ended one cannot acquire or attain virtuous dharmas that should be acquired or attained which are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges Ones groundabiding ignorance accumulates and brings forth all afflictions and their ensuing afflictions both of which should be ended through ones spiritual training It brings forth afflictions that arise from ones mind śamatha vipaśyanā meditation samāpatti skillful means wisdomknowledge spiritual fruit attainment power and fearlessness Such ensuing afflictions more numerous than the sands of the Ganges can be ended only by a Tathāgatas bodhi wisdom  All ensuing afflictions are established on ones groundabiding ignorance arise from ones groundabiding ignorance as their cause and condition and respond to ones mind from moment to moment WorldHonored One ones groundabiding ignorance without a beginning does not respond to ones mind WorldHonored One all ones afflictions which are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges and can be ended only by a Tathāgatas bodhi wisdom  are established on and sustained by ones groundabiding ignorance As an analogy all seeds depend on the ground to arise establish themselves and grow If the ground is destroyed the seeds are destroyed as well Likewise ones afflictions which are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges and can be ended only by a Tathāgatas bodhi wisdom  depend on ones groundabiding ignorance to arise establish themselves and grow If ones groundabiding ignorance is ended ones afflictions are ended as well When all ones groundabiding afflictions and all their ensuing afflictions are ended one acquires all virtuous dharmas acquired by a Tathāgata which are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges acquires hindrancefree transcendental powers acquires all wisdomknowledge and views removes all faults acquires all merits becomes a Dharma King a Dharma Master masters all dharmas and ascends to the ground where all dharmas are hindrance free One roars the lions roar of a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha declaring My rebirth is ended my Brahma way of life is established my undertaking is accomplished I will not undergo a subsequent existence Indeed WorldHonored One this lions roar based on the definitive meaning has always been remembered and expounded  Two Kinds of WisdomKnowledge of Freedom from a Subsequent Existence WorldHonored One there are two kinds of wisdomknowledge that one will not undergo a subsequent existence a Tathāgata who uses an unsurpassed tamers power to subjugate the four māras transcends the world and is revered by all sentient beings He realizes the inconceivable dharma body and acquires mastery of all dharmas on the jñeya  ground above which there is nothing more to do or to attain Equipped with the Ten Powers He valiantly ascends to the foremost unsurpassed fearless ground  and uses His hindrancefree wisdom to observe all dharmas without others help With the wisdomknowledge that He will not undergo a subsequent existence He roars a lions roar WorldHonored One  an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha who overcomes his fear of birth and death and step by step comes to enjoy the happiness of liberation He thinks I have left behind my fear of repeated birth and death and will no longer undergo the suffering of repeated birth and death WorldHonored One as he observes his freedom from a subsequent existence he also observes the foremost reviving rest place the nirvāṇa ground WorldHonored One abiding on the ground he has reached before he is neither ignorant of the Dharma nor dependent on others The One Vehicle Why Because both the VoiceHearer Vehicle and the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle are encompassed in the Mahāyāna The Mahāyāna is the Buddha Vehicle Therefore the Three Vehicles are the One Vehicle Whoever rides the One Vehicle to seek bodhi will attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Anuttarasamyaksabodhi is the realm of nirvāṇa The realm of nirvāṇa is a Tathāgatas dharma body Realizing the ultimate dharma body is reaching the ultimate destination of the One Vehicle A Tathāgata is the dharma body realizing the ultimate dharma body is reaching the ultimate destination of the One Vehicle Ultimate means boundless and endless  The One Refuge in a Tathāgata WorldHonored One the abiding of a Tathāgata has no time limit because a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha abides throughout the endless future As a Tathāgatas abiding has no limit so too His compassion for the world has no limit His limitless great compassion limitlessly comforts the world These words are a good description of a Tathāgata If someone says that a Tathāgata is the endless dharma the everabiding dharma and the refuge for the whole world his words are also a good description of a Tathāgata Therefore for a world that has not been delivered and has no refuge the one who serves as its endless everabiding and ultimate refuge throughout the endless future is a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha The Dharma is the path of the One Vehicle The Saṅgha is the multitude that rides the Three Vehicles The two refuges the Dharma and the Saṅgha are not the ultimate refuge Because the Dharma which is the path of the One Vehicle leads to realization of the ultimate dharma body which does not address the Dharma affairs of the One Vehicle  And the Saṅgha which is the multitude that rides the Three Vehicles has fear takes refuge in a Tathāgata to seek liberation and trains and learns to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Therefore these two refuges are not the ultimate refuge but a limited refuge Suppose that a sentient being tamed by a Tathāgata takes refuge in Him and tastes the Dharma flavor Faith and delight arising in his mind he takes refuge in the Dharma and the Saṅgha His two refuges are not merely these two refuges but the refuge in a Tathāgata Taking refuge in the highest sense  is taking refuge in a Tathāgata The two refuges in the highest sense are the ultimate refuge in a Tathāgata Because a Tathāgata is no different from the two refuges The refuge in a Tathāgata is the Three Refuges A Tathāgata who has acquired the Four Fearlessnesses reveals it in a lions roar If a Tathāgata gives provisional teachings by skillful means according to sentient beings desires they are in essence Mahāyāna teachings There are no Three Vehicles because they are encompassed in the One Vehicle The One Vehicle is the vehicle in the highest sense Chapter   The Boundless Holy Truth WorldHonored One when a voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha first observes the holy truth he does not use only one kind of wisdomknowledge to end his four groundabiding afflictions by meeting the four conditionsknowing the suffering of repeated birth and death completing his virtuous training on the path ending his accumulation of afflictions and attaining nirvāṇa to end all his sufferingalthough he knows well their meaning WorldHonored One he does not have the highest supraworldly wisdomknowledge While his four kinds of wisdomknowledge come gradually as he gradually meets the four conditions a Tathāgatas highest supraworldly wisdomknowledge comes immediately not gradually WorldHonored One the wisdomknowledge of the highest truth is likened to vajra  It is not the initial wisdomknowledge of the holy truth acquired by a voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha who cannot end his groundabiding ignorance WorldHonored One a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha whose state is not that of a voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha uses His inconceivable wisdomknowledge of the emptiness of dharmas to destroy His store of all afflictions WorldHonored One the ultimate wisdomknowledge that destroys ones store of all afflictions is called the wisdomknowledge of the highest truth The initial wisdomknowledge of the holy truth is not the ultimate wisdomknowledge but is the wisdomknowledge that leads to anuttarasamyaksabodhi It does not describe a voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha though he is called a holy being because of the measurable and meager virtue  The holy truth is not the truth realized by a voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha nor is it founded on the meager virtue  WorldHonored One the holy truth is first realized by a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha and then He reveals it to a world shrouded in the store of ignorance The Tathāgata Store The holy truth reveals the profound meaning of dharmas which is subtle hard to know and beyond the thinking mind Only a wise man  knows it and the whole world cannot believe it Because it reveals the profound Tathāgata store  The Tathāgata store is a Tathāgatas state unknown to any voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha The Tathāgata store reveals the meaning of the holy truth Because the Tathāgata store is profound the holy truth revealed is also profound subtle hard to know and beyond the thinking mind Although a wise man knows it the whole world cannot believe it A Tathāgatas Dharma Body If one has no doubts about the Tathāgata store being sheathed in ones store of immeasurable afflictions one will have no doubts about a Tathāgatas dharma body leaving behind ones store of immeasurable afflictions  If one has no doubts about ones Tathāgata store a Tathāgatas dharma body a Buddhas inconceivable state and a Buddhas provisional teachings by skillful means one will believe in and understand the two ways to realize the holy truth which are hard to know and hard to understand What are these two They are  not through an undertaking The holy truth realized through an undertaking reveals the measurable meaning of the Four Noble Truths Because one relies on another  and fails to  complete ones training on all paths One does not know that there are saskṛta birth and death versus asaskṛta birth and death nor nirvāṇa with remnants versus nirvāṇa without remnants The holy truth realized not through an undertaking reveals the immeasurable meaning of the Four Noble Truths Because one uses ones own power  to  complete ones training on all paths Of these two ways to realize the Four Noble Truths a Tathāgata reveals only the first way because only a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha can fully verify the Four Noble Truths not through an undertaking which is beyond the ability of an Arhat or a Pratyekabuddha Because nirvāṇa is not attained gradually through practicing low middle and high dharmas Because a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha fully verifies the meaning of the Four Noble Truth not through an undertaking He fully knows all future suffering ends all His accumulations of afflictions and their ensuing afflictions eliminates all His mindcreated bodies  and ends all His suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa WorldHonored One cessation of ones suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa does not destroy anything but reveals ones everabiding inherent pure nature  which has no beginning no action no arising no end and no expiring and is apart from ones store of all afflictions WorldHonored One what is not separate detached or different from the inconceivable Buddha Dharma  more numerous than the sands of the Ganges is called a Tathāgatas dharma body WorldHonored One when a Tathāgatas dharma body is not free from ones store of afflictions it is called the Tathāgata store A Limited Understanding of Emptiness Conceals the Truth WorldHonored One the wisdomknowledge of the Tathāgata store is a Tathāgatas wisdomknowledge of the emptiness of dharmas WorldHonored One no Arhat Pratyekabuddha or holy Bodhisattva has ever seen his Tathāgata store or realized that he possesses it WorldHonored One there are two kinds of wisdomknowledge of the emptiness of ones Tathāgata store The first kind is the wisdomknowledge of the empty Tathāgata store which is separate detached or different from ones store of all afflictions The second kind is the wisdomknowledge of the notempty Tathāgata store which is not separate detached or different from the inconceivable Buddha Dharma  more numerous than the sands of the Ganges WorldHonored One only great Arhats can believe in a Tathāgatas teachings on these two kinds of wisdomknowledge of the emptiness of ones Tathāgata store For all Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas their wisdomknowledge of emptiness revolves around the four inverted views Therefore they have never known or realized  Only a Buddha has verified the cessation of all His suffering destroyed His store of all afflictions and completed His training on all paths to end all His suffering One of the Four Noble Truths Is the One Truth and the One Reliance WorldHonored One of the Four Noble Truths three are impermanent and one is permanent Because three noble truths have the appearances of a saskṛta dharma and anything with the appearances of a saskṛta dharma is impermanent Impermanent dharmas are destructible not a place of refuge Therefore the three noble truthssuffering accumulation of afflictions and the pathare not the highest truth because they are impermanent and are not a place of refuge The noble truth of cessation of ones suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa is free from the appearances of a saskṛta dharma and anything free from the appearances of a saskṛta dharma is permanent A permanent dharma is indestructible This noble truth is permanent and a place of refuge Therefore it is the highest truth to rely on Wrong Views Invert the Truth The noble truth of cessation of ones suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa is inconceivable beyond the capacity of all sentient beings minds and beyond the wisdom of all Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas As an analogy the bornblind cannot see sights and a sevendayold infant cannot see the sun Likewise the noble truth of cessation of ones suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa is not an object in an ordinary beings mind nor is it an item in the wisdomknowledge of riders of the Two Vehicles An ordinary beings consciousness is dictated by two opposite views while the  wisdomknowledge of all Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas is pure An ordinary being holds the wrong view that there is a self  in the five aggregates that constitute a sentient being and from that view derives two opposite views perpetuity and cessation When he sees that all processes are impermanent he holds the view of cessation  which is not the right view When he seeks nirvāṇa he holds the view of perpetuity  which is not the right view His view of cessation is based on deluded perception When he sees that his thinking continues he does not know that each thought instantly expires His view of perpetuity is based on deluded perception Following deluded perception he cannot see the truth because he shuttles between this view of perpetuity and that view of cessation according to his differentiation Thus a deluded sentient being entertains four inverted perceptions of the five aggregates taking impermanence as permanence suffering as joy a nonexistent self as a self and impurity as purity The pure wisdomknowledge of all Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas has never known a Tathāgatas wisdom state or dharma body If a sentient being because of his belief in a Buddhas words perceives a Tathāgata as eternity bliss a  self and purity this is not an inverted view but the right view Because a Tathāgatas dharma body is the eternity pāramitā the bliss pāramitā the trueself pāramitā and the purity pāramitā This view of a Buddhas dharma body is the right view Whoever holds the right view is a Buddhas true son born from His mouth  from pondering the Dharma and from being transformed by the Dharma who will acquire the remaining wealth of the Dharma WorldHonored One what is meant by pure wisdomknowledge It is the wisdomknowledge pāramitā  of all Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas However their wisdomknowledge though called pure wisdomknowledge cannot know the true meaning of the noble truth of cessation of ones suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa much less can his four kinds of wisdomknowledge that depend on  the Four Noble Truths Because if novice riders of the Three Vehicles were not ignorant of the Dharma they would realize and acquire the true meaning of this noble truth Therefore the WorldHonored One has expounded the Four Noble Truths for them to rely on However the Four Noble Truths  are worldly dharmas The one reliance for all the supreme supraworldly reliance in the highest sense is the noble truth of cessation of ones suffering upon attaining nirvāṇa Ones Tathāgata Store and Inherent Pure Nature WorldHonored One ones birth and death depend on ones Tathāgata store but the beginning of ones Tathāgata store is unknowable WorldHonored One saying that one has birth and death because of ones Tathāgata store is a good explanation WorldHonored One birth and death mean that ones faculties expire and ones new faculties have not arisen WorldHonored One ones birth and death depend on ones Tathāgata store According to worldly descriptions of death and rebirth death means the expiring of ones old faculties rebirth means the arising of ones new faculties However ones Tathāgata store has neither birth nor death It does not have the appearances of a saskṛta dharma and is ever abiding and changeless Therefore dharmas depend on the Tathāgata store to establish themselves and are sustained by it Not only the inconceivable Buddha Dharma which is not separate detached split or different from the wisdomknowledge of liberation depends on the Tathāgata store to establish itself but all saskṛta dharmas which are separate detached split and different from the wisdomknowledge of liberation depend the Tathāgata store to establish themselves WorldHonored One without ones Tathāgata store one cannot come to tire of suffering and to delight in seeking nirvāṇa Why not Because WorldHonored One ones seven dharmasones first six consciousnesses and their perceptionsneither abide for a single moment nor retain ones experience of suffering Then one cannot come to tire of suffering and to delight in seeking nirvāṇa WorldHonored One ones Tathāgata store has no beginning neither arising nor expiring but retains ones experience of suffering Then one can come to tire of suffering and to delight in seeking nirvāṇa Ones Tathāgata store is not a self not a person not a sentient being and not an everlasting soul It is incomprehensible to those who hold the wrong view that one has a self those who hold inverted views and those who misunderstand the emptiness of dharmas WorldHonored One ones Tathāgata store is the store of the dharma realm  the store of the dharma body the supreme store of supraworldly dharmas and the store of ones inherent pure nature  How ones Tathāgata store the store of ones inherent pure nature is tainted by ones visitorlike afflictions  and their ensuing afflictions can be known only through a Tathāgatas inconceivable wisdom Because ones good or evil mind arising from moment to moment is not tainted by ones afflictions Ones afflictions do not touch ones mind and ones mind does not touch ones afflictions Then how can ones mind be tainted without touching anything Yet WorldHonored One one has afflictions and ones mind is tainted by afflictions It is hard to know why ones inherent pure mind can be tainted Only a BuddhaBhagavān who has the true eye and true wisdomknowledge is the root and the reliance of the true Dharma and has a full understanding of the Dharma can truly know it After rīmālā raised this hardtoanswer question the Buddha expressed His sympathetic joy saying Indeed indeed The reason why ones inherent pure mind is tainted is hard to know There are two things that are hard to know its being tainted by afflictions Only you and BodhisattvaMahāsattvas with great attainments can hear and accept these two hardtoknow things Voicehearers can only believe in a Buddhas words A Buddhas True Son If a disciple of mine follows his growing faith he can rely on his right faith to follow the dharma wisdomknowledge to master it Following the dharma wisdomknowledge means that he makes five observations which are observations of  the transcendental powers of an Arhat a Pratyekabuddha and a holy Bodhisattva He should become accomplished in these five skillful observations  After I have entered parinirvāṇa if my disciples in the future follow their growing faith and rely on their right faith to follow the dharma wisdomknowledge they will fully understand that an ordinary beings inherent pure mind is tainted by his afflictions This full understanding will be the cause of their entering the path of the Mahāyāna Believing in a Tathāgata brings such great benefits that they will not malign the profound meaning of the Dharma rīmālās Lions Roar Then rīmālā said to the Buddha There are other great benefits I would like to expound them through the Buddhas awesome spiritual power The Buddha said Speak rīmālā said There are three kinds of good men and women who will never malign the profound meaning of the Dharma and with this great merit will enter the path of the Mahāyāna Who are these three They are  those who do not know the profound Dharma but rely on a WorldHonored One It is not my place to know how they rely on a Tathāgata because only the Buddha knows Aside from these good men and women for other sentient beings who like rotten seeds obstinately misinterpret the profound Dharma go against the true Dharma and follow the wrong paths they should be tamed by the power of the king and Dharma protectors such as gods dragons and ghosts Then rīmālā and her retinue prostrated themselves at the Buddhas feet The Buddha said Very good very good You protect and safeguard the profound Dharma by skillful means and appropriately subjugate its enemies You can expound this meaning because you have stayed close to  koṭi Buddhas Then the WorldHonored One emitted vast radiance that illuminated the multitude He rose into the open sky to the height of seven tāla  trees and walked across the open sky back to rāvastī Meanwhile rīmālā and her retinue joined their palms and insatiably gazed at the Buddha without moving their eyes even temporarily until He was out of their sight Then they exuberantly rejoiced and praised the Tathāgatas virtues Intently thinking of the Buddha they entered the city of Ayodhyā and persuaded King Mitrayaśas to establish the Mahāyāna He used the Mahāyāna to transform in his kingdom men and women over seven years of age All subjects in his kingdom turned toward the Mahāyāna Chapter   Entrusting This Sūtra with Fifteen Names At that time the WorldHonored One returned to the Jetavana garden He summoned the venerable nanda and thought of the godking akra In response to His thought akra and his retinue immediately arrived and stood before the Buddha Then the WorldHonored One broadly expounded this sūtra to the venerable nanda and the godking akra After He finished expounding it He told akra You should accept uphold and read and recite this sūtra Kauśika suppose that a good man or woman trains to attain bodhi and practices the six pāramitās for kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Then suppose that a good man or woman hears accepts reads and recites and upholds this sūtra The merit acquired by the latter surpasses that of the former not to mention that the latter widely expounds it to others Therefore Kauśika you should read and recite this sūtra and widely expound it to gods in your Thirtythree Heavens  Then He told nanda You too should accept uphold and read and recite this sūtra and widely expound it to my four groups of disciples Then the godking akra asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what is the name of this sūtra How should we uphold it The Buddha said to him This sūtra has immeasurable boundless virtues No voicehearer or Pratyekabuddha can fully observe know or see them Kauśika know that this sūtra is an aggregate of profound wondrous great virtues I now will reveal some of its names Hearken hearken Ponder them well The godking akra and the venerable nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One we gladly accept your instruction The Buddha said This sūtra praises a Tathāgatas virtues in the highest sense Moreover Kauśika the teachings in this sūtra end all doubts and reveal the definitive meaning of entering the path of the One Vehicle Kauśika I now entrust you with this Sūtra of Queen rīmālās Lions Roar You should accept uphold and read and recite it as long as the Dharma abides in the world The godking akra said to the Buddha Very good WorldHonored One I accept your instruction with the highest reverence Then the godking akra the venerable nanda and all others in this huge assembly such as gods humans asuras gandharvas having heard the Buddhas words rejoiced and carried out His teachings Buddha Pronounces the Sūtra of Amitāyus Buddha Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Cao Wei Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Saṅghavarman from India Fascicle   Preface Thus I have heard At one time the Buddha was staying on the Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain near the city of Rājagṛha together with  great bhikṣus who all had acquired great transcendental powers Such venerable ones included jñātakauṇḍinya Aśvajit Bāṣpa Mahānāma

Bodhisattva Restrained Action Bodhisattva and Liberation Bodhisattva They all cultivate the virtues of Samantabhadra BodhisattvaMahāsattva Equipped with immeasurable Bodhisattva action vows they stand firm in all virtuous ways They visit worlds in the ten directions skillfully carrying out suitable missions Then he leaves the celestial palace and descends into his mothers womb He is born from the right side of his mother and walks seven steps as his dazzling radiance illuminates innumerable Buddha Lands in the ten directions As the earth quakes in six different ways he declares aloud I will be the unsurpassed honored one in this world The Bodhisattva is attended by the godking akra and Brahmakings and gods and humans take refuge in him As a demonstration he learns mathematics literature archery and horsemanship masters sacred arts and studies voluminous texts Playing in the garden he discusses martial arts and tests his ability Even as he manifests enjoyment of sense objects in his palace such as sights and flavors he perceives old age illness and death and realizes the impermanence of the world Abandoning his kingdom riches and status he goes into mountain forests seeking bodhi He rides off on his white horse then sends it back with his jeweled crown and necklaces Shedding his regal garment the Bodhisattva puts on the Dharma robe and shaves off his hair and beard He meditates under trees training arduously as he should for six years Because he has appeared in the world of the five turbidities he conforms to the way of the multitudes and displays dirt on his body He then bathes in  the river of gold Gods bend the tree branches so that he can hold them to get out of the river Intelligent birds follow him to his bodhimaṇḍa The youth who offers him grass is an auspicious sign of the fullness of his merit and endeavor Out of compassion the Bodhisattva accepts this offering of grass and makes a seat under the bodhi tree upon which he sits crosslegged Alerted by his great radiance the celestial māraking leads māra legions to harass and test him However he subjugates them all with his wisdom and power Then he realizes the wondrous Dharma and attains anuttarasamyaksabodhi The godking akra and Brahmakings all beseech Him to turn the Dharma wheel As a Buddha He walks the Buddha steps and roars the Buddha roar He beats the Dharma drum blows the Dharma conch shell wields the Dharma sword and erects the Dharma banner He rumbles the Dharma thunder flashes the Dharma lightning pours down the Dharma rain and gives the Dharma alms As the Buddha illuminates everywhere in innumerable Buddha Lands with His radiance the entire world quakes in six different ways reaching the māras dominion and the māras palace is shaken The māras in multitudes are intimidated and terrified and none of them fails to fall under submission He shatters the web of evils and crushes the wrong views He expels  afflictions which enslave their body and mind and destroys their pit of desires He cleanses their impurities to reveal purity He protects the Dharma fortress and opens Dharma Doors He illuminates the Buddha Dharma and widely disseminates it to transform all  The Buddha enters towns to beg for food and receives offerings in abundance Revealing Himself as a fortune field He enables the almsgivers to accumulate merit acquired from their planting He smiles as He expounds the Dharma He heals with Dharma medicine the three kinds of suffering He teaches the immeasurable merit of the resolve to attain bodhi He bestows upon Bodhisattvas the prophecy that they all will attain Buddhahood By His demonstration of entering parinirvāṇa He helps innumerable multitudes to eradicate their afflictions and plant their roots of virtue The merit He has acquired is wondrous and immeasurable as he visits Buddha Lands giving everyone the teachings for attaining bodhi His actions are pure and untainted Like a master of illusion who conjures up various images He manifests Himself as male or female or in any suitable form With perfect understanding of what He has learned He manifests Himself at will The Bodhisattva Way The Bodhisattvas  do the same To learn all Dharmas  they collect them and train accordingly The truth they uphold can inspire and transform all sentient beings Fully equipped with ways to help sentient beings compassionately they manifest themselves everywhere in innumerable Buddha Lands never acting arrogant or domineering They thoroughly understand the essentials of Bodhisattva scriptural texts As their names spread everywhere their virtuous ways prevail in the ten directions They are protected and remembered by innumerable Buddhas They abide in the truths that Buddhas abide in and they establish the teachings that great holy ones have established Under Tathāgatas guidance they are Bodhisattvas and great teachers who each can proclaim the Way With wisdom arising from profound meditation they educate and guide multitudes of sentient beings Penetrating dharma nature they understand sentient beings appearances and their lands When such Bodhisattvas make offerings to Buddhas they magically manifest themselves like flashes of lightning They skillfully learn the way of fearlessness and fully understand that dharmas are illusory They annihilate the webs of māras and liberate sentient beings from bondage and fetters Transcending the ground of voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas they attain the Three Samādhis emptiness no appearance and no wish By skillful means they present the Three Vehicles For those of middling or low capacity they demonstrate parinirvāṇa Knowing that  there is neither action nor existence neither arising nor ceasing they realize the truth of equality and fully attain innumerable dhāranīs and hundreds and thousands of samādhis As their faculties and wisdom remain in boundless silence they delve into the store of the Bodhisattva Dharma and attain the Samādhi of Buddha Adornment While they remain inside the profound Samādhi Door they see Buddhas before them Then they promote and expound the Dharma in all the sūtras In the instant of a thought they visit everywhere in all Buddha Lands rescuing those in extreme suffering both those who do and those who do not find respite from suffering As they explicate the true reality of dharmas they acquire a Tathāgatas eloquence With mastery of the languages of the multitudes they educate and transform them all Having transcended the dharmas of the world their minds abide in ways to deliver the world With command of all things in the world they are the unasked friends to multitudes of sentient beings and they carry the heavy load of sentient beings  As such Bodhisattvas accept and uphold Tathāgatas profound Dharma store they protect those of the Tathāgata charactertype and help them to carry on this charactertype Exuding great compassion for sentient beings they speak to them with lovingkindness to open their dharmaeye As they block the three evil lifepaths they open the door to the good lifepaths and unasked they teach the Dharma to the multitudes Like a dutiful son who loves and respects his parents they regard sentient beings as they do themselves All their roots of goodness contribute to their crossing over to the shore of nirvāṇa as they acquire the immeasurable merit inconceivable wisdom and holy knowledge of Buddhas The Request for Teachings Innumerable such BodhisattvaMahāsattvas came to this assembly At that time the WorldHonored One looked vigorous and joyful His appearance pure radiant and majestic The venerable nanda at the Buddhas unspoken holy command rose from his seat bared his right shoulder and fell on both knees With palms joined he said to the Buddha WorldHonored One You look vigorous and joyful today Your appearance pure radiant and majestic like a clear mirror that reflects images inside and is shiny outside Your sublime visage is resplendent

Dharma Today the Hero of the World abides in the truth in which all Buddhas abide Today the Eye of the World carries on as the guiding teacher As Buddhas of the past present and future think of one another does the present Buddha not think of other Buddhas Why is His awesome presence so radiant The WorldHonored One asked nanda Why nanda Did the gods tell you to ask the Buddha Do you ask about my sublime visage based on your own perception nanda replied to the Buddha No god told me to I ask about this meaning based on my own perception The Buddha said Very good nanda your question is opportune You have developed profound wisdom and truly wonderful eloquence and out of compassion for sentient beings you wisely ask about this meaning The Tathāgata out of inexhaustible great compassion for sentient beings in the Three Realms of Existence has appeared in the world to expound the teachings for attaining bodhi to rescue sentient beings and to give them true benefits Like an udumbara flower the auspicious wonderful flower that appears only once in a long while He is hard to encounter in innumerable koṭis of kalpas What you ask now will greatly benefit and transform all gods and humans

time there was a king who heard that a Buddha was expounding the Dharma With joy in his heart he immediately activated the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind He abandoned his kingdom and throne and became a śramaṇa named Dharmākara Exceptionally intelligent and valiant he was outstanding in the world He went to World Sovereign King Tathāgata He made obeisance at that Buddhas feet then circled Him to the

fulfill this vow To give great peace to Those living in fear Suppose there are Buddhas A billion koṭi in number And great holy beings as Numerous as the sands of the Ganges Making offerings to Buddhas such as these Is inferior to seeking bodhi Resolutely without retreat Buddha Lands are as numerous as The sands of the Ganges Although they are countless Beyond reckoning My radiance will illuminate everywhere In all these lands As I make energetic progress My awesome spirit is measureless After I become a Buddha My land will be foremost in splendor Adorned with myriad wonders And its bodhimaṇḍa

ten directions Have hindrancefree wisdom So does this WorldHonored One know My mind and actions Even if I am in the midst of Pain and anguish I persist in my energetic progress And endure without regrets Having spoken these stanzas the bhikṣu Dharmākara said to that Buddha Indeed WorldHonored One I have activated the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind and I pray that the Buddha will fully expound to me the Dharma in the sūtras I will train myself and collect the pure adornments of innumerable Buddha Lands so that I will quickly attain the perfect enlightenment and uproot the suffering of repeated birth and death The Buddha told nanda Then World Sovereign King Buddha said to the bhikṣu Dharmākara You should know how to train yourself and adorn your Buddha Land The bhikṣu replied to that Buddha This profound significance is beyond my state WorldHonored One I pray that You will fully expound to me the way BuddhaTathāgatas form their Pure Lands Having heard it I will train according to what You say and fulfill my vow At that time World Sovereign King Buddha knew this bhikṣus exceptional capacity and the profundity and immensity of his resolve He then said to the bhikṣu Dharmākara As an analogy a person keeps drawing water from an ocean with a small container After kalpas of work he can reach its bottom and obtain the treasures there Likewise if a person makes earnest energetic progress to seek bodhi unceasingly he will definitely harvest the holy fruit No wish will fail to come true Then World Sovereign King Buddha fully described to him  koṭi Buddha Lands In response to his request that Buddha also displayed all lands coarse or fine and the gods and humans there good or evil At that time the bhikṣu heard that Buddhas description of magnificent Pure Lands and also beheld them all He made the unsurpassed supreme resolve His mind was silent and free from attachment and no one in the entire world could compare with him For five kalpas he contemplated and collected the pure actions to adorn a Buddha Land nanda asked the Buddha What was that Buddhas lifespan The Buddha replied That Buddha lived for fortytwo kalpas during which time the bhikṣu Dharmākara collected the pure actions taken to adorn those  koṭi wonderful Buddha Lands Having trained himself in this way he went to that Buddha He made obeisance at that Buddhas feet and circled Him three times Standing properly with his palms joined he said to that Buddha WorldHonored One I have collected the pure actions to adorn my Buddha Land That Buddha told the bhikṣu You now may declare your vows Know that now is the right time to delight all multitudes After I become a Buddha if the number of voicehearers in my land should be known by calculation and be obtained through calculating for  kalpas by sentient

to the unsurpassed bodhi After I become a Buddha if Bodhisattvas in my land should fail to arrive by virtue of my spiritual power in the time of a meal in innumerable countless koṭis of nayutas of Buddha Lands to make offerings to those Buddhas I would not attain the perfect enlightenment After I become a Buddha Bodhisattvas in my land will demonstrate their roots of virtue before Buddhas If they should fail to manifest at will their intended offerings to their satisfaction I would not attain the perfect enlightenment After I become a Buddha if Bodhisattvas in my land should be unable to

Buddha if Bodhisattvas in my land including those with a meager store of merits should fail to know and see in my bodhimaṇḍa the innumerable radiant colors of the  tree which is four million lis tall

Bodhisattvas in other lands who hear my name should not achieve the first second or third of the Three Endurances in the Dharma and thus fail to attain the level of no regress from the Buddha Dharma I would not attain the perfect enlightenment The Buddha told nanda After the bhikṣu Dharmākara finished declaring his vows he spoke in verse Making vows to transcend the world I will definitely attain the unsurpassed bodhi If I am not a great almsgiver who For innumerable kalpas Universally relieves all those in poverty and suffering I vow not to attain samyaksabodhi After I attain Buddha bodhi My renown will spread  in the ten directions If there are those who never hear my name I vow not to attain samyaksabodhi Leaving behind desires and keeping the right mindfulness I will train in the Brahma way of life with pure wisdom Resolved to attain the unsurpassed bodhi I will become the teacher to gods and humans I will display vast radiance with my spiritual power Universally illuminating innumerable lands To dispel the darkness of the three afflictions And rescue those in tribulations I will open their wisdomeye And dispel the darkness of their blindness I will close the evil lifepaths And open the door to the good lifepaths When my meritorious work is completed My awesome radiance will shine in the ten directions The double luminosity of the sun and the moon will be eclipsed And the light of the skies will be withdrawn I open the Dharma store to the multitudes And lavish upon them the treasure of merits In the midst of the multitudes I expound the Dharma with the lions roar I make offerings to all Buddhas Fully developing my roots of virtue I wish to unfold my wisdom in full To become the hero in the Three Realms Like the Buddha whose immeasurable wisdom Penetrates everything everywhere I wish that the power of my merit May equal that of the Supreme Honored One If my vows are to bear fruit The Thousandfold World will be moved And gods in the open sky Will shower splendid flowers As soon as the bhikṣu spoke these stanzas the earth quaked in six different ways and the sky rained wonderful flowers down upon him Music sprang up in the sky praising He will definitely attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Then the bhikṣu Dharmākara completely fulfilled these great vows Truly he transcended the world for he deeply delighted in nirvāṇa His Accumulation of Merits from Virtuous Actions The Buddha said nanda the bhikṣu Dharmākara made these great vows before that Buddha amid multitudes of celestial māras Brahma gods and the eight classes of Dharma protectors such as gods and dragons Having made his vows he intently worked on the adornment of his Buddha Land so that it should be open and vast superb and uniquely wonderful as well as everlasting without decay or change For inconceivable trillions of kalpas the bhikṣu engaged in immeasurable virtuous Bodhisattva actions He permitted neither thoughts nor perceptions of greed anger or harm to arise in his mind He was not attached to the sense objects sights sounds scents flavors tactile sensations and mental objects He was accomplished in endurance never disheartened by myriad tribulations With few desires and much contentment he had no greed anger or delusion Silently abiding in samādhi his wisdom was hindrance free Free from the mind of falsehood and sycophancy he spoke loving words with a kind face and considerately asked the questions for those who hesitated to ask He made boldly energetic progress never feeling weary He sought only the pure dharmas to benefit sentient beings He revered the Three Jewels and served his teachers and elders With great adornments  he completed many works and enabled sentient beings to acquire merit He abided in the Three Samādhis emptiness no appearance and no wish With no act and no arising in his mind he saw that dharmas are illusory Keeping far away from abusive speech which can harm self others and both he trained in speaking virtuous words to benefit self others and both He abandoned his kingdom and throne wealth and women to practice the six pāramitās and teach others to practice them as well After countless kalpas of accumulation of merit and virtue in any place where he was reborn innumerable treasure stores were spontaneously uncovered at his wish He manifested himself as elders laypeople people with a great family name or dignitaries as kings in the kṣatriya caste or WheelTurning Kings and as godkings of the six desire heavens or even godkings of Brahma heavens He always reverently offered the four necessities to all Buddhas Such merit is beyond description and acclaim His breath was fragrant and fresh like utpala flowers The pores of his body emitted sandalwood scent which suffused innumerable worlds His facial features were even and comely and his appearance superb Manifested from his hands were inexhaustible treasures clothing food and drink and adornments such as splendid flowers incense and silky canopies and banners Things such as these surpass those of gods He achieved command of all dharmas Dharmākara as Amitāyus Buddha nanda asked the Buddha Has Dharmākara Bodhisattva already attained Buddhahood and entered parinirvāṇa Has he not yet attained Buddhahood Is he now somewhere The Buddha replied to nanda Dharmākara Bodhisattva has already attained Buddhahood He is now in the west  koṭi lands away from here His Buddha Land is called Peace and Bliss nanda next asked How long has it been since that Buddha attained bodhi The Buddha replied It has been ten kalpas since He attained Buddhahood The Virtues of His Land His Buddha Land naturally has the seven treasures Its ground is made of gold silver aquamarine coral amber conch shell and emerald and it is open vast and boundless The treasures intermingle and combine with one another dazzling and sparkling They are wonderful beautiful pure and splendid surpassing those in all worlds in the ten directions These treasures the best of all treasures are like those in the sixth desire heaven His land does not have the four seasons In spring autumn winter or summer the temperature is neither cold nor hot but constantly pleasant and comfortable Nor does it have immense oceans small seas streams channels wells or valleys Then nanda asked the Buddha If that land does not have Mount Sumeru upon what do Heaven of the Four GodKings  and Trayastriśa Heaven  rely The Buddha replied to nanda Upon what do other heavens from Yāma Heaven the third desire heaven up to  the Ultimate Form Heaven rely nanda said to the Buddha Ones karmas and their corresponding requitals are inconceivable The Buddha told nanda As karmas and corresponding requitals are inconceivable so too are Buddha Lands inconceivable For sentient beings in any land their merits and powers are grounded in their karmas nanda said to the Buddha I have no doubts regarding this Dharma It is for removing the doubts of sentient beings of the future that I ask about this meaning His Infinite Light The Buddha told nanda Amitāyus Buddhas radiance is dignified and supreme with which other Buddhas radiance cannot compare There are Buddhas whose radiance reaches a distance of seven feet or one two three four or five yojanas or to a distance extended to illuminate one Buddha Land There are Buddhas whose radiance illuminates  or  Buddha Lands Therefore Amitāyus Buddha is also called Infinite Light Buddha Boundless Light Buddha HindranceFree Light Buddha Matchless Light Buddha FlameKing Light Buddha Pure Light Buddha Joyful Light Buddha Wisdom Light Buddha Ceaseless Light Buddha Inconceivable Light Buddha Ineffable Light Buddha and Outshining the SunMoon Light Buddha If sentient beings are touched by His radiance their three afflictions will be eliminated and their bodies and minds will become gentle They will be filled with joy and exuberance as benevolence arises in their minds If those who are in extreme suffering taking any of the three evil lifejourneys see this radiance they can rest no more pain or distress After their death they will be saved  Amitāyus Buddhas radiance gloriously illuminates Buddha Lands in the ten directions and no one fails to hear of it As I now praise His radiance so too do all Buddhas Bodhisattvas Pratyekabuddhas and voicehearers If sentient beings that have heard of His radiance awesome spirit and merit unceasingly praise Him day and night with an earnest mind they will be reborn in His land as they wish There multitudes of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers will praise their merit In addition Buddhas and Bodhisattvas  in the ten directions just as they now praise  will praise these sentient beings radiance until their eventual attainment of Buddha bodhi The Buddha continued I could describe the majesty and wonder of Amitāyus Buddhas radiance and awesome spirit day and night for a kalpa but still could not finish my narration His Infinite Life The Buddha told nanda Amitāyus Buddhas lifespan is so long that it is beyond calculation Suppose innumerable sentient beings in worlds in the ten directions all assume human form and become voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas Suppose they assemble and singlemindedly calculate for a billion kalpas with all the power of their intellect the length of His lifespan in terms of kalpas They can never find its end or know its limit The lifespan of the multitude of Bodhisattvas voicehearers and gods there is also not a number that can be known by calculation or analogy The Countless Numbers of the Holy Multitudes In addition the numbers of voicehearers and Bodhisattvas are hard to calculate and describe They have superb spiritual knowledge and command of awesome powers They can hold the entire world in their hands The Buddha told nanda The number of voicehearers and Bodhisattvas who attended that Buddhas first assembly is beyond calculation Suppose there are innumerable countless billions of koṭis of people just like Mahāmaudgalyāyana and they all calculate for asakhyeya nayuta kalpas until they enter parinirvāṇa They can never find this number which is like the immeasurable depth of the immense ocean Suppose someone cuts a hair into a hundred pieces and uses a piece to draw a drop of water from the ocean What is your opinion Is this drop more than the water in the immense ocean nanda replied to the Buddha The quantity of water in the immense ocean can never be gauged by the drop of water taken by the person It cannot be known by skillful calculation or described by words The Buddha told nanda The number of voicehearers and Bodhisattvas who attended the first assembly as calculated by Maudgalyāyana for a billion koṭi nayuta kalpas is like a drop of water The number

them no more nanda when gods in that land see this bodhi tree they achieve the Three Endurances in the Dharma First the Endurance in Hearing the Sounds second the Endurance in Accord third the Endurance in the Realization of the No Birth of Dharmas They achieve these endurances entirely by virtue of Amitāyus Buddhas awesome spiritual power and by virtue of the power of His original vows the fulfillment of these vows the clarity of these vows the firmness of these vows and the ultimacy of these vows The Musical Trees The Buddha told nanda A king in the human world is entertained by  kinds of music and music is also played in the palace of a WheelTurning King and in each of the six desire heavens The music in each place is ten million koṭi times superior to that in the preceding place However the  musical tones in the sixth desire heaven are  koṭi times inferior to even a single tone from the trees made of the seven treasures in Amitāyus Buddhas land These trees naturally play  kinds of instrumental music The sounds of music are none other than Dharma tones which are pure and resonant wonderful and harmonious They are foremost among all the sounds in worlds in the ten directions The Palaces and Towers The auditoriums ashrams palaces and towers in that land are made of the seven treasures by magic The Jeweled Ponds Inside and outside of these structures are bathing

emerald ponds are covered with conch shell dust The beds of white jade ponds are covered with purpletinged gold dust The beds of purpletinged gold ponds are covered with white jade dust Some ponds are made of two three or even seven treasures On the banks of these ponds stand sandalwood trees covered with leaves and flowers wafting fragrances everywhere All over the surfaces of the waters are lotus flowers such as celestial utpalas padmas kumadas and puṇḍarīkas all gleaming with colorful light When Bodhisattvas and voicehearers enter a jeweled pond if they wish the water to cover their feet the water will cover their feet If they wish the water to reach their knees the water will rise to their knees If they wish the water to reach their waist the water will rise to their waist If they wish the water to reach their chest the water will rise to their chest If they wish the water to reach their neck the water will rise to their neck If they wish the water to shower on their body the water will shower on their body If they wish the water to return to its former level the water will return to its former level The water temperature can be adjusted at will to either cool or warm The water vitalizes the spirit delights the body and cleanses the mind of filth The ripples merge and separate vanishing peacefully neither too slow nor too fast The ripples produce innumerable wonderful sounds No one fails to hear the sounds suiting his needs whether the sounds of the Buddha the Dharma the Saṅgha silence emptiness no self great lovingkindness and compassion the pāramitās the Ten Powers the Four Fearlessnesses the Eighteen Exclusive Dharmas the overall wisdomknowledge no act no arising or ceasing the Endurance in the Realization of the No Birth of Dharmas or even sweet nectar pouring on

the Fearlessnesses and the Eighteen Exclusive Dharmas and with the path and wisdom of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers That land does not have even the names of the three evil lifejourneys it has only joyful tones Therefore that land is called Peace and Bliss The Inhabitants nanda those who are reborn in that land are endowed with pure physical bodies wonderful voices and the virtue of transcendental powers The palaces in which they live their clothing food and drink and adornments such as wonderful flowers and incense are like those in the sixth desire heaven When they desire to eat bowls made of the seven treasures spontaneously appear before them Such bowls made of gold silver aquamarine conch shell emerald coral amber or the moonlight jewel appear at their wish The bowls are naturally filled with food and drink of one hundred flavors Although such food is present there are no eaters Gentle in body and mind they are naturally satiated merely by seeing the food and smelling its aroma They take their intention of eating as food with no attachment to flavors The bowls vanish when the meal is over and reappear in due time The purity peace and wonderful pleasures of that Buddha Land are below only the state of nirvāṇa which is free from causes and conditions The Bodhisattvas voicehearers and gods of that land have superb wisdom and marvelous transcendental powers They all appear in the same form without any difference To conform to the way of other lands the name gods is used for them They have wonderful appearances with even facial features extraordinary and unearthly Being neither gods nor humans they all are endowed with bodies that are naturally ethereal and boundless The Buddha told nanda As an analogy when a poor beggar in the world stands beside a king can you compare his features with those of the king nanda replied to the Buddha If this person stands beside the king his features ugly and sordid beyond analogy are reckoned as a billion koṭi times inferior to the kings Why is he so The poor beggar is lowly and his clothes can barely cover his body He can hardly feed himself to stay alive He is always hungry cold and in distress having lost all human standards All his tribulations stem from his past lives during which he did not plant roots of virtue Wealthy and miserly he did not give any of his accumulated riches to others He desired to acquire things unearned never tiring of his greedy pursuits He did not believe in cultivation of virtue and the evil he did piled high like a mountain In this way he died and his wealth and treasures all dispersed The wealth amassed by his toiling body which caused him concern and distress did not benefit him but went to others in the end Without goodness or virtue to depend upon after death he went down an evil lifepath to undergo long suffering After his sins have been purged although he is reborn as a human he is lowly and extremely stupid and sordid A king in the world is honored among men because of the merit he has accumulated in his past lives Caring and generous he gave alms to the needy with lovingkindness He honored his trust and cultivated virtue never disputative After his death supported by his merit he is reborn to go up a good lifepath He can even be reborn  in a heaven to enjoy myriad pleasures With a wealth of accumulated credit he is reborn as a human into a royal family Noble by birth he has even comely features Respected and served by the multitudes he enjoys wonderful garments and choice delicacies served at his command Supported by the merit acquired in his past lives a king lives a kings life The Buddha told nanda What you say is true Although a king is dignified and noble among men his even comely features in comparison with those of a WheelTurning King are lowly and sordid just like the beggar standing beside the king The WheelTurning Kings awesome appearance is the foremost one in the world However he is ugly in the presence of the godking of Trayastriśa Heaven  koṭi times uglier by comparison If this godking is compared with the godking of the sixth desire heaven he is  koṭi times inferior in appearance If the godking of the sixth desire heaven is compared with Bodhisattvas and voicehearers in Amitāyus Buddhas land his radiant features and colors are a billion koṭi times inferior The Splendors of His Land The Buddha told nanda Gods in Amitāyus Buddhas land by a single thought can instantly manifest clothing food and drink flowers and incense necklaces silky canopies and banners and wonderful music as well as dwellings palaces and towers made of one two or even innumerable treasures in desired shapes colors heights and sizes Spread all over the ground are wonderful garments made with jewels Gods step on them as they walk Canopying that Buddha Land are innumerable jeweled nets made of gold threads and precious gems and adorned with  varieties of jewels and wonderful treasures Hanging from the four sides of these nets are jeweled bells which sparkle with colorful light extremely beautiful Breezes of virtue naturally stir and they are gentle and pleasant neither hot nor cold but warm or cool Neither too weakly nor too strongly they sweep across the jeweled nets and the jeweled trees which sound innumerable wonderful Dharma tones and waft  kinds of gentle fragrances of virtue When these winds touch their bodies they experience bliss like that of a bhikṣu in the Samādhi of Total Suspension of Sensory Reception and Perception Moreover the breezes carry flowers all over that Buddha Land which fall orderly according to their colors not chaotically They are soft and lustrous with a strong perfume When one steps on them the foot sinks down four inches According to schedule the breezes disperse the flowers in this way six times a day Moreover there are jeweled lotus flowers all over that world and each jeweled flower has  koṭi petals The petals in innumerable colors are radiant The blue colors gleam with blue light the white colors with white light Each flower emits  koṭi beams of light Manifested in each beam are  koṭi Buddhas each with a purpletinged golden body and an extraordinary superb appearance Each Buddha emits  beams of light as He expounds the wondrous Dharma  in the ten directions These Buddhas each set innumerable sentient beings on the right path to Buddhahood Fascicle   The Certainty of Buddhahood The Buddha told nanda Those who are reborn in that land all belong in the group of sentient beings that definitely progress on the right path to bodhi Because in that Buddha Land there is neither the group that definitely is not on the bodhi path nor the group that is indecisive about its paths The Three Classes to Be Reborn BuddhaTathāgatas in worlds in the ten directions who are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges each praise Amitāyus Buddhas inconceivable awesome spirit and merit If sentient beings that hear His name elicit faith and joy in but one thought and with an earnest wish for rebirth in that land transfer their merits to others they will be reborn there and attain the spiritual level of no regress Excepted are those who have committed any of the five rebellious sins or maligned the true Dharma The Buddha told nanda Gods and humans in worlds in the ten directions who earnestly wish to be reborn in that land are grouped into three classes In the high class are those who have renounced family life abandoned desires and become śramaṇas They should activate the bodhi mind and constantly think only of Amitāyus Buddha They should accumulate merit and resolve to be reborn in His land When they die Amitāyus Buddha together with a holy multitude will appear before them and they will follow that Buddha to His land They will be naturally reborn in lotus flowers made of the seven treasures and they will abide in the spiritual level of no regress Their wisdom will be keen and they will have command of transcendental powers Therefore nanda if there are sentient beings that wish to see Amitāyus Buddha in their present life they should activate the unsurpassed bodhi mind accumulate merit and resolve to be reborn in His land The Buddha told nanda In the middle class are gods and humans in worlds in the ten directions who earnestly wish to be reborn in that land but are unable to become śramaṇas and to accumulate merit on a large scale They should activate the unsurpassed bodhi mind and constantly think only of Amitāyus Buddha as they cultivate goodness on a smaller scale They should observe the pure precepts erect memorial towers enshrine Buddha images offer food to śramaṇas hang silk screens light lamps scatter flowers and burn incense With a wish for rebirth in that land they should transfer their merits to others When they die Amitāyus Buddha will magically manifest a copy of Himself who is just as radiant and splendid as a real Buddha to appear together with a holy multitude before them They will follow this magically manifested Buddha to His land and will abide in the spiritual level of no regress Their merit and wisdom will be below those in the high class The Buddha told nanda In the low class are gods and humans in worlds in the ten directions who earnestly wish to be reborn in that land Although they are unable to acquire various merits they should activate the unsurpassed bodhi mind and with a wish for rebirth in that land singlemindedly think ten thoughts of Amitāyus Buddha If they hear the profound Dharma they should delight and believe in it without raising doubts Even if they think only one thought of that Buddha with utmost sincerity they should resolve to be reborn in His land When they die they will dream of that Buddha and will be reborn in His land Their merit and wisdom are below those in the middle class Praises by Buddhas and Homage by Bodhisattvas The Buddha told nanda Amitāyus Buddhas awesome spirit is boundless None of the innumerable countless inconceivable BuddhaTathāgatas in worlds in the ten directions fails to praise Him Innumerable countless multitudes of Bodhisattvas in Buddha Lands in the east which are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges together with multitudes of voicehearers all go to Amitāyus Buddha to make offerings reverently to Him and the Bodhisattvas and voicehearers there They hear and accept the Dharma in order to disseminate the Dharma and transform sentient beings As they do these things so too do Bodhisattvas in worlds in the south west and north in the inbetween directions toward the zenith and toward the nadir At that time the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Buddha Lands in the east Their numbers are like the sands of the Ganges Multitudes of Bodhisattvas in those lands Visit Amitāyus Buddha reverently In the south west and north in the four inbetween directions Toward the zenith and toward the nadir Multitudes of Bodhisattvas in those lands Also visit Amitāyus Buddha reverently Every Bodhisattva Carries wonderful celestial flowers Choice incense and priceless garments To make offerings to Amitāyus Buddha Celestial music plays harmoniously Exquisite tones in concert They praise the Supreme Honored One in hymns As an offering to Amitāyus Buddha Who has fully attained wisdom and spiritual power Gone through profound Dharma Doors And completed His store of merits His unparalleled wondrous wisdomknowledge Shines on the world like the sun of wisdom And removes the clouds of birth and death They reverently circle Him three times And bow down to the Unsurpassed Honored One Seeing that His welladorned Pure Land is So wondrous and inconceivable They hereupon activate the unsurpassed bodhi mind Each wishing the land  to be the same Then Amitāyus Buddha is moved And he smiles joyfully His mouth emits innumerable beams of light Illuminating everywhere in worlds in the ten directions The returning beams of light circle His body three times And enter into the crown of His head The entire multitude of gods is Exuberant and exultant Avalokiteśvara BodhisattvaMahāsattva Arranges his garment bows his head and asks Why the Buddha is smiling To the request for an explanation that Buddha replies Brahma sounds reverberate like thunders The eight tones resonating wonderful melodies An accompaniment to my bestowal of prophecies upon Bodhisattvas I now explain and you should hearken The Upright Ones have come from worlds in the ten directions And I know all their wishes They resolve to form and adorn their Pure Lands And to attain Buddhahood Realizing that all dharmas are Like dreams illusions and echoes They will fulfill their wonderful wishes Definitely to form such lands as mine Knowing that dharmas are like lightning and reflection They will eventually complete the Bodhisattva Way Perfect their roots of virtue And attain Buddhahood Thoroughly understanding dharma nature They know that everything is empty and has no self Intently seeking pure Buddha Lands They definitely will form such lands All Buddhas tell Bodhisattvas to visit That Buddha in the Land of Peace and Bliss To hear the Dharma accept it joyfully and train accordingly And quickly attain the state of purity Upon arrival in that welladorned Pure Land One will quickly acquire transcendental powers And will definitely receive from Amitāyus Buddha The prophecy of attaining Buddhahood By virtue of the power of that Buddhas original vows Those who hear His name and resolve to be reborn  Will all arrive in that land And attain the spiritual level of no regress Bodhisattvas who make earnest vows Wishing that their own lands be no different from that land Remember and deliver all sentient beings Their renown spreads across worlds in the ten directions To serve koṭis of Tathāgatas They fly to all lands After joyfully paying homage to Tathāgatas They return to the Land of Peace and Bliss Those who do not have roots of goodness Cannot hear this sūtra Only those who are pure and observe their precepts Will come to hear the true Dharma Only those who have seen a WorldHonored One before Will believe this explanation Humble and reverent they hear and carry out the Dharma With exuberance and great joy For those who are arrogant and indolent It is difficult to believe in the Dharma But those who have seen Buddhas in their past lives Delight in hearing these teachings Voicehearers and Bodhisattvas are unable To fathom the mind of the Holiest One Just as a person who is born blind Tries to guide others The ocean of the Tathāgatas wisdom is Deep and vast without a bottom Those riding the Two Vehicles can never measure it Only Buddhas themselves can understand Suppose that all people Have attained bodhi  and Acquired the pure wisdom that everything is empty For koṭis of kalpas they ponder the wisdom of a Buddha Trying to describe it with all their strength They still do not know it at the end of their life Buddha wisdom is boundless And it brings the ultimate state of purity As a long lifespan is hard to obtain Even harder is to encounter a Buddha appearing in the world It is difficult for people to have faith and wisdom Those who energetically seek to hear the Dharma And do not forget the Dharma they have heard Will face that Buddha and receive great benefits Therefore my good kinfolk and friends You should resolve To hear the Dharma Even if the world is in flames Then you will definitely attain Buddha bodhi To rescue all those in the flow of birth and death The Sublime Bodhisattvas The Buddha told nanda All Bodhisattvas in that land will eventually be in the holy position of waiting to attain Buddhahood in their next life except those whose original vows put sentient beings first They adorn themselves with the merit of their great vows hastening to deliver all sentient beings everywhere nanda in that Buddha Land a voicehearers body light is one yojana across and a Bodhisattvas radiance reaches a distance of one hundred yojanas There are two foremost Bodhisattvas who are most honored Their awesome spiritual radiance shines everywhere in the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World nanda asked the Buddha What are these two Bodhisattvas names The Buddha replied One is called Avalokiteśvara and the other  Great Might Arrived These two Bodhisattvas trained in the Bodhisattva Way in this land After their death they have been reborn in that Buddha Land nanda sentient beings reborn in that land are all endowed with a great mans thirtytwo physical marks Fulfilled in wisdom they delve into dharmas and understand their essence Their transcendental powers are hindrance free and their faculties are brilliant and keen Those of inferior capacity achieve the first two of the Three Endurances and those of superior capacity achieve the asakhyeya Endurance in the Realization of the No Birth of Dharmas In addition these Bodhisattvas on their way to Buddhahood will never again go down the evil lifejourneys They have command of transcendental powers and know the past lives of themselves and others However if they choose to be reborn elsewhere in an evil world with the five turbidities resembling my world they will manifest themselves to resemble the inhabitants there The Buddha told nanda Bodhisattvas in that land by virtue of that Buddhas power in the time of a meal can visit innumerable worlds in the ten directions to make offerings to the BuddhaTathāgatas there According to their thoughts innumerable countless offerings instantly appear like magic such as flowers incense instrumental music silky canopies and banners which are precious and extraordinary not of this world These Bodhisattvas offer such objects to the multitude of Buddhas Bodhisattvas and voicehearers there which then change into flower canopies in the sky The flower canopies are radiant and colorful wafting fragrances everywhere Each flower canopy is  lis in circumference and continues to double in size until it covers the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World These flower canopies then vanish one after another Delighted these Bodhisattvas play celestial music in the sky and with wonderful tones they hymn Buddhas virtues They hear and accept the Dharma with infinite joy After making offerings to those Buddhas before mealtime they effortlessly lift off and return to their own land Pronouncement of the Dharma and Presentation of Offerings The Buddha told nanda When Amitāyus Buddha pronounces the Dharma to Bodhisattvas voicehearers and gods they all assemble in the auditorium made of the seven treasures As He widely expounds the wondrous Dharma no one fails to understand and accept with delight the teachings for attaining bodhi Meanwhile winds arise from the four directions blowing across trees made of the seven treasures which sound the five tones The winds scatter innumerable wonderful flowers everywhere These natural offerings continue endlessly All gods take  celestial flowers and fragrances and play  kinds of instrumental music to make offerings to that Buddha and the multitude of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers Scattering flowers and incense playing music they walk to and fro and quickly get out of one anothers way During that time their harmony and delight are beyond words The Merit of the Bodhisattvas The Buddha told nanda When Bodhisattvas reborn in that Buddha Land speak they always pronounce the true Dharma in accord with their wisdom with no contradictions or mistakes For the myriad things in that land they hold no concept of belonging or attachment Without emotional bondage they come and go move or stop completely at ease Unfettered by endearment or alienation with no sense of self versus others neither competitive nor disputative they have the altruistic mind of great lovingkindness and compassion for sentient beings Never weary or indolent they retain in their minds equality excellence profundity and concentration as well as love appreciation and joy of the Dharma Having eradicated afflictions and purified the mind bent on the evil lifejourneys they take all Bodhisattva actions and acquire immeasurable merit Equipped with profound samādhi transcendental powers and illuminating wisdom they practice the Seven Bodhi Factors training their minds in accordance with the Buddha Dharma Their physicaleye is pure and perceptive able to distinguish all things With hindrancefree wisdom they expound the Dharma to others Seeing that all things in the Three Realms of Existence are equal in their emptiness they resolve to seek the Buddha Dharma Equipped with eloquence they annihilate the afflictions that trouble all sentient beings Born from the Tathātaga they understand the true suchness of dharmas Equipped with a good understanding of nirvāṇa and with verbal skills they do not enjoy worldly talks but delight in true discussions  They develop their roots of goodness and resolve to attain Buddha bodhi Knowing that all dharmas are in nirvāṇa they end both their afflictions and their cycle of birth and death When they hear the profound Dharma they have no fears or doubts in their minds and are able to train themselves accordingly Their great compassion is so profound farreaching and wonderful that it embraces all sentient beings without exception and they carry them all aboard the ultimate One Vehicle to the opposite shore As they resolutely shatter the web of doubts wisdom arises in their minds completely encompassing the Buddha Dharma Their wisdom is like the immense ocean and their samādhi is like the king of mountains The radiance of their wisdom surpasses that of the sun and the moon as they master the pure ways They are like the snow mountain because they sparkle with merits that are equal in purity like the great earth because they do not discriminate between purity and impurity good and evil like the pure water because they wash away afflictions like filth like the fireking because they burn way afflictions like firewood like the powerful wind because they travel across worlds unhindered like the open sky because they are not attached to anything like the lotus flower because they live in the world untainted like the Mahāyāna because they carry sentient beings out of their cycle of birth and death like the thick clouds because they rumble the great Dharma thunder to awaken those asleep like the torrential rain because they pour down sweet nectar to water sentient beings like the vajra mountain because they cannot be moved by māras or nonBuddhists like the Brahmakings because they are foremost in upholding virtuous dharmas like the banyan tree because they shelter all like the udumbara flower because they are rare to encounter like the goldenwinged garuḍa because they subdue adherents of the wrong views like the soaring birds because they do not accumulate things like the oxking because they are invincible like the elephantking

precepts endurance of adversity energetic progress meditation and wisdomand the power of right mindfulness right observation the six transcendental powers the Three Clarities and taming sentient beings in accordance with the Dharma Such power is complete in them Adorned with merit and eloquence their physical features are majestic No one can compare with them They reverently make offerings to innumerable Buddhas and they are always praised by Buddhas They perfect their practice of pāramitās required for Bodhisattvas as they train in the Three Samādhisemptiness no appearance and no wishand go through Samādhi Doors such as no birth and no death They stay far away from the ground of voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas nanda those Bodhisattvas are adorned with such immeasurable merit which I have only briefly described to you If I elaborate I cannot finish even in a billion kalpas Encouragement to Achieve Rebirth in That Land The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva gods and humans The merit and wisdom of the voicehearers and Bodhisattvas in Amitāyus Buddhas land are beyond description If one makes energetic progress seeking bodhi one definitely will transcend this world and be reborn in the Land of Peace and Bliss If one decisively rejects the five evil lifepaths they will be closed to one However although the limitless  ascension is easy to achieve no one wants to go that way Although that land poses no obstructions people are tethered to their world Why does one not give up ones worldly matters to walk the virtuous Way in order to acquire an extremely long life and infinite delight The Evil Ways of the World However people of the world are shallow and earthly and they fight over minor matters In extreme suffering they toil to support themselves Noble or base rich or poor young or old male or female they all are concerned about money Whether or not they have money they worry about it just the same If they own houses they worry about their houses In addition their slaves riches clothing food sundry goods and the six kinds of livestock such as cows and horses are all their concerns Thinking and panting they live in anxiety and fear Unexpectedly floods fires bandits enemies and creditors wash burn and take away their goods When the objects of their concern are all destroyed or dispersed their toxic anxiety and anguish can find no release Anger stays in their minds together with concern and distress Obstinately attached to their belongings they refuse to let go of them Some live out the rest of their lives as ruined men The poor and lowly are constantly in destitution Those who do not own farmland desire to own farmland those who do not own houses desire to own houses those who do not own slaves riches clothing food sundry goods or the six kinds of livestock such as cows and horses desire to own them They may have one item lacking another they may have some items lacking others They think about getting all of them Even as they get everything these objects soon are dispersed With anxiety and pain they seek but cannot get what they want Their thinking is futile which only tires their body and mind Plagued by their concerns they are restless in their conduct They cannot help toiling in cold or hot weather living in pain They carry on in this way until they die They refuse to do good walk the right path or cultivate virtue After death each of them will travel long distances alone taking the next lifejourney unable to know whether it is good or evil People of the worldparents children siblings spouses and close or distant relativesshould have love and respect for one another not hatred The fortunate should be generous to the unfortunate not stingy People should be kind and gentle to one another in their speech and manners not hostile However those who are in dispute harbor anger and their anger in the present life will become an enormous feud in a future life Because although mutually harmful acts in ones present life may not immediately result in a deadly fight the poisonous anger and hardened fury remain in ones  consciousness not going away People live in the loves and desires of the world However everyone is born alone dies alone comes alone and goes alone One must complete ones own lifejourney of pain or pleasure and no one else can take ones place Ones good or evil karmas lead one to fortune or misfortune As ones past karmas relentlessly await one must go alone on ones next lifejourney to a distant place that cannot be known Family members each accompanied by good and evil karmas which are hidden from them will be separated by their different lifepaths for a long time It will be extremely difficult for them to meet again Why do people not give up their worldly pursuits and not strive to cultivate virtue while they are still healthy and strong If they strive to cultivate virtue and make energetic progress aiming to transcend the world they can acquire infinite life What other delight can they possibly desire However people of the world do not believe that doing good karmas reaps good requitals or that seeking bodhi leads to attainment of bodhi They do not believe in rebirth after death Nor do they believe that generous giving yields good fortune or that requitals match good or evil karmas They contend that it is not so and that there is no such thing Just like their deceased fathers and forefathers who neither did good nor recognized morality these descendants with their delusions closed minds and dark spirits are of course unable to distinguish between good and evil ways or to understand the resultant journeys of birth and death Whether good or evil fortunate or unfortunate they race to do anything as they please and no one finds it disturbing Parents weep for the loss of their children children weep for the loss of their parents Siblings and spouses weep for their respective losses Death does not occur according to any order Under the law of impermanence nothing can stay forever and all things will pass away Even when people are told or taught this few believe it Therefore ones transmigration through birth and death is endless But in their ignorance people still refuse to believe in the Dharma  in the sūtras Without any forethought they each desire instant gratification Stupefied in their loves and desires they disregard morality They are lost in anger and hatred and greedy for wealth and carnal pleasures They continue to undergo birth and death endlessly suffering through their evil lifejourneys How agonized and pathetic they are If there is a death in a family whether a parent a child a sibling or a spouse the survivors mourn their loss They think of their loved one and their thoughts of grief form a knot Enduring days and years of pain in their hearts they still cannot release themselves from their attachment Even when they are given the true teachings their minds stay closed because their thoughts are not apart from sensual desires Dazed and blocked their minds are mired in delusion In this bustling world a place upon which one cannot rely whether dignified or humble high or low rich or poor noble or base each toils in his work harboring malice and dark evil energy They attract evils to follow them which let them do as they please until their sins have peaked Before the end of their natural lifespans they die sudden deaths Then they go down the evil lifepaths life after life for thousands of koṭis of kalpas not knowing when release will come Their suffering is indescribable How pathetic they are The Solemn Admonition The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva gods and humans I now have described to you the affairs of the world Those who are involved cannot attain bodhi One should carefully reflect on ones life stay far away from evils and diligently do wellchosen good deeds Love desire rank and wealth are impossible to preserve They are not pleasurable and they all will depart When one encounters a Buddha in the world one should make energetic progress Those who earnestly resolve to be reborn in the Land of Peace and Bliss will acquire illuminating wisdom and excellent merit One should not allow selfindulgence or fail the teachings and the precepts thus falling behind others If you have any doubts about this sūtra you may ask the Buddha I will explain to you Maitreya Bodhisattva fell on both knees and said The Buddha is revered for His awesome spirit His words are direct and virtuous Having heard the Buddhas teachings we each should thoroughly think them over People of the world act just as described by the Buddha Out of His lovingkindness and compassion the Buddha now has indicated the great Way Ones ear and eye are opened and cleared because of ones deliverance None of those who have heard the Buddha fails to rejoice By His lovingkindness gods humans and even wriggly insects are all liberated from anxiety and suffering The Buddhas admonition is profound and virtuous His wisdom clearly sees all things of the past present and future everywhere  in the ten directions hindrance free The reason we have deliverance bestowed upon us is that the Buddha in His past lives arduously sought bodhi with humility His kindness is allembracing and his merit majestic His radiance shines through the limitless emptiness  opening the entrance to nirvāṇa He ceaselessly teaches tames commands transforms and inspires all  in the ten directions The Buddha is the Dharma King revered above all multitudes of holy beings As the teacher to all gods and humans He enables them to attain bodhi as they wish No one fails to rejoice and open his mind wide The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva What you say is true Reverence for the Buddha is a great virtue Only once in a long long time will a Buddha appear in the world I now have become a Buddha in this world to expound the Dharma giving the teachings for attaining bodhi to shatter the web of doubts to pull out the roots of love and desire and to destroy the source of evils as I visit the Three Realms of Existence unhindered With allencompassing wisdom I teach the essentials of the right path and explain its guidelines I reveal the five lifejourneys and deliver those who have not been delivered enabling them to take the right path that goes from sasāra to nirvāṇa Maitreya know that you have trained in the Bodhisattva Way for innumerable kalpas It has been a long time since you first resolved to deliver sentient beings You gods and humans in worlds in the ten directions and my four groups of disciples have been transmigrating through the five lifepaths since time without a beginning Your anxiety suffering and toil are beyond description Up to the present life you have not ended your cycle of birth and death Nevertheless you have encountered a Buddha and have heard and accepted the Dharma This is delightful and excellent I express my sympathetic joy You all should be tired of the pain of birth old age illness and death  discharging impurities nothing enjoyable It would be wise to resolve to organize yourselves for the right actionsto do good karmas to purify your body and mind and to speak and act truthfully in accord with your mind One can deliver oneself then help and rescue others To fulfill ones wish energetically one should develop ones roots of goodness Although one has to toil arduously in ones entire life it would be like an instant in comparison  One will then enjoy infinite bliss after ones rebirth in Amitāyus Buddhas land One will always act in accord with virtue and will have forever pulled out the roots of birth and death freed from the trouble of afflictions such as greed anger and delusion Ones lifespan can last for one kalpa  kalpas  kalpas or  koṭi kalpas according to ones wish You each should make energetic progress striving to fulfill your wish Doubts and regrets would be a blunder which would cause ones rebirth on the edge of that land There one would be confined for  years in a palace made of the seven treasures undergoing tribulations Maitreya Bodhisattva said Having received the Buddhas solemn admonition we will intently train and learn carrying out His teachings We dare not have any doubts The Five Evils and the Five Virtues The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva If you each can rectify your minds and intentions and refrain from doing evil this is the highest virtue unparalleled in worlds in the ten directions Because gods and humans in many Buddha Lands spontaneously do good not evil and they easily develop and transform themselves I now have become a Buddha in this world of the five evils the five pains and the five burns and I teach sentient beings in extreme suffering to discard the five evils remove the five pains and stay away from the five burns I transform their minds enabling them to uphold the five virtues and acquire merits so that they will live a long life  and eventually attain nirvāṇa The Buddha asked What are the five evils the five pains and the five burns How does one destroy the five evils and uphold the five virtues in order to acquire merit live a long life and attain nirvāṇa The First Evil and the First Virtue The Buddha explained The first evil is this Sentient beings from gods and humans down to wriggly insects do evil without exception As the strong crush the weak they harm kill and eat one another They do not know how to cultivate virtue but do evil without compunction Evildoers receive punishment as they head for the next lifejourney The evils lodged in their  consciousnesses find no pardon That is why there are those who are poor and lowly deprived and forlorn those who are deaf blind mute or stupid and those who are vicious and violent Then there are those who are dignified noble wealthy or capable and brilliant because in their past lives they were kind and dutiful and acquired merit and cultivated virtue Although the world has its regular systems of law and prison there are those who do not fear them and they commit crimes Then by law they receive punishment from which it is hard to escape or to be absolved This kind of punishment takes place in their present life The consequence in their next life is even more intense and severe Each of them enters darkness and assumes a body in a new life to undergo torture as if enforced by human law Hence there naturally are the three evil lifejourneys with immeasurable suffering and distress The sinners change bodies forms and lifepaths Whether a lifespan is long or short ones  consciousness cannot help heading for it One goes alone in ones rebirth timed with enemies rebirths to continue mutual revenge endlessly Until the purging of ones horrible sins one is unable to leave the evil lifejourneys One continues to trudge through them not knowing when release will come As liberation is hard to achieve ones pain is indescribable Such things do take place between heaven and earth Although requitals are not always immediate virtuous and evil ways will be returned in due time These are the first enormous evil the first pain and the first burn As one toils painfully it is like a huge fire burning ones body In its midst if one can control ones mind and harness ones body only to do good not evil one will achieve liberation acquire merit transcend the world and attain nirvāṇa People of the worldparents children siblings and spousesneither follow honorable principles nor comply with regulations They revel in extravagance and dissipation for gratification Selfcentered and selfwilled they deceive one another Their mouth and mind contradict each other their words and thoughts are dishonest Sycophantic and untrustworthy they flatter others with cunning words They slander the worthy and the virtuous incriminating them of wrongdoings Unwise rulers appoint deceitful and conniving ministers who size up the situations and implement their schemes Those in a shaky position are deceived by them Against the law of conscience they purposely slander the loyal and the upright Ministers deceive their kings children deceive their parents Likewise siblings spouses and close or casual friends deceive one another Afflicted with greed anger and delusion each desires to benefit himself Dignified or humble high or low people have the same mentality They disregard the consequences of their actions bringing about the destruction of their families and their own deaths Both close and distant relatives may be implicated and the entire clan may be annihilated Sometimes they engage in enterprises involving family friends villagers townsfolk fools and the uncivilized They exploit one another and their anger becomes a grudge The wealthy are miserly and refuse to give alms Greedy for and attached to riches they continue to fatigue their bodies and minds Yet at the end of their lives they have nothing to depend upon As they each have come alone they each will go alone and no one will accompany them Good or evil fortune or misfortune follows them as each begins the next lifejourney pleasant or painful Their remorse comes too late People of the world are stupid and unwise Instead of admiring the virtuous they hate and slander them They desire to do evil and willfully do unlawful deeds Thievery is in their minds as they covet others wealth Although they fear others detection of their evil motives they act without any foresight and regret after they are caught The world now has law and prison Evildoers are punished for their crimes In their present life they do evil Gods even record their names After death they go down the evil lifepaths Hence there naturally are the three evil lifejourneys with immeasurable suffering and distress While liberation is hard to achieve their pain is indescribable These are the second enormous evil the second pain and the second burn As one toils painfully it is like a huge fire burning ones body In its midst if one can control ones mind and harness ones body only to do good not evil one will achieve liberation acquire merit transcend the world and attain nirvāṇa People of the world who have limited lifespans depend upon one another and the environment as they live together between heaven and earth At the top are wise elders the dignified the noble and the wealthy At the bottom are the poor the lowly the vile and the foolish In the middle are the depraved who are evil and lustful Filled with chaotic loves and desires they are restless in their conduct They leer at objects of lust displaying their evil manners They detest their own wives and go out to seek adventures They squander family assets and perform unlawful deeds They band together and launch lawless warfare attacking killing and pillaging Their evil minds target external objects unconcerned about improving their karmas They obtain things by robbery or thievery To evade prosecution by law they give their loot to their wives They seek gratification in physical pleasure abusing even their own relatives People whether dignified or humble loathe them as they cause trouble and anguish to their families They do not fear the law or other prohibitions Touching humans and ghosts their evils are exposed under the sun and the moon and lodged in their  consciousnesses Hence there naturally are the three evil lifejourneys with immeasurable suffering and distress While liberation is hard to achieve their pain is indescribable These are the third enormous evil the third pain and the third burn As one toils painfully it is like a huge fire burning ones body In its midst if one can control ones mind and harness ones body only to do good not evil one will achieve liberation acquire merit transcend the world and attain nirvāṇa This is the third great virtue The Fourth Evil and the Fourth Virtue The Buddha said The fourth evil is this People of the world do not think of cultivating virtue Instead they teach one another to do evil With divisive speech abusive speech false speech and suggestive speech they dispute with and slander others They hate the virtuous and find pleasure in maligning the worthy They are neither dutiful nor respectful to their parents and they disdain their teachers and elders They betray their friends trust and find it hard to become honest Conceited and selfaggrandizing they claim that they are righteous Lacking selfknowledge they brutally assault and terrorize others Considering themselves tough they do evil shamelessly making it impossible to earn others respect They have no fear of the law between heaven and earth under the sun and the moon Unwilling to do good karmas they are hard to tame Obstinate and mentally blocked they claim that their ways can last With nothing to worry or fear they are arrogant All their evils are noted by gods They rely on the merit they acquired in their past lives and use their little virtue for protection and support Then in the present life they do evil and deplete their store of merits Benign spirits all leave them and they are left alone without any support After they die their evils spontaneously return to them and overpower them Because their evils are lodged in their  consciousnesses their horrible sins will drag them toward inescapable requitals They must move forward into a cauldron of fire When their bodies are consumed and their minds in agony their remorse at that moment comes too late Hence there naturally are the three evil lifejourneys with immeasurable suffering and distress While liberation is hard to achieve their pain is indescribable These are the fourth enormous evil the fourth pain and the fourth burn As one toils painfully it is like a huge fire burning ones body In its midst if one can control ones mind and harness ones body only to do good not evil one will achieve liberation acquire merit transcend the world and attain nirvāṇa This is the fourth great virtue The Fifth Evil and the Fifth Virtue The Buddha said The fifth evil is this People of the world wander in indolence and negligence They are unwilling to do good karmas harness their bodies and earn a livelihood though their families are in hardship hungry and cold When their parents instruct them they stare and respond in defiance and argue and contradict acting like enemies Parents are better off without such children They are takers who know no limit and people loathe them They take others kindness and friendship for granted and have no intention of reciprocating Unable to alter their poverty and hardship they resort to thievery and vagrancy and live on what is not earned They revel in drinking and debauchery eating and drinking without moderation Rude and aggressive they do not understand human rapport and willfully deny it When they see virtue in people they envy and hate them Without any scruples or manners they have no misgivings They do as they please beyond admonition They have no concern about the means of their six branches of family never thinking of the kindness of their parents and teachers or the fellowship of their friends Devoid of a single virtue their minds think evil their mouths speak evil and their bodies do evil They disbelieve the Dharma taught by Buddhas and holy ones They disbelieve that walking the Way leads to transcendence of the world that after ones death ones  consciousness heads for rebirth or that good karmas reap fortune and evil karmas reap misfortune They desire to kill the virtuous damage the Saṅgha and harm their parents siblings and dependents Their six branches of family are appalled by them wishing them dead Thus many people of the world have the same mentality Stupid and ignorant they think that they are wise They know neither whence they are born nor where they will go after death Coldhearted and rebellious they do evil between heaven and earth They hope to get lucky and live a long life but only end in death If someone kindly teaches them to think of virtue and explains to them the good and evil lifejourneys they refuse to believe him Painstaking advice cannot benefit them because their minds are entirely blocked and impossible to open Upon the ending of their life they are crushed by fear and remorse They refuse to cultivate virtue only to regret in the end What good is their remorse to their next life Between heaven and earth the five lifepaths are distinct extensive profound and vast Ones good and evil requitals manifested as fortune and misfortune respond without fail to ones good and evil karmas One must personally bear them and no one else can take ones place The karmic law responds to ones actions and requitals chase ones life never relenting While a virtuous person who does good karmas goes from pleasure to pleasure from light to light an evil person who does evil karmas goes from pain to pain from dark to dark Who besides a Buddha knows all this However few believe and carry out the teachings As ones cycle of birth and death and the evil lifejourneys are endless so too people of the world are endless Hence there naturally are the three evil lifejourneys with immeasurable suffering and distress While liberation is hard to achieve their pain is indescribable These are the fifth enormous evil the fifth pain and the fifth burn As one toils painfully it is like a huge fire burning ones body In its midst if one can control ones mind and harness ones body to think the right thoughts to act according to ones words with utmost sincerity to keep ones words in accord with ones mind and to do good not evil one will achieve liberation acquire merit transcend the world and attain nirvāṇa This is the fifth great virtue Another Solemn Admonition The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva As I say to you all people of the world toil painfully in the five evils As a result they suffer the five pains and in turn the five burns They do myriad evils but do not develop roots of goodness so they naturally go down the evil lifejourneys As witnessed by the multitudes some even in their present life suffer prolonged illness brought about by their sins and are unable either to die or to live Then after death they go down the three evil lifepaths to experience immeasurable horrendous suffering burning in fire These people bear each other grudges that begin small but after a long time grow into an enormous evil Because of their greed for wealth they cannot give alms Mired in delusion they can neither think straight nor liberate themselves from the bondage of afflictions They fight for selfbenefit never stopping to reflect As they seek fleeting pleasures in wealth and rank they can neither endure adversity nor cultivate virtue The little power they hold is soon spent Their longtime toil only leads to severe consequences The law of karma prevails and the net of requitals is accordingly spread From ancient times to the present there are such deplorable pains The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva All Buddhas are sad over the ways of the world With their awesome spiritual power they annihilate evils enabling people to drop their habitual thoughts uphold sūtras and precepts and practice the Dharma without misunderstandings or violations
