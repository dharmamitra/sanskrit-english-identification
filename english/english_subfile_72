or even a fortnight When a fortnight has passed we shall go forth Your destiny shall be ours
A fortnight is too long sirs I cannot wait that long
Who knows what will happen to the living
We are heading to the next life We must think about this and wake up We must do whats good and lead the spiritual life for noone born can escape death
As I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at home
I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Well then sir please wait for a week so that we can instruct our sons and brothers in kingship When a week has passed we shall go forth Your destiny shall be ours
A week is not too long sirs I will wait that long
Informing the Brahmins
Then the Great Steward also went to the seven welltodo brahmins and seven hundred bathed initiates and said
Sirs please now find another teacher to teach you to recite the hymns
I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness
As I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at home
I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Please dont go forth from the lay life to homelessness
The life of one gone forth is of little influence or profit
whereas the life of a brahmin is of great influence and profit
Please sirs dont say that
Who has greater influence and profit than myself
For now I am like a king to kings like Brahmā to brahmins like a deity to householders
Giving up all that I shall go forth
As I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at home
I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness
If the Steward is going forth from the lay life to homelessness we shall do so too Your destiny shall be ours
Informing the Wives
Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said
Ladies please do whatever you wish whether returning to your own families or finding another husband
I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness
As I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at home
I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness
You are the only family we want You are the only husband we want
If you are going forth from the lay life to homelessness we shall do so too Your destiny shall be ours
The Great Steward Goes Forth
When a week had passed the Great Steward shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness
And when he had gone forth the seven anointed aristocrat kings the seven brahmins with seven hundred initiates the forty equal wives and many thousands of aristocrats brahmins householders and many harem women shaved off their hair and beards dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness
Escorted by that assembly the Great Steward wandered on tour among the villages towns and capital cities
And at that time whenever he arrived at a village or town he was like a king to kings like Brahmā to brahmins like a deity to householders
And whenever people sneezed or tripped over
theyd say
Homage to the Great Steward Homage to the high priest for the seven
And the Great Steward meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion 
rejoicing 
equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
And he taught his disciples the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā
Those of his disciples who completely understood the Great Stewards instructions
at the breaking up of the body after death were reborn in the Brahmā realm
Of those disciples who only partly understood the Great Stewards instructions some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others
while some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create
or the Joyful Gods
or the Gods of Yama
or the Gods of the ThirtyThree
or the Gods of the Four Great Kings
And at the very least they swelled the hosts of the fairies
And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain was not wasted but was fruitful and fertile
Do you remember this Blessed One
I remember Pañcasikha
I myself was the brahmin Great Steward at that time
And I taught those disciples the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā
But that spiritual path of mine doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the Brahmā realm
But this spiritual path does lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
And what is the spiritual path that leads to extinguishment
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
This is the spiritual path that leads to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Those of my disciples who completely understand my instructions realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
Of those disciples who only partly understand my instructions some with the ending of the five lower fetters become reborn spontaneously They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that world
Some with the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion become oncereturners They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
And some with the ending of three fetters become streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain was not wasted but was fruitful and fertile
That is what the Buddha said
Delighted the fairy Pañcasikha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right there
Long Discourses
Advice to Sigālaka
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time the householders son Sigālaka rose early and left Rājagaha With his clothes and hair all wet he raised his joined palms to revere the quarters
east south west north below and above
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
He saw Sigālaka revering the quarters
and said to him
Householders son why are you revering the quarters in this way
Sir on his deathbed my father said to me
My dear please revere the quarters
Honoring respecting and venerating my fathers words I rose early and left Rājagaha and with my clothes and hair all wet raised my joined palms to revere the quarters
east south west north below and above
The Six Quarters
Householders son thats not how the six quarters should be revered in the training of the Noble One
But sir how should the six quarters be revered in the training of the Noble One
Sir please teach me this
Well then householders son listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Sigālaka
The Buddha said this
Householders son a noble disciple gives up four corrupt deeds doesnt do bad deeds on four grounds and avoids six drains on wealth When theyve left these fourteen bad things behind they have the six quarters covered
Theyre practicing to win in both worlds and they succeed in this world and the next
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Four Corrupt Deeds
What four corrupt deeds have they given up
Killing living creatures stealing sexual misconduct and lying these are corrupt deeds
These are the four corrupt deeds theyve given up
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
Killing stealing
telling lies
and committing adultery
astute people dont praise these things
Four Grounds
On what four grounds do they not do bad deeds
One does bad deeds prejudiced by favoritism hostility stupidity and cowardice
When a noble disciple is not prejudiced by favoritism hostility stupidity and cowardice
they dont do bad deeds on these four grounds
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
If you act against the teaching
out of favoritism hostility cowardice or stupidity
your fame shrinks
like the moon in the waning fortnight
If you dont act against the teaching
out of favoritism hostility cowardice and stupidity
your fame swells
like the moon in the waxing fortnight

Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
Some are just drinking buddies
some call you their dear dear friend
but a true friend is one
who stands by you in need
Sleeping late adultery
making enemies harmfulness
bad friends and avarice
these six grounds ruin a person
With bad friends bad companions
bad behavior and almsresort
a man falls to ruin
in both this world and the next
Dice women drink song and dance
sleeping by day and roaming at night
bad friends and avarice
these six grounds ruin a person
They play dice and drink liquor
and consort with women loved by others
Associating with the worse not the better
they diminish like the waning moon
A drunkard broke and destitute
thirsty drinking in the bar
drowning in debt
will quickly lose their way
When youre in the habit of sleeping late
seeing night as time to rise
and always getting drunk
you cant keep up the household life
Too cold too hot
too late they say
When the young neglect their work like this
riches pass them by
But one who considers heat and cold
as nothing more than blades of grass
he does his duties as a man
and happiness never fails
Fake Friends
Householders son you should recognize these four enemies disguised as friends
the taker the talker the flatterer the spender
You can recognize a fake friend whos all take on four grounds
Your possessions end up theirs
Giving little they expect a lot
They do their duty out of fear
They associate for their own advantage
You can recognize a fake friend whos all take on these four grounds
You can recognize a fake friend whos all talk on four grounds
Theyre hospitable in the past Theyre hospitable in the future Theyre full of meaningless pleasantries When something needs doing in the present they point to their own misfortune
You can recognize a fake friend whos all talk on these four grounds

You can recognize a fake friend whos a spender on four grounds
They accompany you when drinking roaming the streets at night frequenting festivals and gambling
You can recognize a fake friend whos a spender on these four grounds
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
One friend is all take
another all talk
ones just a flatterer
and ones a friend who spends
An astute person understands
these four enemies for what they are
and keeps them at a distance
as theyd shun a risky road
GoodHearted Friends
Householders son you should recognize these four goodhearted friends
the helper the friend in good times and bad the counselor and the one whos compassionate
You can recognize a goodhearted friend whos a helper on four grounds
They guard you when youre negligent They guard your property when youre negligent They keep you safe in times of danger When something needs doing they supply you with twice the money you need
You can recognize a goodhearted friend whos a helper on these four grounds
You can recognize a goodhearted friend whos the same in good times and bad on four grounds
They tell you secrets They keep your secrets They dont abandon you in times of trouble Theyd even give their life for your welfare

They dont delight in your misfortune They delight in your good fortune They keep others from criticizing you They encourage praise of you
You can recognize a goodhearted friend whos compassionate on these four grounds
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
A friend whos a helper
one the same in both pleasure and pain
a friend of good counsel
and one of compassion
an astute person understands
these four friends for what they are
and carefully looks after them
like a mother the child at her breast
The astute and virtuous
shine like a burning flame
They pick up riches as bees
roaming round pick up pollen
And their riches proceed to grow
like an anthill piling up
In gathering wealth like this
a householder does enough for their family
And theyd hold on to friends
by dividing their wealth in four
One portion is to enjoy
Two parts invest in work
And the fourth should be kept
for times of trouble
Covering the Six Quarters
And how householders son does a noble disciple cover the six quarters
These six quarters should be recognized
parents as the east teachers as the south partner and children as the west friends and colleagues as the north bondservants and workers as beneath and ascetics and brahmins as above
A child should serve their parents as the eastern quarter in five ways thinking
I will support those who supported me Ill do my duty for them Ill maintain the family traditions Ill take care of the inheritance When they have passed away Ill make an offering on their behalf
Parents served by the children in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways
They keep them from doing bad They support them in doing good They train them in a profession They connect them with a suitable partner They transfer the inheritance in due time
Parents served by their children in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways
And thats how the eastern quarter is covered kept safe and free of peril
A student should serve their teacher as the southern quarter in five ways
by rising for them by serving them by listening well by looking after them and by carefully learning their profession
Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways
They make sure theyre well trained and well educated They clearly explain all the knowledge of the profession They introduce them to their friends and colleagues They provide protection in every region
Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways
And thats how the southern quarter is covered kept safe and free of peril
A husband should serve his wife as the western quarter in five ways
by treating her with honor by not looking down on her by not being unfaithful by relinquishing authority to her and by presenting her with adornments
A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in five ways
Shes wellorganized in her work She manages the domestic help Shes not unfaithful She preserves his earnings Shes deft and tireless in all her duties
A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in these five ways
And thats how the western quarter is covered kept safe and free of peril
A gentleman should serve his friends and colleagues as the northern quarter in five ways
giving kindly words taking care equality and not using tricky words
Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in five ways
They guard him when theyre negligent They guard his property when theyre negligent They keep him safe in times of danger They dont abandon him in times of trouble They honor his descendants
Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in these five ways
And thats how the northern quarter is covered kept safe and free of peril
A master should serve their bondservants and workers as the lower quarter in five ways
by organizing work according to ability by paying food and wages by nursing them when sick by sharing special treats and by giving time off work
Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to him in five ways
They get up first and go to bed last They dont steal They do their work well And they promote a good reputation
Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to him in these five ways
And thats how the lower quarter is covered kept safe and free of peril
A gentleman should serve ascetics and brahmins as the upper quarter in five ways
by loving deeds of body speech and mind by not turning them away at the gate and by providing them with material needs
Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in five ways
They keep him from doing bad They support him in doing good They think of him with kindly thoughts They teach him what he does not know They clarify what hes already learned They explain the path to heaven
Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in these five ways
And thats how the upper quarter is covered kept safe and free of peril
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
Parents are the east
teachers the south
wives and child the west
friends and colleagues the north
servants and workers below
and ascetics and brahmins above
By honoring these quarters
a householder does enough for their family
The astute and the virtuous
the gentle and the articulate
the humble and the kind
theyre the kind who win glory
The diligent not lazy
those not disturbed by troubles
those consistent in conduct the intelligent
theyre the kind who win glory
The inclusive the makers of friends
the kind those rid of stinginess
those who lead train and persuade
theyre the kind who win glory
Giving and kindly words
taking care here
and treating equally in worldly conditions
as befits them in each case
these ways of being inclusive in the world
are like a moving chariots linchpin
If there were no such ways of being inclusive
neither mother nor father
would be respected and honored
for what theyve done for their children
But since these ways of being inclusive do exist
the astute do regard them well
so they achieve greatness
and are praised
When this was said Sigālaka the householders son said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Long Discourses
The Fruits of the Ascetic Life
A Discussion With the Kings Ministers
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicants
Now at that time it was the sabbaththe Komudi full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth monthand King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministers
Then Ajātasattu expressed this heartfelt sentiment
Oh sirs this moonlit night is so very delightful so beautiful so glorious so lovely so striking
Now what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today paying homage to whom my mind might find peace
When he had spoken one of the kings ministers said to him
Sire Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many people He is of long standing long gone forth he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace
But when he had spoken the king kept silent
Another of the kings ministers said to him
Sire Makkhali Gosāla leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many people He is of long standing long gone forth he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace
But when he had spoken the king kept silent
Another of the kings ministers said to him
Sire Ajita Kesakambala leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many people He is of long standing long gone forth he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace
But when he had spoken the king kept silent
Another of the kings ministers said to him
Sire Pakudha Kaccāyana leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many people He is of long standing long gone forth he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace
But when he had spoken the king kept silent
Another of the kings ministers said to him
Sire Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many people He is of long standing long gone forth he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace
But when he had spoken the king kept silent
Another of the kings ministers said to him
Sire Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta leads an order and a community and teaches a community Hes a wellknown and famous religious founder regarded as holy by many people He is of long standing long gone forth he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace
But when he had spoken the king kept silent
A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca
Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king
Then the king said to him
But my dear Jīvaka why are you silent
Sire the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
Let Your Majesty pay homage to him
Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace
Well then my dear Jīvaka have the elephants readied
Yes Your Majesty replied Jīvaka He had around five hundred female elephants readied in addition to the kings bull elephant for riding Then he informed the king
The elephants are ready sire
Please go at your convenience
Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants while he mounted his bull elephant With attendants carrying torches he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvakas mango grove
But as he drew near the mango grove the king became frightened scared his hair standing on end
He said to Jīvaka
My dear Jīvaka I hope youre not deceiving me
I hope youre not betraying me
I hope youre not turning me over to my enemies
For how on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of  mendicants
Do not fear great king do not fear
I am not deceiving you
or betraying you
or turning you over to your enemies
Go forward great king go forward Those are lamps shining in the pavilion
The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life
Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot where he asked Jīvaka
But my dear Jīvaka where is the Buddha
That is the Buddha great king that is the Buddha
Hes sitting against the central column facing east in front of the Saṅgha of mendicants
Then the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one side
He looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent like a still clear lake and expressed this heartfelt sentiment
May my son Prince Udāyibhadda be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys
Has your mind gone to one you love great king
I love my son sir Prince Udāyibhadda
May he be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys
Then the king bowed to the Buddha raised his joined palms toward the Saṅgha and sat down to one side
He said to the Buddha
Sir Id like to ask you about a certain point if youd take the time to answer
Ask what you wish great king
Sir there are many different professional fields
These include elephant riders cavalry charioteers archers bannermen adjutants food servers warriorchiefs princes chargers great warriors heroes leatherclad soldiers and sons of bondservants
They also include bakers barbers bathroom attendants cooks garlandmakers dyers weavers basketmakers potters accountants fingertalliers or those following any similar professions All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present life
With that they bring happiness and joy to themselves their parents their children and partners and their friends and colleagues And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heaven
Sir can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life thats likewise apparent in the present life
Great king do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins
I do sir
If you wouldnt mind great king tell me how they answered
Its no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here
Well speak then great king
The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa
One time sir I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same question
He said to me
Great king the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish mutilate torture aggrieve oppress intimidate or when they encourage others to do the same
They do nothing wrong when they kill steal break into houses plunder wealth steal from isolated buildings commit highway robbery commit adultery and lie If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razoredged chakram no evil comes of that and no outcome of evil
If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing mutilating and torturing and encouraging others to do the same no evil comes of that and no outcome of evil
If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same no merit comes of that and no outcome of merit
In giving selfcontrol restraint and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit
And so when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the doctrine of inaction
It was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mango
I thought
How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa
I was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and left
The Doctrine of Makkhali Gosāla
One time sir I approached Makkhali Gosāla and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same question
Great king there is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or condition
Theres no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings
Sentient beings are purified without cause or condition
One does not act of ones own volition one does not act of anothers volition one does not act from a persons volition There is no power no energy no human strength or vigor
All sentient beings all living creatures all beings all souls lack control power and energy Molded by destiny circumstance and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth
There are  million main wombs and  and  There are  deeds and five and three There are deeds and halfdeeds There are  paths  subeons six classes of rebirth and eight stages in a persons life There are  jīvaka ascetics  wanderers and  naked ascetics There are  faculties  hells and  realms of dust There are seven percipient embryos seven nonpercipient embryos and seven embryos without attachments There are seven gods seven humans and seven goblins There are seven lakes seven winds  winds seven cliffs and  cliffs There are seven dreams and  dreams There are  million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering
And here there is no such thing as this By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little for that cannot be
Pleasure and pain are allotted Transmigration lasts only for a limited period so theres no increase or decrease no getting better or worse
Its like how when you toss a ball of string it rolls away unraveling
In the same way after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering
And so when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration
It was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mango
I thought
How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Makkhali Gosāla
I was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and left
The Doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala
One time sir I approached Ajita Kesakambala and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same question
Great king there is no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
This person is made up of the four primary elements When they die the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air The faculties are transferred to space
Four men with a bier carry away the corpse
Their footprints show the way to the cemetery
The bones become bleached Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes
Giving is a doctrine of morons
When anyone affirms a positive teaching its just hollow false nonsense
Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and dont exist after death
And so when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the doctrine of annihilationism
It was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mango
I thought
How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Ajita Kesakambala
I was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and left
The Doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana
One time sir I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same question
Great king these seven substances are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
They dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each other
What seven
The substances of earth water fire air pleasure pain and the soul is the seventh
These seven substances are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
They dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each other
And here there is noone who kills or who makes others kill noone who learns or who educates others noone who understands or who helps others understand
If you chop off someones head with a sharp sword you dont take anyones life
The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances
And so when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with something else entirely
It was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mango
I thought
How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana
I was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and left
The Doctrine of Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
One time sir I approached Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same question
Great king consider a Jain ascetic who is restrained in the fourfold restraint
And how is a Jain ascetic restrained in the fourfold restraint
Its when a Jain ascetic is obstructed by all water devoted to all water shaking off all water pervaded by all water
Thats how a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraint
When a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraint
theyre called a knotless one who is selfrealized selfcontrolled and steadfast
And so when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the fourfold restraint
It was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mango
I thought
How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta
I was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and left
The Doctrine of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta
One time sir I approached Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same question
Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world If I believed there was I would say so
But I dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not so
Suppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world 
whether there both is and is not another world 
whether there neither is nor is not another world 
whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously 
whether there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously 
whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously 
whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously 
whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds 
whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds 
whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds 
whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds 
whether a Realized One exists after death 
whether a Realized One doesnt exist after death 
whether a Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death 
whether a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death If I believed there was I would say so
But I dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not so
And so when I asked Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with evasiveness
It was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mango
I thought
This is the most foolish and stupid of all these ascetics and brahmins
How on earth can he answer with evasiveness when asked about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life
I thought
How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm
So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta
I was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and left
The Fruits of the Ascetic Life
The First Fruit of the Ascetic Life
And so I ask the Buddha
Sir there are many different professional fields
These include elephant riders cavalry charioteers archers bannermen adjutants food servers warriorchiefs princes chargers great warriors heroes leatherclad soldiers and sons of bondservants
They also include bakers barbers bathroom attendants cooks garlandmakers dyers weavers basketmakers potters accountants fingertalliers or those following any similar professions All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present life
With that they bring happiness and joy to themselves their parents their children and partners and their friends and colleagues And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heaven
Sir can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life thats likewise apparent in the present life
I can great king
Well then Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think great king
Suppose you had a person who was a bondservant a worker They get up before you and go to bed after you and are obliging behaving nicely and speaking politely and gazing up at your face
Theyd think
The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible so amazing
For this King Ajātasattu is a human being and so am I
Yet he amuses himself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god
Whereas Im his bondservant his worker I get up before him and go to bed after him and am obliging behaving nicely and speaking politely and gazing up at his face
I should do good deeds
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time that is what they do
Having gone forth theyd live restrained in body speech and mind living content with nothing more than food and clothes delighting in seclusion
And suppose your men were to report all this to you
Would you say to them
Bring that person to me Let them once more be my bondservant my worker
Rather I would bow to them rise in their presence and offer them a seat Id invite them to accept robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick And Id organize their lawful guarding and protection
What do you think great king
If this is so is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not
Clearly sir there is
This is the first fruit of the ascetic life thats apparent in the present life which I point out to you
The Second Fruit of the Ascetic Life
But sir can you point out another fruit of the ascetic life thats likewise apparent in the present life
I can great king
Well then Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think great king
Suppose you had a person who was a farmer a householder a hard worker someone who builds up their capital
Theyd think
The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible so amazing
For this King Ajātasattu is a human being and so am I
Yet he amuses himself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god
Whereas Im a farmer a householder a hard worker someone who builds up their capital
I should do good deeds
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle Theyd shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Having gone forth theyd live restrained in body speech and mind living content with nothing more than food and clothes delighting in seclusion
And suppose your men were to report all this to you
Would you say to them
Bring that person to me Let them once more be a farmer a householder a hard worker someone who builds up their capital
Rather I would bow to them rise in their presence and offer them a seat Id invite them to accept robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick And Id organize their lawful guarding and protection
What do you think great king
If this is so is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not
Clearly sir there is
This is the second fruit of the ascetic life thats apparent in the present life which I point out to you
The Finer Fruits of the Ascetic Life
But sir can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life thats apparent in the present life which is better and finer than these
I can great king
Well then listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied the king
The Buddha said this
Consider when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clan
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once theyve gone forth they live restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken They act skillfully by body and speech Theyre purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct They guard the sense doors have mindfulness and situational awareness and are content

Immersion
Sense Restraint
And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors

Giving Up the Hindrances

Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work
and his efforts proved successful

But after some time they crossed over the desert safely reaching the neighborhood of a village a sanctuary free of peril
Thinking about this
theyd be filled with joy and happiness
In the same way as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves a mendicant regards them thus as a debt a disease a prison slavery and a desert crossing
But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt good health release from prison emancipation and sanctuary
Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersed

When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they acted out of that wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they acted out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
Suppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central square
A person with good eyesight standing there might see people entering and leaving a house walking along the streets and paths and sitting at the central square
Theyd think
These are people entering and leaving a house walking along the streets and paths and sitting at the central square
In the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
This too great king is a fruit of the ascetic life thats apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones
Ending of Defilements
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent clear and unclouded
A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying still
Theyd think
This lake is transparent clear and unclouded
And here are the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying still
In the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
This too great king is a fruit of the ascetic life thats apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones
And great king there is no other fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life which is better and finer than this
Ajātasattu Declares Himself a Lay Follower
When the Buddha had spoken King Ajātasattu said to him
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
I have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me to take the life of my father a just and principled king for the sake of authority
Please sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in future
Indeed great king you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you to take the life of your father a just and principled king for the sake of sovereignty
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly I accept it
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is deal with it properly and commit to restraint in the future
When the Buddha had spoken King Ajātasattu said to him
Well now sir I must go I have many duties and much to do
Please great king go at your convenience
Then the king having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled him keeping him on his right before leaving
Soon after the king had left the Buddha addressed the mendicants
The king is broken mendicants
he is ruined
If he had not taken the life of his father a just and principled king the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma would have arisen in him in that very seat
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
The Longer Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
What four
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelingskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of the mindkeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Observing the Body
Mindfulness of Breathing
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body

Just mindful they breathe in Mindful they breathe out
When breathing in heavily they know Im breathing in heavily When breathing out heavily they know Im breathing out heavily
When breathing in lightly they know Im breathing in lightly When breathing out lightly they know Im breathing out lightly
They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body
They practice breathing in stilling the bodys motion They practice breathing out stilling the bodys motion
Its like a deft carpenter or carpenters apprentice When making a deep cut they know Im making a deep cut and when making a shallow cut they know Im making a shallow cut
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally externally and both internally and externally
They meditate observing the body as liable to originate as liable to vanish and as liable to both originate and vanish
Or mindfulness is established that the body exists to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness They meditate independent not grasping at anything in the world
Thats how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body

In this body there is head hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urine
Its as if there were a bag with openings at both ends filled with various kinds of grains such as fine rice wheat mung beans peas sesame and ordinary rice
And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents
These grains are fine rice these are wheat these are mung beans these are peas these are sesame and these are ordinary rice

A skeleton rid of flesh and blood held together by sinews 
Bones without sinews scattered in every direction Here a handbone there a footbone here a shinbone there a thighbone here a hipbone there a ribbone here a backbone there an armbone here a neckbone there a jawbone here a tooth there the skull 
White bones the color of shells 
Decrepit bones heaped in a pile

As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
Giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
This is called right immersion
This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally externally and both internally and externally
They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate as liable to vanish and as liable to both originate and vanish
Or mindfulness is established that principles exist to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness They meditate independent not grasping at anything in the world
Thats how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths
Anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven years can expect one of two results

enlightenment in the present life or if theres something left over nonreturn
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
With Poṭṭhapāda
On the Wanderer Poṭṭhapāda
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikās singlehalled monastery for group debates set among the flaking palemoon ebony trees
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī
Why dont I go to Mallikās monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda
So thats what he did
Now at that time Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such as
talk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence
Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and hushed his own assembly
Be quiet good sirs dont make a sound
Here comes the ascetic Gotama
The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approach
Then those wanderers fell silent
Then the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapāda
who said to him
Come Blessed One
Welcome Blessed One
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
Please sir sit down this seat is ready
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
while Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one side
The Buddha said to him
Poṭṭhapāda what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinished
On the Cessation of Perception
When he said this the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha
Sir leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now
It wont be hard for you to hear about that later
Sir a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths were sitting together at the debating hall and this discussion came up among them
How does the cessation of perception happen
Some of them said
A persons perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason
When they arise you become percipient
When they cease you become nonpercipient
Thats how some describe the cessation of perception
But someone else says
Thats not how it is gentlemen 
Perception is a persons self
When it enters you become percipient
When it departs you become nonpercipient
Thats how some describe the cessation of perception
But someone else says
Thats not how it is gentlemen 
There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might
They insert and extract a persons perception
When they insert it you become percipient
When they extract it you become nonpercipient
Thats how some describe the cessation of perception
But someone else says
Thats not how it is gentlemen 
There are deities of great power and might
They insert and extract a persons perception
When they insert it you become percipient
When they extract it you become nonpercipient
Thats how some describe the cessation of perception
That reminded me of the Buddha
Surely it must be the Blessed One the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters
The Buddha is skilled and wellversed in the cessation of perception
How does the cessation of perception happen
Perception Arises With a Cause
Regarding this Poṭṭhapāda those ascetics and brahmins who say that
a persons perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start
Why is that
Because a persons perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason
With training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And what is that training said the Buddha
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha 
Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics 
Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersed
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
The sensual perception that they had previously ceases
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion
Thats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And this is that training said the Buddha
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion that they had previously ceases
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion
Thats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And this is that training said the Buddha
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion that they had previously ceases
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss
Thats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And this is that training said the Buddha
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
The subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss that they had previously ceases
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of neutral feeling
Thats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And this is that training said the Buddha
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space
The perception of luminous form that they had previously ceases
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space
Thats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And this is that training said the Buddha
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness
The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space that they had previously ceases
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness
Thats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And this is that training said the Buddha
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness that they had previously ceases
At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of nothingness
Thats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease
And this is that training said the Buddha
Poṭṭhapāda from the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception they proceed from one stage to the next gradually reaching the peak of perception
Standing on the peak of perception they think
Intentionality is bad for me its better to be free of it
For if I were to intend and choose these perceptions would cease in me and other coarser perceptions would arise
Why dont I neither make a choice nor form an intention
They neither make a choice nor form an intention
Those perceptions cease in them and other coarser perceptions dont arise
They touch cessation
And that Poṭṭhapāda is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda
Have you ever heard of this before
This is how I understand what the Buddha said
From the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception they proceed from one stage to the next gradually reaching the peak of perception
Standing on the peak of perception they think
Intentionality is bad for me its better to be free of it
For if I were to intend and choose these perceptions would cease in me and other coarser perceptions would arise
Why dont I neither make a choice nor form an intention
Those perceptions cease in them and other coarser perceptions dont arise
They touch cessation
And that is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness
Thats right Poṭṭhapāda
Does the Buddha describe just one peak of perception or many
I describe the peak of perception as both one and many
But sir how do you describe it as one peak and as many
I describe the peak of perception according to the specific manner in which one touches cessation
Thats how I describe the peak of perception as both one and many
But sir does perception arise first and knowledge afterwards Or does knowledge arise first and perception afterwards Or do they both arise at the same time
Perception arises first and knowledge afterwards The arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge
They understand
My knowledge arose from a specific condition
That is a way to understand how
perception arises first and knowledge afterwards that the arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge
Perception and the Self
Sir is perception a persons self or are perception and self different things
But Poṭṭhapāda do you believe in a self
I believe in a substantial self sir which is physical made up of the four primary elements and consumes solid food
Suppose there were such a substantial self Poṭṭhapāda
In that case perception would be one thing the self another
Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things
So long as that substantial self remains still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease
That is a way to understand how perception and self are different things
Sir I believe in a mindmade self which is complete in all its various parts not deficient in any faculty
Suppose there were such a mindmade self Poṭṭhapāda In that case perception would be one thing the self another
Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things
So long as that mindmade self remains still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease
That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things
Sir I believe in a nonphysical self which is made of perception
Suppose there were such a nonphysical self Poṭṭhapāda In that case perception would be one thing the self another
Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things
So long as that nonphysical self remains still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease
That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things
But sir am I able to know whether
perception is a persons self or whether perception and self are different things
Its hard for you to understand this since you have a different view creed preference practice and tradition
Well if thats the case sir
then is this right The cosmos is eternal This is the only truth anything else is wrong
This has not been declared by me Poṭṭhapāda
Then is this right The cosmos is not eternal This is the only truth anything else is wrong
This too has not been declared by me
Then is this right The cosmos is finite  
The cosmos is infinite  
The soul and the body are the same thing  
The soul and the body are different things  
A Realized One exists after death  
A Realized One doesnt exist after death  
A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death  
A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death This is the only truth anything else is wrong
This too has not been declared by me
Why havent these things been declared by the Buddha
Because theyre not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why I havent declared them
Then what has been declared by the Buddha
I have declared this This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
Why have these things been declared by the Buddha
Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why I have declared them
Thats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy One
Please sir go at your convenience
Then the Buddha got up from his seat and left
Soon after the Buddha left those wanderers gave Poṭṭhapāda a comprehensive tonguelashing
No matter what the ascetic Gotama says Poṭṭhapāda agrees with him
Thats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy One
We understand that the ascetic Gotama didnt make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on
When they said this Poṭṭhapāda said to them
I too understand that the ascetic Gotama didnt make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on
Nevertheless the practice that he describes is true real and accurate It is the regularity of natural principles the invariance of natural principles
So how could a sensible person such as I not agree that what was well spoken by the ascetic Gotama was in fact well spoken
On Citta Hatthisāriputta
Then after two or three days had passed Citta Hatthisāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda went to see the Buddha Citta Hatthisāriputta bowed and sat down to one side
But the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda exchanged greetings with the Buddha and when the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Poṭṭhapāda told the Buddha what had happened after he left The Buddha said
All those wanderers Poṭṭhapāda are blind and sightless
You are the only one who sees
For I have taught and pointed out both things that are definitive
and things that are not definitive
And what things have I taught and pointed out that are not definitive
The cosmos is eternal 
The cosmos is not eternal 
The cosmos is finite 
The cosmos is infinite 
The soul is the same thing as the body 
The soul and the body are different things 
A Realized One exists after death 
A Realized One doesnt exist after death 
A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death 
A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death
And why havent I taught and pointed out such things that are not definitive
Because those things arent beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why I havent taught and pointed them out
Things That Are Definitive
And what things have I taught and pointed out that are definitive
This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
And why have I taught and pointed out such things that are definitive
Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why I have taught and pointed them out
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
The self is exclusively happy and is sound after death
I go up to them and say
Is it really true that this is the venerables view
And they answer Yes
I say to them
But do you meditate knowing and seeing an exclusively happy world
Asked this they say No
I say to them
But have you perceived an exclusively happy self for a single day or night or even half a day or night
Asked this they say No
I say to them
But do you know
a path and a practice to realize an exclusively happy world
Asked this they say No
I say to them
But have you ever heard the voice of the deities reborn in an exclusively happy world saying
Practice well dear sirs practice directly so as to realize an exclusively happy world
For this is how we practiced and we were reborn in an exclusively happy world
Asked this they say No
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda
This being so doesnt what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
Suppose Poṭṭhapāda a man were to say
Whoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her that I desire
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whether shes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a worker
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes from
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seen
Asked this hed say Yes
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda
This being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
In the same way the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views 
Doesnt what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
Suppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouse
Theyd say to him
Mister that stilt longhouse that youre building a ladder fordo you know whether its to the north south east or west Or whether its tall or short or medium
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister are you building a ladder for a longhouse that youve never even known or seen
Asked this hed say Yes
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda
This being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
In the same way the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views 
Doesnt what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
Three Kinds of Reincarnation
Poṭṭhapāda there are these three kinds of reincarnation
a substantial reincarnation a mindmade reincarnation and a nonphysical reincarnation
And what is a substantial reincarnation
It is physical made up of the four primary elements and consumes solid food
What is a mindmade reincarnation
It is physical mindmade complete in all its various parts not deficient in any faculty
What is a nonphysical reincarnation
It is nonphysical made of perception
I teach the Dhamma for the giving up of these three kinds of reincarnation
When you practice accordingly corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow Youll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom having realized it with your own insight in this very life
Poṭṭhapāda you might think
Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom having realized it with ones own insight in this very life But such a life is suffering
But you should not see it like this
Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom having realized it with ones own insight in this very life And there will be only joy and happiness tranquility mindfulness and awareness Such a life is blissful
If others should ask us
But reverends what is that substantial reincarnation Wed answer like this
This is that substantial reincarnation
If others should ask us
But reverends what is that mindmade reincarnation Wed answer like this
This is that mindmade reincarnation
If others should ask us
But reverends what is that nonphysical reincarnation Wed answer like this
This is that nonphysical reincarnation
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda
This being so doesnt that statement turn out to have a demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
Suppose a man were to build a ladder for climbing up to a stilt longhouse right underneath that longhouse
Theyd say to him
Mister that stilt longhouse that youre building a ladder fordo you know whether its to the north south east or west Or whether its tall or short or medium
This is that stilt longhouse for which Im building a ladder right underneath it
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda
This being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have a demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
When the Buddha had spoken Citta Hatthisāriputta said
Sir while in a substantial reincarnation are the mindmade and nonphysical reincarnations fictitious
and only the substantial reincarnation real
While in a mindmade reincarnation are the substantial and nonphysical reincarnations fictitious
and only the mindmade reincarnation real
While in a nonphysical reincarnation are the substantial and mindmade reincarnations fictitious
and only the nonphysical reincarnation real
While in a substantial reincarnation its not referred to as a mindmade or nonphysical reincarnation
only as a substantial reincarnation
While in a mindmade reincarnation its not referred to as a substantial or nonphysical reincarnation
only as a mindmade reincarnation
While in a nonphysical reincarnation its not referred to as a substantial or mindmade reincarnation
only as a nonphysical reincarnation
Citta suppose they were to ask you
Did you exist in the past
Will you exist in the future
Do you exist now
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
Id answer like this
I existed in the past
I will exist in the future
I exist now
Thats how Id answer
But Citta suppose they were to ask you
Is the reincarnation you had in the past your only real one and those of the future and present fictitious
Is the reincarnation you will have in the future your only real one and those of the past and present fictitious
Is the reincarnation you have now your only real one and those of the past and future fictitious
How would you answer
Sir if they were to ask me this
Id answer like this
The reincarnation I had in the past was real at that time and those of the future and present fictitious
The reincarnation I will have in the future will be real at the time and those of the past and present fictitious
The reincarnation I have now is real at this time and those of the past and future fictitious
Thats how Id answer
In the same way while in any one of the three reincarnations its not referred to as the other two only under its own name
From a cow comes milk from milk comes curds from curds come butter from butter comes ghee and from ghee comes cream of ghee And the cream of ghee is said to be the best of these
While its milk its not referred to as curds butter ghee or cream of ghee
Its only referred to as milk
While its curd
or cream of ghee its not referred to as anything else
only under its own name
In the same way while in any one of the three reincarnations its not referred to as the other two only under its own name
These are the worlds usages terms expressions and descriptions which the Realized One uses without misapprehending them
When he had spoken the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
The Ordination of Citta Hatthisāriputta
But Citta Hatthisāriputta said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
And Citta Hatthisāriputta received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected
Long Discourses
The Three Knowledges
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Manasākaṭa
He stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa
Now at that time several very wellknown welltodo brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa They included
the brahmins Caṅkī Tārukkha Pokkharasāti Jāṇussoṇi Todeyya and others
Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding the variety of paths
Vāseṭṭha said this
This is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā namely that explained by the brahmin Pokkharasāti
Bhāradvāja said this
This is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā namely that explained by the brahmin Tārukkha
But neither was able to persuade the other
So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja
Bhāradvāja the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
Come lets go to see him and ask him about this matter
As he answers so well remember it
Yes sir replied Bhāradvāja
The Variety of Paths
So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation adding
In this matter we have a dispute a disagreement a difference of opinion
So Vāseṭṭha it seems that you say that
the straight path is that explained by Pokkharasāti
while Bhāradvāja says that
the straight path is that explained by Tārukkha
But what exactly is your disagreement about
About the variety of paths Master Gotama
Even though brahmins describe different pathsthe Addhariya brahmins the Tittiriya brahmins the Chandoka brahmins and the Bavhadija brahminsall of them lead someone who practices them to the company of Brahmā
Its like a village or town that has many different roads nearby yet all of them meet at that village
In the same way even though brahmins describe different pathsthe Addhariya brahmins the Tittiriya brahmins the Chandoka brahmins and the Bavhadija brahminsall of them lead someone who practices them to the company of Brahmā
Questioning Vāseṭṭha
Do you say they lead someone Vāseṭṭha
I do Master Gotama
Do you say they lead someone Vāseṭṭha
I do Master Gotama
Do you say they lead someone Vāseṭṭha
I do Master Gotama
Well of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas Vāseṭṭha is there even a single one who has seen Brahmā with their own eyes
No Master Gotama
Well has even a single one of their teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes
No Master Gotama
Well has even a single one of their teachers teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes
No Master Gotama
Well has anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes
No Master Gotama
Well what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins namely Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught
Did they say
We know and see where Brahmā is or what way he lies
No Master Gotama
So it seems that none of the brahmins have seen Brahmā with their own eyes
and not even the ancient hermits
claimed to know where he is
Yet the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas say
We teach the path to the company of that which we neither know nor see
This is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
This being so doesnt their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha
For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see
Suppose there was a queue of blind men each holding the one in front the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
In the same way it seems to me that the brahmins statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
Their statement turns out to be a jokemere words void and hollow
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Do the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do And do they pray to them and beseech them following their course from where they rise to where they set with joined palms held in worship
Yes Master Gotama
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Though this is so are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon saying
This is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of the sun and moon
No Master Gotama
So it seems that even though the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon they are not able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon
But it seems that even though they have not seen Brahmā with their own eyes
they still claim
to teach the path to the company of that which they neither know nor see
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
This being so doesnt their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see
The Simile of the Finest Lady in the Land
Suppose a man were to say
Whoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her that I desire
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whether
shes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a worker
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes from
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seen
Asked this hed say Yes
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
This being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
In the same way
doesnt the statement of those brahmins turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see
The Simile of the Ladder
Suppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouse
Theyd say to him
Mister that stilt longhouse that youre building a ladder fordo you know whether its to the north south east or west Or whether its tall or short or medium
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister are you building a ladder for a longhouse that youve never even known or seen
Asked this hed say Yes
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
This being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
In the same way
doesnt the statement of those brahmins turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha
For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see
The Simile of the River Aciravatī
Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore
Standing on the near shore theyd call out to the far shore
Come here far shore Come here far shore
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Would the far shore of the Aciravatī river come over to the near shore because of that mans call request desire or expectation
No Master Gotama
In the same way Vāseṭṭha the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas proceed having given up those things that make one a true brahmin and having undertaken those things that make one not a true brahmin Yet they say
We call upon Indra We call upon Soma We call upon sāna We call upon Pajāpati We call upon Brahmā We call upon Mahiddhi We call upon Yama
So long as they proceed in this way its impossible that they will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā
Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore
But while still on the near shore their arms are tied tightly behind their back with a strong chain
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Could that person cross over to the far shore
No Master Gotama
In the same way the five kinds of sensual stimulation are called chains and fetters in the training of the Noble One
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation that are called chains and fetters in the training of the Noble One
The brahmins proficient in the three Vedas enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escape
So long as they enjoy them its impossible that they will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā
Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore
But theyd lie down wrapped in cloth from head to foot
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Could that person cross over to the far shore
No Master Gotama
In the same way the five hindrances are called obstacles and hindrances and coverings and shrouds in the training of the Noble One
What five
The hindrances of sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubt
These five hindrances are called obstacles and hindrances and coverings and shrouds in the training of the Noble One
The brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are hindered obstructed covered and shrouded by these five hindrances
So long as they are so obstructed its impossible that they will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā
Converging
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Have you heard that the brahmins who are elderly and senior the teachers of teachers say whether Brahmā is possessive or not
That he is not Master Gotama
Is his heart full of enmity or not
It is not
Is his heart full of ill will or not
It is not
Is his heart corrupted or not
It is not
Does he wield power or not
He does
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas possessive or not
They are
Are their hearts full of enmity or not
They are
Are their hearts full of ill will or not
They are
Are their hearts corrupted or not
They are
Do they wield power or not
They do not
So it seems that the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are possessive but Brahmā is not
But would brahmins who are possessive come together and converge with Brahmā who isnt possessive
No Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha Its impossible that the brahmins who are possessive will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā who isnt possessive
And it seems that the brahmins have enmity
corruption
and do not wield power while Brahmā is the opposite in all these things But would brahmins who are opposite to Brahmā in all things come together and converge with him
No Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha Its impossible that such brahmins will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā
But here the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas sink down where they have sat only to be torn apart all the while imagining that theyre crossing over to drier ground
Thats why the three Vedas of the brahmins are called a salted land and a barren land and a disaster
When he said this Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha
I have heard Master Gotama that you know the path to company with Brahmā
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Is the village of Manasākaṭa nearby
Yes it is
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
Suppose a person was born and raised in Manasākaṭa
And as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to Manasākaṭa
Would they be slow or hesitant to answer
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because they were born and raised in Manasākaṭa Theyre well acquainted with all the roads to the village
Still its possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the Brahmā realm or the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm
I understand Brahmā the Brahmā realm and the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the Brahmā realm
When he said this Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha
I have heard Master Gotama that you teach the path to company with Brahmā
Please teach us that path and elevate this generation of brahmins
Well then Vāseṭṭha listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Vāseṭṭha
Teaching the Path to Brahmā
The Buddha said this
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha 
Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics 
Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersed
They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directions
In the same way when the hearts release by love has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist there
This is a path to companionship with Brahmā
Furthermore a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directions
In the same way when the hearts release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist there
This too is a path to companionship with Brahmā
What do you think Vāseṭṭha
When a mendicant meditates like this are they possessive or not
They are not
Is their heart full of enmity or not
It is not
Is their heart full of ill will or not
It is not
Is their heart corrupted or not
It is not
Do they wield power or not
They do
So it seems that that mendicant is not possessive and neither is Brahmā
Would a mendicant who is not possessive come together and converge with Brahmā who isnt possessive
Yes Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha Its possible that a mendicant who is not possessive will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā who isnt possessive
And it seems that that mendicant has no enmity
corruption
and does wield power while Brahmā is the same in all these things Would a mendicant who is the same as Brahmā in all things come together and converge with him
Yes Master Gotama
Good Vāseṭṭha Its possible that that mendicant will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā
When he had spoken Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
We go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life

Long Discourses
Reciting in Concert
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Mallian town named Pāvā
There he stayed in Cunda the smiths mango grove
Now at that time a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka had recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all
The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Cundas mango grove
Then they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka has recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all
May the Buddha be the first to use it and only then will the Mallas of Pāvā use it
That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā
The Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented the Mallas got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right Then they went to the new town hall where they spread carpets all over prepared seats set up a water jar and placed a lamp Then they went back to the Buddha
bowed stood to one side
and told him of their preparations saying
Please sir come at your convenience
Then the Buddha robed up and taking his bowl and robe went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east
The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the west wall facing east with the Buddha right in front of them
The Mallas of Pāvā also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the east wall facing west with the Buddha right in front of them
The Buddha spent most of the night educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the Mallas with a Dhamma talk Then he dismissed them
The night is getting late Vāseṭṭhas
Please go at your convenience
Yes sir replied the Mallas They got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right before leaving
Soon after they left the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent He addressed Venerable Sāriputta
Sāriputta the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness
Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired
My back is sore
Ill stretch it
Yes sir Sāriputta replied
And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up
Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at Pāvā
With his passing the Jain ascetics split dividing into two factions arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed words
You dont understand this teaching and training
I understand this teaching and training
What you understand this teaching and training Youre practicing wrong
Im practicing right
I stay on topic you dont You said last what you should have said first You said first what you should have said last What youve thought so much about has been disproved Your doctrine is refuted Go on save your doctrine Youre trapped get yourself out of thisif you can
Youd think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics
And the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputtas whiteclothed lay disciples were disillusioned dismayed and disappointed in the Jain ascetics They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha with broken monument and without a refuge
Then Sāriputta told the mendicants about these things He went on to say
Thats what happens reverends when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
But this teaching is well explained and well propounded to us by the Blessed One emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha

Long Discourses
The Great Congregation
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants all of whom were perfected ones
And most of the deities from ten solar systems had gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants
Then four deities of the Pure Abodes aware of what was happening thought
Why dont we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his presence
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the Buddha
They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side
Standing to one side one deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Theres a great congregation in the woods
a host of gods have assembled
Weve come to this righteous congregation
to see the invincible Saṅgha
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
The mendicants there are immersed in samādhi
theyve straightened out their own minds
Like a charioteer who has taken the reins
the astute ones protect their senses
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Having cut the stake and cut the bar
theyre unstirred with boundary pillar uprooted
They live pure and immaculate
the young dragons tamed by the seer
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddhas presence
Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge
wont go to a plane of loss
After giving up this human body
they swell the hosts of gods
The Gathering of Deities
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the Realized One and the mendicant Saṅgha
The Buddhas of the past had and the Buddhas of the future will have gatherings of deities that are at most like the gathering for me now
I shall declare the names of the heavenly hosts
I shall extol the names of the heavenly hosts
I shall teach the names of the heavenly hosts
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
I shall invoke a paean of praise
Where the earthgods dwell
there in mountain caves
resolute and composed
dwell many like lonely lions
who have mastered their fears
Their minds are bright and pure
clear and undisturbed
The teacher knew that over five hundred
were in the wood at Kapilavatthu
Therefore he addressed
the disciples who love the teaching
The heavenly hosts have come forth
mendicants you should be aware of them
Those monks became keen
hearing the Buddhas instruction
Knowledge manifested in them
seeing those nonhuman beings
Some saw a hundred
a thousand even seventy thousand
while some saw a hundred thousand
nonhuman beings
But some saw an endless number
spread out in every direction
And all that was known
and distinguished by the Seer
Therefore he addressed
the disciples who love the teaching
The heavenly hosts have come forth

I shall extol them for you
with lyrics in proper order

Those monks became keen
hearing the Buddhas instruction
The army fled from those free of passion
and not a single hair was stirred
All are triumphant in battle

They rejoice with all the spirits
the disciples wellknown among men
Long Discourses
With Pāyāsi
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Kosalan citadel named Setavyā
He stayed in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā
Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi was living in Setavyā It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest quality
On Pāyāsi
Now at that time Pāyāsi had the following harmful misconception
Theres no afterlife No beings are reborn spontaneously Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds
The brahmins and householders of Setavyā heard
It seems the ascetic Kassapa the Princea disciple of the ascetic Gotamais staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā
He has this good reputation
He is astute competent intelligent learned a brilliant speaker eloquent mature a perfected one
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then having departed Setavyā they formed into companies and headed north to the grove
Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap
He saw the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove
and addressed his steward
My steward why are the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove
The ascetic Kassapa the Princea disciple of the ascetic Gotamais staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā
He has this good reputation
He is astute competent intelligent learned a brilliant speaker eloquent mature a perfected one
Theyre going to see that Kassapa the Prince
Well then go to the brahmins and householders and say to them
Sirs the chieftain Pāyāsi asks
you to wait as he will also go to see the ascetic Kassapa the Prince
Before Kassapa the Prince convinces those foolish and incompetent brahmins and householders that
there is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds
for none of these things are true
Yes sir replied the steward and did as he was asked
Then Pāyāsi escorted by the brahmins and householders went up to Kassapa the Prince and exchanged greetings with him When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Before sitting down to one side some of the brahmins and householders of Setavyā bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward Kassapa the Prince some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
Nihilism
Seated to one side the chieftain Pāyāsi said to Venerable Kassapa the Prince
Master Kassapa this is my doctrine and view
Theres no afterlife No beings are reborn spontaneously Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds
Well chieftain Ive never seen or heard of anyone holding such a doctrine or view
For how on earth can anyone say such a thing
The Simile of the Moon and Sun
Well then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think chieftain
Are the moon and sun in this world or the other world Are they gods or humans
They are in the other world Master Kassapa and they are gods not humans
By this method it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife no beings are reborn spontaneously and theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds
Is there a method by which you can prove what you say
There is Master Kassapa
How exactly chieftain
Well I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin who kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong view
Some time later they become sick suffering gravely ill
When I know that
they will not recover from their illness I go to them and say
Sirs there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
Those who kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and are covetous malicious and have wrong viewwhen their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
You do all these things
If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true when your body breaks up after death youll be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
If that happens sirs come and tell me that
there is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds
I trust you and believe you Anything you see will be just as if Ive seen it for myself
They agree to this But they dont come back to tell me nor do they send a messenger
This is the method by which I prove that
theres no afterlife no beings are reborn spontaneously and theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds
The Simile of the Bandit
Well then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think chieftain
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to you saying
Sir this is a bandit a criminal
Punish him as you will
Then youd say to them
Well then my men tie this mans arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum Then take him out the south gate and there at the place of execution to the south of the city chop off his head
Saying Good theyd do as they were told sitting him down at the place of execution
Could that bandit get the executioners to wait saying
Please good executioners I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin in such and such village or town Wait until Ive visited them then Ill come back Or would they just chop off his head as he prattled on
Theyd just chop off his head
So even a human bandit couldnt get his human executioners to stay his execution
What then of your friends and colleagues relatives and kin who are reborn in a lower realm after doing bad things Could they get the wardens of hell to wait saying
Please good wardens of hell Wait until Ive gone to the chieftain Pāyāsi to tell him that
there is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds
By this method too it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife
Is there a method by which you can prove what you say
There is Master Kassapa
How exactly chieftain
Well I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct They refrain from speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre content kindhearted with right view
Some time later they become sick suffering gravely ill
When I know that
they will not recover from their illness I go to them and say
Sirs there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
Those who refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct who refrain from speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and are content kindhearted with right viewwhen their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
You do all these things
If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true when your body breaks up after death youll be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
If that happens sirs come and tell me that
there is an afterlife
I trust you and believe you Anything you see will be just as if Ive seen it for myself
They agree to this But they dont come back to tell me nor do they send a messenger
This is the method by which I prove that
theres no afterlife
The Simile of the Sewer
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose there were a man sunk over his head in a sewer
Then you were to order someone
to pull him out of the sewer
and theyd agree to do so
Then youd tell them to
carefully scrape the dung off that mans body with bamboo scrapers
and theyd agree to do so
Then youd tell them to
carefully scrub that mans body down with pale clay three times
and theyd do so
Then youd tell them to
smear that mans body with oil and carefully wash him down with fine paste three times
and theyd do so
Then youd tell them to
dress that mans hair and beard
and theyd do so
Then youd tell them to
provide that man with costly garlands makeup and clothes
and theyd do so
Then youd tell them to
bring that man up to the stilt longhouse and set him up with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
and theyd do so
What do you think chieftain
Now that man is nicely bathed and anointed with hair and beard dressed bedecked with garlands and bracelets dressed in white supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation upstairs in the royal longhouse Would he want to dive back into that sewer again
No Master Kassapa
Why is that
Because that sewer is filthy stinking disgusting and repulsive and its regarded as such
In the same way chieftain to the gods human beings are filthy stinking disgusting and repulsive and are regarded as such
The smell of humans reaches the gods even a hundred leagues away
What then of your friends and colleagues relatives and kin who are reborn in a higher realm after doing good things Will they come back to tell you that
there is an afterlife
By this method too it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife
Can you prove it
How exactly chieftain
Well I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures and so on
Some time later they become sick suffering gravely ill
When I know that
they will not recover from their illness I go to them and say
Sirs there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
Those who refrain from killing living creatures and so on are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree
You do all these things
If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true when your body breaks up after death youll be reborn in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree
If that happens sirs come and tell me that
there is an afterlife
I trust you and believe you Anything you see will be just as if Ive seen it for myself
They agree to this But they dont come back to tell me nor do they send a messenger
This is how I prove that
theres no afterlife
The Simile of the Gods of the ThirtyThree
Well then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
A hundred human years are equivalent to one day and night for the gods of the ThirtyThree Thirty such days make a month and twelve months make a year The gods of the ThirtyThree have a lifespan of a thousand such years
Now as to your friends who are reborn in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree after doing good things
If they think
First Ill amuse myself for two or three days supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation Then Ill go back to Pāyāsi and tell him that
there is an afterlife
Would they come back to tell you that
there is an afterlife
No Master Kassapa
For I would be long dead by then
But Master Kassapa who has told you
that the gods of the ThirtyThree exist or that they have such a long life span
I dont believe you
Blind From Birth
Chieftain suppose there was a person blind from birth They couldnt see sights that are dark or bright or blue yellow red or magenta They couldnt see even and uneven ground or the stars or the moon and sun
Theyd say
Theres no such thing as dark and bright sights and noone who sees them
Theres no such thing as blue
even and uneven ground
moon and sun and noone who sees these things
I dont know it or see it therefore it doesnt exist
Would they be speaking rightly
No Master Kassapa
There are such things as dark and bright sights and one who sees them
And those other things are real too as is the one who sees them
So its not right to say this
I dont know it or see it therefore it doesnt exist
In the same way chieftain when you tell me you dont believe me you seem like the blind man in the simile
You cant see the other world the way you think with the eye of the flesh
There are ascetics and brahmins who live in the wilderness frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Meditating diligent keen and resolute they purify the divine eye the power of clairvoyance
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see this world and the other world and sentient beings who are spontaneously reborn
Thats how to see the other world
not how you think with the eye of the flesh
By this method too it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife
Can you prove it
How exactly chieftain
Well I see ascetics and brahmins who are ethical of good character who want to live and dont want to die who want to be happy and recoil from pain
I think to myself
If those ascetics and brahmins knew that
things were going to be better for them after death
theyd drink poison slit their wrists hang themselves or throw themselves off a cliff
They mustnt know that
things are going to be better for them after death Thats why they are ethical of good character wanting to live and not wanting to die wanting to be happy and recoiling from pain
This is the method by which I prove that
theres no afterlife
The Simile of the Pregnant Woman
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time a certain brahmin had two wives
One had a son ten or twelve years of age while the other was pregnant and about to give birth
Then the brahmin passed away
So the youth said to his mothers cowife
Madam all the wealth grain silver and gold is mine
and you get nothing
Transfer to me my fathers inheritance
But the brahmin lady said
Wait my dear until I give birth
If its a boy one portion shall be his
If its a girl she will be your reward
But for a second time
and a third time the youth insisted that the entire inheritance must be his
So the brahmin lady took a knife went to her bedroom and sliced open her belly thinking
Until I give birthwhether its a boy or a girl
She destroyed her own life and that of the fetus as well as any wealth
Being foolish and incompetent she sought an inheritance irrationally and fell to ruin and disaster In the same way chieftain being foolish and incompetent youre seeking the other world irrationally and will fall to ruin and disaster
just like that brahmin lady
Good ascetics and brahmins dont force what is unripe to ripen
rather they wait for it to ripen
For the life of clever ascetics and brahmins is beneficial
So long as they remain good ascetics and brahmins make much merit and act for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
By this method too it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife
Can you prove it
How exactly chieftain
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me saying
Sir this is a bandit a criminal
Punish him as you will
I say to them
Well then sirs place this man in a pot while hes still alive Close up the mouth bind it up with damp leather and seal it with a thick coat of damp clay Then lift it up on a stove and light the fire
They agree and do what I ask
When we know that that man has passed away we lift down the pot and break it open uncover the mouth and slowly peek inside thinking
Hopefully well see his soul escaping
But we dont see his soul escaping
This is how I prove that
theres no afterlife
The Simile of the Dream
Well then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
Do you recall ever having a midday nap and seeing delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds in a dream
I do sir
At that time were you guarded by hunchbacks dwarves midgets and younglings
But did they see your soul entering or leaving
No they did not
So if they couldnt even see your soul entering or leaving while you were still alive
how could you see the soul of a dead man
By this method too it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife
Can you prove it
How exactly chieftain
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me saying
Sir this is a bandit a criminal
Punish him as you will
I say to them
Well then sirs weigh this man with scales while hes still alive Then strangle him with a bowstring and when hes dead weigh him again
They agree and do what I ask
So long as they are alive theyre lighter softer more flexible
But when they die they become heavier stiffer less flexible
This is how I prove that
theres no afterlife
The Simile of the Hot Iron Ball
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose a person was to heat an iron ball all day until it was burning blazing and glowing and then they weigh it with scales
After some time when it had cooled and become extinguished theyd weigh it again
When would that iron ball be lighter softer and more workablewhen its burning or when its cool
So long as the iron ball is full of heat and airburning blazing and glowingits lighter softer and more workable
But when it lacks heat and aircooled and extinguishedits heavier stiffer and less workable
In the same way so long as this body is full of life and warmth and consciousness its lighter softer and more flexible
But when it lacks life and warmth and consciousness its heavier stiffer and less flexible
By this method too it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife
Can you prove it
How exactly chieftain
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me saying
Sir this is a bandit a criminal
Punish him as you will
I say to them
Well then sirs take this mans life without injuring his outer skin inner skin flesh sinews bones or marrow Hopefully well see his soul escaping
They agree and do what I ask
When hes halfdead I tell them to
lay him on his back in hope of seeing his soul escape
They do so
But we dont see his soul escaping
I tell them to
lay him bent over
to lay him on his side
to lay him on the other side
to stand him upright
to stand him upside down
to strike him with fists
and swords
and to give him a good shaking in hope of seeing his soul escape
They do all these things
But we dont see his soul escaping
For him the eye itself is present and so are those sights Yet he does not experience that sensefield
The ear itself is present and so are those sounds Yet he does not experience that sensefield
The nose itself is present and so are those smells Yet he does not experience that sensefield
The tongue itself is present and so are those tastes Yet he does not experience that sensefield
The body itself is present and so are those touches Yet he does not experience that sensefield
This is how I prove that
theres no afterlife
The Simile of the Horn Blower
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time a certain horn blower took his horn and traveled to a borderland
where he went to a certain village Standing in the middle of the village he sounded his horn three times then placed it on the ground and sat down to one side
Then the people of the borderland thought
What is making this sound so arousing sensuous intoxicating infatuating and captivating
They gathered around the horn blower and said
Mister what is making this sound so arousing sensuous intoxicating infatuating and captivating
The sound is made by this which is called a horn
They laid that horn on its back saying
Speak good horn Speak good horn
But still the horn made no sound
Then they lay the horn bent over they lay it on its side they lay it on its other side they stood it upright they stood it upside down they struck it with fists stones rods and swords and they gave it a good shake saying
Speak good horn Speak good horn
But still the horn made no sound
So the horn blower thought
How foolish are these borderland folk For how can they seek the sound of a horn so irrationally
And as they looked on he picked up the horn sounded it three times and took it away with him
Then the people of the borderland thought
So it seems when what is called a horn is accompanied by a person effort and wind it makes a sound But when these things are absent it makes no sound
In the same way so long as this body is full of life and warmth and consciousness it walks back and forth stands sits and lies down It sees sights with the eye hears sounds with the ear smells odors with the nose tastes flavors with the tongue feels touches with the body and knows thoughts with the mind
But when it lacks life and warmth and consciousness it does none of these things
By this method too it ought to be proven that
there is an afterlife
Even though Master Kassapa says this still I think that
theres no afterlife
Can you prove it
How exactly chieftain
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me saying
Sir this is a bandit a criminal
Punish him as you will
I say to them
Well then sirs cut open this mans outer skin Hopefully we might see his soul
They cut open his outer skin
but we see no soul
I say to them
Well then sirs cut open his inner skin flesh sinews bones or marrow Hopefully well see his soul
They do so but we see no soul
This is how I prove that
theres no afterlife
The Simile of the FireWorshiping MattedHair Ascetic
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time a certain fireworshiping mattedhair ascetic settled in a leaf hut in a wilderness region
Then a caravan came out from a certain country
It stayed for one night not far from that ascetics hermitage and then moved on
The ascetic thought
Why dont I go to that caravans campsite Hopefully Ill find something useful there
So he went and he saw a little baby boy abandoned there
When he saw this he thought
Its not proper for me to look on while a human being dies
Why dont I bring this boy back to my hermitage nurse him nourish him and raise him
So thats what he did
When the boy was ten or twelve years old the ascetic had some business come up in the country
So he said to the boy
My dear I wish to go to the country
Serve the sacred flame
Do not extinguish it
But if you should extinguish it here is the hatchet the firewood and the bundle of drillsticks Light the fire and serve it
And having instructed the boy the ascetic went to the country
But the boy was so engrossed in his play the fire went out
He thought
My father told me to serve the sacred flame
Why dont I light it again and serve it
So he chopped the bundle of drillsticks with the hatchet thinking
Hopefully Ill get a fire
But he still got no fire
He split the bundle of drillsticks into two three four five ten or a hundred parts He chopped them into splinters pounded them in a mortar and swept them away in a strong wind thinking
Hopefully Ill get a fire
But he still got no fire
Then the mattedhair ascetic having concluded his business in the country returned to his own hermitage and said to the boy
I trust my dear that the fire didnt go out
And the boy told him what had happened
Then the ascetic thought
How foolish is this boy how incompetent For how can he seek a fire so irrationally
So while the boy looked on he took a bundle of firesticks lit the fire and said
Dear boy this is how to light a fire
Not the foolish and incompetent way you sought it so irrationally
In the same way chieftain being foolish and incompetent you seek the other world irrationally
Let go of this harmful misconception chieftain let go of it
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
Even though Master Kassapa says this still Im not able to let go of that harmful misconception
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my views and so do foreign kings
If I let go of this harmful misconception people will say
How foolish is the chieftain Pāyāsi how incompetent that he should hold on to a mistake
I shall carry on with this view out of anger contempt and spite
The Simile of the Two Caravan Leaders
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time a large caravan of a thousand wagons traveled from a country in the east to the west
Wherever they went they quickly used up the grass wood water and the green foliage
Now that caravan had two leaders each in charge of five hundred wagons
They thought
This is a large caravan of a thousand wagons
Wherever we go we quickly use up the grass wood water and the green foliage
Why dont we split the caravan in two halves
So thats what they did
One caravan leader having prepared much grass wood and water started the caravan
After two or three days journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels He was armored with a quiver and wreathed with yellow lotus his clothes and hair all wet Seeing him he said
Sir where do you come from
From such and such a country
And where are you going
To the country named so and so
But has there been much rain in the desert up ahead
Indeed there has sir The paths are sprinkled with water and there is much grass wood and water
Toss out your grass wood and water Your wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen so dont tire your draught teams
So the caravan leader addressed his drivers
This man says that
there has been much rain in the desert up ahead
He advises us to toss out the grass wood and water The wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen and wont tire our draught teams
So lets toss out the grass wood and water and restart the caravan with lightlyladen wagons
Yes sir the drivers replied and thats what they did
But in the caravans first campsite they saw no grass wood or water
And in the second
and seventh campsites they saw no grass wood or water
And all fell to ruin and disaster
And the men and beasts in that caravan were all devoured by that nonhuman spirit
Only their bones remained
Now when the second caravan leader knew that
the first caravan was well underway he prepared much grass wood and water and started the caravan
After two or three days journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels He was armored with a quiver and wreathed with yellow lotus his clothes and hair all wet Seeing him he said
Sir where do you come from
From such and such a country
And where are you going
To the country named so and so
But has there been much rain in the desert up ahead
Indeed there has sir
The paths are sprinkled with water and there is much grass wood and water
Toss out your grass wood and water Your wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen so dont tire your draught teams
So the caravan leader addressed his drivers
This man says that
there has been much rain in the desert up ahead
He advises us to toss out the grass wood and water The wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen and wont tire our draught teams
But this person is neither our friend nor relative How can we proceed out of trust in him
We shouldnt toss out any grass wood or water but continue with our goods laden as before
We shall not toss out any old stock
Yes sir the drivers replied and they restarted the caravan with the goods laden as before
And in the caravans first campsite they saw no grass wood or water
And in the second
and seventh campsites they saw no grass wood or water
And they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin
And they saw the bones of the men and beasts who had been devoured by that nonhuman spirit
So the caravan leader addressed his drivers
This caravan came to ruin as happens when guided by a foolish caravan leader
Well then sirs toss out any of our merchandise thats of little value and take whats valuable from this caravan
Yes sir replied the drivers and thats what they did They crossed over the desert safely as happens when guided by an astute caravan leader
In the same way chieftain being foolish and incompetent you will come to ruin seeking the other world irrationally like the first caravan leader
And those who think youre worth listening to and trusting will also come to ruin like the drivers
Let go of this harmful misconception chieftain let go of it
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
Even though Master Kassapa says this still Im not able to let go of that harmful misconception
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my views and so do foreign kings
I shall carry on with this view out of anger contempt and spite
The Simile of the DungCarrier
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time a certain swineherd went from his own village to another village
There he saw a large pile of dry dung abandoned
He thought
This pile of dry dung can serve as food for my pigs
Why dont I carry it off
So he spread out his upper robe shoveled the dry dung onto it tied it up into a bundle lifted it on to his head and went on his way
While on his way a large sudden storm poured down
Smeared with leaking oozing dung down to his fingernails he kept on carrying the load of dung
When people saw him they said
Have you gone mad sir Have you lost your mind For how can you smeared with leaking oozing dung down to your fingernails keep on carrying that load of dung
Youre the mad ones sirs Youre the ones whove lost your minds For this will serve as food for my pigs
In the same way chieftain you seem like the dung carrier in the simile
Let go of this harmful misconception chieftain let go of it
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
Even though Master Kassapa says this still Im not able to let go of that harmful misconception
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my views and so do foreign kings
I shall carry on with this view out of anger contempt and spite
The Simile of the Gamblers
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time two gamblers were playing with dice
One gambler every time they made a bad throw swallowed the dice
The second gambler saw him and said
Well my friend youve won it all Give me the dice I will offer them as sacrifice
Yes my friend the gambler replied and gave them
Having soaked the dice in poison the gambler said to the other
Come my friend lets play dice
Yes my friend the other gambler replied
And for a second time the gamblers played with dice
And for the second time every time they made a bad throw that gambler swallowed the dice
The second gambler saw him and said
The man swallows the dice without realizing
theyre smeared with burning poison
Swallow you bloody cheat swallow
Soon youll know the bitter fruit
In the same way chieftain you seem like the gambler in the simile
Let go of this harmful misconception chieftain let go of it
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
Even though Master Kassapa says this still Im not able to let go of that harmful misconception
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my views and so do foreign kings
I shall carry on with this view out of anger contempt and spite
The Simile of the Man Who Carried Hemp
Well then chieftain I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time the inhabitants of a certain country emigrated
Then one friend said to another
Come my friend lets go to that country Hopefully well get some riches there
Yes my friend the other replied
They went to that country and to a certain place in a village There they saw a pile of abandoned sunn hemp Seeing it one friend said to the other
This is a pile of abandoned sunn hemp Well then my friend you make up a bundle of hemp and Ill make one too Lets both take a bundle of hemp and go on
Yes my friend he said Carrying their bundles of hemp they went to another place in the village
There they saw much sunn hemp thread abandoned Seeing it one friend said to the other
This pile of abandoned sunn hemp thread is just what we wanted the hemp for
Well then my friend lets abandon our bundles of hemp and both take a bundle of hemp thread and go on
Ive already carried this bundle of hemp a long way and its well tied up Its good enough for me you understand
So one friend abandoned their bundle of hemp and picked up a bundle of hemp thread
They went to another place in the village
There they saw much sunn hemp cloth abandoned Seeing it one friend said to the other
This pile of abandoned sunn hemp cloth is just what we wanted the hemp and hemp thread for
Well then my friend lets abandon our bundles and both take a bundle of hemp cloth and go on
Ive already carried this bundle of hemp a long way and its well tied up Its good enough for me you understand
So one friend abandoned their bundle of hemp thread and picked up a bundle of hemp cloth
They went to another place in the village
There they saw a pile of flax and by turn
linen thread
linen cloth
silk thread
silk cloth
and gold abandoned Seeing it one friend said to the other
This pile of gold is just what we wanted all those other things for
Well then my friend lets abandon our bundles and both take a bundle of gold and go on
Ive already carried this bundle of hemp a long way and its well tied up Its good enough for me you understand
So one friend abandoned their bundle of silver and picked up a bundle of gold
Then they returned to their own village
When one friend returned with a bundle of sunn hemp they didnt please their parents their partners and children or their friends and colleagues And they got no pleasure and happiness on that account
But when the other friend returned with a bundle of gold they pleased their parents their partners and children and their friends and colleagues And they got much pleasure and happiness on that account
In the same way chieftain you seem like the hempcarrier in the simile
Let go of this harmful misconception chieftain let go of it
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
Going for Refuge
I was delighted and satisfied with your very first simile Master Kassapa
Nevertheless I wanted to hear your various solutions to the problem so I thought Id oppose you in this way
Excellent Master Kassapa Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Kassapa has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Kassapa remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Master Kassapa I wish to perform a great sacrifice Please instruct me so it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness
On Sacrifice
Chieftain take the kind of sacrifice where cattle goats and sheep chickens and pigs and various kinds of creatures are slaughtered And the recipients have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion That kind of sacrifice is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful
Suppose a farmer was to enter a wood taking seed and plough
And on that barren field that barren ground with uncleared stumps he sowed seeds that were broken spoiled weatherdamaged infertile and ill kept
And the heavens dont provide enough rain when needed
Would those seeds grow increase and mature and would the farmer get abundant fruit
No Master Kassapa
In the same way chieftain take the kind of sacrifice where cattle goats and sheep chickens and pigs and various kinds of creatures are slaughtered And the recipients have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion That kind of sacrifice is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful
But take the kind of sacrifice where cattle goats and sheep chickens and pigs and various kinds of creatures are not slaughtered And the recipients have right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion That kind of sacrifice is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful
Suppose a farmer was to enter a wood taking seed and plough
And on that fertile field that fertile ground with wellcleared stumps he sowed seeds that were intact unspoiled not weatherdamaged fertile and well kept
And the heavens provide plenty of rain when needed
Would those seeds grow increase and mature and would the farmer get abundant fruit
Yes Master Kassapa
In the same way chieftain take the kind of sacrifice where cattle goats and sheep chickens and pigs and various kinds of creatures are not slaughtered And the recipients have right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion That kind of sacrifice is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful
On the Brahmin Student Uttara
Then the chieftain Pāyāsi set up an offering for ascetics and brahmins for paupers vagrants travelers and beggars
At that offering such food as rough gruel with pickles was given and heavy clothes with knotted fringes
Now it was a brahmin student named Uttara who organized that offering
When the offering was over he referred to it like this
Through this offering may I be together with the chieftain Pāyāsi in this world but not in the next
Pāyāsi heard of this
so he summoned Uttara and said
Is it really true dear Uttara that you referred to the offering in this way
Yes sir
Dont we who seek merit expect some result from the offering
At your offering such food as rough gruel with pickles was given which you wouldnt even want to touch with your foot much less eat And also heavy clothes with knotted fringes which you also wouldnt want to touch with your foot much less wear
Sir youre dear and beloved to me But how can I reconcile one so dear with something so disagreeable
Well then dear Uttara set up an offering with the same kind of food that I eat
and the same kind of clothes that I wear
Yes sir replied Uttara and did so
So the chieftain Pāyāsi gave gifts carelessly thoughtlessly not with his own hands giving the dregs When his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings in an empty palace of acacia
But the brahmin student Uttara who organized the offering gave gifts carefully thoughtfully with his own hands not giving the dregs
When his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the ThirtyThree
The God Pāyāsi
Now at that time Venerable Gavampati would often go to that empty acacia palace for the days meditation
Then the god Pāyāsi went up to him bowed and stood to one side
Gavampati said to him
Who are you reverend
Sir I am the chieftain Pāyāsi
Didnt you have the view that
theres no afterlife no beings are reborn spontaneously and theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds
Its true sir I did have such a view
But Venerable Kassapa the Prince dissuaded me from that harmful misconception
But the student named Uttara who organized that offering for youwhere has he been reborn
Sir Uttara gave gifts carefully thoughtfully with his own hands not giving the dregs When his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the ThirtyThree
But I gave gifts carelessly thoughtlessly not with my own hands giving the dregs When my body broke up after death I was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings in an empty palace of acacia
So sir when youve returned to the human realm please announce this
Give gifts carefully thoughtfully with your own hands not giving the dregs
The chieftain Pāyāsi gave gifts carelessly thoughtlessly not with his own hands giving the dregs When his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings in an empty palace of acacia
But the brahmin student Uttara who organized the offering gave gifts carefully thoughtfully with his own hands not giving the dregs When his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the ThirtyThree
So when Venerable Gavampati returned to the human realm he made that announcement
Long Discourses
The ṭānāṭiya Protection
The First Recitation Section
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
Then late at night the Four Great Kingswith large armies of spirits fairies goblins and dragonsset guards troops and wards at the four quarters and then lighting up the entire Vultures Peak with their beauty went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Before sitting down to one side some spirits bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
Seated to one side the Great King Vessavaṇa said to the Buddha
Sir some high spirits have confidence in the Buddha
some do not
Some middling spirits have confidence in the Buddha
some do not
Some low spirits have confidence in the Buddha
some do not
But mostly the spirits dont have confidence in the Buddha
Why is that
Because the Buddha teaches them to refrain from killing living creatures stealing lying sexual misconduct and drinking alcohol
But mostly they dont refrain from such things
They dont like that or approve of it
Sir there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreat
There dwell high spirits who have no confidence in the Buddhas dispensation
To give them confidence may the Buddha please learn the ṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding protection safety and comfort of the monks nuns laymen and laywomen
The Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented on that occasion Great King Vessavaṇa recited the ṭānāṭiya protection

This dear sir is the ṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding protection safety and comfort of the monks nuns laymen and laywomen
The monks nuns laymen and laywomen should learn this ṭānāṭiya protection well and completely memorize it
If anyone who does so is approached while walking standing sitting or lying down by any nonhuman being with malicious intentincluding males females boys girls ministers counselors and servants among the spirits fairies goblins and dragons
that nonhuman will receive no homage or respect in any village or town
And they will receive no ground or dwelling in my capital of lakamandā
Nor will they get to go to the conference of the spirits
In addition the nonhumans would not give or take them in marriage
Theyd heap personal abuse on them
drop an empty bowl on their head
and even split their head into seven pieces
For there are dear sir nonhumans who are fierce cruel and violent They dont obey the Great Kings or their men or their mens men
Theyre said to be rebelling against the Great Kings
Theyre just like the bandits in the king of Magadhas realm
who dont obey the king his men or his mens men
and are said to be rebelling against the king
If any nonhuman being with malicious intentincluding males females boys girls ministers counselors and servants among the spirits fairies goblins and dragonsapproaches a monk nun layman or laywoman while walking standing sitting or lying down
one ought to yell cry and scream to the spirits great spirits generals great generals
This spirits got me This spirits entered me This spirits annoying me This spirits harassing me This spirits hurting me This spirits harming me This spirit wont let me go

Well now dear sir I must go I have many duties and much to do
Please Great Kings go at your convenience
Then the Four Great Kings got up from their seats bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right side before vanishing right there
And before the other spirits present vanished some bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right side some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
The first recitation section is finished
The Second Recitation Section
Then when the night had passed the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened repeating all the verses spoken Then he added
Mendicants learn the ṭānāṭiya protection
Memorize the ṭānāṭiya protection
Remember the ṭānāṭiya protection
The ṭānāṭiya protection is beneficial and is for the guarding protection safety and comfort of the monks nuns laymen and laywomen
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
The Great Discourse on Causation
Dependent Origination
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma
Then Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Its incredible sir its amazing
in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep yet to me it seems as plain as can be
Dont say that nanda dont say that
This dependent origination is deep and appears deep
It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string knotted like a ball of thread and matted like rushes and reeds and it doesnt escape the places of loss the bad places the underworld transmigration
When asked Is there a specific condition for old age and death you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for old age and death you should answer Rebirth is a condition for old age and death
When asked Is there a specific condition for rebirth you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for rebirth you should answer Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
When asked Is there a specific condition for continued existence you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for continued existence you should answer Grasping is a condition for continued existence
When asked Is there a specific condition for grasping you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for grasping you should answer Craving is a condition for grasping
When asked Is there a specific condition for craving you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for craving you should answer Feeling is a condition for craving
When asked Is there a specific condition for feeling you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for feeling you should answer Contact is a condition for feeling
When asked Is there a specific condition for contact you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for contact you should answer Name and form are conditions for contact
When asked Is there a specific condition for name and form you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for name and form you should answer Consciousness is a condition for name and form
When asked Is there a specific condition for consciousness you should answer There is
If they say What is a condition for consciousness you should answer Name and form are conditions for consciousness
So name and form are conditions for consciousness Consciousness is a condition for name and form Name and form are conditions for contact Contact is a condition for feeling Feeling is a condition for craving Craving is a condition for grasping Grasping is a condition for continued existence Continued existence is a condition for rebirth Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Rebirth is a condition for old age and deaththats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no rebirth for anyone anywhere
That is there were no rebirth of sentient beings into their various realmsof gods fairies spirits creatures humans quadrupeds birds or reptiles each into their own realm
When theres no rebirth at all with the cessation of rebirth would old age and death still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of old age and death namely rebirth
Continued existence is a condition for rebirththats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no continued existence for anyone anywhere
That is continued existence in the sensual realm the realm of luminous form or the formless realm When theres no continued existence at all with the cessation of continued existence would rebirth still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of rebirth namely continued existence
Grasping is a condition for continued existencethats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no grasping for anyone anywhere
That is grasping at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances and theories of a self When theres no grasping at all with the cessation of grasping would continued existence still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of continued existence namely grasping
Craving is a condition for graspingthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no craving for anyone anywhere
That is craving for sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughts When theres no craving at all with the cessation of craving would grasping still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of grasping namely craving
Feeling is a condition for cravingthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no feeling for anyone anywhere
That is feeling born of contact through the eye ear nose tongue body and mind When theres no feeling at all with the cessation of feeling would craving still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of craving namely feeling
So it is nanda that feeling is a cause of craving Craving is a cause of seeking Seeking is a cause of gaining material possessions Gaining material possessions is a cause of assessing Assessing is a cause of desire and lust Desire and lust is a cause of attachment Attachment is a cause of possessiveness Possessiveness is a cause of stinginess Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding
Owing to safeguarding many bad unskillful things come to be taking up the rod and the sword quarrels arguments and fights accusations divisive speech and lies
Owing to safeguarding many bad unskillful things come to be taking up the rod and the sword quarrels arguments and fights accusations divisive speech and liesthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no safeguarding for anyone anywhere When theres no safeguarding at all with the cessation of safeguarding would those many bad unskillful things still come to be
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition for the origination of those many bad unskillful things namely safeguarding
Stinginess is a cause of safeguardingthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no stinginess for anyone anywhere When theres no stinginess at all with the cessation of stinginess would safeguarding still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of safeguarding namely stinginess
Possessiveness is a cause of stinginessthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no possessiveness for anyone anywhere When theres no possessiveness at all with the cessation of possessiveness would stinginess still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of stinginess namely possessiveness
Attachment is a cause of possessivenessthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no attachment for anyone anywhere When theres no attachment at all with the cessation of attachment would possessiveness still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of possessiveness namely attachment
Desire and lust is a cause of attachmentthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no desire and lust for anyone anywhere When theres no desire and lust at all with the cessation of desire and lust would attachment still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of attachment namely desire and lust
Assessing is a cause of desire and lustthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no assessing for anyone anywhere When theres no assessing at all with the cessation of assessing would desire and lust still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of desire and lust namely assessing
Gaining material possessions is a cause of assessingthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no gaining of material possessions for anyone anywhere When theres no gaining of material possessions at all with the cessation of gaining material possessions would assessing still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of assessing namely the gaining of material possessions
Seeking is a cause of gaining material possessionsthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no seeking for anyone anywhere When theres no seeking at all with the cessation of seeking would the gaining of material possessions still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of gaining material possessions namely seeking
Craving is a cause of seekingthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no craving for anyone anywhere
That is craving for sensual pleasures craving for continued existence and craving to end existence When theres no craving at all with the cessation of craving would seeking still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of seeking namely craving
And so nanda these two things are united by the two aspects of feeling
Contact is a condition for feelingthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were totally and utterly no contact for anyone anywhere
That is contact through the eye ear nose tongue body and mind When theres no contact at all with the cessation of contact would feeling still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of feeling namely contact
Name and form are conditions for contactthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
Suppose there were none of the features attributes signs and details by which the category of mental phenomena is found Would linguistic contact still be found in the category of physical phenomena
No sir
Suppose there were none of the features attributes signs and details by which the category of physical phenomena is found Would impingement contact still be found in the category of mental phenomena
No sir
Suppose there were none of the features attributes signs and details by which the categories of mental or physical phenomena are found Would either linguistic contact or impingement contact still be found
No sir
Suppose there were none of the features attributes signs and details by which name and form are found Would contact still be found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of contact namely name and form
Consciousness is a condition for name and formthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
If consciousness were not conceived in the mothers womb would name and form coagulate there
No sir
If consciousness after being conceived in the mothers womb were to be miscarried would name and form be born into this state of existence
No sir
If the consciousness of a young boy or girl were to be cut off would name and form achieve growth increase and maturity
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of name and form namely consciousness
Name and form are conditions for consciousnessthats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is so
If consciousness were not to become established in name and form would the coming to be of the origin of sufferingof rebirth old age and death in the futurebe found
No sir
Thats why this is the cause source origin and condition of consciousness namely name and form
This is the extent to which one may be reborn grow old die pass away or reappear
This is how far the scope of language terminology and description extends how far the sphere of wisdom extends how far the cycle of rebirths proceeds so that this state of existence is to be found namely name and form together with consciousness
Describing the Self
How do those who describe the self describe it
They describe it as physical and limited
My self is physical and limited
Or they describe it as physical and infinite
My self is physical and infinite
Or they describe it as formless and limited
My self is formless and limited
Or they describe it as formless and infinite
My self is formless and infinite
Now take those who describe the self as physical and limited
They describe the self as physical and limited in the present or in some future life or else they think Though it is not like that I will ensure it is provided with what it needs to become like that
This being so its appropriate to say that a view of self as physical and limited underlies them
Now take those who describe the self as physical and infinite 
formless and limited 
formless and infinite
They describe the self as formless and infinite in the present or in some future life or else they think Though it is not like that I will ensure it is provided with what it needs to become like that
This being so its appropriate to say that a view of self as formless and infinite underlies them
Thats how those who describe the self describe it
Not Describing the Self
How do those who dont describe the self not describe it
They dont describe it as physical and limited 
physical and infinite 
formless and limited 
formless and infinite
My self is formless and infinite
Now take those who dont describe the self as physical and limited 
physical and infinite 
formless and limited 
formless and infinite
They dont describe the self as formless and infinite in the present or in some future life and they dont think Though it is not like that I will ensure it is provided with what it needs to become like that
This being so its appropriate to say that a view of self as formless and infinite doesnt underlie them
Thats how those who dont describe the self dont describe it
Regarding a Self
How do those who regard the self regard it
They regard feeling as self
Feeling is my self
Or they regard it like this Feeling is definitely not my self My self does not experience feeling
Or they regard it like this Feeling is definitely not my self But its not that my self does not experience feeling My self feels for my self is liable to feel
Now as to those who say
Feeling is my self
You should say this to them
Reverend there are three feelings
pleasant painful and neutral
Which one of these do you regard as self
nanda at a time when you feel a pleasant feeling you dont feel a painful or neutral feeling
you only feel a pleasant feeling
At a time when you feel a painful feeling you dont feel a pleasant or neutral feeling
you only feel a painful feeling
At a time when you feel a neutral feeling you dont feel a pleasant or painful feeling
you only feel a neutral feeling
Pleasant feelings painful feelings and neutral feelings are all impermanent conditioned dependently originated liable to end vanish fade away and cease
When feeling a pleasant feeling they think This is my self
When their pleasant feeling ceases they think My self has disappeared
When feeling a painful feeling they think This is my self
When their painful feeling ceases they think My self has disappeared
When feeling a neutral feeling they think This is my self
When their neutral feeling ceases they think My self has disappeared
So those who say feeling is my self regard as self that which is evidently impermanent a mixture of pleasure and pain and liable to rise and fall
Thats why its not acceptable to regard feeling as self
Now as to those who say
Feeling is definitely not my self My self does not experience feeling You should say this to them
But reverend where there is nothing felt at all would the thought I am occur there
No sir
Thats why its not acceptable to regard self as that which does not experience feeling
Now as to those who say
Feeling is definitely not my self But its not that my self does not experience feeling My self feels for my self is liable to feel
You should say this to them
Suppose feelings were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over
When theres no feeling at all with the cessation of feeling would the thought I am this occur there
No sir
Thats why its not acceptable to regard self as that which is liable to feel
Not regarding anything in this way they dont grasp at anything in the world
Not grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguished
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
It wouldnt be appropriate to say that a mendicant whose mind is freed like this holds the following views
A Realized One exists after death
A Realized One doesnt exist after death
A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death
A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death
Why is that
A mendicant is freed by directly knowing this how far language and the scope of language extend how far terminology and the scope of terminology extend how far description and the scope of description extend how far wisdom and the sphere of wisdom extend how far the cycle of rebirths and its continuation extend It wouldnt be appropriate to say that a mendicant freed by directly knowing this holds the view There is no such thing as knowing and seeing
Planes of Consciousness
nanda there are seven planes of consciousness and two dimensions
What seven
There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in perception such as human beings some gods and some beings in the underworld
This is the first plane of consciousness
There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in perception such as the gods reborn in Brahmās Host through the first absorption
This is the second plane of consciousness
There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in perception such as the gods of streaming radiance
This is the third plane of consciousness
There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in perception such as the gods replete with glory
This is the fourth plane of consciousness
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form With the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space
This is the fifth plane of consciousness
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space Aware that consciousness is infinite they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness
This is the sixth plane of consciousness
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness Aware that there is nothing at all they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingness
This is the seventh plane of consciousness
Then theres the dimension of nonpercipient beings and secondly the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Now regarding these seven planes of consciousness and two dimensions
is it appropriate for someone who understands themand their origin ending gratification drawback and escapeto take pleasure in them
No sir
When a mendicant having truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape regarding these seven planes of consciousness and these two dimensions is freed by not grasping theyre called a mendicant who is freed by wisdom
The Eight Liberations
nanda there are these eight liberations
What eight
Having physical form they see visions
This is the first liberation
Not perceiving form internally they see visions externally
This is the second liberation
Theyre focused only on beauty
This is the third liberation
Going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space
This is the fourth liberation
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness
This is the fifth liberation
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness
This is the sixth liberation
Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This is the seventh liberation
Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is the eighth liberation
These are the eight liberations
When a mendicant enters into and withdraws from these eight liberationsin forward order in reverse order and in forward and reverse orderwherever they wish whenever they wish and for as long as they wish
and when they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements theyre called a mendicant who is freed both ways
And nanda there is no other freedom both ways that is better or finer than this
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
An Impressive Discourse
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans in a stilt longhouse in a mango grove belonging to the Sakyan family named Vedhañña
Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at Pāvā
With his passing the Jain ascetics split dividing into two factions arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed words
You dont understand this teaching and training I understand this teaching and training What you understand this teaching and training
Youre practicing wrong
Im practicing right
I stay on topic you dont
You said last what you should have said first You said first what you should have said last What youve thought so much about has been disproved Your doctrine is refuted Go on save your doctrine Youre trapped get yourself out of thisif you can
Youd think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics
And the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputtas whiteclothed lay disciples were disillusioned dismayed and disappointed in the Jain ascetics They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha with broken monument and without a refuge
And then after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā the novice Cunda went to see Venerable nanda at Sāma village
He bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
nanda said to him
Reverend Cunda we should see the Buddha about this matter
Come lets go to the Buddha and tell him about this
Yes sir replied Cunda
Then nanda and Cunda went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
The Teaching of the Unawakened
Thats what happens Cunda when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
Take the case where a teacher is not awakened and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
A disciple in that teaching does not practice in line with the teachings does not practice following that procedure does not live in line with the teaching They proceed having turned away from that teaching
You should say this to them
Youre fortunate reverend youre so very fortunate
For your teacher is not awakened and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
But you dont practice in line with that teaching you dont practice following that procedure you dont live in line with the teaching You proceed having turned away from that teaching
In such a case the teacher and the teaching are to blame but the disciple deserves praise
Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple
Come on venerable practice as taught and pointed out by your teacher
The one who encourages the one who they encourage and the one who practices accordingly all make much bad karma
Why is that
Its because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
Take the case where a teacher is not awakened and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
A disciple in that teaching practices in line with the teachings practices following that procedure lives in line with the teaching They proceed having undertaken that teaching
You should say this to them
Its your loss reverend its your misfortune For your teacher is not awakened and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
And you practice in line with that teaching you practice following that procedure you live in line with the teaching You proceed having undertaken that teaching
In such a case the teacher the teaching and the disciple are all to blame
Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple
Clearly the venerable is practicing methodically and will succeed in completing that method
The one who praises the one who they praise and the one who being praised rouses up even more energy all make much bad karma
Why is that
Its because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
The Teaching of the Awakened
Take the case where a teacher is awakened and the teaching is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha
A disciple in that teaching does not practice in line with the teachings does not practice following that procedure does not live in line with the teaching They proceed having turned away from that teaching
You should say this to them
Its your loss reverend its your misfortune For your teacher is awakened and their teaching is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha
But you dont practice in line with that teaching you dont practice following that procedure you dont live in line with the teaching You proceed having turned away from that teaching
In such a case the teacher and the teaching deserve praise but the disciple is to blame
Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple
Come on venerable practice as taught and pointed out by your teacher
The one who encourages the one who they encourage and the one who practices accordingly all make much merit
Why is that
Its because that teaching and training is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha
Take the case where a teacher is awakened and the teaching is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha
A disciple in that teaching practices in line with the teachings practices following that procedure lives in line with the teaching They proceed having undertaken that teaching
You should say this to them
Youre fortunate reverend youre so very fortunate
For your teacher is awakened and their teaching is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha
And you practice in line with that teaching you practice following that procedure you live in line with the teaching You proceed having undertaken that teaching
In such a case the teacher the teaching and the disciple all deserve praise
Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple
Clearly the venerable is practicing methodically and will succeed in completing that method
The one who praises the one who they praise and the one who being praised rouses up even more energy all make much merit
Why is that
Its because that teaching and training is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha
When Disciples Have Regrets
Take the case where a teacher arises in the world who is perfected a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is fully awakened
But the disciples havent inquired about the meaning of that good teaching And the spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure has not been disclosed and revealed to them with all its collected sayings with its demonstrable basis well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans
And then their teacher passes away
When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are tormented by regrets
Why is that
They think Our teacher was perfected a fully awakened Buddha His teaching was well explained but we didnt inquire about the meaning and the spiritual practice was not fully disclosed to us
And then our teacher passed away
When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are tormented by regrets
When Disciples Have No Regrets
Take the case where a teacher arises in the world who is perfected a fully awakened Buddha
The teaching is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is fully awakened
The disciples have inquired about the meaning of that good teaching And the spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure has been disclosed and revealed to them with all its collected sayings with its demonstrable basis well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans
And then their teacher passes away
When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are free of regrets
Why is that
They think Our teacher was perfected a fully awakened Buddha
His teaching was well explained
we inquired about the meaning and the spiritual practice was fully disclosed to us
And then our teacher passed away
When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are free of regrets
On the Incomplete Spiritual Path Etc
Now suppose Cunda that a spiritual path possesses those factors But the teacher is not senior long standing long gone forth advanced in years and reached the final stage of life
Then that spiritual path is incomplete in that respect
But when a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior
then that spiritual path is complete in that respect
Now suppose that a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior But there are no senior monk disciples who are competent educated assured have attained sanctuary
who can rightly explain the true teaching and who can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up and teach with a demonstrable basis
Then that spiritual path is incomplete in that respect
But when a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior and there are competent senior monks
then that spiritual path is complete in that respect
Now suppose that a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior and there are competent senior monks
But there are no competent middle monks
junior monks
senior nuns
middle nuns
junior nuns
celibate whiteclothed laymen
whiteclothed laymen enjoying sensual pleasures
celibate whiteclothed laywomen
whiteclothed laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures 
There are whiteclothed laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures but the spiritual path is not successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans 
the spiritual path is successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans but it has not reached the peak of material possessions and fame
Then that spiritual path is incomplete in that respect
But when a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior and there are competent senior monks
middle monks
junior monks
senior nuns
middle nuns
junior nuns
celibate laymen
laymen enjoying sensual pleasures
celibate laywomen
laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures
and the spiritual path is successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans and it has reached the peak of material possessions and fame
then that spiritual path is complete in that respect
I Cunda am a teacher who has arisen in the world today perfected and fully awakened
The teaching is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is fully awakened
My disciples have inquired about the meaning of that good teaching And the spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure has been disclosed and revealed to them with all its collected sayings with its demonstrable basis well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans
I am a teacher today who is senior long standing long gone forth advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life
I have today disciples who are competent senior monks
middle monks
junior monks
senior nuns
middle nuns
junior nuns
celibate laymen
laymen enjoying sensual pleasures
celibate laywomen
and laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures
Today my spiritual life is successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans
Of all the teachers in the world today Cunda I dont see even a single one who has reached the peak of material possessions and fame like me
Of all the spiritual communities and groups in the world today Cunda I dont see even a single one who has reached the pinnacle of material possessions and fame like the mendicant Saṅgha
And if theres any spiritual path of which it may be rightly said that
its endowed with all good qualities complete in all good qualities neither too little nor too much well explained whole full and well propounded
its of this spiritual path that this should be said
Uddaka son of Rāma used to say
Seeing one does not see
But seeing what does one not see
You can see the blade of a wellsharpened razor but not the edge
Thus it is said
Seeing one does not see
But that saying of Uddakas is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless as its only concerning a razor
If theres anything of which it may be rightly said
Seeing one does not see its of this that it should be said
Seeing what does one not see
One sees this a spiritual path endowed with all good qualities complete in all good qualities neither too little nor too much well explained whole full and well propounded
One does not see this anything that were it to be removed would make it purer
One does not see this anything that were it to be added would make it more complete
Thus it is rightly said
Seeing one does not see
Teachings Should be Recited in Concert
So Cunda you should all come together and recite in concert without disputing those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge comparing meaning with meaning and phrasing with phrasing so that this spiritual path may last for a long time That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
And what are those things I have taught from my direct knowledge
They are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven awakening factors and the noble eightfold path
These are the things I have taught from my own direct knowledge
Reaching Agreement
Suppose one of those spiritual companions who is training in harmony and mutual appreciation without fighting were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha
Now you might think
This venerable misconstrues the meaning and mistakes the phrasing
You should neither approve nor dismiss them but say
Reverend if this is the meaning the phrasing may either be this or that which is more fitting And if this is the phrasing the meaning may be either this or that which is more fitting
Suppose they reply
This phrasing fits the meaning better than that And this meaning fits the phrasing better than that
Without flattering or rebuking them you should carefully convince them by examining that meaning and that phrasing
Suppose another spiritual companion were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha
Now you might think
This venerable misconstrues the meaning but gets the phrasing right
You should neither approve nor dismiss them but say
Reverend if this is the phrasing the meaning may be either this or that which is more fitting
Suppose they reply
This meaning fits the phrasing better than that
Without flattering or rebuking you should carefully convince them by examining that meaning
Suppose another spiritual companion were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha
Now you might think
This venerable construes the meaning correctly but mistakes the phrasing
You should neither approve nor dismiss them but say
Reverend if this is the meaning the phrasing may be either this or that which is more fitting
Suppose they reply
This phrasing fits the meaning better than that
Without flattering or rebuking you should carefully convince them by examining that phrasing
Suppose another spiritual companion were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha
Now you might think
This venerable construes the meaning correctly and gets the phrasing right
Saying Good you should applaud and cheer that mendicants statement
and then say to them
We are fortunate reverend so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself so wellversed in the meaning and the phrasing as one of our spiritual companions
The Reasons for Allowing Requisites
Cunda I do not teach you solely for restraining defilements that affect the present life
Nor do I teach solely for protecting against defilements that affect lives to come
I teach both for restraining defilements that affect the present life and
protecting against defilements that affect lives to come
And thats why I have allowed robes for you that suffice
only for the sake of warding off cold and heat for warding off the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles and for covering up the private parts
I have allowed almsfood for you that suffices
only to sustain this body avoid harm and support spiritual practice so that you will put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and will keep on living blamelessly and at ease
I have allowed lodgings for you that suffice
only for the sake of warding off cold and heat for warding off the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat
I have allowed medicines and supplies for the sick for you that suffice
only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health
Indulgence in Pleasure
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure
You should say to them
What is that indulgence in pleasure
For there are many different kinds of indulgence in pleasure
These four kinds of indulgence in pleasure Cunda are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
What four
Its when some fool makes themselves happy and pleased by killing living creatures
This is the first kind of indulgence in pleasure
Furthermore someone makes themselves happy and pleased by theft
This is the second kind of indulgence in pleasure
Furthermore someone makes themselves happy and pleased by lying
This is the third kind of indulgence in pleasure
Furthermore someone amuses themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
This is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasure
These are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure that are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four ways
They should be told Not so
It isnt right to say that about you it misrepresents you with an untruth
These four kinds of indulgence in pleasure when developed and cultivated lead solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
What four
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is the first kind of indulgence in pleasure
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is the second kind of indulgence in pleasure
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption They meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
This is the third kind of indulgence in pleasure
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption It is without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
This is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasure
These are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure which when developed and cultivated lead solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four ways
They should be told Exactly so
Its right to say that about you it doesnt misrepresent you with an untruth
The Benefits of Indulgence in Pleasure
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
How many fruits and benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways
You should say to them
Four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways
What four
Firstly with the ending of three fetters a mendicant becomes a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
This is the first fruit and benefit
Furthermore a mendicantwith the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusionbecomes a oncereturner They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
This is the second fruit and benefit
Furthermore with the ending of the five lower fetters a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that world
This is the third fruit and benefit
Furthermore a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
This is the fourth fruit and benefit
These four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways
Things Impossible for the Perfected
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
The ascetics who follow the Sakyan are inconsistent
You should say to them
Reverends these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha not to be transgressed so long as life lasts
Suppose there was a boundary pillar or an iron pillar with deep foundations firmly embedded imperturbable and unshakable
In the same way these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha not to be transgressed so long as life lasts
A mendicant who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentcant transgress in nine respects
A mendicant with defilements ended cant deliberately take the life of a living creature take something with the intention to steal have sex tell a deliberate lie or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person And they cant make decisions prejudiced by favoritism hostility stupidity or cowardice
A mendicant who is perfected cant transgress in these nine respects
Questions and Answers
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
The ascetic Gotama demonstrates boundless knowledge and vision of the past but not of the future Whats up with that
Those wanderers like incompetent fools seem to imagine that one kind of knowledge and vision can be demonstrated by means of another kind of knowledge and vision
Regarding the past the Realized One has knowledge stemming from memory
He recollects as far as he wants
Regarding the future the Realized One has the knowledge born of awakening
This is my last rebirth Now there are no more future lives
If a question about the past is untrue false and pointless the Realized One does not reply
If a question about the past is true and substantive but pointless he does not reply
If a question about the past is true substantive and beneficial he knows the right time to reply
And the Realized One replies to questions about the future or the present in the same way
And so the Realized One has speech thats welltimed true meaningful in line with the teaching and training Thats why hes called the Realized One
In this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswhatever is seen heard thought known sought and explored by the mind all that has been understood by the Realized One
Thats why hes called the Realized One
From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguishedthrough the natural principle of extinguishment without anything left overeverything he speaks says and expresses is real not otherwise
Thats why hes called the Realized One
The Realized One does as he says and says as he does
Since this is so thats why hes called the Realized One
In this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansthe Realized One is the undefeated the champion the universal seer the wielder of power
The Undeclared Points
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
Is this your view A Realized One exists after death This is the only truth other ideas are silly
You should say to them
Reverend this has not been declared by the Buddha
The wanderers might say
Then is this your view A Realized One doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are silly
You should say to them
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
The wanderers might say
Then is this your view A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are silly
You should say to them
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
The wanderers might say
Then is this your view A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are silly
You should say to them
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
The wanderers might say
But why has this not been declared by the ascetic Gotama
You should say to them
Because its not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life It doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment Thats why it hasnt been declared by the Buddha
The Declared Points
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
But what has been declared by the ascetic Gotama
You should say to them
What has been declared by the Buddha is this This is sufferingThis is the origin of sufferingThis is the cessation of sufferingThis is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
The wanderers might say
But why has this been declared by the ascetic Gotama
You should say to them
Because its beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life
It leads to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment Thats why it has been declared by the Buddha
Views of the Past
Cunda I have explained to you as they should be explained the views that some rely on regarding the past
Shall I explain them to you in the wrong way
I have explained to you as they should be explained the views that some rely on regarding the future
Shall I explain them to you in the wrong way
What are the views that some rely on regarding the past
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
The self and the cosmos are eternal This is the only truth other ideas are silly
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
The self and the cosmos are not eternal
or both eternal and not eternal
or neither eternal nor not eternal
The self and the cosmos are made by oneself
or made by another
or made by both oneself and another
or they have arisen by chance not made by oneself or another
Pleasure and pain are eternal
or not eternal
or both eternal and not eternal
or neither eternal nor not eternal
Pleasure and pain are made by oneself
or made by another
or made by both oneself and another
or they have arisen by chance not made by oneself or another This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Regarding this I go up to the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
the self and the cosmos are eternal
Reverends is this what you say
The self and the cosmos are eternal
But when they say Yes
This is the only truth other ideas are silly
I dont acknowledge that
Why is that
Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic
I dont see any such expositions that are equal to my own still less superior
Rather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition
Regarding this I go up to the ascetics and brahmins who assert all the other views as described above
And in each case I dont acknowledge that
Why is that
Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic
I dont see any such expositions that are equal to my own still less superior
Rather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition
These are the views that some rely on regarding the past
Views of the Future
What are the views that some rely on regarding the future
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
The self is physical and sound after death
or it is nonphysical
or both physical and nonphysical
or neither physical nor nonphysical
or percipient
or nonpercipient
or neither percipient nor nonpercipient
or the self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up and doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Regarding this I go up to the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
the self is physical and sound after death
Reverends is this what you say
The self is physical and sound after death
But when they say Yes
This is the only truth other ideas are silly
I dont acknowledge that
Why is that
Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic
I dont see any such expositions that are equal to my own still less superior
Rather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition
Regarding this I go up to the ascetics and brahmins who assert all the other views as described above
And in each case I dont acknowledge that
Why is that
Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic
I dont see any such expositions that are equal to my own still less superior
Rather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition
These are the views that some rely on regarding the future which I have explained to you as they should be explained
Shall I explain them to you in the wrong way
I have taught and pointed out the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for giving up and going beyond all these views of the past and the future
What four
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
These are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation that I have taught for giving up and going beyond all these views of the past and the future
Now at that time Venerable Upavāṇa was standing behind the Buddha fanning him
He said to the Buddha
Its incredible sir its amazing
This exposition of the teaching is impressive sir
it is very impressive Sir what is the name of this exposition of the teaching
Well Upavāṇa you may remember this exposition of the teaching as The Impressive Discourse
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Upavāṇa was happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
With Kūṭadanta
The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata
There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā
Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest quality
Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice
Bulls bullocks heifers goats and ramsseven hundred of eachhad been led to the post for the sacrifice
The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying in a forest nearby
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then having departed Khāṇumataka they formed into companies and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā
Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap
He saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā
and addressed his steward
My steward why are the brahmins and householders headed for Ambalaṭṭhikā
The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
Theyre going to see that Master Gotama
Then Kūṭadanta thought
Ive heard that
the ascetic Gotama knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories
I dont know about that
but I wish to perform a great sacrifice
Why dont I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories
Then Kūṭadanta addressed his steward
Well then go to the brahmins and householders and say to them
Sirs the brahmin Kūṭadanta asks
you to wait as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama
Yes sir replied the steward and did as he was asked
The Qualities of Kūṭadanta
Now at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in Khāṇumata
thinking to participate in Kūṭadantas sacrifice
They heard that
Kūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic Gotama
They approached Kūṭadanta and said to him
Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama
Yes gentlemen it is true
Please dont
Its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama
For if you do so your reputation will diminish and his will increase
For this reason its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama
its appropriate that he comes to see you
You are well born on both your mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation
For this reason its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama
its appropriate that he comes to see you
Youre rich affluent and wealthy with lots of property and assets and lots of money and grain 
You recite and remember the hymns and have mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth You know philology and grammar and are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man 
You are attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty You are magnificent splendid remarkable to behold 
You are ethical mature in ethical conduct 
Youre a good speaker with a polished clear and articulate voice that expresses the meaning 
You teach the teachers of many and teach three hundred students to recite the hymns Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns wishing to learn the hymns 
Youre old elderly and senior advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life
The ascetic Gotama is young and has newly gone forth 
Youre honored respected revered venerated and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha 
and the brahmin Pokkharasāti 
You live in Khāṇumata a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest quality
For this reason its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama
its appropriate that he comes to see you
The Qualities of the Buddha
When they had spoken Kūṭadanta said to those brahmins
Well then gentlemen listen to why its appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama
and its not appropriate for him to come to see me
He is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation
For this reason its not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me
rather its appropriate for me to go to see him
When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle 
When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers 
He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth young blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life 
Though his mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful faces he shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness 
He is attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty He is magnificent splendid remarkable to behold 
He is ethical possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful 
Hes a good speaker with a polished clear and articulate voice that expresses the meaning 
Hes a teacher of teachers 
He has ended sensual desire and is rid of caprice 
He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action He doesnt wish any harm upon the community of brahmins 
He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage 
He went forth from a rich affluent and wealthy family 
People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him 
Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him 
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed 
He has the thirtytwo marks of a great man

While he is residing in a village or town nonhuman entities do not harass them 
He leads an order and a community and teaches a community and is said to be the best of the various religious founders He didnt come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins
Rather he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct 
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama 
King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama 
The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama 
Hes honored respected revered venerated and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha 
King Pasenadi of Kosala 
and the brahmin Pokkharasāti
The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā
Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest
and should be honored and respected as such
For this reason too its not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me
rather its appropriate for me to go to see him
This is the extent of Master Gotamas praise that I have learned But his praises are not confined to this
for the praise of Master Gotama is limitless
When he had spoken those brahmins said to him
According to Kūṭadantas praises if Master Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues itd be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him even if he had to carry his own provisions in a shoulder bag
Well then gentlemen lets all go to see the ascetic Gotama
The Story of King Mahāvijitas Sacrifice
Then Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Before sitting down to one side some of the brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha
Master Gotama Ive heard that
you know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories
I dont know about that
but I wish to perform a great sacrifice
Please teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Kūṭadanta replied
The Buddha said this
Once upon a time brahmin there was a king named Mahāvijita He was rich affluent and wealthy with lots of gold and silver lots of property and assets lots of money and grain and a full treasury and storehouses
Then as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
I have achieved human wealth and reign after conquering this vast territory Why dont I hold a large sacrifice That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness
Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him
Just now brahmin as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind
I have achieved human wealth and reign after conquering this vast territory
Why dont I perform a great sacrifice That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness
Brahmin I wish to perform a great sacrifice
Please instruct me It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness
When he had spoken the brahmin high priest said to him
Sir the kings realm is harried and oppressed Bandits have been seen raiding villages towns and cities and infesting the highways
But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed he would not be doing his duty
Now the king might think
Ill eradicate this outlaw threat by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment But thats not the right way to eradicate this barbarian obstacle
Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the kings realm
Rather here is a plan relying on which the outlaw threat will be properly uprooted
So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in farming and raising cattle
Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade
Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service
Then the people occupied with their own work will not harass the realm
The kings revenues will be great
When the country is secured as a sanctuary free of being harried and oppressed the happy people with joy in their hearts dancing with children at their breast will dwell as if their houses were wide open
The king agreed with the high priests advice and followed his recommendation
Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him
I have eradicated the outlaw threat And relying on your plan my revenue is now great
Since the country is secured as a sanctuary free of being harried and oppressed the happy people with joy in their hearts dancing with children at their breast dwell as if their houses were wide open
Brahmin I wish to perform a great sacrifice
Please instruct me It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness
The Four Accessories
In that case let the king announce this throughout the realm to the aristocrat vassals ministers and counselors welltodo brahmins and welloff householders both of town and country
I wish to perform a great sacrifice Please grant your approval gentlemen it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness
The king agreed with the high priests advice and followed his recommendation
And all of the people who were thus informed responded by saying
May the king perform a sacrifice It is time for a sacrifice great king
And so these four consenting factions became accessories to the sacrifice
The Eight Accessories
King Mahāvijita possessed eight factors
He was well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation
He was attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty He was magnificent splendid remarkable to behold
He was rich affluent and wealthy with lots of gold and silver lots of property and assets lots of money and grain and a full treasury and storehouses
He was powerful having an army of four divisions that was obedient and carried out instructions Hed probably prevail over his enemies just with his reputation
He was faithful generous a donor his door always open He was a wellspring of support making merit with ascetics and brahmins for paupers vagrants travelers and beggars
He was very learned in diverse fields of learning He understood the meaning of diverse statements saying
This is what that statement means that is what this statement means
He was astute competent and intelligent able to think issues through as they bear upon the past future and present
These are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessed
And so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrifice
Four More Accessories
And the brahmin high priest had four factors
He was well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation
He recited and remembered the hymns and had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
He was ethical mature in ethical conduct
He was astute and clever being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle
These are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessed
And so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrifice
The Three Modes
Next before the sacrifice the brahmin high priest taught the three modes to the king
Now though the king wants to perform a great sacrifice he might have certain regrets thinking
I shall lose a great fortune or
I am losing a great fortune or
I have lost a great fortune But the king should not harbor such regrets
These are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the king before the sacrifice
The Ten Respects
Next before the sacrifice the brahmin high priest dispelled the kings regret regarding the recipients in ten respects
There will come to the sacrifice those who kill living creatures and those who refrain from killing living creatures
As to those who kill living creatures the outcome of that is theirs alone
But as to those who refrain from killing living creatures it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heart
There will come to the sacrifice those who steal 
commit sexual misconduct 
use divisive speech 
use harsh speech 
talk nonsense 
are covetous 
have ill will 
have wrong view and those who have right view
As to those who have wrong view the outcome of that is theirs alone
But as to those who have right view it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heart
These are the ten respects in which the high priest dispelled the kings regret regarding the recipients before the sacrifice
The Sixteen Respects
Next while the king was performing the great sacrifice the brahmin high priest educated encouraged fired up and inspired the kings mind in sixteen respects
Now while the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might say
King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice but he did not announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country
Thats the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy
For the king did indeed announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country
Let the king know this as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heart
While the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might say
King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice but he did not announce it to the ministers and counselors welltodo brahmins and welloff householders both of town and country Thats the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy
For the king did indeed announce it to all these people
Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heart
While the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might say
that he does not possess the eight factors
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy
For the king does indeed possess the eight factors
Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heart
While the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might say
that the high priest does not possess the four factors
Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy
For the high priest does indeed possess the four factors
Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heart
These are the sixteen respects in which the high priest educated encouraged fired up and inspired the kings mind while he was performing the sacrifice
And brahmin in that sacrifice no cattle were killed no goats were killed and no chickens or pigs were killed There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures No trees were felled for the sacrificial post No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice
No bondservants employees or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful faces
Those who wished to work did so while those who did not wish to did not
They did the work they wanted to and did not do what they didnt want to
The sacrifice was completed with just ghee oil butter curds honey and molasses
Then the aristocrat vassals ministers and counselors welltodo brahmins and welloff householders of both town and country came to the king bringing abundant wealth and said
Sire this abundant wealth is specially for you alone may Your Highness accept it
Theres enough raised for me through regular taxes Let this be for you and here take even more
When the king turned them down they withdrew to one side to think up a plan
It wouldnt be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homes
King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice Let us make an offering as an auxiliary sacrifice
Then the aristocrat vassals of town and country set up gifts to the east of the sacrificial pit
The ministers and counselors of town and country set up gifts to the south of the sacrificial pit
The welltodo brahmins of town and country set up gifts to the west of the sacrificial pit
The welloff householders of town and country set up gifts to the north of the sacrificial pit
And brahmin in that sacrifice too no cattle were killed no goats were killed and no chickens or pigs were killed There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures No trees were felled for the sacrificial post No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice
No bondservants employees or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful faces
Those who wished to work did so while those who did not wish to did not
They did the work they wanted to and did not do what they didnt want to
The sacrifice was completed with just ghee oil butter curds honey and molasses
And so there were four consenting factions eight factors possessed by King Mahāvijita four factors possessed by the high priest
and three modes
Brahmin this is called the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories
When he said this those brahmins made an uproar
Hooray for such sacrifice Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrifice
But the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silence
So those brahmins said to him
How can you not applaud the ascetic Gotamas fine words
Its not that I dont applaud what he said
If anyone didnt applaud such fine words their head would explode
But gentlemen it occurs to me that
the ascetic Gotama does not say
So I have heard or It ought to be like this
Rather he just says
So it was then this is how it was then
It occurs to me that
the ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King Mahāvijita the owner of the sacrifice or else the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for him
Does Master Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice or having facilitated it and then when his body broke up after death being reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
I do recall that brahmin For at that time I was the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice
A Regular Gift as an Ongoing Family Sacrifice
But Master Gotama apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
There is brahmin
But what is it
The regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates
this sacrifice brahmin has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
What is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings yet are more fruitful and beneficial compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories
Because neither perfected ones nor those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice
Why is that
Because beatings and throttlings are seen there
But the regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates
perfected ones and those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice
Why is that
Because no beatings and throttlings are seen there
This is the cause brahmin this is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings yet are more fruitful and beneficial compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories
But Master Gotama apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories and those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
There is brahmin
But what is it
When someone gives a dwelling specially for the Saṅgha of the four quarters
But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
When someone with confident heart goes for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha
But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
When someone with a confident heart undertakes the training rules
to refrain from killing living creatures stealing sexual misconduct lying and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence
But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
There is brahmin
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha 
Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics 
They enter and remain in the first absorption 
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficial 
They enter and remain in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficial

They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision 
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficial
They understand  there is no return to any state of existence
This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficial
And brahmin there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice which is better and finer than this
Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower
When he had spoken Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
And these bulls bullocks heifers goats and ramsseven hundred of eachI release them I grant them life Let them eat green grass and drink cool water and may a cool breeze blow upon them
The Realization of the Fruit of StreamEntry
Then the Buddha taught Kūṭadanta step by step with
a talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven
He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciation
And when he knew that Kūṭadantas mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas
suffering its origin its cessation and the path
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye
in that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Kūṭadanta
Everything that has a beginning has an end
Then Kūṭadanta saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions He said to the Buddha
Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from me
The Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented Kūṭadanta got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
And when the night had passed Kūṭadanta had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time saying
Its time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Kūṭadanta together with the mendicant Saṅgha where he sat on the seat spread out
Then Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one side
Then the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired him with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and left
Long Discourses
The WheelTurning Monarch
Taking Refuge in Oneself
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Mātulā
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants be your own island your own refuge with no other refuge Let the teaching be your island and your refuge with no other refuge
And how does a mendicant do this
They meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Thats how a mendicant is their own island their own refuge with no other refuge Thats how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge with no other refuge
You should roam inside your own territory the domain of your fathers
If you roam inside your own territory the domain of your fathers Māra wont catch you or get hold of you
It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that this merit grows
King Daḷhanemi
Once upon a time mendicants there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extended to all four sides he achieved stability in the country and he possessed the seven treasures
He had the following seven treasures
the wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasure
He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemies
After conquering this land girt by sea he reigned by principle without rod or sword
Then after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his men
My good man when you see that the heavenly wheeltreasure has receded back from its place please tell me
Yes Your Majesty replied that man
After many thousand years had passed that man saw that the heavenly wheeltreasure had receded back from its place So he went to King Daḷhanemi and said
Please sire you should know that your heavenly wheeltreasure has receded back from its place
So the king summoned the crown prince and said
Dear prince my heavenly wheeltreasure has receded back from its place
Ive heard that
when this happens to a wheelturning monarch he does not have long to live
I have enjoyed human pleasures Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasures
Come dear prince rule this land surrounded by ocean
I shall shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
And so after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness
Seven days later the heavenly wheeltreasure vanished
Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said
Please sire you should know that the heavenly wheeltreasure has vanished
At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness
He went to the royal sage and said
Please sire you should know that the heavenly wheeltreasure has vanished
When he said this the royal sage said to him
Dont be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheeltreasure My dear the wheeltreasure is not inherited from your father
Come now my dear implement the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
If you do so its possible thaton a fifteenth day sabbath having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbaththe heavenly wheeltreasure will appear to you with a thousand spokes with rim and hub complete in every detail
The Noble Duties of a WheelTurning Monarch
But sire what are the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
Well then my dear relying only on principlehonoring respecting and venerating principle having principle as your flag banner and authorityprovide just protection and security for your court troops aristocrats vassals brahmins and householders people of town and country ascetics and brahmins beasts and birds
Do not let injustice prevail in the realm
Pay money to the penniless in the realm
And there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who avoid intoxication and negligence are settled in patience and gentleness and who tame calm and extinguish themselves From time to time you should go up to them and ask
Sirs what is skillful What is unskillful What is blameworthy What is blameless What should be cultivated What should not be cultivated Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness
Having heard them you should reject what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillful
These are the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
The WheelTreasure Appears
Yes Your Majesty replied the new king to the royal sage And he implemented the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
While he was implementing them on a fifteenth day sabbath he had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath
And the heavenly wheeltreasure appeared to him with a thousand spokes with rim and hub complete in every detail
Seeing this the king thought
I have heard that when the heavenly wheeltreasure appears to a king in this way he becomes a wheelturning monarch
Am I then a wheelturning monarch
Then the anointed king rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheeltreasure with his right hand saying
Roll forth O wheeltreasure Triumph O wheeltreasure
Then the wheeltreasure rolled towards the east
And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions In whatever place the wheeltreasure stood still there the king came to stay together with his army
And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to the wheelturning monarch and said
Come great king Welcome great king We are yours great king instruct us
The wheelturning monarch said
Do not kill living creatures Do not steal Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not lie Do not drink alcohol Maintain the current level of taxation
And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals
Then the wheeltreasure having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again rolled towards the south 
Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again it rolled towards the west 
Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again it rolled towards the north followed by the king together with his army of four divisions
In whatever place the wheeltreasure stood still there the king came to stay together with his army
And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to the wheelturning monarch and said
Come great king Welcome great king We are yours great king instruct us
The wheelturning monarch said
Do not kill living creatures Do not steal Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not lie Do not drink alcohol Maintain the current level of taxation
And so the rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals
And then the wheeltreasure having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean returned to the royal capital There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle illuminating the royal compound
On Subsequent WheelTurning Monarchs
And for a second time
and a third
and a seventh time a wheelturning monarch was established in exactly the same way And after many years the seventh wheelturning monarch went forth handing the realm over to the crown prince
Seven days later the heavenly wheeltreasure vanished
Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said
Please sire you should know that the heavenly wheeltreasure has vanished
At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness
But he didnt go to the royal sage and ask about the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
He just governed the country according to his own ideas
So governed the nations did not prosper like before as they had when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
Then the ministers and counselors the treasury officials military officers guardsmen and advisers gathered and said to the king
Sire when governed according to your own ideas the nations do not prosper like before as they did when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
In your realm are found ministers and counselors treasury officials military officers guardsmen and advisersboth ourselves and otherswho remember the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
Please Your Majesty ask us about the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
We will answer you
On the Period of Decline
So the anointed king asked the assembled ministers and counselors treasury officials military officers guardsmen and advisers about the noble duties of a wheelturning monarch
And they answered him
But after listening to them he didnt provide just protection and security Nor did he pay money to the penniless in the realm
And so poverty grew widespread
When poverty was widespread a certain person stole from others with the intention to commit theft
They arrested him
and presented him to the king saying
Your Majesty this person stole from others with the intention to commit theft
The king said to that person
Is it really true mister that you stole from others with the intention to commit theft
Its true sire
What was the reason
Sire I cant survive
So the king paid some money to that person saying
With this money mister keep yourself alive and provide for your mother and father partners and children Work for a living and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heaven
Yes Your Majesty replied that man
But then another man stole something from others
They arrested him
and presented him to the king saying
Your Majesty this person stole from others
The king said to that person
Is it really true mister that you stole from others
Its true sire
What was the reason
Sire I cant survive
So the king paid some money to that person saying
With this money mister keep yourself alive and provide for your mother and father partners and children Work for a living and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heaven
Yes Your Majesty replied that man
People heard about this
It seems the king is paying money to anyone who steals from others
It occurred to them
Why dont we steal from others
So then another man stole something from others
They arrested him
and presented him to the king saying
Your Majesty this person stole from others
The king said to that person
Is it really true mister that you stole from others
Its true sire
What was the reason
Sire I cant survive
Then the king thought
If I pay money to anyone who steals from others it will only increase the stealing
Id better make an end of this person finish him off and chop off his head
Then he ordered his men
Well then my men tie this mans arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum Then take him out the south gate and make an end of him finish him off and chop off his head
Yes Your Majesty they replied and did as he commanded
People heard about this
It seems the king is chopping the head off anyone who steals from others
It occurred to them
Wed better have sharp swords made Then when we steal from others well make an end of them finish them off and chop off their heads
They had sharp swords made Then they started to make raids on villages towns and cities and to infest the highways
And they chopped the heads off anyone they stole from
And so mendicants from not paying money to the penniless poverty became widespread When poverty was widespread theft became widespread When theft was widespread swords became widespread When swords were widespread killing living creatures became widespread And for the sentient beings among whom killing was widespread their lifespan and beauty declined
Those people lived for  years but their children lived for  years
Among the people who lived for  years a certain person stole something from others
They arrested him
and presented him to the king saying
Your Majesty this person stole from others
The king said to that person
Is it really true mister that you stole from others
No sire he said deliberately lying
And so mendicants from not paying money to the penniless poverty theft swords and killing became widespread
When killing was widespread lying became widespread
And for the sentient beings among whom lying was widespread their lifespan and beauty declined
Those people who lived for  years had children who lived for  years
Among the people who lived for  years a certain person stole something from others
Someone else reported this to the king
Your Majesty suchandsuch person stole from others he said going behind his back
And so mendicants from not paying money to the penniless poverty theft swords killing and lying became widespread
When lying was widespread backbiting became widespread And for the sentient beings among whom backbiting was widespread their lifespan and beauty declined
Those people who lived for  years had children who lived for  years
Among the people who lived for  years some were more beautiful than others
And the ugly beings coveting the beautiful ones committed adultery with others wives
And so mendicants from not paying money to the penniless poverty theft swords killing lying and backbiting became widespread
When backbiting was widespread sexual misconduct became widespread And for the sentient beings among whom sexual misconduct was widespread their lifespan and beauty declined
Those people who lived for  years had children who lived for  years
Among the people who lived for  years two things became widespread

Those people who lived for  years had children who lived for  years
Among the people who lived for  years wrong view became widespread
For the sentient beings among whom wrong view was widespread their lifespan and beauty declined

Among the people who lived for five hundred years three things became widespread
illicit desire immoral greed and wrong thoughts
For the sentient beings among whom these three things were widespread their lifespan and beauty declined
Those people who lived for five hundred years had some children who lived for two hundred and fifty years while others lived for two hundred years
Among the people who lived for two hundred and fifty years three things became widespread
lack of due respect for mother and father ascetics and brahmins and failure to honor the elders in the family
And so mendicants from not paying money to the penniless all these things became widespreadpoverty
backbiting
sexual misconduct
harsh speech and talking nonsense
desire and ill will
wrong view
illicit desire immoral greed and wrong thoughts
and lack of due respect for mother and father ascetics and brahmins and failure to honor the elders in the family
For the sentient beings among whom these things were widespread their lifespan and beauty declined
Those people who lived for two hundred and fifty years had children who lived for a hundred years
When People Live for Ten Years
There will come a time mendicants when these people will have children who live for ten years
Among the people who live for ten years girls will be marriageable at five
The following flavors will disappear
ghee butter oil honey molasses and salt
The best kind of food will be finger millet
just as fine rice with meat is the best kind of food today
The ten ways of doing skillful deeds will totally disappear and the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds will explode in popularity
Those people will not even have the word skillful still less anyone who does what is skillful
And anyone who disrespects mother and father ascetics and brahmins and fails to honor the elders in the family will be venerated and praised
just as the opposite is venerated and praised today
Therell be no recognition of the status of mother aunts or wives and partners of teachers and respected people
The world will become promiscuous like goats and sheep chickens and pigs and dogs and jackals
Theyll be full of hostility towards each other with acute ill will malevolence and thoughts of murder
Even a mother will feel like this for her child and the child for its mother
father for child child for father
brother for sister and sister for brother
Theyll be just like a deer hunter when he sees a deerfull of hostility ill will malevolence and thoughts of killing
Among the people who live for ten years there will be an interregnum of swords lasting seven days
During that time they will see each other as beasts
Sharp swords will appear in their hands
with which theyll take each others life crying Its a beast Its a beast
But then some of those beings will think
Let us neither be perpetrators nor victims Why dont we hide in thick grass thick jungle thick trees inaccessible riverlands or rugged mountains and survive on forest roots and fruits
So thats what they do
When those seven days have passed having emerged from their hiding places and embraced each other they will come together in one voice and cry
How fantastic dear being you live How fantastic dear being you live
The Period of Growth
Then those beings will think
Its because we undertook unskillful things that we suffered such an extensive loss of our relatives
Wed better do whats skillful
What skillful thing should we do
Why dont we refrain from killing living creatures Having undertaken this skillful thing well live by it
So thats what they do
Because of undertaking this skillful thing their lifespan and beauty will grow
Those people who live for ten years will have children who live for twenty years
Then those beings will think
Because of undertaking this skillful thing our lifespan and beauty are growing
Why dont we do even more skillful things
What skillful thing should we do
Why dont we refrain from stealing 
sexual misconduct 
backbiting 
harsh speech 
and talking nonsense
Why dont we give up covetousness 
ill will 
wrong view 
three things
illicit desire immoral greed and wrong thoughts
Why dont we pay due respect to mother and father ascetics and brahmins honoring the elders in our families Having undertaken this skillful thing well live by it
So thats what they do
Because of undertaking this skillful thing their lifespan and beauty will grow
Those people who live for twenty years will have children who live for forty years
Those people who live for forty years will have children who live for eighty years
then a hundred and sixty years
three hundred and twenty years
six hundred and forty years
 years
 years
 years
 years
 years
and finally  years
Among the people who live for  years girls will be marriageable at five hundred
The Time of King Saṅkha
Among the people who live for  years there will be just three afflictions greed starvation and old age
India will be successful and prosperous The villages towns and capital cities will be no more than a chickens flight apart
And the land will be as crowded as hell just full of people like a thicket of rushes or reeds
The royal capital will be our Benares but renamed Ketumati And it will be successful prosperous populous full of people with plenty of food
There will be  cities in India with the royal capital of Ketumati foremost
And in the royal capital of Ketumati a king named Saṅkha will arise a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion will extend to all four sides he will achieve stability in the country and possess the seven treasures
He will have the following seven treasures
the wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasure
He will have over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemies
After conquering this land girt by sea he will reign by principle without rod or sword
The Arising of the Buddha Metteyya
And the Blessed One named Metteyya will arise in the worldperfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
just as I have arisen today
He will realize with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand make it known to others just as I do today
He will teach the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he will reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
just as I do today
He will look after a Saṅgha of many thousand mendicants just as I look after a Saṅgha of many hundreds today
Then King Saṅkha will have the sacrificial post that had been built by King Mahāpanāda raised up
After staying there he will give it away to ascetics and brahmins paupers vagrants travelers and beggars Then having shaved off his hair and beard and dressed in ocher robes he will go forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha Metteyyas presence
Soon after going forth living withdrawn diligent keen and resolute he will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He will live having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Mendicants be your own island your own refuge with no other refuge Let the teaching be your island and your refuge with no other refuge
And how does a mendicant do this
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Thats how a mendicant is their own island their own refuge with no other refuge Thats how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge with no other refuge
On Long Life and Beauty for Mendicants
Mendicants you should roam inside your own territory the domain of your fathers
Doing so you will grow in life span beauty happiness wealth and power
And what is long life for a mendicant
Its when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm and active effort
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy and active effort
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development and active effort
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry and active effort
Having developed and cultivated these four bases of psychic power they may if they wish live on for the eon or whats left of the eon
This is long life for a mendicant
And what is beauty for a mendicant
Its when a mendicant is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken
This is beauty for a mendicant
And what is happiness for a mendicant
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
This is happiness for a mendicant
And what is wealth for a mendicant
Its when a monk meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
rejoicing 
equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
This is wealth for a mendicant
And what is power for a mendicant
Its when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
This is power for a mendicant
Mendicants I do not see a single power so hard to defeat as the power of Māra
It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that this merit grows
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
The Great Discourse on the Harvest of Deeds
On Past Lives
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery in the hut by the kari tree
Then after the meal on return from almsround several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion by the kari tree and this Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives came up among them
So it was in a past life such it was in a past life
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman the Buddha heard that discussion among the mendicants
So he got up from his seat and went to the pavilion where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants
Mendicants what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinished
The mendicants told him what had happened adding

That is what the Buddha said
When he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling
Soon after the Buddha left those mendicants discussed among themselves
Its incredible reverends its amazing the power and might of a Realized One
For he is able to recollect the caste names clans lifespan chief disciples and gatherings of disciples of the Buddhas of the past who have become completely extinguished cut off proliferation cut off the track finished off the cycle and transcended suffering
He knows the caste they were born in and also their names clans conduct qualities wisdom meditation and freedom
Is it because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings that he can recollect all these things
Or did deities tell him
But this conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion by the kari tree where he sat on the seat spread out
and addressed the mendicants
Mendicants what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinished
The mendicants told him what had happened adding
This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived

Would you like to hear a further Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives

How He Came to be Known as Vipassī
Then King Bandhuma had the brahmin soothsayers dressed in fresh clothes and satisfied all their needs
Then the king appointed nurses for Prince Vipassī
Some suckled him some bathed him some held him and some carried him on their hip
From when he was born a white parasol was held over him night and day with the thought
Dont let cold heat grass dust or damp bother him
He was dear and beloved by many people
like a blue water lily or a pink or white lotus
He was always passed from hip to hip
From when he was born his voice was charming graceful sweet and lovely
It was as sweet as the song of a cuckoobird found in the Himalayas
From when he was born Prince Vipassī had the power of clairvoyance which manifested as a result of past deeds He could see for a league all around both by day and by night
And he was unblinkingly watchful like the gods of the ThirtyThree
And because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful he came to be known as Vipassī
Then while King Bandhuma was sitting in judgment hed sit Prince Vipassī in his lap and explain the case to him
And sitting there in his fathers lap Vipassī would thoroughly consider the case and draw a conclusion using a logical procedure
So this was all the more reason for him to be known as Vipassī
Then King Bandhuma had three stilt longhouses built for himone for the winter one for the summer and one for the rainy season
and provided him with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Prince Vipassī stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season where he was entertained by musiciansnone of them men
The Old Man
Then after many thousand years had passed Prince Vipassī addressed his charioteer
My dear charioteer harness the finest chariots We will go to a park and see the scenery
Yes sir replied the charioteer He harnessed the chariots and informed the prince
Sire the finest chariots are harnessed
Please go at your convenience
Then Prince Vipassī mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out for the park
Along the way he saw an elderly man bent double crooked leaning on a staff trembling as he walked ailing past his prime
He addressed his charioteer
My dear charioteer what has that man done
For his hair and his body are unlike those of other men
That Your Majesty is called an old man
But why is he called an old man
Hes called an old man because now he has not long to live
But my dear charioteer am I liable to grow old Am I not exempt from old age
Everyone is liable to grow old Your Majesty including you Noone is exempt from old age
Well then my dear charioteer thats enough of the park for today
Lets return to the royal compound
Yes Your Majesty replied the charioteer and did so
Back at the royal compound the prince brooded miserable and sad
Damn this thing called rebirth since old age will come to anyone whos born
Then King Bandhuma summoned the charioteer and said
My dear charioteer I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park
I hope he was happy there
No Your Majesty the prince didnt enjoy himself at the park
But what did he see on the way to the park
And the charioteer told the king about seeing the old man and the princes reaction
The Sick Man
Then King Bandhuma thought
Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true
To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation
with which the prince amused himself
Then after many thousand years had passed Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more
Along the way he saw a man who was ill suffering gravely ill collapsed in his own urine and feces being picked up by some and put down by others
He addressed his charioteer
My dear charioteer what has that man done
For his eyes and his voice are unlike those of other men
That Your Majesty is called a sick man
But why is he called a sick man
Hes called an sick man hopefully he will recover from that illness
But my dear charioteer am I liable to fall sick Am I not exempt from sickness
Everyone is liable to fall sick Your Majesty including you Noone is exempt from sickness
Well then my dear charioteer thats enough of the park for today Lets return to the royal compound
Yes Your Majesty replied the charioteer and did so

My dear charioteer I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park I hope he was happy there
No Your Majesty the prince didnt enjoy himself at the park
But what did he see on the way to the park
And the charioteer told the king about seeing the sick man and the princes reaction
The Dead Man
Then King Bandhuma thought
Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true
To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation
with which the prince amused himself
Then after many thousand years had passed Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more
Along the way he saw a large crowd gathered making a bier out of garments of different colors
He addressed his charioteer
My dear charioteer why is that crowd making a bier
That Your Majesty is for someone whos departed
Well then drive the chariot up to the departed
Yes Your Majesty replied the charioteer and did so
When the prince saw the corpse of the departed he addressed the charioteer
But why is he called departed
Hes called departed because now his mother and father his relatives and kin shall see him no more and he shall never again see them
But my dear charioteer am I liable to die Am I not exempt from death
Will the king and queen and my other relatives and kin see me no more
And shall I never again see them
Everyone is liable to die Your Majesty including you Noone is exempt from death
The king and queen and your other relatives and kin shall see you no more
and you shall never again see them
Well then my dear charioteer thats enough of the park for today Lets return to the royal compound

Damn this thing called rebirth since old age sickness and death will come to anyone whos born
Then King Bandhuma summoned the charioteer and said
My dear charioteer I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park I hope he was happy there
No Your Majesty the prince didnt enjoy himself at the park
But what did he see on the way to the park
And the charioteer told the king about seeing the dead man and the princes reaction
The Renunciate
Then King Bandhuma thought
Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true
To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation
with which the prince amused himself
Then after many thousand years had passed Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more
Along the way he saw a man a renunciate with shaven head wearing an ocher robe
He addressed his charioteer
My dear charioteer what has that man done
For his head and his clothes are unlike those of other men
That Your Majesty is called a renunciate
But why is he called a renunciate
He is called a renunciate because he celebrates principled and fair conduct skillful actions good deeds harmlessness and compassion for living creatures
Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate who celebrates principled and fair conduct skillful actions good deeds harmlessness and compassion for living creatures
Well then drive the chariot up to that renunciate
Yes Your Majesty replied the charioteer and did so
Then Prince Vipassī said to that renunciate
My good man what have you done
For your head and your clothes are unlike those of other men
Sire I am what is called a renunciate
But why are you called a renunciate
I am called a renunciate because I celebrate principled and fair conduct skillful actions good deeds harmlessness and compassion for living creatures
Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate who celebrates principled and fair conduct skillful actions good deeds harmlessness and compassion for living creatures
The Going Forth
Then the prince addressed the charioteer
Well then my dear charioteer take the chariot and return to the royal compound
I shall shave off my hair and beard right here dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Yes Your Majesty replied the charioteer and did so
Then Prince Vipassī shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness
A Great Crowd Goes Forth
A large crowd of  people in the capital of Bandhumatī heard
that Vipassī had gone forth
It occurred to them
This must be no ordinary teaching and training no ordinary going forth in which Prince Vipassī has gone forth
If even the prince goes forth why dont we do the same
Then that great crowd of  people shaved off their hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and followed the one intent on awakening Vipassī by going forth from the lay life to homelessness
Escorted by that assembly Vipassī wandered on tour among the villages towns and capital cities
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
Its not appropriate for me to live in a crowd Why dont I live alone withdrawn from the group
After some time he withdrew from the group to live alone The  went one way but Vipassī went another
Vipassīs Reflections
Then as Vipassī the one intent on awakening was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
Alas this world has fallen into trouble Its born grows old dies passes away and is reborn yet it doesnt understand how to escape from this suffering from old age and death
Oh when will an escape be found from this suffering from old age and death
Then Vipassī thought
When what exists is there old age and death What is a condition for old age and death
Then through proper attention Vipassī comprehended with wisdom
When rebirth exists theres old age and death Rebirth is a condition for old age and death
Then Vipassī thought
When what exists is there rebirth What is a condition for rebirth
Then through proper attention Vipassī comprehended with wisdom
When continued existence exists theres rebirth Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Then Vipassī thought

Then Vipassī thought
When what exists is there consciousness What is a condition for consciousness
Then through proper attention Vipassī comprehended with wisdom
When name and form exist theres consciousness Name and form are a condition for consciousness
Then Vipassī thought
This consciousness turns back from name and form and doesnt go beyond that
It is to this extent that one may be reborn grow old die pass away or reappear That is
Name and form are conditions for consciousness Consciousness is a condition for name and form Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields The six sense fields are conditions for contact Contact is a condition for feeling Feeling is a condition for craving Craving is a condition for grasping Grasping is a condition for continued existence Continued existence is a condition for rebirth Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Origination origination Such was the vision knowledge wisdom realization and light that arose in Vipassī the one intent on awakening regarding teachings not learned before from another
Then Vipassī thought
When what doesnt exist is there no old age and death When what ceases do old age and death cease
Then through proper attention Vipassī comprehended with wisdom
When rebirth doesnt exist theres no old age and death When rebirth ceases old age and death cease
Then Vipassī thought
When what doesnt exist is there no rebirth When what ceases does rebirth cease

Then Vipassī thought

Then through proper attention Vipassī comprehended with wisdom

Then Vipassī thought
I have discovered the path to awakening That is

That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Cessation cessation Such was the vision knowledge wisdom realization and light that arose in Vipassī the one intent on awakening regarding teachings not learned before from another
Some time later Vipassī meditated observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates
Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling such is the origin of feeling such is the ending of feeling
Such is perception such is the origin of perception such is the ending of perception
Such are choices such is the origin of choices such is the ending of choices
Such is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousness
Meditating like this his mind was soon freed from defilements by not grasping
The Appeal of Brahmā
Then the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha thought
Why dont I teach the Dhamma
Then he thought
This principle I have discovered is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astute
But people like attachment they love it and enjoy it
Its hard for them to see this thing that is specific conditionality dependent origination
Its also hard for them to see this thing that is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishment
And if I were to teach the Dhamma others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for me
And then these verses which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to him
Ive struggled hard to realize this
enough with trying to explain it
This teaching is not easily understood
by those mired in greed and hate
Those caught up in greed cant see
whats subtle going against the stream
deep hard to see and very fine
for theyre shrouded in a mass of darkness
So as the Buddha Vipassī reflected like this his mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the Dhamma
Then a certain Great Brahmā knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking thought
Oh my goodness The world will be lost the world will perish For the mind of the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha inclines to remaining passive not to teaching the Dhamma
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī
He arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī and said
Sir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma
There are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teaching
There will be those who understand the teaching
When he said this the Buddha Vipassī said to him
I too thought this Brahmā
Why dont I teach the Dhamma
Then it occurred to me
If I were to teach the Dhamma others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for me
So as I reflected like this my mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the Dhamma
For a second time
and a third time that Great Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach
Then understanding Brahmās invitation the Buddha Vipassī surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha because of his compassion for sentient beings
And he saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did not
Its like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses
Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater
Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the waters surface And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them
In the same way the Buddha Vipassī saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes
Then that Great Brahmā knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking addressed him in verse
Standing high on a rocky mountain
you can see the people all around
In just the same way allseer wise one
having ascended the Temple of Truth
rid of sorrow look upon the people
swamped with sorrow oppressed by rebirth and old age
Rise hero Victor in battle leader of the caravan
wander the world without obligation
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma
There will be those who understand
Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed that Great Brahmā in verse
Flung open are the doors to the deathless
Let those with ears to hear decide their faith
Thinking it would be troublesome Brahmā I did not teach
the sophisticated sublime Dhamma among humans
Then the Great Brahmā knowing that his request for the Buddha Vipassī to teach the Dhamma had been granted bowed and respectfully circled him keeping him on his right before vanishing right there
The Chief Disciples
Then the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha thought
Who should I teach first of all
Who will quickly understand this teaching
Then he thought
That Khaṇḍa the kings son and Tissa the high priests son are astute competent clever and have long had little dust in their eyes
Why dont I teach them first of all They will quickly understand this teaching
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the tree of awakening and reappeared near the capital city of Bandhumatī in the deer park named Sanctuary
Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed the park keeper
My dear park keeper please enter the city and say this to the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa
Sirs the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary He wishes to see you
Yes sir replied the park keeper and did as he was asked
Then the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa had the finest carriages harnessed
Then they mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out from Bandhumatī for the Sanctuary
They went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the Buddha Vipassī on foot
They bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step with
a talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciation
And when he knew that their minds were ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas
suffering its origin its cessation and the path
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye
in that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa
Everything that has a beginning has an end
They saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma They went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions They said to the Buddha Vipassī
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
We go for refuge to the Blessed One and to the teaching
Sir may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddhas presence
And they received the going forth the ordination in the Buddha Vipassīs presence
Then the Buddha Vipassī educated encouraged fired up and inspired them with a Dhamma talk
He explained the drawbacks of conditioned phenomena so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of extinguishment
Being taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not grasping
The Going Forth of the Large Crowd
A large crowd of  people in the capital of Bandhumatī heard
that the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha had arrived at Bandhumatī and was staying in the deer park named Sanctuary
And they heard that the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa had shaved off their hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddhas presence
It occurred to them
This must be no ordinary teaching and training no ordinary going forth in which the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa have gone forth
If even they go forth why dont we do the same
Then those  people left Bandhumatī for the deer park named Sanctuary where they approached the Buddha Vipassī bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step with
a talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciation
And when he knew that their minds were ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas
suffering its origin its cessation and the path
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye
in that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those  people
Everything that has a beginning has an end
They saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma They went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions They said to the Buddha Vipassī
Excellent sir Excellent
And just like Khaṇḍa and Tissa they asked for and received ordination Then the Buddha taught them further
Being taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not grasping
The  Who Had Gone Forth Previously
The  people who had gone forth previously also heard
It seems the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary And he is teaching the Dhamma
Then they too went to see the Buddha Vipassī realized the Dhamma went forth and became freed from defilements
The Allowance to Wander
Now at that time a large Saṅgha of  mendicants were residing at Bandhumatī
As the Buddha Vipassī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large What if I was to urge them
Wander forth mendicants for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
Let not two go by one road
Teach the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
There are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teaching
There will be those who understand the teaching
But when six years have passed you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code
Then a certain Great Brahmā knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī
He arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī and said
Thats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy One
The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large Please urge them to wander as you thought
And sir Ill make sure that when six years have passed the mendicants will return to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code
Thats what that Great Brahmā said
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Vipassī keeping him on his right side before vanishing right there
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha Vipassī came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants telling them all that had happened Then he said
Wander forth mendicants for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
Let not two go by one road
Teach the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
There are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teaching
There will be those who understand the teaching
But when six years have passed you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code
Then most of the mendicants departed to wander the country that very day
Now at that time there were  monasteries in India
And when the first year came to an end the deities raised the cry
Good sirs the first year has ended
Now five years remain
When five years have passed you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code
And when the second year 
the third year 
the fourth year 
the fifth year came to an end the deities raised the cry
Good sirs the fifth year has ended
Now one year remains
When one year has passed you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code
And when the sixth year came to an end the deities raised the cry
Good sirs the sixth year has ended
Now is the time that you must go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code
Then that very day the mendicants went to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code Some went by their own psychic power and some by the psychic power of the deities
And there the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha recited the monastic code thus
Patient acceptance is the ultimate austerity
Extinguishment is the ultimate say the Buddhas
No true renunciate injures another
nor does an ascetic hurt another
Not to do any evil
to embrace the good
to purify ones mind
this is the instruction of the Buddhas
Not speaking ill nor doing harm
restraint in the monastic code
moderation in eating
staying in remote lodgings
commitment to the higher mind
this is the instruction of the Buddhas
Being Informed by Deities
At one time mendicants I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree
As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind
Its not easy to find an abode of sentient beings where I havent previously abided in all this long time except for the gods of the pure abodes
Why dont I go to see them
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared with the Aviha gods
In that order of gods many thousands many hundreds of thousands of deities approached me bowed stood to one side and said to me
Ninetyone eons ago good sir the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world perfected and fully awakened
He was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family
Koṇḍañña was his clan
He lived for  years
He was awakened at the root of a trumpet flower tree
He had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa
He had three gatherings of disciplesone of  one of  and one of all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements
He had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka
His father was King Bandhuma
his birth mother was Queen Bandhumatī
and their capital city was named Bandhumatī
And such was his renunciation such his going forth such his striving such his awakening and such his rolling forth of the wheel of Dhamma
And good sir after leading the spiritual life under that Buddha Vipassī we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn here
In that order of gods many hundreds of deities approached me bowed stood to one side and said to me
In the present fortunate eon good sir you have arisen in the world perfected and fully awakened
You were born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family
Gotama is your clan
For you the lifespan is short brief and fleeting A longlived person lives for a century or a little more
You were awakened at the root of a peepul tree
You have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna
You have had one gathering of disciples mendicants who had ended their defilements
You have as chief attendant a mendicant named nanda
Your father was King Suddhodana
your birth mother was Queen Māyā
and your capital city was Kapilavatthu
And such was your renunciation such your going forth such your striving such your awakening and such your rolling forth of the wheel of Dhamma
And good sir after leading the spiritual life under you we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn here
Then together with the Aviha gods I went to see the Atappa gods 
the Gods Fair to See 
and the Fair Seeing Gods
Then together with all these gods I went to see the Gods of Akaniṭṭha where we had a similar conversation
And that is how the Realized One is able to recollect the caste names clans lifespan chief disciples and gatherings of disciples of the Buddhas of the past who have become completely extinguished cut off proliferation cut off the track finished off the cycle and transcended suffering It is both because I have clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings
and also because the deities told me
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
About Pāṭikaputta
On Sunakkhatta
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas near the Mallian town named Anupiya
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Anupiya for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Anupiya
Why dont I go to the wanderer Bhaggavagottas monastery to visit him
So thats what he did
Then the wanderer Bhaggavagotta said to the Buddha
Come Blessed One
Welcome Blessed One
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
Please sir sit down this seat is ready
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
while Bhaggavagotta took a low seat sat to one side
and said to the Buddha
Sir a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said
Now Bhaggava I have rejected the Buddha
Now I no longer live dedicated to him
Sir is what Sunakkhatta said true
Indeed it is Bhaggava
A few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me bowed sat down to one side and said
Now I reject the Buddha
Now I shall no longer live dedicated to you
When Sunakkhatta said this I said to him
But Sunakkhatta did I ever say to you
Come live dedicated to me
No sir
Or did you ever say to me
Sir I shall live dedicated to the Buddha
No sir
So it seems that I did not ask you to
live dedicated to me
nor did you say you would
live dedicated to me
In that case you silly man are you really in a position to be rejecting anything
See how far you have strayed
But sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me
But Sunakkhatta did I ever say to you
Come live dedicated to me and I will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for you
No sir
Or did you ever say to me
Sir I shall live dedicated to the Buddha and the Buddha will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for me
No sir
So it seems that I did not ask this of you and you did not require it of me
In that case you silly man are you really in a position to be rejecting anything
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering
It does sir
So it seems that whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering
In that case what is the point of superhuman demonstrations of psychic power
See how far you have strayed you silly man
But sir the Buddha never describes the origin of the world to me
But Sunakkhatta did I ever say to you
Come live dedicated to me and I will describe the origin of the world to you
No sir
Or did you ever say to me
Sir I shall live dedicated to the Buddha and the Buddha will describe the origin of the world to me
No sir
So it seems that I did not ask this of you and you did not require it of me
In that case you silly man are you really in a position to be rejecting anything
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Whether or not the origin of the world is described does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering
It does sir
So it seems that whether or not the origin of the world is described my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering
In that case what is the point of describing the origin of the world
See how far you have strayed you silly man
In many ways Sunakkhatta you have praised me like this in the Vajjian capital
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
In many ways you have praised the teaching like this in the Vajjian capital
The teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
In many ways you have praised the Saṅgha like this in the Vajjian capital
The Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples is practicing the way thats good direct methodical and proper It consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world
I declare this to you Sunakkhatta I announce this to you
There will be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama Thats why he resigned the training and returned to a lesser life
Thats what theyll say
Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hell
On Korakkhattiya
Bhaggava this one time I was staying in the land of the Thūlus where they have a town named Uttarakā
Then I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe entered Uttarakā for alms with Sunakkhatta the Licchavi as my second monk
Now at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya had taken a vow to behave like a dog When food is tossed on the ground he gets down on all fours eating and devouring it just with his mouth
Sunakkhatta saw him doing this
and thought
That ascetic is a true holy man
Then knowing what Sunakkhatta was thinking I said to him
Dont you claim to be an ascetic a follower of the Sakyan you silly man
But why does the Buddha say this to me
When you saw that naked ascetic Korakkhattiya didnt you think
That ascetic is a true holy man
Yes sir
But sir are you jealous of the perfected ones
Im not jealous of the perfected ones you silly man
Rather you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
That naked ascetic Korakkhattiya who you imagine to be a true holy man will die of flatulence in seven days
And when he dies hell be reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the Kālakañjas
And theyll throw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver
If you wish Sunakkhatta go to Korakkhattiya and ask him
whether he knows his own destiny
Its possible that he will answer
Reverend Sunakkhatta I know my own destiny
Ive been reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the Kālakañjas
So Bhaggava Sunakkhatta went to see Korakkhattiya and said to him
Reverend Korakkhattiya the ascetic Gotama has declared
that you will die of flatulence in seven days
And when you die youll be reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the Kālakañjas
And when you die theyll throw you in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver
But by eating just a little food and drinking just a little water
youll prove what the ascetic Gotama says to be false
Then Sunakkhatta counted up the days until the seventh day as happens when you have no faith in the Realized One
But on the seventh day the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya died of flatulence
And when he passed away he was reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the Kālakañjas
And when he passed away they threw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver
Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this
So he went to see Korakkhattiya in the charnel ground on the clump of vetiver There he struck Korakkhattiya with his fist three times
Reverend Korakkhattiya do you know your destiny
Then Korakkhattiya got up rubbing his back with his hands and said
Reverend Sunakkhatta I know my own destiny
Ive been reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the Kālakañjas After speaking he fell flat right there
Then Sunakkhatta came to me bowed and sat down to one side
I said to him
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Did the declaration I made about Korakkhattiya turn out to be correct or not
It turned out to be correct
What do you think Sunakkhatta
If that is so has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not
Clearly sir a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed
Though I performed such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this
But sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me
See how far you have strayed
Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hell
On the Naked Ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka
This one time Bhaggava I was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka was residing in Vesālī And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material possessions and fame
He had undertaken these seven vows
As long as I live I will be a naked ascetic not wearing clothes As long as I live I will be celibate not having sex As long as I live I will consume only meat and alcohol not eating rice and porridge
And I will not go past the following tree shrines near Vesālī the Udena shrine to the east the Gotamaka to the south the Sattamba to the west and the Bahuputta to the north
And it was due to undertaking these seven vows that he had reached the peak of material possessions and fame
So Bhaggava Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and asked him a question
But when he couldnt answer it
he displayed annoyance hate and bitterness
So Sunakkhatta thought
Ive offended the holy man the perfected one the ascetic
I mustnt create lasting harm and suffering for myself
Then Sunakkhatta came to me bowed and sat down to one side
I said to him
Dont you claim to be an ascetic a follower of the Sakyan you silly man
But why does the Buddha say this to me
Didnt you go to see the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and ask him a question
But when he couldnt answer it
he displayed annoyance hate and bitterness
Then you thought
Ive offended the holy man the perfected one the ascetic
I mustnt create lasting harm and suffering for myself
Yes sir
But sir are you jealous of perfected ones
Im not jealous of the perfected ones you silly man
Rather you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
That naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka who you imagine to be a true holy man
will shortly be clothed living with a partner eating rice and porridge having gone past all the shrines near Vesālī And he will die after losing all his fame
And thats exactly what happened
Sunakkhatta heard about this
He came to me bowed and sat down to one side
I said to him
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Did the declaration I made about Kaḷāramaṭṭaka turn out to be correct or not
It turned out to be correct
What do you think Sunakkhatta
If that is so has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not
Clearly sir a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed
Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this
But sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me
See how far you have strayed
Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hell
On the Naked Ascetic Pāṭikaputta
This one time Bhaggava I was staying right there near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta was residing in Vesālī And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material possessions and fame
He was telling a crowd in Vesālī
Both the ascetic Gotama and I speak from knowledge
One who speaks from knowledge ought to display a superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from knowledge
If the ascetic Gotama meets me halfway
there we should both perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power
If he performs one demonstration of psychic power Ill perform two
If he performs two Ill perform four
If he performs four Ill perform eight
However many demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs Ill perform double
Then Sunakkhatta came to me bowed sat down to one side and told me of all this
I said to him
Sunakkhatta the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence unless he gives up that statement and that intention and lets go of that view
If he thinks he can
come into my presence without giving up those things his head may explode
Careful what you say Blessed One Careful what you say Holy One
But why do you say this to me Sunakkhatta
Sir the Buddha has definitively asserted that
Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into the Buddhas presence otherwise
his head may explode
But Pāṭikaputta might come into the Buddhas presence in disguise proving the Buddha wrong
Sunakkhatta would the Realized One make an ambiguous statement
But sir did you make that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputtas mind with your mind
Or did deities tell you about it
Both Sunakkhatta
For Ajita the Licchavi general has recently passed away and been reborn in the host of the ThirtyThree
He came and told me this
The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless sir
he is a liar
For he has declared of me in the Vajjian capital
Ajita the Licchavi general has been reborn in the Great Hell
But that is not true
I have been reborn in the host of the ThirtyThree
The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless sir
he is a liar
Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into the Buddhas presence otherwise
his head may explode
Thus I both made that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputtas mind with my mind
and deities told me about it
So Sunakkhatta Ill wander for alms in Vesālī After the meal on my return from almsround Ill go to Pāṭikaputtas monastery for the days meditation
Now you may tell him if you so wish
On Demonstrations of Psychic Power
Then Bhaggava I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe entered Vesālī for alms
After the meal on my return from almsround I went to Pāṭikaputtas monastery for the days meditation
Then Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesālī to see the very wellknown Licchavis and said to them
Sirs after his almsround the Buddha has gone to Pāṭikaputtas monastery for the days meditation
Come forth sirs come forth There will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics
So the very wellknown Licchavis thought
It seems there will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics
Lets go
Then he went to see the very wellknown welltodo brahmins rich householders and ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths and said the same thing
They all said
It seems there will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics
Lets go
Then all those very wellknown people went to Pāṭikaputtas monastery
That assembly was large Bhaggava there were many hundreds many thousands of them
Pāṭikaputta heard
It seems that very wellknown Licchavis welltodo brahmins rich householders and ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths have come forth
And the ascetic Gotama is sitting in my monastery for the days meditation
When he heard that he became frightened scared his hair standing on end
In fear he went to the PaleMoon Ebony Trunk Monastery of the wanderers
The assembly heard of this
and instructed a man
Come my man go to see Pāṭikaputta at the PaleMoon Ebony Trunk Monastery and say to him
Come forth Reverend Pāṭikaputta All these very wellknown people have come forth and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the days meditation
For you stated this in the assembly at Vesālī
Both the ascetic Gotama and I speak from knowledge
One who speaks from knowledge ought to display a superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from knowledge
If the ascetic Gotama meets me halfway
there we should both perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power
If he performs one demonstration of psychic power Ill perform two
If he performs two Ill perform four
If he performs four Ill perform eight
However many demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs Ill perform double
Come forth Reverend Pāṭikaputta halfway
The ascetic Gotama has come the first half and is sitting in your monastery
Yes sir replied that man and delivered the message
When he had spoken Pāṭika said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seat
Then that man said to Pāṭikaputta
Whats up Reverend Pāṭikaputta Is your bottom stuck to the bench or is the bench stuck to your bottom
You say Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as you might you cant get up from your seat
And as he was speaking Pāṭika said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seat
When that man knew
that Pāṭikaputta had lost
he returned to the assembly and said
Pāṭikaputta has lost sirs
He says Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he cant get up from his seat
When he said this I said to the assembly
The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence unless he gives up that statement and that intention and lets go of that view
If he thinks he can
come into my presence without giving up those things his head may explode
The first recitation section is finished
Then Bhaggava a certain Licchavi minister stood up and said to the assembly
Well then sirs wait a moment Ill go
Hopefully Ill be able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the assembly
So that minister went to see Pāṭikaputta and said
Come forth Reverend Pāṭikaputta Its best for you to come forth
All these very wellknown people have come forth and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the days meditation
You said youd meet the ascetic Gotama halfway
The ascetic Gotama has come the first half and is sitting in your monastery
The ascetic Gotama has told the assembly
that youre not capable of coming into his presence
Come forth Pāṭikaputta When you come forth well make you win and the ascetic Gotama lose
When he had spoken Pāṭikaputta said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seat
Then the minister said to Pāṭikaputta
Whats up Reverend Pāṭikaputta Is your bottom stuck to the bench or is the bench stuck to your bottom
You say Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as you might you cant get up from your seat
And as he was speaking Pāṭikaputta said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seat
When the Licchavi minister knew
that Pāṭikaputta had lost
he returned to the assembly and said
Pāṭikaputta has lost sirs
When he said this I said to the assembly
Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence otherwise
his head may explode
Even if the good Licchavis were to think
Lets bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him with a pair of oxen But either the straps will break or Pāṭikaputta will
Then Bhaggava Jāliya the pupil of the woodbowl ascetic stood up and said to the assembly
Well then sirs wait a moment Ill go
Hopefully Ill be able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the assembly
So Jāliya went to see Pāṭikaputta and said
Come forth Reverend Pāṭikaputta Its best for you to come forth
All these very wellknown people have come forth and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the days meditation
You said youd meet the ascetic Gotama halfway
The ascetic Gotama has come the first half and is sitting in your monastery
The ascetic Gotama has told the assembly
that youre not capable of coming into his presence
And he said that even if the Licchavis
try to bind you with straps and drag you with a pair of oxen either the straps will break or you will
Come forth Pāṭikaputta When you come forth well make you win and the ascetic Gotama lose
When he had spoken Pāṭikaputta said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seat
Then Jāliya said to Pāṭikaputta
Whats up Reverend Pāṭikaputta Is your bottom stuck to the bench or is the bench stuck to your bottom
You say Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as you might you cant get up from your seat
And as he was speaking Pāṭikaputta said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seat
When Jāliya knew
that Pāṭikaputta had lost he said to him
Once upon a time Reverend Pāṭikaputta it occurred to a lion king of beasts
Why dont I make my lair near a certain forest
Towards evening I can emerge from my den yawn look all around the four directions roar my lions roar three times and set out on the hunt
Having slain the very best of the deer herd and eaten the most tender flesh I could return to my den
And so thats what he did
Now there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lions leavings becoming arrogant and strong
He thought
What does the lion king of beasts have that I dont
Why dont I also make my lair near a certain forest
Towards evening I can emerge from my den yawn look all around the four directions roar my lions roar three times and set out on the hunt
Having slain the very best of the deer herd and eaten the most tender flesh I could return to my den
And so thats what he did
But when he tried to roar a lions roar he only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal And what is a pathetic jackals squeal next to the roar of a lion
In the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One you presume to attack the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Who are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas
When Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile
he said to him
Seeing himself as equal to the lion
the jackal presumed Im the king of the beasts
But in reality he only managed to yelp
and whats a sad jackals squeal to the roar of a lion
In the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One you presume to attack him
When Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile
he said to him
Following in the steps of another
seeing himself grown fat on scraps
until he doesnt even see himself
the jackal presumes hes a tiger
But in reality he only managed to yelp
and whats a sad jackals squeal to the roar of a lion
In the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One you presume to attack him
When Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile
he said to him
Gorged on frogs and mice from the barn
and carcasses tossed in the cemetery
thriving in the great empty wood
the jackal presumed Im the king of the beasts
But in reality he only managed to yelp
and whats a sad jackals squeal to the roar of a lion
In the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One you presume to attack the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Who are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas
When Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile
he returned to the assembly and said
Pāṭikaputta has lost sirs He says Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he cant get up from his seat
When he said this I said to the assembly
The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence unless he gives up that statement and that intention and lets go of that view
If he thinks he can
come into my presence without giving up those things his head may explode
The good Licchavis might even think
Lets bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him with a pair of oxen But either the straps will break or Pāṭikaputta will
Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence otherwise
his head may explode
Then Bhaggava I educated encouraged fired up and inspired that assembly with a Dhamma talk I released that assembly from the great bondage and lifted  beings from the great swamp Next I entered upon the fire element rose into the sky to the height of seven palm trees and created a flame another seven palm trees high blazing and smoking Finally I landed at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Then Sunakkhatta came to me bowed and sat down to one side
I said to him
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Did the declaration I made about Pāṭikaputta turn out to be correct or not
It turned out to be correct
What do you think Sunakkhatta
If that is so has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not
Clearly sir a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed
Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this
But sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me
See how far you have strayed
Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hell
On Describing the Origin of the World
Bhaggava I understand the origin of the world
I understand this and what goes beyond it Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding I have realized extinguishment within myself Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruin
There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as created by the Lord God by Brahmā
I go up to them and say
Is it really true that this is the venerables view
And they answer Yes
I say to them
But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the Lord God by Brahmā
But they cannot answer and they even question me in return
So I answer them
There comes a time when reverends after a very long period has passed this cosmos contracts
As the cosmos contracts sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance
There they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long time
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed this cosmos expands
As it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appears
Then a certain sentient beingdue to the running out of their lifespan or meritpasses away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā
There they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long time
But after staying there all alone for a long time they become dissatisfied and anxious
Oh if only another being would come to this state of existence
Then other sentient beingsdue to the running out of their lifespan or meritpass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that being
There they too are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long time
Now the being who was reborn there first thinks
I am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born
Why is that
Because first I thought
Oh if only another being would come to this state of existence
Such was my hearts wish and then these creatures came to this state of existence
And the beings who were reborn there later also think
This must be Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born
And we have been created by him
Why is that
Because we see that he was reborn here first and we arrived later
And the being who was reborn first is more longlived beautiful and illustrious than those who arrived later
Its possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence
Having done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessness
By dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no further
He who is Brahmāthe Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornis permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternity
We who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existence
This is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the Lord God by Brahmā
That is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you say
Bhaggava I understand the origin of the world
I understand this and what goes beyond it
Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding I have realized extinguishment within myself Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruin
There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as due to those depraved by play
I go up to them and say
Is it really true that this is the venerables view
And they answer Yes
I say to them
But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved by play
But they cannot answer and they even question me in return
So I answer them
Reverends there are gods named depraved by play
They spend too much time laughing playing and making merry
And in doing so they lose their mindfulness and they pass away from that host of gods
Its possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence
Having done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessness
By dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no further
The gods not depraved by play dont spend too much time laughing playing and making merry
So they dont lose their mindfulness and dont pass away from that host of gods
They are permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternity
But we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing playing and making merry In doing so we lost our mindfulness and passed away from that host of gods
We are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existence
This is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved by play
That is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you say
Bhaggava I understand the origin of the world
Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruin
There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as due to those who are malevolent
I go up to them and say
Is it really true that this is the venerables view
And they answer Yes
I say to them
But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those who are malevolent
But they cannot answer and they even question me in return
So I answer them
Reverends there are gods named malevolent
They spend too much time gazing at each other so they grow angry with each other and their bodies and minds get tired
They pass away from that host of gods
Its possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence
Having done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessness
By dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no further
The gods who are not malevolent dont spend too much time gazing at each other so they dont grow angry with each other their bodies and minds dont get tired and they dont pass away from that host of gods
They are permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternity
But we who were malevolent spent too much time gazing at each other so our minds grew angry with each other our bodies and minds got tired and we passed away from that host of gods
We are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existence
This is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those who are malevolent
That is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you say
Bhaggava I understand the origin of the world
Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruin
There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as having arisen by chance
I go up to them and say
Is it really true that this is the venerables view
And they answer Yes
I say to them
But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about by chance
But they cannot answer and they even question me in return
So I answer them
Reverends there are gods named nonpercipient beings
When perception arises they pass away from that host of gods
Its possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence
Having done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessness
By dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception but no further
The self and the cosmos arose by chance
Why is that
Because formerly I didnt exist Now from not being Ive changed into being
This is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about by chance
That is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you say
I understand this and what goes beyond it Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding I have realized extinguishment within myself Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruin
Though I speak and explain like this certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false hollow lying untruthful claim
The ascetic Gotama has a distorted perspective and so have his monks
When one enters and remains in the liberation of the beautiful at that time one only perceives what is ugly
But I dont say that
I say this
When one enters and remains in the liberation of the beautiful at that time one only perceives what is beautiful
They are the ones with a distorted perspective sir who regard the Buddha and the mendicants in this way
Sir I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful
Its hard for you to enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful since you have a different view creed preference practice and tradition
Come now Bhaggava carefully preserve the confidence that you have in me
If its hard for me to enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful since I have a different view creed preference practice and tradition
I shall carefully preserve the confidence that I have in the Buddha
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the wanderer Bhaggavagotta was happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
With Janavasabha
Declaring the Rebirths of People From Nādika and Elsewhere
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house
Now at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all over the nations the Kāsis and Kosalans Vajjis and Mallas Cetīs and Vasas Kurus and Pañcālas Macchas and Sūrasenas
This one was reborn here while that one was reborn there
Over fifty devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters Theyve been reborn spontaneously and will be extinguished there not liable to return from that world
More than ninety devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters and weakened greed hate and delusion Theyre oncereturners who will come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
In excess of five hundred devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters Theyre streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
When the devotees of Nādika heard about the Buddhas
answers to those questions they became uplifted and overjoyed full of rapture and happiness
Venerable nanda heard of the Buddhas statements and the Nādikans happiness
nandas Suggestion
Then Venerable nanda thought
But there were also Magadhan devoteesmany and of long standing toowho have passed away
Youd think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees who have passed away
But they too had confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and had fulfilled their ethics
The Buddha hasnt declared their passing
It would be good to do so for many people would gain confidence and so be reborn in a good place
That King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a just and principled king who benefited the brahmins and householders of town and country
People still sing his praises
That just and principled king who made us so happy has passed away Life was good under his dominion
He too had confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and had fulfilled his ethics
People say
Until his dying day King Bimbisāra sang the Buddhas praises
The Buddha hasnt declared his passing
It would be good to do so for many people would gain confidence and so be reborn in a good place
Besides the Buddha was awakened in Magadha
so why hasnt he declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees
If he fails to do so they will be dejected
After pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private nanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the Buddha
He bowed sat down to one side and told the Buddha of his concerns finishing by saying
Why hasnt the Buddha declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees If he fails to do so they will be dejected
Then nanda after making this suggestion regarding the Magadhan devotees got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Soon after nanda had left the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Nādika for alms
He wandered for alms in Nādika After the meal on his return from almsround he washed his feet and entered the brick house He paid heed paid attention and concentrated wholeheartedly on the fate of Magadhan devotees and sat on the seat spread out thinking
I shall know their destiny where they are reborn in the next life
And he saw where they had been reborn
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat Emerging from the brick house he sat on the seat spread out in the shade of the porch
Then Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir you look so serene your face seems to shine owing to the clarity of your faculties
Have you been abiding in a peaceful meditation today sir
The Buddha then recounted what had happened since speaking to nanda revealing that he had seen the destiny of the Magadhan devotees He continued
Janavasabha the Spirit
Then nanda an invisible spirit called out
I am Janavasabha Blessed One
I am Janavasabha Holy One
nanda do you recall having previously heard such a name as Janavasabha
No sir But when I heard the word I got goosebumps
I thought
This must be no ordinary spirit to bear such an exalted name as Janavasabha
After making himself heard while invisible nanda a very beautiful spirit appeared in front of me
And for a second time he called out
I am Bimbisāra Blessed One
I am Bimbisāra Holy One
This is the seventh time I have been reborn in the company of the Great King Vessavaṇa After passing away from there I am now able to become a king of nonhumans
Seven from here seven from there
fourteen transmigrations in all
Thats how many past lives
I can recollect
For a long time Ive known that I wont be reborn in the underworld but that I still hope to become a oncereturner
Its incredible and amazing that you the venerable spirit Janavasabha should say
For a long time Ive been aware that I wont be reborn in the underworld and also But I still hope to become a oncereturner But from what source do you know that youve achieved such a high distinction
None other than the Blessed Ones instruction None other than the Holy Ones instruction
From the day I had absolute devotion to the Buddha I have known that I wont be reborn in the underworld but that I still hope to become a oncereturner
Just now sir I had been sent out by the great king Vessavaṇa to the great king Virūḷhakas presence on some business and on the way I saw the Buddha giving his attention to the fate of the Magadhan devotees
But it comes as no surprise that I have heard and learned the fate of the Magadhan devotees in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking to his assembly
It occurred to me
I shall see the Buddha and inform him of this
These are the two reasons Ive come to see the Buddha
The Council of the Gods
Sir it was more than a few days agoon the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the entry to the rainy seasonwhen all the gods of the ThirtyThree were sitting together in the Hall of Justice
A large assembly of gods was sitting all around and the Four Great Kings were seated at the four directions
The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east facing west in front of his gods
The Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south facing north in front of his gods
The Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west facing east in front of his gods
The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north facing south in front of his gods
When the gods of the ThirtyThree have a gathering like this that is how they are seated
After that come our seats
Sir those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshone the other gods in beauty and glory
The gods of the ThirtyThree became uplifted and overjoyed at that full of rapture and happiness saying
The heavenly hosts swell while the demon hosts dwindle
Seeing the joy of those gods Sakka lord of gods celebrated with these verses
The gods rejoice
the ThirtyThree with their Lord
revering the Realized One
and the natural excellence of the teaching
and seeing the new gods
so beautiful and glorious
who have come here after leading
the spiritual life under the Buddha
They outshine the others
in beauty glory and lifespan
Here are the distinguished disciples
of he whose wisdom is vast
Seeing this they delight
the ThirtyThree with their Lord
revering the Realized One
and the natural excellence of the teaching
The gods of the ThirtyThree became even more uplifted and overjoyed at that saying
The heavenly hosts swell while the demon hosts dwindle
Then the gods of the ThirtyThree having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice advised and instructed the Four Great Kings on the subject
And each stood at his own seat without departing
The Kings were instructed
and heeded good advice
With clear and peaceful minds
they stood by their own seats
Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared surpassing the glory of the gods
Then Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
As indicated by the signslight arising and radiance appearingBrahmā will appear
For this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā namely light arising and radiance appearing
As indicated by the signs
Brahmā will appear
For this is the sign of Brahmā
a light vast and great
On Sanaṅkumāra
Then the gods of the ThirtyThree sat in their own seats saying
We shall find out what has caused that light and only when we have realized it shall we go to it
And the Four Great Kings did likewise
Hearing that the gods of the ThirtyThree agreed in unison
We shall find out what has caused that light and only when we have realized it shall we go to it
When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal form
For the gods of the ThirtyThree arent able to see a Brahmās normal appearance
When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory
as a golden statue outshines the human form
When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seat
They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised thinking
Now Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses
And the god on whose couch Brahmā sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness
like a king on the day of his coronation
Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid corporeal form taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha and appeared to the gods of the ThirtyThree
Rising into the air he sat crosslegged in the sky
like a strong man might sit crosslegged on a wellappointed couch or on level ground
Seeing the joy of those gods Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses
The gods rejoice
the ThirtyThree with their Lord
revering the Realized One
and the natural excellence of the teaching
and seeing the new gods
so beautiful and glorious
who have come here after leading
the spiritual life under the Buddha
They outshine the others
in beauty glory and lifespan
Here are the distinguished disciples
of he whose wisdom is vast
Seeing this they delight
the ThirtyThree with their Lord
revering the Realized One
and the natural excellence of the teaching
That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke
And while he was speaking on that topic his voice had eight qualities it was clear comprehensible charming audible rounded undistorted deep and resonant
He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes but it doesnt extend outside the assembly
When someone has a voice like this theyre said to have the voice of Brahmā
Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra having manifested thirtythree corporeal forms sat down on the couches of each of the gods of the ThirtyThree and addressed them
What do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
For consider those who have gone for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and have fulfilled their ethics When their bodies break up after death some are reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others some with the Gods Who Love to Create some with the Joyful Gods some with the Gods of Yama some with the Gods of the ThirtyThree and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings
And at the very least they swell the hosts of the fairies
That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke
And while he was speaking on that topic each of the gods fancied
The one sitting on my couch is the only one speaking
When one is speaking
all the forms speak
When one sits in silence
they all remain silent
But those gods imagine
the ThirtyThree with their Lord
that the one on their seat
is the only one to speak
The Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra merged into one corporeal form Then he sat on the couch of Sakka lord of gods and addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
Developing the Bases of Psychic Power
What do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the four bases of psychic power have been clearly described by the Blessed Onethe one who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddhafor the multiplication generation and transformation of corporeal forms through psychic power
What four
Its when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm and active effort
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy and active effort
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development and active effort
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry and active effort
These are the four bases of psychic power that have been clearly described by the Buddha for the multiplication generation and transformation of corporeal forms through psychic power
All the ascetics and brahmins in the past
or present who wield the many kinds of psychic power do so by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power
Gentlemen do you see such psychic might and power in me
Yes Great Brahmā
I too became so mighty and powerful by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power
That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke
And having spoken about that he addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
The Three Openings
What do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has understood the three opportunities for achieving happiness
What three
First take someone who lives mixed up with sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities
After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones properly attend to how it applies to them and practice accordingly
They live aloof from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities
That gives rise to pleasure and more than pleasure happiness
like the joy thats born from gladness
This is the first opportunity for achieving happiness
Next take someone whose coarse physical verbal and mental processes have not died down
After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones properly attend to how it applies to them and practice accordingly
Their coarse physical verbal and mental processes die down
That gives rise to pleasure and more than pleasure happiness
like the joy thats born from gladness
This is the second opportunity for achieving happiness
Next take someone who doesnt truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful
what is blameworthy and what is blameless what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated what is inferior and what is superior and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright
After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones properly attend to how it applies to them and practice accordingly
They truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful and so on
Knowing and seeing like this ignorance is given up and knowledge arises
That gives rise to pleasure and more than pleasure happiness
like the joy thats born from gladness
This is the third opportunity for achieving happiness
These are the three opportunities for achieving happiness that have been understood by the Buddha
That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke
And having spoken about that he addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
Mindfulness Meditation
What do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has clearly described the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for achieving what is skillful
What four
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body internallykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
As they meditate in this way they become rightly immersed in that and rightly serene
Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples bodies externally
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally 
Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples feelings externally
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally 
Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples minds externally
They meditate observing an aspect of principles internallykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
As they meditate in this way they become rightly immersed in that and rightly serene
Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples principles externally
These are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation that the Buddha has clearly described for achieving what is skillful
That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke
And having spoken about that he addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
Seven Prerequisites of Immersion
What do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has clearly described the seven prerequisites of immersion for the development and fulfillment of right immersion
What seven
Right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort and right mindfulness
Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites is called noble right immersion with its vital conditions and with its prerequisites
Right view gives rise to right thought
Right thought gives rise to right speech Right speech gives rise to right action Right action gives rise to right livelihood Right livelihood gives rise to right effort Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion Right immersion gives rise to right knowledge Right knowledge gives rise to right freedom
If anything should be rightly described as
a teaching thats well explained by the Buddha visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves and the doors to the deathless are flung open its this
For the teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselvesand the doors of the deathless are flung open
Whoever has experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and has the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones and whoever is spontaneously reborn and is trained in the teaching in excess of  such Magadhan devotees have passed away having ended three fetters Theyre streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
And there are oncereturners here too
And as for other people
who I think have shared in merit
I couldnt even number them
for fear of speaking falsely
That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke And while he was speaking on that topic this thought came to the great king Vessavaṇa
Its incredible its amazing That there should be such a magnificent Teacher and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching And that such achievements of high distinction should be made known
And then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra knowing what the great king Vessavaṇa was thinking said to him
What does Great King Vessavaṇa think In the past too there was such a magnificent Teacher and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching And such achievements of high distinction were made known
In the future too there will be such a magnificent Teacher and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching And such achievements of high distinction will be made known
That sir is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke to the gods of the ThirtyThree And the great king Vessavaṇa having heard and learned it in the presence of Brahmā as he was speaking on that topic informed his own assembly
And the spirit Janavasabha having heard and learned it in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking on that topic to his own assembly informed the Buddha
And the Buddha having heard and learned it in the presence of the spirit Janavasabha and also from his own direct knowledge informed Venerable nanda And Venerable nanda having heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha informed the monks nuns laymen and laywomen
And thats how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans
Long Discourses
With Ambaṭṭha
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala
He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala
The Section on Pokkharasāti
Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in Ukkaṭṭhā It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest quality
Pokkharasāti heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
The Brahmin Student Ambaṭṭha
Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha He was one who recited and remembered the hymns and had mastered in the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man He had been authorized as a master in his own teachers scriptural heritage of the three Vedas with the words
What I know you know
And what you know I know
Then Pokkharasāti addressed Ambaṭṭha
Dear Ambaṭṭha the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby 
Its good to see such perfected ones
Please dear Ambaṭṭha go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation
Through you I shall learn about Master Gotama
But sir how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation
Dear Ambaṭṭha the thirtytwo marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies no other
If he stays at home he becomes a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extends to all four sides he achieves stability in the country and he possesses the seven treasures
He has the following seven treasures
the wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasure
He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemies
After conquering this land girt by sea he reigns by principle without rod or sword
But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness he becomes a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha who draws back the veil from the world
But dear Ambaṭṭha I am the one who gives the hymns
and you are the one who receives them
Yes sir replied Ambaṭṭha He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti keeping him to his right He mounted a maredrawn chariot and together with several students set out for the forest near Icchānaṅgala
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and entered the monastery on foot
At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air
Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and said
Gentlemen where is Master Gotama at present
For we have come here to see him
Then those mendicants thought
This Ambaṭṭha is from a wellknown family and he is the pupil of the wellknown brahmin Pokkharasāti
The Buddha wont mind having a discussion together with such gentlemen
They said to Ambaṭṭha
Ambaṭṭha thats his dwelling with the door closed Approach it quietly without hurrying go onto the porch clear your throat and knock with the latch The Buddha will open the door
So he approached the Buddhas dwelling and knocked and the Buddha opened the door
Ambaṭṭha and the other students entered the dwelling
The other students exchanged greetings with the Buddha and when the greetings and polite conversation were over sat down to one side
But while the Buddha was sitting Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while walking around or standing
So the Buddha said to him
Ambaṭṭha is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachers walking around or standing while Im sitting speaking some polite words or other
The First Use of the Word Riffraff
No Master Gotama
For it is proper for one brahmin to converse with another while both are walking standing sitting or lying down
But as to these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman I converse with them as I do with Master Gotama
But Ambaṭṭha you must have come here for some purpose You should focus on that
Though this Ambaṭṭha is unqualified he thinks hes qualified What is that but lack of qualifications
When he said this Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of being described as unqualified He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself saying
The ascetic Gotama will be worsted He said to the Buddha
Master Gotama the Sakyan clan are rude
and argumentative
Riffraff they are and riffraff they remain They dont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahmins
It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyansriffraff that they aredont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahmins
And thats how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word riffraff for the first time
The Second Use of the Word Riffraff
But Ambaṭṭha how have the Sakyans wronged you
This one time Master Gotama I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher the brahmin Pokkharasāti
I approached the Sakyans in their meeting hall
Now at that time several Sakyans and Sakyan princes were sitting on high seats poking each other with their fingers giggling and playing together In fact they even presumed to giggle at me and didnt invite me to a seat
It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyansriffraff that they aredont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahmins
And thats how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word riffraff for the second time
The Third Use of the Word Riffraff
Even a little quail Ambaṭṭha speaks as she likes in her own nest
Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans own place Ambaṭṭha Its not worthy of the Venerable Ambaṭṭha to lose his temper over such a small thing
Master Gotama there are these four castes
aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers
Three of these castes
aristocrats merchants and workers
in fact succeed only in serving the brahmins
It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyansriffraff that they aredont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahmins
And thats how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word riffraff for the third time
The Word Son of Bondservants is Used
Then it occurred to the Buddha
This Ambaṭṭha puts the Sakyans down too much by calling them riffraff Why dont I ask him about his own clan
So the Buddha said to him
What is your clan Ambaṭṭha
I am a Kaṇhāyana Master Gotama
But recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father the Sakyans were the children of the masters while youre descended from the son of a female bondservant of the Sakyans
But the Sakyans claim King Okkāka as their grandfather
Once upon a time King Okkāka wishing to divert the royal succession to the son of his most beloved queen banished the elder princes from the realm
Okkāmukha Karakaṇḍa Hatthinika and Sinisūra
They made their home beside a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas where there was a large teak grove
For fear of diluting their lineage they slept with their own sisters
Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and counselors
Where sirs have the princes settled now
Sire there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas by a large grove of sāka the teak tree Theyve settled there
For fear of diluting their lineage they are sleeping with their own saka sisters
Then Ambaṭṭha King Okkāka expressed this heartfelt sentiment
The princes are indeed Sakyans The princes are indeed the best Sakyans
From that day on the Sakyans were recognized and he was their founder
Now King Okkāka had a female bondservant named Disā
She gave birth to a black boy
When he was born Black Boy said
Wash me mum bathe me Get this filth off of me I will be useful for you
Whereas these days when people see goblins they know them as goblins
in those days they knew goblins as blackboys
They said
He spoke as soon as he was borna blackboy is born A goblin is born
From that day on the Kaṇhāyanas were recognized and he was their founder
Thats how recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father the Sakyans were the children of the masters while youre descended from the son of a female bondservant of the Sakyans
When he said this those students said to him
Master Gotama please dont put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant
Hes wellborn a gentleman learned a good speaker and astute Hes capable of having a dialogue with Master Gotama about this
So the Buddha said to them
Well students if you think that
Ambaṭṭha is illborn not a gentleman uneducated a poor speaker witless and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with me
But if you think that
hes wellborn a gentleman learned a good speaker astute and capable of having a dialogue with me about this then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with me
He is capable of having a dialogue We will be silent and let Ambaṭṭha have a dialogue with Master Gotama
So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha
Well Ambaṭṭha theres a legitimate question that comes up You wont like it but you ought to answer anyway
If you dont answer but dodge the issue remain silent or simply leave your head will explode into seven pieces right here
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachers what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas and who is their founder
When he said this Ambaṭṭha kept silent
For a second time the Buddha put the question
and for a second time Ambaṭṭha kept silent
So the Buddha said to him
Answer now Ambaṭṭha Now is not the time for silence
If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha their head explodes into seven pieces there and then
Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇi holding a massive iron spear burning blazing and glowing stood in the sky above Ambaṭṭha thinking
If this Ambaṭṭha doesnt answer when asked a third time Ill blow his head into seven pieces there and then
And both the Buddha and Ambaṭṭha could see Vajirapāṇi
Ambaṭṭha was terrified shocked and awestruck Looking to the Buddha for shelter protection and refuge he sat down close by the Buddha and said
What did you say
Please repeat the question
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachers what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas and who is their founder
I have heard Master Gotama that it is just as you say
Thats the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas
and thats who their founder is
The Discussion of Ambaṭṭhas Heritage
When he said this those students made an uproar
It turns out Ambaṭṭha is illborn not a gentleman son of a Sakyan bondservant and that the Sakyans are sons of his masters
And it seems that the ascetic Gotama spoke only the truth though we presumed to rebuke him
Then it occurred to the Buddha
These students put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant Why dont I get him out of this
So the Buddha said to the students
Students please dont put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant
That Black Boy was an eminent sage
He went to a southern country and memorized the Prime Spell Then he approached King Okkāka and asked for the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī
The king said to him
Who the hell is this son of a bondservant to ask for the hand of my daughter Angry and upset he fastened a razortipped arrow
But he wasnt able to either shoot it or to relax it
Then the ministers and counselors approached the sage Black Boy and said
Spare the king sir
spare him
The king will be safe But if he shoots the arrow downwards there will be an earthquake across the entire realm
Spare the king sir and spare the country
Both king and country will be safe But if he shoots the arrow upwards there will be no rain in the entire realm for seven years
Spare the king sir spare the country and let there be rain
Both king and country will be safe and the rain will fall And if the king aims the arrow at the crown prince he will be safe and untouched
So the ministers said to Okkāka
Okkāka must aim the arrow at the crown prince
He will be safe and untouched
So King Okkāka aimed the arrow at the crown prince And he was safe and untouched
Then the king was terrified shocked and awestruck Scared by the prime punishment he gave the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī
Students please dont put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant That Black Boy was an eminent sage
The Supremacy of the Aristocrats
Then the Buddha addressed Ambaṭṭha
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Suppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl and they had a son
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins
He would Master Gotama
And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guests
They would
And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not
They would
And would he be kept from the women or not
He would not
And would the aristocrats anoint him as king
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because his maternity is unsuitable
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Suppose a brahmin boy was to sleep with an aristocrat girl and they had a son
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins
He would Master Gotama
And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guests
They would
And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not
They would
And would he be kept from the women or not
He would not
And would the aristocrats anoint him as king
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because his paternity is unsuitable
And so Ambaṭṭha the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior whether comparing women with women or men with men
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Suppose the brahmins for some reason were to shave a brahmins head inflict him with a sack of ashes and banish him from the nation or the city
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins
No Master Gotama
And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guests
No Master Gotama
And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not
No Master Gotama
And would he be kept from the women or not
He would be
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Suppose the aristocrats for some reason were to shave an aristocrats head inflict him with a sack of ashes and banish him from the nation or the city
Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins
He would Master Gotama
And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guests
They would
And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not
They would
And would he be kept from the women or not
He would not
At this point Ambaṭṭha that aristocrat has reached rock bottom with head shaven inflicted with a sack of ashes and banished from city or nation
Yet still the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior
Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse
The aristocrat is first among people
who take clan as the standard
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct
is first among gods and humans
That verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra not poorly sung well spoken not poorly spoken beneficial not harmful and it was approved by me
For I also say this
The aristocrat is first among people
who take clan as the standard
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct
is first among gods and humans
Knowledge and Conduct
But what Master Gotama is that conduct and what is that knowledge
Ambaṭṭha in the supreme knowledge and conduct there is no discussion of ancestry or clan or pride
You deserve me or You dont deserve me
Wherever there is giving and taking in marriage there is such discussion
Whoever is attached to questions of ancestry or clan or pride or to giving and taking in marriage is far from the supreme knowledge and conduct
The realization of supreme knowledge and conduct occurs when youve given up such things
But what Master Gotama is that conduct and what is that knowledge
Ambaṭṭha its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clan
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect 
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption 
This pertains to their conduct
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption 
This pertains to their conduct
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption 
This pertains to their conduct
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption 
This pertains to their conduct
This is that conduct
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision
This pertains to their knowledge 
They understand There is no return to any state of existence
This pertains to their knowledge
This is that knowledge
This mendicant is said to be accomplished in knowledge and also accomplished in conduct and also accomplished in knowledge and conduct
And Ambaṭṭha there is no accomplishment in knowledge and conduct that is better or finer than this
Four Drains
There are these four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conduct
What four
Firstly take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct plunges into a wilderness region carrying their stuff with a shoulderpole thinking
they will get by eating fallen fruit
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct
This is the first drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct
Furthermore take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit plunges into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket thinking
they will get by eating tubers and fruit
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct
This is the second drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct
Furthermore take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit or to get by eating tubers and fruit sets up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwells there serving the sacred flame
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct
This is the third drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct
Furthermore take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit or to get by eating tubers and fruit or to serve the sacred flame sets up a fire chamber in the central square and dwells there thinking
When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters I will honor them as best I can
In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct
This is the fourth drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct
These are the four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conduct
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Is this supreme knowledge and conduct seen in your own tradition
No Master Gotama
Who am I and my tradition compared with the supreme knowledge and conduct
We are far from that
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Since youre not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct have you with your tradition plunged into a wilderness region carrying your stuff with a shoulderpole thinking
you will get by eating fallen fruit
No Master Gotama
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Have you with your tradition  plunged into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket thinking
you will get by eating tubers and fruit
No Master Gotama
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Have you with your tradition  set up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwelt there serving the sacred flame
No Master Gotama
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Have you with your tradition  set up a fire chamber in the central square and dwelt there thinking
When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters I will honor them as best I can
No Master Gotama
So you with your tradition are not only inferior to the supreme knowledge and conduct
you are even inferior to the four drains that affect the supreme knowledge and conduct
But you have been told this by your teacher the brahmin Pokkharasāti
Who are these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman compared with conversation with the brahmins of the three knowledges Yet he himself has not even fulfilled one of the drains
See Ambaṭṭha how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged you
Being Like the Sages of the Past
But Pokkharasāti lives off an endowment provided by King Pasenadi of Kosala
But the king wont even grant him an audience face to face
When he consults he does so behind a curtain
Why wouldnt the king grant a face to face audience with someone whod receive his legitimate presentation of food
See Ambaṭṭha how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged you
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
Suppose King Pasenadi was holding consultations with warriorchiefs or chieftains while sitting on an elephants neck or on horseback or while standing on the mat in a chariot
And suppose hed get down from that place and stand aside
Then along would come a worker or their bondservant whod stand in the same place and continue the consultation
This is what King Pasenadi says and this too is what the king says
Though he spoke the kings words and gave the kings advice
does that qualify him to be the king or the kings minister
No Master Gotama
In the same way Ambaṭṭha the brahmin seers of the past were Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught
You might imagine that since youve learned their hymns by heart in your own tradition that makes you a hermit or someone on the path to becoming a hermit But that is not possible
What do you think Ambaṭṭha
According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachers
did those ancient brahmin hermits
nicely bathed and anointed with hair and beard dressed bedecked with jewels earrings and bracelets dressed in whiteamuse themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation like you do today in your tradition
No Master Gotama
Did they eat boiled fine rice garnished with clean meat with the dark grains picked out served with many soups and sauces like you do today in your tradition
No Master Gotama
Did they amuse themselves with girls wearing thongs that show off their curves like you do today in your tradition
No Master Gotama
Did they drive about in chariots drawn by mares with plaited manes whipping and lashing them onward with long goads like you do today in your tradition
No Master Gotama
Did they get men with long swords to guard them in fortresses with moats dug and barriers in place like you do today in your tradition
No Master Gotama
So Ambaṭṭha in your own tradition you are neither hermit nor someone on the path to becoming a hermit
Whoever has any doubt or uncertainty about me let them ask me and I will clear up their doubts with my answer
Seeing the Two Marks
Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and proceeded to begin walking mindfully
and Ambaṭṭha did likewise
Then while walking beside the Buddha Ambaṭṭha scrutinized his body for the thirtytwo marks of a great man
He saw all of them except for two
which he had doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
Then it occurred to the Buddha
This brahmin student Ambaṭṭha sees all the marks except for two
which he has doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Ambaṭṭha would see his retracted private parts
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongue
Then Ambaṭṭha thought
The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking none
He said to the Buddha
Well now sir I must go I have many duties and much to do
Please Ambaṭṭha go at your convenience
Then Ambaṭṭha mounted his maredrawn chariot and left
Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti had come out from Ukkaṭṭhā together with a large group of brahmins and was sitting in his own park just waiting for Ambaṭṭha
Then Ambaṭṭha entered the park
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the brahmin Pokkharasāti on foot
He bowed and sat down to one side and Pokkharasāti said to him
I hope dear Ambaṭṭha you saw the Master Gotama
I saw him sir
Well does he live up to his reputation or not
He does sir
Master Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking none
And did you have some discussion with him
And what kind of discussion did you have with him
Then Ambaṭṭha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed
Then Pokkharasāti said to Ambaṭṭha
Oh our bloody fake scholar our fake learned man who pretends to be proficient in the three Vedas A man who behaves like this ought when their body breaks up after death to be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Its only because you repeatedly attacked Master Gotama like that that he kept bringing up charges against us
Angry and upset he kicked Ambaṭṭha over
and wanted to go and see the Buddha right away
Pokkharasāti Visits the Buddha
Then those brahmins said to Pokkharasāti
Its much too late to visit the ascetic Gotama today
You can visit him tomorrow
So Pokkharasāti had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he mounted a carriage and with attendants carrying torches set out from Ukkaṭṭhā for the forest near Icchānaṅgala
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and entered the monastery on foot
He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama has my pupil the student Ambaṭṭha come here
Yes he has brahmin
And did you have some discussion with him
And what kind of discussion did you have with him
Then the Buddha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed
Then Pokkharasāti said to the Buddha
Ambaṭṭha is a fool Master Gotama Please forgive him
May the student Ambaṭṭha be happy brahmin
Then Pokkharasāti scrutinized the Buddhas body for the thirtytwo marks of a great man
He saw all of them except for two
which he had doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
Then it occurred to the Buddha
Pokkharasāti sees all the marks except for two
which he has doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Pokkharasāti would see his retracted private parts
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongue
Pokkharasāti thought
The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking none
He said to the Buddha
Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept todays meal from me
The Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented Pokkharasāti announced the time to him
Its time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Pokkharasāti together with the mendicant Saṅgha where he sat on the seat spread out
Then Pokkharasāti served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods while his students served the Saṅgha
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Pokkharasāti took a low seat and sat to one side
Then the Buddha taught him step by step with
a talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven
He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciation
And when the Buddha knew that Pokkharasātis mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas
suffering its origin its cessation and the path
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye
in that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Pokkharasāti
Everything that has a beginning has an end
Pokkharasāti Declares Himself a Lay Follower
Then Pokkharasāti saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions He said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there just so has Master Gotama made the Teaching clear in many ways
Together with my children wives retinue and ministers I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Just as Master Gotama visits other devoted families in Ukkaṭṭhā may he visit mine
The brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you rise in your presence give you a seat and water and gain confidence in their hearts That will be for their lasting welfare and happiness
Thats good of you to say householder
Long Discourses
With Mahāli
On the Brahmin Emissaries
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were residing in Vesālī on some business
They heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the Buddha
Now at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddhas attendant
The brahmin emissaries went up to him and said
Master Nāgita where is Master Gotama at present
For we want to see him
Its the wrong time to see the Buddha he is on retreat
So right there the brahmin emissaries sat down to one side thinking
Well go only after weve seen Master Gotama
On Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi
Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roof
He bowed stood to one side and said to Nāgita
Master Nāgita where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For we want to see him
Its the wrong time to see the Buddha he is on retreat
So right there Oṭṭhaddha also sat down to one side thinking
Ill go only after Ive seen the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Then the novice Sīha approached Nāgita
He bowed stood to one side and said to Nāgita
Sir Kassapa these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis have come here to see the Buddha Itd be good if these people got to see the Buddha
Well then Sīha tell the Buddha yourself
Yes sir replied Sīha
He went to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and told him of the people waiting to see him adding
Sir itd be good if these people got to see the Buddha
Well then Sīha spread out a seat in the shade of the dwelling
Yes sir replied Sīha and he did so
Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out
Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side
Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha Sir a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said
Mahāli soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years I see heavenly sights that are pleasant sensual and arousing but I dont hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant sensual and arousing
The heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta cannot hear do such sounds really exist or not
OneSided Immersion
Such sounds really do exist but Sunakkhatta cannot hear them
What is the cause sir what is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear them even though they really do exist
Mahāli take a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds
When they have developed immersion for that purpose
they see heavenly sights but dont hear heavenly sounds
Why is that
Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way
Furthermore take a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the southern quarter 
western quarter 
northern quarter 
above below across 
That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way
Take a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to hear heavenly sounds but not to see heavenly sights
When they have developed immersion for that purpose
they hear heavenly sounds but dont see heavenly sights
Why is that
Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way
Furthermore take a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the southern quarter 
western quarter 
northern quarter 
above below across 
That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way
Take a mendicant who has developed twosided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to both hear heavenly sounds and see heavenly sights
When they have developed immersion for that purpose
they both see heavenly sights and hear heavenly sounds
Why is that
Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way
Furthermore take a mendicant who has developed twosided immersion to the southern quarter 
western quarter 
northern quarter 
above below across 
That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way
This is the cause Mahāli this is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant sensual and arousing even though they really do exist
Surely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion
No Mahāli the mendicants dont lead the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion
There are other things that are finer for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me
The Four Noble Fruits
But sir what are those finer things
Firstly Mahāli with the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me
Furthermore a mendicantwith the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusionis a oncereturner They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
This too is one of the finer things
Furthermore with the ending of the five lower fetters a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that world
This too is one of the finer things
Furthermore a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
This too is one of the finer things
These are the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me
The Noble Eightfold Path
But sir is there a path and a practice for realizing these things
There is Mahāli
Well what is it
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
This is the path and the practice for realizing these things
On the Two Renunciates
This one time Mahāli I was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
Then two renunciates
the wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattikacame and exchanged greetings with me
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they stood to one side and said to me
Reverend Gotama are the soul and the body the same thing or they are different things
Well then reverends listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes reverend they replied
I said this
Take the case when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha 
Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics 
They enter and remain in the first absorption
When a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of them
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things
It would reverend
But reverends I know and see like this
Nevertheless I do not say
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things 
They enter and remain in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
When a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of them
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things
It would reverend
But reverends I know and see like this
Nevertheless I do not say
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision 
When a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of them
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things
It would reverend
But reverends I know and see like this
Nevertheless I do not say
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things

They understand  there is no return to any state of existence
When a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of them
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things
It would not reverend
But reverends I know and see like this
Nevertheless I do not say
The soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi was happy with what the Buddha said
Long Discourses
With Lohicca
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā
Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest quality
Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception
Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality they ought not inform anyone else For what can one person do for another
Suppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bond
Thats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for another
Lohicca heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Sālavatikā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika
Here dear Rosika go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
And then ask him whether he
together with the mendicant Saṅgha might please accept tomorrows meal from the brahmin Lohicca
Yes sir Rosika replied
He did as he was asked and
the Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented Rosika got up from his seat went to Lohicca and said to him
I gave the Buddha your message
and he accepted
And when the night had passed Lohicca had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time saying
Here dear Rosika go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time saying
Its time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Yes sir Rosika replied He did as he was asked
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants
Now Rosika was following behind the Buddha
and told him of Lohiccas views adding
Sir please dissuade him from that harmful misconception
Hopefully thatll happen Rosika hopefully thatll happen
Then the Buddha approached Lohiccas home where he sat on the seat spread out
Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
Questioning Lohicca
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Lohicca took a low seat and sat to one side
The Buddha said to him
Is it really true Lohicca that you have such a harmful misconception
Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality they ought not inform anyone else For what can one person do for another
Suppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bond
Thats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for another
Yes Master Gotama
What do you think Lohicca
Do you reside in Sālavatikā
Yes Master Gotama
Lohicca suppose someone were to say
The brahmin Lohicca reigns over Sālavatikā
He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Sālavatikā and not share them with anyone else
Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for those whose living depends on you or not
They would Master Gotama
But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly
Unkindly sir
But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility
Hostility sir
And when the heart is full of hostility is there right view or wrong view
Wrong view Master Gotama
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say
hell or the animal realm
What do you think Lohicca
Does King Pasenadi reign over Kāsī and Kosala
Yes Master Gotama
Lohicca suppose someone were to say
King Pasenadi reigns over Kāsī and Kosala
He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Kāsī and Kosala and not share them with anyone else
Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for yourself and others whose living depends on King Pasenadi or not
They would Master Gotama
But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly
Unkindly sir
But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility
Hostility sir
And when the heart is full of hostility is there right view or wrong view
Wrong view Master Gotama
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say
hell or the animal realm
So it seems Lohicca that should someone say such a thing either of Lohicca or of King Pasenadi
that is wrong view
In the same way suppose someone were to say
Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality they ought not inform anyone else For what can one person do for another
Suppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bond
Thats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for another
Now there are gentlemen who relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One achieve a high distinction such as the following they realize the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturn the fruit of nonreturn or the fruit of perfection And in addition there are those who ripen the seeds for rebirth in a heavenly state The person who spoke like that makes it difficult for them Theyre acting unkindly their heart is full of hostility and they have wrong view
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say
hell or the animal realm
Three Teachers Who Deserve to Be Reprimanded
Lohicca there are three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded
When someone reprimands such teachers the reprimand is true substantive legitimate and blameless
What three
Firstly take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness
They teach their disciples
This is for your welfare This is for your happiness
But their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the teachers instruction
That teacher deserves to be reprimanded
Venerable you havent reached the goal of the ascetic life and when you teach disciples
they proceed having turned away from the teachers instruction
Its like a man who makes advances on a woman though she pulls away or embraces her though she turns her back
Thats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one do for another
This is the first kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded
Furthermore take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness
They teach their disciples
This is for your welfare This is for your happiness
Their disciples do want to listen They pay attention and apply their minds to understand They dont proceed having turned away from the teachers instruction
That teacher deserves to be reprimanded
Venerable you havent reached the goal of the ascetic life and when you teach disciples
they dont proceed having turned away from the teachers instruction
Its like someone who abandons their own field and presumes to weed someone elses field Thats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one do for another
This is the second kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded
Furthermore take a teacher who has reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness
They teach their disciples
This is for your welfare This is for your happiness
But their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the teachers instruction
That teacher deserves to be reprimanded
Venerable you have reached the goal of the ascetic life yet when you teach disciples
they proceed having turned away from the teachers instruction
Suppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bond
Thats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for another
This is the third kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded
These are the three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded
When someone reprimands such teachers the reprimand is true substantive legitimate and blameless
A Teacher Who Does Not Deserve to Be Reprimanded
When he had spoken Lohicca said to the Buddha
But Master Gotama is there a teacher in the world who does not deserve to be reprimanded
There is Lohicca
But who is that teacher
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha 
Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics 
They enter and remain in the first absorption 
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded
When someone reprimands such a teacher the reprimand is false baseless illegitimate and blameworthy
They enter and remain in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded 
They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision 
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded 
They understand  there is no return to any state of existence
A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded When someone reprimands such a teacher the reprimand is false baseless illegitimate and blameworthy
When he had spoken Lohicca said to the Buddha
Suppose Master Gotama a person was on the verge of falling off a cliff and another person were to grab them by the hair pull them up and place them on firm ground
In the same way when I was falling off a cliff Master Gotama pulled me up and placed me on safe ground
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Long Discourses
What Came First
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery in the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being ordained
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air beneath the shade of the longhouse
Vāseṭṭha saw him
and said to Bhāradvāja
Reverend Bhāradvāja the Buddha is walking mindfully in the open air beneath the shade of the longhouse
Come reverend lets go to the Buddha
Hopefully well get to hear a Dhamma talk from him
Yes reverend replied Bhāradvāja
So they went to the Buddha bowed and walked beside him
Then the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha
Vāseṭṭha you are both brahmins by birth and clan and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family I hope you dont have to suffer abuse and insults from the brahmins
Actually sir the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical insults to the fullest extent
But how do the brahmins insult you
Sir the brahmins say
Only brahmins are the first caste other castes are inferior
