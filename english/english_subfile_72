for noone born can escape deathAs I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at homeI shall go forth from the lay life to homelessnessWell then sir please wait for a week so that we can instruct our sons and brothers in kingship When a week has passed we shall go forth Your destiny shall be oursA week is not too long sirs I will wait that longInforming the BrahminsThen the Great Steward also went to the seven welltodo brahmins and seven hundred bathed initiates and saidSirs please now find another teacher to teach you to recite the hymnsI wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAs I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at homeI shall go forth from the lay life to homelessnessPlease dont go forth from the lay life to homelessnessThe life of one gone forth is of little influence or profitwhereas the life of a brahmin is of great influence and profitPlease sirs dont say thatWho has greater influence and profit than myselfFor now I am like a king to kings like Brahmā to brahmins like a deity to householdersGiving up all that I shall go forthAs I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at homeI shall go forth from the lay life to homelessnessIf the Steward is going forth from the lay life to homelessness we shall do so too Your destiny shall be oursInforming the WivesThen the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and saidLadies please do whatever you wish whether returning to your own families or finding another husbandI wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAs I understand what Brahmā says about carrionstench its not easy to quell while living at homeI shall go forth from the lay life to homelessnessYou are the only family we want You are the only husband we wantIf you are going forth from the lay life to homelessness we shall do so too Your destiny shall be oursThe Great Steward Goes ForthWhen a week had passed the Great Steward shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessAnd when he had gone forth the seven anointed aristocrat kings the seven brahmins with seven hundred initiates the forty equal wives and many thousands of aristocrats brahmins householders and many harem women shaved off their hair and beards dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessEscorted by that assembly the Great Steward wandered on tour among the villages towns and capital citiesAnd at that time whenever he arrived at a village or town he was like a king to kings like Brahmā to brahmins like a deity to householdersAnd whenever people sneezed or tripped overtheyd sayHomage to the Great Steward Homage to the high priest for the sevenAnd the Great Steward meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willHe meditated spreading a heart full of compassion rejoicing equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willAnd he taught his disciples the path to rebirth in the company of BrahmāThose of his disciples who completely understood the Great Stewards instructionsat the breaking up of the body after death were reborn in the Brahmā realmOf those disciples who only partly understood the Great Stewards instructions some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Otherswhile some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Createor the Joyful Godsor the Gods of Yamaor the Gods of the ThirtyThreeor the Gods of the Four Great KingsAnd at the very least they swelled the hosts of the fairiesAnd so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain was not wasted but was fruitful and fertileDo you remember this Blessed OneI remember PañcasikhaI myself was the brahmin Great Steward at that timeAnd I taught those disciples the path to rebirth in the company of BrahmāBut that spiritual path of mine doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the Brahmā realmBut this spiritual path does lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentAnd what is the spiritual path that leads to extinguishmentIt is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionThis is the spiritual path that leads to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentThose of my disciples who completely understand my instructions realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsOf those disciples who only partly understand my instructions some with the ending of the five lower fetters become reborn spontaneously They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that worldSome with the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion become oncereturners They come back to this world once only then make an end of sufferingAnd some with the ending of three fetters become streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningAnd so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain was not wasted but was fruitful and fertileThat is what the Buddha saidDelighted the fairy Pañcasikha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right thereLong DiscoursesAdvice to SigālakaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundNow at that

householders son said to the BuddhaExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeLong DiscoursesThe Fruits of the Ascetic LifeA Discussion With the Kings MinistersSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near

Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministersThen Ajātasattu expressed this heartfelt sentimentOh sirs this moonlit night is so very delightful so beautiful so glorious so lovely so strikingNow what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today paying homage to whom my mind might find peaceWhen he had spoken one of the kings

lifeLet Your Majesty pay homage to himHopefully in so doing your mind will find peaceBut when he had spoken the king kept silentA Discussion With Jīvaka KomārabhaccaNow at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the kingThen the king said to himBut my dear Jīvaka why are you silentSire the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedLet Your Majesty pay homage to himHopefully in so doing your mind will find peaceWell then my dear Jīvaka have the elephants readiedYes Your Majesty replied Jīvaka He had around five hundred female elephants readied in addition to the kings bull elephant for riding Then he informed the kingThe elephants are ready sirePlease go at your convenienceThen King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants while he mounted his bull elephant With attendants carrying torches he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvakas mango groveBut as he drew near the mango grove the king became frightened scared his hair standing on endHe said to JīvakaMy dear Jīvaka I hope youre not deceiving meI hope youre not betraying meI hope youre not turning me over to my enemiesFor how on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of  mendicantsDo not fear great king do not fearI am not deceiving youor betraying youor turning you over to your enemiesGo forward great king go forward Those are lamps shining in the pavilionThe Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic LifeThen King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot where he asked JīvakaBut my dear Jīvaka where is the BuddhaThat is the Buddha great king that is the BuddhaHes sitting against the central column facing east in front of the Saṅgha of mendicantsThen the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one sideHe looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent like a still clear lake and expressed this heartfelt sentimentMay my son Prince Udāyibhadda be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoysHas your mind gone to one you love great kingI love my son sir Prince UdāyibhaddaMay he be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoysThen the king bowed to the Buddha raised his joined palms toward the Saṅgha and sat down to one sideHe said to the BuddhaSir Id like to ask you about a certain point if youd take the time to answerAsk what you wish great kingSir there are many different professional fieldsThese include elephant riders cavalry charioteers archers bannermen adjutants food servers warriorchiefs princes chargers great warriors heroes leatherclad soldiers and sons of bondservantsThey also include bakers barbers bathroom attendants cooks garlandmakers dyers weavers basketmakers potters accountants fingertalliers or those following any similar professions All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present lifeWith that they bring happiness and joy to themselves their parents their children and partners and their friends and colleagues And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heavenSir can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life thats likewise apparent in the present lifeGreat king do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahminsI do sirIf you wouldnt mind great king tell me how they answeredIts no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting hereWell speak then great kingThe Doctrine of Pūraṇa KassapaOne time sir I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same questionHe said to meGreat king the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish mutilate torture aggrieve oppress intimidate or when they encourage others to do the sameThey do nothing wrong when they kill steal break into houses plunder wealth steal from isolated buildings commit highway robbery commit adultery and lie If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razoredged chakram no evil comes of that and no outcome of evilIf you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing mutilating and torturing and encouraging others to do the same no evil comes of that and no outcome of evilIf you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same no merit comes of that and no outcome of meritIn giving selfcontrol restraint and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of meritAnd so when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the doctrine of inactionIt was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mangoI thoughtHow could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realmSo I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa KassapaI was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and leftThe Doctrine of Makkhali GosālaOne time sir I approached Makkhali Gosāla and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same questionGreat king there is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or conditionTheres no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beingsSentient beings are purified without cause or conditionOne does not act of ones own volition one does not act of anothers volition one does not act from a persons volition There is no power no energy no human strength or vigorAll sentient beings all living creatures all beings all souls lack control power and energy Molded by destiny circumstance and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirthThere are  million main wombs and  and  There are  deeds and five and three There are deeds and halfdeeds There are  paths  subeons six classes of rebirth and eight stages in a persons life There are  jīvaka ascetics  wanderers and  naked ascetics There are  faculties  hells and  realms of dust There are seven percipient embryos seven nonpercipient embryos and seven embryos without attachments There are seven gods seven humans and seven goblins There are seven lakes seven winds  winds seven cliffs and  cliffs There are seven dreams and  dreams There are  million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of sufferingAnd here there is no such thing as this By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little for that cannot bePleasure and pain are allotted Transmigration lasts only for a limited period so theres no increase or decrease no getting better or worseIts like how when you toss a ball of string it rolls away unravelingIn the same way after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of sufferingAnd so when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigrationIt was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mangoI thoughtHow could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realmSo I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Makkhali GosālaI was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and leftThe Doctrine of Ajita KesakambalaOne time sir I approached Ajita Kesakambala and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same questionGreat king there is no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightThis person is made up of the four primary elements When they die the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air The faculties are transferred to spaceFour men with a bier carry away the corpseTheir footprints show the way to the cemeteryThe bones become bleached Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashesGiving is a doctrine of moronsWhen anyone affirms a positive teaching its just hollow false nonsenseBoth the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and dont exist after deathAnd so when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the doctrine of annihilationismIt was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mangoI thoughtHow could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realmSo I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Ajita KesakambalaI was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and leftThe Doctrine of Pakudha KaccāyanaOne time sir I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same questionGreat king these seven substances are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarThey dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each otherWhat sevenThe substances of earth water fire air pleasure pain and the soul is the seventhThese seven substances are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarThey dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each otherAnd here there is noone who kills or who makes others kill noone who learns or who educates others noone who understands or who helps others understandIf you chop off someones head with a sharp sword you dont take anyones lifeThe sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substancesAnd so when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with something else entirelyIt was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mangoI thoughtHow could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realmSo I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pakudha KaccāyanaI was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and leftThe Doctrine of Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaOne time sir I approached Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same questionGreat king consider a Jain ascetic who is restrained in the fourfold restraintAnd how is a Jain ascetic restrained in the fourfold restraintIts when a Jain ascetic is obstructed by all water devoted to all water shaking off all water pervaded by all waterThats how a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraintWhen a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restrainttheyre called a knotless one who is selfrealized selfcontrolled and steadfastAnd so when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life he answered with the fourfold restraintIt was like someone who when asked about a mango answered with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit answered with a mangoI thoughtHow could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realmSo I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Nigaṇṭha NāṭaputtaI was displeased but did not express my displeasure Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it I got up from my seat and leftThe Doctrine of Sañjaya BelaṭṭhiputtaOne time sir I approached Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over I sat down to one side and asked him the same questionSuppose you were to ask me whether there is another world If I believed there was I would say soBut I dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not soSuppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world whether there both is and is not another world whether there neither is nor is not another world whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously whether there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds whether a Realized One exists after death

five years four years three years two years one year seven months six months five months four months three months two months one month a fortnight Let alone a fortnightanyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven days can expect one of two resultsenlightenment in the present life or if theres something left over nonreturnThe four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishmentThats what I said and this is why I said itThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesWith PoṭṭhapādaOn the Wanderer PoṭṭhapādaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikās singlehalled monastery for group debates set among the flaking palemoon ebony treesThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsThen it occurred to himIts too early to wander for alms in SāvatthīWhy dont I go to Mallikās monastery to visit the wanderer PoṭṭhapādaSo thats what he didNow at that time Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such astalk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existencePoṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceand hushed his own assemblyBe quiet good sirs dont make a soundHere comes the ascetic GotamaThe venerable likes quiet and praises quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachThen those wanderers fell silentThen the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapādawho said to himCome Blessed OneWelcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readyThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outwhile Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha said to himPoṭṭhapāda what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedOn the Cessation of PerceptionWhen he said this the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the BuddhaSir leave aside what we were sitting talking about just nowIt wont be hard for you to hear about that laterSir a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths were sitting together at the debating hall and this discussion came up among themHow does the cessation of perception happenSome of them saidA persons perceptions arise and cease without cause or reasonWhen they arise you become percipientWhen they cease you become nonpercipientThats how some describe the cessation of perceptionBut someone else saysThats not how it is gentlemen Perception is a persons selfWhen it enters you become percipientWhen it departs you become nonpercipientThats how some describe the cessation of perceptionBut someone else saysThats not how it is gentlemen There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and mightThey insert and extract a persons perceptionWhen they insert it you become percipientWhen they extract it you become nonpercipientThats how some describe the cessation of perceptionBut someone else saysThats not how it is gentlemen There are deities of great power and mightThey insert and extract a persons perceptionWhen they insert it you become percipientWhen they extract it you become nonpercipientThats how some describe the cessation of perceptionThat reminded me of the BuddhaSurely it must be the Blessed One the Holy One who is so skilled in such mattersThe Buddha is skilled and wellversed in the cessation of perceptionHow does the cessation of perception happenPerception Arises With a CauseRegarding this Poṭṭhapāda those ascetics and brahmins who say thata persons perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the startWhy is thatBecause a persons perceptions arise and cease with cause and reasonWith training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd what is that training said the BuddhaIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersedQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThe sensual perception that they had previously ceasesAt that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusionThats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd this is that training said the BuddhaFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThe subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion that they had previously ceasesAt that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersionThats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd this is that training said the BuddhaFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThe subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion that they had previously ceasesAt that time they have a subtle and true perception of equanimous blissThats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd this is that training said the BuddhaFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThe subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss that they had previously ceasesAt that time they have a subtle and true perception of neutral feelingThats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd this is that training said the BuddhaFurthermore a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite spaceThe perception of luminous form that they had previously ceasesAt that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite spaceThats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd this is that training said the BuddhaFurthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousnessThe subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space that they had previously ceasesAt that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousnessThats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd this is that training said the BuddhaFurthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingnessThe subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness that they had previously ceasesAt that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of nothingnessThats how with training certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions ceaseAnd this is that training said the BuddhaPoṭṭhapāda from the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception they proceed from one stage to the next gradually reaching the peak of perceptionStanding on the peak of perception they thinkIntentionality is bad for me its better to be free of itFor if I were to intend and choose these perceptions would cease in me and other coarser perceptions would ariseWhy dont I neither make a choice nor form an intentionThey neither make a choice nor form an intentionThose perceptions cease in them and other coarser perceptions dont ariseThey touch cessationAnd that Poṭṭhapāda is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awarenessWhat do you think PoṭṭhapādaHave you ever heard of this beforeThis is how I understand what the Buddha saidFrom the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception they proceed from one stage to the next gradually reaching the peak of perceptionStanding on the peak of perception they thinkIntentionality is bad for me its better to be free of itFor if I were to intend and choose these perceptions would cease in me and other coarser perceptions would ariseWhy dont I neither make a choice nor form an intentionThose perceptions cease in them and other coarser perceptions dont ariseThey touch cessationAnd that is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awarenessThats right PoṭṭhapādaDoes the Buddha describe just one peak of perception or manyI describe the peak of perception as both one and manyBut sir how do you describe it as one peak and as manyI describe the peak of perception according to the specific manner in which one touches cessationThats how I describe the peak of perception as both one and manyBut sir does perception arise first and knowledge afterwards Or does knowledge arise first and perception afterwards Or do they both arise at the same timePerception arises first and knowledge afterwards The arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledgeThey understandMy knowledge arose from a specific conditionThat is a way to understand howperception arises first and knowledge afterwards that the arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledgePerception and the SelfSir is perception a persons self or are perception and self different thingsBut Poṭṭhapāda do you believe in a selfI believe in a substantial self sir which is physical made up of the four primary elements and consumes solid foodSuppose there were such a substantial self PoṭṭhapādaIn that case perception would be one thing the self anotherHere is another way to understand how perception and self are different thingsSo long as that substantial self remains still some perceptions arise in a person and others ceaseThat is a way to understand how perception and self are different thingsSir I believe in a mindmade self which is complete in all its various parts not deficient in any facultySuppose there were such a mindmade self Poṭṭhapāda In that case perception would be one thing the self anotherHere is another way to understand how perception and self are different thingsSo long as that mindmade self remains still some perceptions arise in a person and others ceaseThat too is a way to understand how perception and self are different thingsSir I believe in a nonphysical self which is made of perceptionSuppose there were such a nonphysical self Poṭṭhapāda In that case perception would be one thing the self anotherHere is another way to understand how perception and self are different thingsSo long as that nonphysical self remains still some perceptions arise in a person and others ceaseThat too is a way to understand how perception and self are different thingsBut sir am I able to know whetherperception is a persons self or whether perception and self are different thingsIts hard for you to understand this since you have a different view creed preference practice and traditionWell if thats the case sirthen is this right The cosmos is eternal This is the only truth anything else is wrongThis has not been declared by me PoṭṭhapādaThen is this right The cosmos is not eternal This is the only truth anything else is wrongThis too has not been declared by meThen is this right The cosmos is finite  The cosmos is infinite  The soul and the body are the same thing  The soul and the body are different things  A Realized One exists after death  A Realized One doesnt exist after death  A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death  A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death This is the only truth anything else is wrongThis too has not been declared by meWhy havent these things been declared by the BuddhaBecause theyre not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentThats why I havent declared themThen what has been declared by the BuddhaI have declared this This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingWhy have these things been declared by the BuddhaBecause they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentThats why I have declared themThats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy OnePlease sir go at your convenienceThen the Buddha got up from his seat and leftSoon after the Buddha left those wanderers gave Poṭṭhapāda a comprehensive tonguelashingNo matter what the ascetic Gotama says Poṭṭhapāda agrees with himThats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy OneWe understand that the ascetic Gotama didnt make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so onWhen they said this Poṭṭhapāda said to themI too understand that the ascetic Gotama didnt make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so onNevertheless the practice that he describes is true real and accurate It is the regularity of natural principles the invariance of natural principlesSo how could a sensible person such as I not agree that what was well spoken by the ascetic Gotama was in fact well spokenOn Citta HatthisāriputtaThen after two or three days had passed Citta Hatthisāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda went to see the Buddha Citta Hatthisāriputta bowed and sat down to one sideBut the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda exchanged greetings with the Buddha and when the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sidePoṭṭhapāda told the Buddha what had happened after he left The Buddha saidAll those wanderers Poṭṭhapāda are blind and sightlessYou are the only one who seesFor I have taught and pointed out both things that are definitiveand things that are not definitiveAnd what things have I taught and pointed out that are not definitiveThe cosmos is eternal The cosmos is not eternal The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul is the same thing as the body The soul and the body are different things A Realized One exists after death A Realized One doesnt exist after death A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after deathAnd why havent I taught and pointed out such things that are not definitiveBecause those things arent beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentThats why I havent taught and pointed them outThings That Are DefinitiveAnd what things have I taught and pointed out that are definitiveThis is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingAnd why have I taught and pointed out such things that are definitiveBecause they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentThats why I have taught and pointed them outThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewThe self is exclusively happy and is sound after deathI go up to them and sayIs it really true that this is the venerables viewAnd they answer YesI say to themBut do you meditate knowing and seeing an exclusively happy worldAsked this they say NoI say to themBut have you perceived an exclusively happy self for a single day or night or even half a day or nightAsked this they say NoI say to themBut do you knowa path and a practice to realize an exclusively happy worldAsked this they say NoI say to themBut have you ever heard the voice of the deities reborn in an exclusively happy world sayingPractice well dear sirs practice directly so as to realize an exclusively happy worldFor this is how we practiced and we were reborn in an exclusively happy worldAsked this they say NoWhat do you think PoṭṭhapādaThis being so doesnt what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirSuppose Poṭṭhapāda a man were to sayWhoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her that I desireTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whether shes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes fromAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seenAsked this hed say YesWhat do you think PoṭṭhapādaThis being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirIn the same way the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views Doesnt what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirSuppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouseTheyd say to himMister that stilt longhouse that youre building a ladder fordo you know whether its to the north south east or west Or whether its tall or short or mediumAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister are you building a ladder for a longhouse that youve never even known or seenAsked this hed say YesWhat do you think PoṭṭhapādaThis being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirIn the same way the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views Doesnt what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirThree Kinds of ReincarnationPoṭṭhapāda there are these three kinds of reincarnationa substantial reincarnation a mindmade reincarnation and a nonphysical reincarnationAnd what is a substantial reincarnationIt is physical made up of the four primary elements and consumes solid foodWhat is a mindmade reincarnationIt is physical mindmade complete in all its various parts not deficient in any facultyWhat is a nonphysical reincarnationIt is nonphysical made of perceptionI teach the Dhamma for the giving up of these three kinds of reincarnationWhen you practice accordingly corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow Youll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom having realized it with your own insight in this very lifePoṭṭhapāda you might thinkCorrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom having realized it with ones own insight in this very life But such a life is sufferingBut you should not see it like thisCorrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom having realized it with ones own insight in this very life And there will be only joy and happiness tranquility mindfulness and awareness Such a life is blissfulIf others should ask usBut reverends what is that substantial reincarnation Wed answer like thisThis is that substantial reincarnationIf others should ask usBut reverends what is that mindmade reincarnation Wed answer like thisThis is that mindmade reincarnationIf others should ask usBut reverends what is that nonphysical reincarnation Wed answer like thisThis is that nonphysical reincarnationWhat do you think PoṭṭhapādaThis being so doesnt that statement turn out to have a demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirSuppose a man were to build a ladder for climbing up to a stilt longhouse right underneath that longhouseTheyd say to himMister that stilt longhouse that youre building a ladder fordo you know whether its to the north south east or west Or whether its tall or short or mediumThis is that stilt longhouse for which Im building a ladder right underneath itWhat do you think PoṭṭhapādaThis being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have a demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirWhen the Buddha had spoken Citta Hatthisāriputta saidSir while in a substantial reincarnation are the mindmade and nonphysical reincarnations fictitiousand only the substantial reincarnation realWhile in a mindmade reincarnation are the substantial and nonphysical reincarnations fictitiousand only the mindmade reincarnation realWhile in a nonphysical reincarnation are the substantial and mindmade reincarnations fictitiousand only the nonphysical reincarnation realWhile in a substantial reincarnation its not referred to as a mindmade or nonphysical reincarnationonly as a substantial reincarnationWhile in a mindmade reincarnation its not referred to as a substantial or nonphysical reincarnationonly as a mindmade reincarnationWhile in a nonphysical reincarnation its not referred to as a substantial or mindmade reincarnationonly as a nonphysical reincarnationCitta suppose they were to ask youDid you exist in the pastWill you exist in the futureDo you exist nowHow would you answerSir if they were to ask me thisId answer like thisI existed in the pastI will exist in the futureI exist nowThats how Id answerBut Citta suppose they were to ask youIs the reincarnation you had in the past your only real one and those of the future and present fictitiousIs the reincarnation you will have in the future your only real one and those of the past and present fictitiousIs the reincarnation you have now your only real one and those of the past and future fictitiousHow would you answerSir if they were to ask me thisId answer like thisThe reincarnation I had in the past was real at that time and those of the future and present fictitiousThe reincarnation I will have in the future will be real at the time and those of the past and present fictitiousThe reincarnation I have now is real at this time and those of the past and future fictitiousThats how Id answerIn the same way while in any one of the three reincarnations its not referred to as the other two only under its own nameFrom a cow comes milk from milk comes curds from curds come butter from butter comes ghee and from ghee comes cream of ghee And the cream of ghee is said to be the best of theseWhile its milk its not referred to as curds butter ghee or cream of gheeIts only referred to as milkWhile its curdor cream of ghee its not referred to as anything elseonly under its own nameIn the same way while in any one of the three reincarnations its not referred to as the other two only under its own nameThese are the worlds usages terms expressions and descriptions which the Realized One uses without misapprehending themWhen he had spoken the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the BuddhaExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeThe Ordination of Citta HatthisāriputtaBut Citta Hatthisāriputta said to the BuddhaExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceAnd Citta Hatthisāriputta received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after his ordination Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfectedLong DiscoursesThe Three KnowledgesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named ManasākaṭaHe stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of ManasākaṭaNow at that time several very wellknown welltodo brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa They includedthe brahmins Caṅkī Tārukkha Pokkharasāti Jāṇussoṇi Todeyya and othersThen as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding the variety of pathsVāseṭṭha said thisThis is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā namely that explained by the brahmin PokkharasātiBhāradvāja said thisThis is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā namely that explained by the brahmin TārukkhaBut neither was able to persuade the otherSo Vāseṭṭha said to BhāradvājaBhāradvāja the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of ManasākaṭaHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedCome lets go to see him and ask him about this matterAs he answers so well remember itYes sir replied BhāradvājaThe Variety of PathsSo they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation addingIn this matter we have a dispute a disagreement a difference of opinionSo Vāseṭṭha it seems that you say thatthe straight path is that explained by Pokkharasātiwhile Bhāradvāja says thatthe straight path is that explained by TārukkhaBut what exactly is your disagreement aboutAbout the variety of paths Master GotamaEven though brahmins describe different pathsthe Addhariya brahmins the Tittiriya brahmins the Chandoka brahmins and the Bavhadija brahminsall of them lead someone who practices them to the company of BrahmāIts like a village or town that has many different roads nearby yet all of them meet at that villageIn the same way even though brahmins describe different pathsthe Addhariya brahmins the Tittiriya brahmins the Chandoka brahmins and the Bavhadija brahminsall of them lead someone who practices them to the company of BrahmāQuestioning VāseṭṭhaDo you say they lead someone VāseṭṭhaI do Master GotamaDo you say they lead someone VāseṭṭhaI do Master GotamaDo you say they lead someone VāseṭṭhaI do Master GotamaWell of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas Vāseṭṭha is there even a single one who has seen Brahmā with their own eyesNo Master GotamaWell has even a single one of their teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyesNo Master GotamaWell has even a single one of their teachers teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyesNo Master GotamaWell has anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyesNo Master GotamaWell what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins namely Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taughtDid they sayWe know and see where Brahmā is or what way he liesNo Master GotamaSo it seems that none of the brahmins have seen Brahmā with their own eyesand not even the ancient hermitsclaimed to know where he isYet the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas sayWe teach the path to the company of that which we neither know nor seeThis is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of BrahmāWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaThis being so doesnt their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case Master GotamaGood VāseṭṭhaFor it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor seeSuppose there was a queue of blind men each holding the one in front the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeIn the same way it seems to me that the brahmins statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeTheir statement turns out to be a jokemere words void and hollowWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaDo the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do And do they pray to them and beseech them following their course from where they rise to where they set with joined palms held in worshipYes Master GotamaWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaThough this is so are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon sayingThis is the only straight path the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of the sun and moonNo Master GotamaSo it seems that even though the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon they are not able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moonBut it seems that even though they have not seen Brahmā with their own eyesthey still claimto teach the path to the company of that which they neither know nor seeWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaThis being so doesnt their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case Master GotamaGood Vāseṭṭha For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor seeThe Simile of the Finest Lady in the LandSuppose a man were to sayWhoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her that I desireTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whethershes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes fromAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seenAsked this hed say YesWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaThis being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirIn the same waydoesnt the statement of those brahmins turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case Master GotamaGood Vāseṭṭha For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor seeThe Simile of the LadderSuppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouseTheyd say to himMister that stilt longhouse that youre building a ladder fordo you know whether its to the north south east or west Or whether its tall or short or mediumAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister are you building a ladder for a longhouse that youve never even known or seenAsked this hed say YesWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaThis being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirIn the same waydoesnt the statement of those brahmins turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case Master GotamaGood VāseṭṭhaFor it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor seeThe Simile of the River AciravatīSuppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from itThen along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shoreStanding on the near shore theyd call out to the far shoreCome here far shore Come here far shoreWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaWould the far shore of the Aciravatī river come over to the near shore because of that mans call request desire or expectationNo Master GotamaIn the same way Vāseṭṭha the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas proceed having given up those things that make one a true brahmin and having undertaken those things that make one not a true brahmin Yet they sayWe call upon Indra We call upon Soma We call upon sāna We call upon Pajāpati We call upon Brahmā We call upon Mahiddhi We call upon YamaSo long as they proceed in this way its impossible that they will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of BrahmāSuppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from itThen along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shoreBut while still on the near shore their arms are tied tightly behind their back with a strong chainWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaCould that person cross over to the far shoreNo Master GotamaIn the same way the five kinds of sensual stimulation are called chains and fetters in the training of the Noble OneWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulation that are called chains and fetters in the training of the Noble OneThe brahmins proficient in the three Vedas enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escapeSo long as they enjoy them its impossible that they will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of BrahmāSuppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from itThen along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shoreBut theyd lie down wrapped in cloth from head to footWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaCould that person cross over to the far shoreNo Master GotamaIn the same way the five hindrances are called obstacles and hindrances and coverings and shrouds in the training of the Noble OneWhat fiveThe hindrances of sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubtThese five hindrances are called obstacles and hindrances and coverings and shrouds in the training of the Noble OneThe brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are hindered obstructed covered and shrouded by these five hindrancesSo long as they are so obstructed its impossible that they will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of BrahmāConvergingWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaHave you heard that the brahmins who are elderly and senior the teachers of teachers say whether Brahmā is possessive or notThat he is not Master GotamaIs his heart full of enmity or notIt is notIs his heart full of ill will or notIt is notIs his heart corrupted or notIt is notDoes he wield power or notHe doesWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaAre the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas possessive or notThey areAre their hearts full of enmity or notThey areAre their hearts full of ill will or notThey areAre their hearts corrupted or notThey areDo they wield power or notThey do notSo it seems that the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are possessive but Brahmā is notBut would brahmins who are possessive come together and converge with Brahmā who isnt possessiveNo Master GotamaGood Vāseṭṭha Its impossible that the brahmins who are possessive will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā who isnt possessiveAnd it seems that the brahmins have enmitycorruptionand do not wield power while Brahmā is the opposite in all these things But would brahmins who are opposite to Brahmā in all things come together and converge with himNo Master GotamaGood Vāseṭṭha Its impossible that such brahmins will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of BrahmāBut here the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas sink down where they have sat only to be torn apart all the while imagining that theyre crossing over to drier groundThats why the three Vedas of the brahmins are called a salted land and a barren land and a disasterWhen he said this Vāseṭṭha said to the BuddhaI have heard Master Gotama that you know the path to company with BrahmāWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaIs the village of Manasākaṭa nearbyYes it isWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaSuppose a person was born and raised in ManasākaṭaAnd as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to ManasākaṭaWould they be slow or hesitant to answerNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause they were born and raised in Manasākaṭa Theyre well acquainted with all the roads to the villageStill its possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the Brahmā realm or the practice that leads to the Brahmā realmI understand Brahmā the Brahmā realm and the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the Brahmā realmWhen he said this Vāseṭṭha said to the BuddhaI have heard Master Gotama that you teach the path to company with BrahmāPlease teach us that path and elevate this generation of brahminsWell then Vāseṭṭha listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied VāseṭṭhaTeaching the Path to BrahmāThe Buddha said thisIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersedThey meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willSuppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directionsIn the same way when the hearts release by love has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist thereThis is a path to companionship with BrahmāFurthermore a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willSuppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directionsIn the same way when the hearts release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist thereThis too is a path to companionship with BrahmāWhat do you think VāseṭṭhaWhen a mendicant meditates like this are they possessive or notThey are notIs their heart full of enmity or notIt is notIs their heart full of ill will or notIt is notIs their heart corrupted or notIt is notDo they wield power or notThey doSo it seems that that mendicant is not possessive and neither is BrahmāWould a mendicant who is not possessive come together and converge with Brahmā who isnt possessiveYes Master GotamaGood Vāseṭṭha Its possible that a mendicant who is not possessive will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of Brahmā who isnt possessiveAnd it seems that that mendicant has no enmitycorruptionand does wield power while Brahmā is the same in all these things Would a mendicant who is the same as Brahmā in all things come together and converge with himYes Master GotamaGood Vāseṭṭha Its possible that that mendicant will when the body breaks up after death be reborn in the company of BrahmāWhen he had spoken Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to himExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysWe go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeLong DiscoursesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicantsThere Sāriputta addressed the mendicantsReverends mendicantsReverend they repliedSāriputta said thisI will relate the teachingsup to ten for attaining extinguishmentfor making an end of sufferingthe release from all tiesGroups of OneReverends one thing is helpful one thing should be developed one thing should be completely understood one thing

mendicant has faith in the Realized Ones awakeningThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedThey are rarely ill or unwell Their stomach digests well being neither too hot nor too cold but just right and fit for meditationTheyre not devious or deceitful They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companionsThey live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities Theyre strong staunchly vigorous not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualitiesTheyre wise They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble penetrative and leads to the complete ending of sufferingWhat five things should be developedRight immersion with five factorspervaded with rapture pervaded with pleasure pervaded with mind pervaded with light and the foundation for reviewingWhat five things should be completely understoodFive grasping aggregatesform feeling perception choices and consciousnessWhat five things should be given upFive hindrancessensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubtWhat five things make things worseFive kinds of emotional barrennessFirstly a mendicant has doubts about the Teacher Theyre uncertain undecided and lacking confidenceThis being so their mind doesnt incline toward keenness commitment persistence and strivingThis is the first kind of emotional barrennessFurthermore a mendicant has doubts about the teaching the Saṅgha the training A mendicant is angry and upset with their spiritual companions resentful and closed offThis being so their mind doesnt incline toward keenness commitment persistence and strivingThis is the fifth kind of emotional barrennessWhat five things lead to distinctionFive facultiesfaith energy mindfulness immersion and wisdomWhat five things are hard to comprehendFive elements of escapeA mendicant focuses on sensual pleasures but their mind isnt eager confident settled and decided about themBut when they focus on renunciation their mind is eager confident settled and decided about itTheir mind is in a good state well developed well risen well freed and well detached from sensual pleasuresTheyre freed from the distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of sensual pleasures so they dont experience that kind of feelingThis is how the escape from sensual pleasures is explainedTake another case where a mendicant focuses on

awakened to by the Realized OneThis is what Venerable Sāriputta saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta saidThe Long Discourses are completedLong DiscoursesReciting in ConcertSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Mallian town named PāvāThere he stayed in Cunda the smiths mango groveNow at that time a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka had recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at allThe Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Cundas mango groveThen they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka has recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at allMay the Buddha be the first to use it and only then will the Mallas of Pāvā use itThat would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Mallas of PāvāThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented the Mallas got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right Then they went to the new town hall where they spread carpets all over prepared seats set up a water jar and placed a lamp Then they went back to the Buddhabowed stood to one sideand told him of their preparations sayingPlease sir come at your convenienceThen the Buddha robed up and taking his bowl and robe went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing eastThe Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the west wall facing east with the Buddha right in front of themThe Mallas of Pāvā also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the east wall facing west with the Buddha right in front of themThe Buddha spent most of the night educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the Mallas with a Dhamma talk Then he dismissed themThe night is getting late VāseṭṭhasPlease go at your convenienceYes sir replied the Mallas They got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right before leavingSoon after they left the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent He addressed Venerable SāriputtaSāriputta the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsinessGive them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspiredMy back is soreIll stretch itYes sir Sāriputta repliedAnd then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting upNow at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at PāvāWith his passing the Jain ascetics split dividing into two factions arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed wordsYou dont understand this teaching and trainingI understand this teaching and trainingWhat you understand this teaching and training Youre practicing wrongIm practicing rightI stay on topic you dont You said last what you should have said first You said first what you should have said last What youve thought so much about has been disproved Your doctrine is refuted Go on save your doctrine Youre trapped get yourself out of thisif you canYoud think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain asceticsAnd the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputtas whiteclothed lay disciples were disillusioned dismayed and disappointed in the Jain ascetics They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha with broken monument and without a refugeThen Sāriputta told the mendicants about these things He went on to sayThats what happens reverends when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened BuddhaBut this teaching is well explained and well propounded to us by the Blessed One emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened BuddhaYou should all recite this in concert without disputing so that this spiritual path may last for a long time That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people for the

have heardAt one time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Kosalan citadel named SetavyāHe stayed in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of SetavyāNow at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi was living in Setavyā It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest qualityOn PāyāsiNow at that time Pāyāsi had the following harmful misconceptionTheres no afterlife No beings are reborn spontaneously Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deedsThe brahmins and householders of Setavyā heardIt seems the ascetic Kassapa the Princea disciple of the ascetic Gotamais staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of SetavyāHe has this good reputationHe is astute competent intelligent learned a brilliant speaker eloquent mature a perfected oneIts good to see such perfected onesThen having departed Setavyā they formed into companies and headed north to the groveNow at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday napHe saw the brahmins and householders heading north towards the groveand addressed his stewardMy steward why are the brahmins and householders heading north towards the groveThe ascetic Kassapa the Princea disciple of the ascetic Gotamais staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of SetavyāHe has this good reputationHe is astute competent intelligent learned a brilliant speaker eloquent mature a perfected oneTheyre going to see that Kassapa the PrinceWell then go to the brahmins and householders and say to themSirs the chieftain Pāyāsi asksyou to wait as he will also go to see the ascetic Kassapa the PrinceBefore Kassapa the Prince convinces those foolish and incompetent brahmins and householders thatthere is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deedsfor none of these things are trueYes sir replied the steward and did as he was askedThen Pāyāsi escorted by the brahmins and householders went up to Kassapa the Prince and exchanged greetings with him When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideBefore sitting down to one side some of the brahmins and householders of Setavyā bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward Kassapa the Prince some announced their name and clan while some kept silentNihilismSeated to one side the chieftain Pāyāsi said to Venerable Kassapa the PrinceMaster Kassapa this is my doctrine and viewTheres no afterlife No beings are reborn spontaneously Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deedsWell chieftain Ive never seen or heard of anyone holding such a doctrine or viewFor how on earth can anyone say such a thingThe Simile of the Moon and SunWell then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think chieftainAre the moon and sun in this world or the other world Are they gods or humansThey are in the other world Master Kassapa and they are gods not humansBy this method it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deedsEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlife no beings are reborn spontaneously and theres no fruit or result of good and bad deedsIs there a method by which you can prove what you sayThere is Master KassapaHow exactly chieftainWell I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin who kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong viewSome time later they become sick suffering gravely illWhen I know thatthey will not recover from their illness I go to them and saySirs there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewThose who kill living creatures steal and commit sexual misconduct use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and are covetous malicious and have wrong viewwhen their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellYou do all these thingsIf what those ascetics and brahmins say is true when your body breaks up after death youll be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellIf that happens sirs come and tell me thatthere is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deedsI trust you and believe you Anything you see will be just as if Ive seen it for myselfThey agree to this But they dont come back to tell me nor do they send a messengerThis is the method by which I prove thattheres no afterlife no beings are reborn spontaneously and theres no fruit or result of good and bad deedsThe Simile of the BanditWell then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think chieftainSuppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to you sayingSir this is a bandit a criminalPunish him as you willThen youd say to themWell then my men tie this mans arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum Then take him out the south gate and there at the place of execution to the south of the city chop off his headSaying Good theyd do as they were told sitting him down at the place of executionCould that bandit get the executioners to wait sayingPlease good executioners I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin in such and such village or town Wait until Ive visited them then Ill come back Or would they just chop off his head as he prattled onTheyd just chop off his headSo even a human bandit couldnt get his human executioners to stay his executionWhat then of your friends and colleagues relatives and kin who are reborn in a lower realm after doing bad things Could they get the wardens of hell to wait sayingPlease good wardens of hell Wait until Ive gone to the chieftain Pāyāsi to tell him thatthere is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deedsBy this method too it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deedsEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlifeIs there a method by which you can prove what you sayThere is Master KassapaHow exactly chieftainWell I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct They refrain from speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre content kindhearted with right viewSome time later they become sick suffering gravely illWhen I know thatthey will not recover from their illness I go to them and saySirs there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewThose who refrain from killing living creatures stealing and committing sexual misconduct who refrain from speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical and are content kindhearted with right viewwhen their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realmYou do all these thingsIf what those ascetics and brahmins say is true when your body breaks up after death youll be reborn in a good place a heavenly realmIf that happens sirs come and tell me thatthere is an afterlifeI trust you and believe you Anything you see will be just as if Ive seen it for myselfThey agree to this But they dont come back to tell me nor do they send a messengerThis is the method by which I prove thattheres no afterlifeThe Simile of the SewerWell then chieftain I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose there were a man sunk over his head in a sewerThen you were to order someoneto pull him out of the sewerand theyd agree to do soThen youd tell them tocarefully scrape the dung off that mans body with bamboo scrapersand theyd agree to do soThen youd tell them tocarefully scrub that mans body down with pale clay three timesand theyd do soThen youd tell them tosmear that mans body with oil and carefully wash him down with fine paste three timesand theyd do soThen youd tell them todress that mans hair and beardand theyd do soThen youd tell them toprovide that man with costly garlands makeup and clothesand theyd do soThen youd tell them tobring that man up to the stilt longhouse and set him up with the five kinds of sensual stimulationand theyd do soWhat do you think chieftainNow that man is nicely bathed and anointed with hair and beard dressed bedecked with garlands and bracelets dressed in white supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation upstairs in the royal longhouse Would he want to dive back into that sewer againNo Master KassapaWhy is thatBecause that sewer is filthy stinking disgusting and repulsive and its regarded as suchIn the same way chieftain to the gods human beings are filthy stinking disgusting and repulsive and are regarded as suchThe smell of humans reaches the gods even a hundred leagues awayWhat then of your friends and colleagues relatives and kin who are reborn in a higher realm after doing good things Will they come back to tell you thatthere is an afterlifeBy this method too it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlifeEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlifeCan you prove itHow exactly chieftainWell I have friends and colleagues relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures and so onSome time later they become sick suffering gravely illWhen I know thatthey will not recover from their illness I go to them and saySirs there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewThose who refrain from killing living creatures and so on are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThreeYou do all these thingsIf what those ascetics and brahmins say is true when your body breaks up after death youll be reborn in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThreeIf that happens sirs come and tell me thatthere is an afterlifeI trust you and believe you Anything you see will be just as if Ive seen it for myselfThey agree to this But they dont come back to tell me nor do they send a messengerThis is how I prove thattheres no afterlifeThe Simile of the Gods of the ThirtyThreeWell then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeA hundred human years are equivalent to one day and night for the gods of the ThirtyThree Thirty such days make a month and twelve months make a year The gods of the ThirtyThree have a lifespan of a thousand such yearsNow as to your friends who are reborn in the company of the gods of the ThirtyThree after doing good thingsIf they thinkFirst Ill amuse myself for two or three days supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation Then Ill go back to Pāyāsi and tell him thatthere is an afterlifeWould they come back to tell you thatthere is an afterlifeNo Master KassapaFor I would be long dead by thenBut Master Kassapa who has told youthat the gods of the ThirtyThree exist or that they have such a long life spanI dont believe youBlind From BirthChieftain suppose there was a person blind from birth They couldnt see sights that are dark or bright or blue yellow red or magenta They couldnt see even and uneven ground or the stars or the moon and sunTheyd sayTheres no such thing as dark and bright sights and noone who sees themTheres no such thing as blueeven and uneven groundmoon and sun and noone who sees these thingsI dont know it or see it therefore it doesnt existWould they be speaking rightlyNo Master KassapaThere are such things as dark and bright sights and one who sees themAnd those other things are real too as is the one who sees themSo its not right to say thisI dont know it or see it therefore it doesnt existIn the same way chieftain when you tell me you dont believe me you seem like the blind man in the simileYou cant see the other world the way you think with the eye of the fleshThere are ascetics and brahmins who live in the wilderness frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Meditating diligent keen and resolute they purify the divine eye the power of clairvoyanceWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see this world and the other world and sentient beings who are spontaneously rebornThats how to see the other worldnot how you think with the eye of the fleshBy this method too it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlifeEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlifeCan you prove itHow exactly chieftainWell I see ascetics and brahmins who are ethical of good character who want to live and dont want to die who want to be happy and recoil from painI think to myselfIf those ascetics and brahmins knew thatthings were going to be better for them after deaththeyd drink poison slit their wrists hang themselves or throw themselves off a cliffThey mustnt know thatthings are going to be better for them after death Thats why they are ethical of good character wanting to live and not wanting to die wanting to be happy and recoiling from painThis is the method by which I prove thattheres no afterlifeThe Simile of the Pregnant WomanWell then chieftain I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidOnce upon a time a certain brahmin had two wivesOne had a son ten or twelve years of age while the other was pregnant and about to give birthThen the brahmin passed awaySo the youth said to his mothers cowifeMadam all the wealth grain silver and gold is mineand you get nothingTransfer to me my fathers inheritanceBut the brahmin lady saidWait my dear until I give birthIf its a boy one portion shall be hisIf its a girl she will be your rewardBut for a second timeand a third time the youth insisted that the entire inheritance must be hisSo the brahmin lady took a knife went to her bedroom and sliced open her belly thinkingUntil I give birthwhether its a boy or a girlShe destroyed her own life and that of the fetus as well as any wealthBeing foolish and incompetent she sought an inheritance irrationally and fell to ruin and disaster In the same way chieftain being foolish and incompetent youre seeking the other world irrationally and will fall to ruin and disasterjust like that brahmin ladyGood ascetics and brahmins dont force what is unripe to ripenrather they wait for it to ripenFor the life of clever ascetics and brahmins is beneficialSo long as they remain good ascetics and brahmins make much merit and act for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansBy this method too it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlifeEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlifeCan you prove itHow exactly chieftainSuppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me sayingSir this is a bandit a criminalPunish him as you willI say to themWell then sirs place this man in a pot while hes still alive Close up the mouth bind it up with damp leather and seal it with a thick coat of damp clay Then lift it up on a stove and light the fireThey agree and do what I askWhen we know that that man has passed away we lift down the pot and break it open uncover the mouth and slowly peek inside thinkingHopefully well see his soul escapingBut we dont see his soul escapingThis is how I prove thattheres no afterlifeThe Simile of the DreamWell then chieftain Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeDo you recall ever having a midday nap and seeing delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds in a dreamI do sirAt that time were you guarded by hunchbacks dwarves midgets and younglingsBut did they see your soul entering or leavingNo they did notSo if they couldnt even see your soul entering or leaving while you were still alivehow could you see the soul of a dead manBy this method too it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlife there are beings reborn spontaneously and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deedsEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlifeCan you prove itHow exactly chieftainSuppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me sayingSir this is a bandit a criminalPunish him as you willI say to themWell then sirs weigh this man with scales while hes still alive Then strangle him with a bowstring and when hes dead weigh him againThey agree and do what I askSo long as they are alive theyre lighter softer more flexibleBut when they die they become heavier stiffer less flexibleThis is how I prove thattheres no afterlifeThe Simile of the Hot Iron BallWell then chieftain I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose a person was to heat an iron ball all day until it was burning blazing and glowing and then they weigh it with scalesAfter some time when it had cooled and become extinguished theyd weigh it againWhen would that iron ball be lighter softer and more workablewhen its burning or when its coolSo long as the iron ball is full of heat and airburning blazing and glowingits lighter softer and more workableBut when it lacks heat and aircooled and extinguishedits heavier stiffer and less workableIn the same way so long as this body is full of life and warmth and consciousness its lighter softer and more flexibleBut when it lacks life and warmth and consciousness its heavier stiffer and less flexibleBy this method too it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlifeEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlifeCan you prove itHow exactly chieftainSuppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me sayingSir this is a bandit a criminalPunish him as you willI say to themWell then sirs take this mans life without injuring his outer skin inner skin flesh sinews bones or marrow Hopefully well see his soul escapingThey agree and do what I askWhen hes halfdead I tell them tolay him on his back in hope of seeing his soul escapeThey do soBut we dont see his soul escapingI tell them tolay him bent overto lay him on his sideto lay him on the other sideto stand him uprightto stand him upside downto strike him with fistsand swordsand to give him a good shaking in hope of seeing his soul escapeThey do all these thingsBut we dont see his soul escapingFor him the eye itself is present and so are those sights Yet he does not experience that sensefieldThe ear itself is present and so are those sounds Yet he does not experience that sensefieldThe nose itself is present and so are those smells Yet he does not experience that sensefieldThe tongue itself is present and so are those tastes Yet he does not experience that sensefieldThe body itself is present and so are those touches Yet he does not experience that sensefieldThis is how I prove thattheres no afterlifeThe Simile of the Horn BlowerWell then chieftain I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidOnce upon a time a certain horn blower took his horn and traveled to a borderlandwhere he went to a certain village Standing in the middle of the village he sounded his horn three times then placed it on the ground and sat down to one sideThen the people of the borderland thoughtWhat is making this sound so arousing sensuous intoxicating infatuating and captivatingThey gathered around the horn blower and saidMister what is making this sound so arousing sensuous intoxicating infatuating and captivatingThe sound is made by this which is called a hornThey laid that horn on its back sayingSpeak good horn Speak good hornBut still the horn made no soundThen they lay the horn bent over they lay it on its side they lay it on its other side they stood it upright they stood it upside down they struck it with fists stones rods and swords and they gave it a good shake sayingSpeak good horn Speak good hornBut still the horn made no soundSo the horn blower thoughtHow foolish are these borderland folk For how can they seek the sound of a horn so irrationallyAnd as they looked on he picked up the horn sounded it three times and took it away with himThen the people of the borderland thoughtSo it seems when what is called a horn is accompanied by a person effort and wind it makes a sound But when these things are absent it makes no soundIn the same way so long as this body is full of life and warmth and consciousness it walks back and forth stands sits and lies down It sees sights with the eye hears sounds with the ear smells odors with the nose tastes flavors with the tongue feels touches with the body and knows thoughts with the mindBut when it lacks life and warmth and consciousness it does none of these thingsBy this method too it ought to be proven thatthere is an afterlifeEven though Master Kassapa says this still I think thattheres no afterlifeCan you prove itHow exactly chieftainSuppose they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and present him to me sayingSir this is a bandit a criminalPunish him as you willI say to themWell then sirs cut open this mans outer skin Hopefully we might see his soulThey cut open his outer skinbut we see no soulI say to themWell then sirs cut open his inner skin flesh sinews bones or marrow Hopefully well see his soulThey do so but we see no soulThis is how I prove thattheres no afterlifeThe Simile of the FireWorshiping MattedHair AsceticWell then chieftain I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidOnce upon a time a certain fireworshiping mattedhair ascetic settled in a leaf hut in a wilderness regionThen a caravan came out from a certain countryIt stayed for one night not far from that ascetics hermitage and then moved onThe ascetic thoughtWhy dont I go to that caravans campsite Hopefully Ill find something useful thereSo he went and he saw a little baby boy abandoned thereWhen he saw this he thoughtIts not proper for me to look on while a human being diesWhy dont I bring this boy back to my hermitage nurse him nourish him and raise himSo thats what he didWhen the boy was ten or twelve years old the ascetic had some business come up in the countrySo he said to the boyMy dear I wish to go to the countryServe the sacred flameDo not extinguish itBut if you should extinguish it here is the hatchet the firewood and the bundle of drillsticks Light the fire and serve itAnd having instructed the boy the ascetic went to the countryBut the boy was so engrossed in his play the fire went outHe thoughtMy father told me to serve the sacred flameWhy dont I light it again and serve itSo he chopped the bundle of drillsticks with the hatchet thinkingHopefully Ill get a fireBut he still got no fireHe split the bundle of drillsticks into two three four five ten or a hundred parts He chopped them into splinters pounded them in a mortar and swept them away in a strong wind thinkingHopefully Ill get a fireBut he still got no fireThen the mattedhair ascetic having concluded his business in the country returned to his own hermitage and said to the boyI trust my dear that the fire didnt go outAnd the boy told him what had happenedThen the ascetic thoughtHow foolish is this boy how incompetent For how can he seek a fire so irrationallySo while the boy looked on he took a bundle of firesticks lit the fire and saidDear boy this is how to light a fireNot the foolish and incompetent way you sought it so irrationallyIn the same way chieftain being foolish and incompetent you seek the other world irrationallyLet go of this harmful misconception chieftain let go of itDont create lasting harm and suffering for yourselfEven though Master Kassapa says this still Im not able to let go of that harmful misconceptionKing Pasenadi of Kosala knows my views and so do foreign kingsIf I let go of this harmful misconception people will sayHow foolish is the chieftain Pāyāsi how incompetent that he should hold on to a mistakeI shall carry on with this view out of anger contempt and spiteThe Simile of the Two Caravan LeadersWell then chieftain I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidOnce upon a time a large caravan of a thousand wagons traveled from a country in the east to the westWherever they went they quickly used up the grass wood water and the green foliageNow that caravan had two leaders each in charge of five hundred wagonsThey thoughtThis is a large caravan of a thousand wagonsWherever we go we quickly use up the grass wood water and the green foliageWhy dont we split the caravan in two halvesSo thats what they didOne caravan leader having prepared much grass wood and water started the caravanAfter two or three days journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels He was armored with a quiver and wreathed with yellow lotus his clothes and hair all wet Seeing him he saidSir where do you come fromFrom such and such a countryAnd where are you goingTo the country named so and soBut has there been much rain in the desert up aheadIndeed there has sir The paths are sprinkled with water and there is much grass wood and waterToss out your grass wood and water Your wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen so dont tire your draught teamsSo the caravan leader addressed his driversThis man says thatthere has been much rain in the desert up aheadHe advises us to toss out the grass wood and water The wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen and wont tire our draught teamsSo lets toss out the grass wood and water and restart the caravan with lightlyladen wagonsYes sir the drivers replied and thats what they didBut in the caravans first campsite they saw no grass wood or waterAnd in the secondand seventh campsites they saw no grass wood or waterAnd all fell to ruin and disasterAnd the men and beasts in that caravan were all devoured by that nonhuman spiritOnly their bones remainedNow when the second caravan leader knew thatthe first caravan was well underway he prepared much grass wood and water and started the caravanAfter two or three days journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels He was armored with a quiver and wreathed with yellow lotus his clothes and hair all wet Seeing him he saidSir where do you come fromFrom such and such a countryAnd where are you goingTo the country named so and soBut has there been much rain in the desert up aheadIndeed there has sirThe paths are sprinkled with water and there is much grass wood and waterToss out your grass wood and water Your wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen so dont tire your draught teamsSo the caravan leader addressed his driversThis man says thatthere has been much rain in the desert up aheadHe advises us to toss out the grass wood and water The wagons will move swiftly when lightlyladen and wont tire our draught teamsBut this person is neither our friend nor relative How can we proceed out of trust in himWe shouldnt toss out any grass wood or water but continue with our goods laden as beforeWe shall not toss out any old stockYes sir the drivers replied and they restarted the caravan with the goods laden as beforeAnd in the caravans first campsite they saw no grass wood or waterAnd in the secondand seventh campsites they saw no grass wood or waterAnd they saw the other caravan that had come to ruinAnd they saw the bones of the men and beasts who had been devoured by that nonhuman spiritSo the caravan leader addressed his driversThis caravan came to ruin as happens when guided by a foolish caravan leaderWell then sirs toss out any of our merchandise thats of little value and take whats valuable from this caravanYes sir replied the drivers and thats what they did They crossed over the desert safely as happens when guided by an astute caravan leaderIn the same way chieftain being foolish and incompetent you will come to ruin seeking the other world irrationally like the first caravan leaderAnd those who think youre worth listening to and trusting will also come to ruin like the driversLet go of this harmful misconception chieftain let go of itDont create lasting harm and suffering for yourselfEven though Master Kassapa says this still Im not able to let go of that harmful misconceptionKing Pasenadi of Kosala knows my views and so do foreign kingsI shall carry on with this view out of anger contempt and spiteThe Simile of the

wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion That kind of sacrifice is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or

and ill keptAnd the heavens dont provide enough rain when neededWould those seeds grow increase and mature and would the farmer get abundant fruitNo Master KassapaIn the same way chieftain take the

such food as rough gruel with pickles was given and heavy clothes with knotted fringesNow it was a brahmin student named Uttara who organized that offeringWhen the offering was over he referred to it like thisThrough this offering may I be together with the chieftain Pāyāsi in this world but not in the nextPāyāsi heard of thisso he summoned Uttara and saidIs it really true dear Uttara that you referred to the offering in this wayYes sirDont we who seek merit expect some result from the offeringAt your offering such food as rough gruel with pickles was given which you wouldnt even want to touch with your foot much less eat And also heavy clothes with knotted fringes which you also wouldnt want to touch with your foot much less wearSir youre dear and beloved to me But how can I reconcile one so dear with something so disagreeableWell then dear Uttara set up an offering with the same kind of food that I eatand the same kind of clothes that I wearYes sir replied Uttara and did soSo the chieftain Pāyāsi gave gifts carelessly thoughtlessly not with his own hands giving the dregs When his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings in an empty palace of acaciaBut the brahmin student Uttara who organized the offering gave gifts carefully thoughtfully with his own hands not giving the dregsWhen his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the ThirtyThreeThe God PāyāsiNow at that time Venerable Gavampati would often go to that empty acacia palace for the days meditationThen the god Pāyāsi went up to him bowed and stood to one sideGavampati said to himWho are you reverendSir I am the chieftain PāyāsiDidnt you have the view thattheres no afterlife no beings are reborn spontaneously and theres no fruit or result of good and bad deedsIts true sir I did have such a viewBut Venerable Kassapa the Prince dissuaded me from that harmful misconceptionBut the student named Uttara who organized that offering for youwhere has he been rebornSir Uttara gave gifts carefully thoughtfully with his own hands not giving the dregs When his body broke up after death he was reborn in company with the gods of the ThirtyThreeBut I gave gifts carelessly thoughtlessly not with my own hands giving the dregs When my body broke up after death I was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings in an empty palace of acaciaSo sir when youve returned to the human realm please announce thisGive gifts carefully thoughtfully with your own hands not giving the dregsThe chieftain Pāyāsi gave gifts

was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak MountainThen late at night the Four Great Kingswith large armies of spirits fairies goblins and dragonsset guards troops and wards at the four quarters and then lighting up the entire Vultures Peak with their beauty went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one sideBefore sitting down to one side some spirits bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentSeated to one side the Great King Vessavaṇa said to the BuddhaSir some high spirits have confidence in the Buddhasome do notSome middling spirits have confidence in the Buddhasome do notSome low spirits have confidence in the Buddhasome do notBut mostly the spirits dont have confidence in the BuddhaWhy is thatBecause the Buddha teaches them to refrain from killing living creatures stealing lying sexual misconduct and drinking alcoholBut mostly they dont refrain from such thingsThey dont like that or approve of itSir there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreatThere dwell high spirits who have no confidence in the Buddhas dispensationTo give them confidence may the Buddha please learn the ṭānāṭiya protection

Discourse on CausationDependent OriginationSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus near the Kuru town named KammāsadammaThen Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himIts incredible sir its amazingin that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep yet to me it seems as plain as can beDont say that nanda dont say thatThis dependent origination is deep and appears deepIt is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string knotted like a ball of thread and matted like rushes and reeds and it doesnt escape the places of loss the bad places the underworld transmigrationWhen asked Is there a specific condition for old age and death you should

condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to beThat is how this entire mass of suffering originatesRebirth is a condition for old age and deaththats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is soSuppose there were totally and utterly no rebirth for anyone anywhereThat is there were no rebirth of sentient beings into their various realmsof gods fairies spirits creatures humans quadrupeds birds or reptiles each into their own realmWhen theres no rebirth at all with the cessation of rebirth would old age and death still be foundNo sirThats why this is the cause source origin and condition of old age and death namely rebirthContinued existence is a condition for rebirththats what I said And this is a way to understand how this is soSuppose there were totally and utterly no continued existence for anyone anywhereThat is continued existence in the sensual realm the realm of luminous form or the formless realm When theres no

is soIf consciousness were not to become established in name and form would the coming to be of the origin of sufferingof rebirth old age and death in the futurebe foundNo sirThats why this is the cause source origin and condition of consciousness namely name and formThis is the extent to which one may be reborn grow old die pass away or reappearThis is how far the scope of language terminology and description extends how far the sphere of wisdom extends how far the cycle of rebirths proceeds so that this state of existence is to be found namely name and form together with

feeling as selfFeeling is my selfOr they regard it like this Feeling is definitely not my self My self does not experience feelingOr they regard it like this Feeling is definitely not my self But its not that my self does not experience feeling My self feels for my self is liable to feelNow as to those who sayFeeling is my selfYou should say this to themReverend there are three feelingspleasant painful and neutralWhich one of these do you regard as selfnanda at a time when you feel a pleasant feeling you dont feel a painful or neutral feelingyou only feel a pleasant feelingAt a time when you feel a painful feeling you dont feel a pleasant or neutral feelingyou only feel a painful feelingAt a time when you feel a neutral feeling you dont feel a pleasant or painful feelingyou only feel a neutral feelingPleasant feelings painful feelings and neutral feelings are all impermanent conditioned dependently originated liable to end vanish fade away and ceaseWhen feeling a pleasant feeling they think This is my selfWhen their pleasant feeling ceases they think My self has disappearedWhen feeling a painful feeling they think This is my selfWhen their painful feeling ceases they think My self has disappearedWhen feeling a neutral feeling they think This is my selfWhen their neutral feeling ceases they think My self has disappearedSo those who say feeling is my self regard as self that which is evidently impermanent a mixture of pleasure and pain and liable to rise and fallThats why its not acceptable to regard feeling as selfNow as to those who sayFeeling is definitely not my self My self does not experience feeling You should say this to themBut reverend where there is nothing felt at all would the thought I am occur thereNo sirThats why its not acceptable to regard self as that which does not experience feelingNow as to those who sayFeeling is definitely not my self But its not that my self does not experience feeling My self feels for my self is liable to feelYou should say this to themSuppose feelings were to totally and utterly cease without anything left overWhen theres no feeling at all with the cessation of feeling would the thought I am this occur thereNo sirThats why its not acceptable to regard self as that which is liable to feelNot regarding anything in this way they dont grasp at anything in the worldNot grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguishedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceIt wouldnt be appropriate to say that a mendicant whose mind is freed like this holds the following viewsA Realized One exists after deathA Realized One doesnt exist after deathA Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after deathA Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after deathWhy is thatA mendicant is freed by directly knowing this how far language and the scope of language extend how far terminology and the scope of terminology extend how far description and the scope of description extend how far wisdom and the sphere of wisdom extend how far the cycle of rebirths and its continuation extend It wouldnt be appropriate to say that a mendicant freed by directly knowing this holds the view There is no such thing as knowing and seeingPlanes of Consciousnessnanda there are seven planes of consciousness and two dimensionsWhat sevenThere are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in perception such as human beings some gods and some beings in the underworldThis is the first plane of consciousnessThere are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in perception such as the gods reborn in Brahmās Host through the first absorptionThis is the second plane of consciousnessThere are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in perception such as the gods of streaming radianceThis is the third plane of consciousnessThere are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in perception such as the gods replete with gloryThis is the fourth plane of consciousnessThere are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form With the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite spaceThis is the fifth plane of consciousnessThere are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space Aware that consciousness is infinite they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousnessThis is the sixth plane of consciousnessThere are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness Aware that there is nothing at all they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingnessThis is the seventh plane of consciousnessThen theres the dimension of nonpercipient beings and secondly the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionNow regarding these seven planes of consciousness and two dimensionsis it appropriate for someone who understands themand their origin ending gratification drawback and escapeto take pleasure in themNo sirWhen a mendicant having truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape regarding these seven planes of consciousness and these two dimensions is freed by not grasping theyre called a mendicant who is freed by wisdomThe Eight Liberationsnanda there are these eight liberationsWhat eightHaving physical form they see visionsThis is the first liberationNot perceiving form internally they see visions externallyThis is the second liberationTheyre focused only on beautyThis is the third liberationGoing totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite spaceThis is the fourth liberationGoing totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousnessThis is the fifth liberationGoing totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingnessThis is the sixth liberationGoing totally beyond the dimension of nothingness they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is the seventh liberationGoing totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is the eighth liberationThese are the eight liberationsWhen a mendicant enters into and withdraws from these eight liberationsin forward order in reverse order and in forward and reverse orderwherever they wish whenever they wish and for as long as they wishand when they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements theyre called a mendicant who is freed both waysAnd nanda there is no other freedom both ways that is better or finer than thisThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesAn Impressive DiscourseSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans in a stilt longhouse in a mango grove belonging to the Sakyan family named VedhaññaNow at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at PāvāWith his passing the Jain ascetics split dividing into two factions arguing quarreling and fighting continually wounding each other with barbed wordsYou dont understand this teaching and training I understand this teaching and training What you understand this teaching and trainingYoure practicing wrongIm practicing rightI stay on topic you dontYou said last what you should have said first You said first what you should have said last What youve thought so much about has been disproved Your doctrine is refuted Go on save your doctrine Youre trapped get yourself out of thisif you canYoud think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain asceticsAnd the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputtas whiteclothed lay disciples were disillusioned dismayed and disappointed in the Jain ascetics They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha with broken monument and without a refugeAnd then after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā the novice Cunda went to see Venerable nanda at Sāma villageHe bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenednanda said to himReverend Cunda we should see the Buddha about this matterCome lets go to the Buddha and tell him about thisYes sir replied CundaThen nanda and Cunda went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedThe Teaching of the UnawakenedThats what happens Cunda when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not

concert without disputing those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge comparing meaning with meaning and phrasing with phrasing so that this spiritual path may last for a long time That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansAnd what are those things I have taught from my direct knowledgeThey are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven awakening factors and the noble eightfold pathThese are the things I have taught from my own direct knowledgeReaching AgreementSuppose one of those spiritual companions who is training in harmony and mutual appreciation without fighting were to recite the teaching in the SaṅghaNow you might thinkThis venerable misconstrues the meaning and mistakes the phrasingYou should neither approve nor dismiss them but sayReverend if this is the meaning the phrasing may either be this or that which is more fitting And if this is the phrasing the meaning may be either this or that which is more fittingSuppose they replyThis phrasing fits the meaning better than that And this meaning fits the phrasing better than thatWithout flattering or rebuking them you should carefully convince them by examining that meaning and that phrasingSuppose another spiritual companion were to recite the teaching in the SaṅghaNow you might thinkThis venerable misconstrues the meaning but gets the phrasing rightYou should neither approve nor dismiss them but sayReverend if this is the

see a venerable such as yourself so wellversed in the meaning and the phrasing as one of our spiritual companionsThe Reasons for Allowing RequisitesCunda I do not teach you solely for restraining defilements that affect the present lifeNor do I teach solely for protecting against defilements that affect lives to comeI teach both for restraining defilements that affect the present life andprotecting against defilements that affect lives to comeAnd thats why I have allowed robes for you that sufficeonly for the sake of warding off cold and heat for warding off the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles and for covering up the private partsI have allowed almsfood for you that sufficesonly to sustain this body avoid harm and support spiritual practice so that you will put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and will keep on living blamelessly and at easeI have allowed lodgings for you that sufficeonly for the sake of warding off cold and heat for warding off the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreatI have allowed medicines and supplies for the sick for you that sufficeonly for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good healthIndulgence in PleasureIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasureYou should say to themWhat is that indulgence in pleasureFor there are many different kinds of indulgence in pleasureThese four kinds of indulgence in pleasure Cunda are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentWhat fourIts when some fool makes themselves happy and pleased by killing living creaturesThis is the first kind of indulgence in pleasureFurthermore someone makes themselves happy and pleased by theftThis is the second kind of indulgence in pleasureFurthermore someone makes themselves happy and pleased by lyingThis is the third kind of indulgence in pleasureFurthermore someone amuses themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulationThis is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasureThese are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure that are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four waysThey should be told Not soIt isnt right to say that about you it misrepresents you with an untruthThese four kinds of indulgence in pleasure when developed and cultivated lead solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentWhat fourIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is the first kind of indulgence in pleasureFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is the second kind of indulgence in pleasureFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption They meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThis is the third kind of indulgence in pleasureFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption It is without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThis is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasureThese are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure which when developed and cultivated lead solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four waysThey should be told Exactly soIts right to say that about you it doesnt misrepresent you with an untruthThe Benefits of Indulgence in PleasureIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayHow many fruits and benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four waysYou should say to themFour benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four waysWhat fourFirstly with the ending of three fetters a mendicant becomes a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningThis is the first fruit and benefitFurthermore a mendicantwith the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusionbecomes a oncereturner They come back to this world once only then make an end of sufferingThis is the second fruit and benefitFurthermore with the ending of the five lower fetters a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that worldThis is the third fruit and benefitFurthermore a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsThis is the fourth fruit and benefitThese four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four waysThings Impossible for the PerfectedIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetics who follow the Sakyan are inconsistentYou should say to themReverends these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha not to be transgressed so long as life lastsSuppose there was a boundary pillar or an iron pillar with deep foundations firmly embedded imperturbable and unshakableIn the same way these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha not to be transgressed so long as life lastsA mendicant who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentcant transgress in nine respectsA mendicant with defilements ended cant deliberately take the life of a living creature take something with the intention to steal have sex tell a deliberate lie or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person And they cant make decisions prejudiced by favoritism hostility stupidity or cowardiceA mendicant who is perfected cant transgress in these nine respectsQuestions and AnswersIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetic Gotama demonstrates boundless knowledge and vision of the past but not of the future Whats up with thatThose wanderers like incompetent fools seem to imagine that one kind of knowledge and vision can be demonstrated by means of another kind of knowledge and visionRegarding the past the Realized One has knowledge stemming from memoryHe recollects as far as he wantsRegarding the future the Realized One has the knowledge born of awakeningThis is my last rebirth Now there are no more future livesIf a question about the past is untrue false and pointless the Realized One does not replyIf a question about the past is true and substantive but pointless he does not replyIf a question about the past is true substantive and beneficial he knows the right time to replyAnd the Realized One replies to questions about the future or the present in the same wayAnd so the Realized One has speech thats welltimed true meaningful in line with the teaching and training Thats why hes called the Realized OneIn this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswhatever is seen heard thought known sought and explored by the mind all that has been understood by the Realized OneThats why hes called the Realized OneFrom the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguishedthrough the natural principle of extinguishment without anything left overeverything he speaks says and expresses is real not otherwiseThats why hes called the Realized OneThe Realized One does as he says and says as he doesSince this is so thats why hes called the Realized OneIn this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansthe Realized One is the undefeated the champion the universal seer the wielder of powerThe Undeclared PointsIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayIs this your view A Realized One exists after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyYou should say to themReverend this has not been declared by the BuddhaThe wanderers might sayThen is this your view A Realized One doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyYou should say to themThis too has not been declared by the BuddhaThe wanderers might sayThen is this your view A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyYou should say to themThis too has not been declared by the BuddhaThe wanderers might sayThen is this your view A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are sillyYou should say to themThis too has not been declared by the BuddhaThe wanderers might sayBut why has this not been declared by the ascetic GotamaYou should say to themBecause its not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life It doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment Thats why it hasnt been declared by the BuddhaThe Declared PointsIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayBut what has been declared by the ascetic GotamaYou should say to themWhat has been declared by the Buddha is this This is sufferingThis is the origin of sufferingThis is the cessation of sufferingThis is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThe wanderers might sayBut why has this been declared by the ascetic GotamaYou should say to themBecause its beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual lifeIt leads to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment Thats why it has been declared by the BuddhaViews of the PastCunda I have explained to you as they should be explained the views that some rely on regarding the pastShall I explain them to you in the wrong wayI have explained to you as they should be

wrong wayI have taught and pointed out the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for giving up and going beyond all these views of the past and the futureWhat fourIts when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThey meditate observing an aspect of feelings principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThese are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation that I have taught for giving up and going beyond all these views of the past and the futureNow at that time Venerable Upavāṇa was standing behind the Buddha fanning himHe said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazingThis exposition of the teaching is impressive sirit is very impressive Sir what is the name of this exposition of the teachingWell Upavāṇa you may remember this exposition of the teaching as The Impressive DiscourseThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Upavāṇa was happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesWith KūṭadantaThe Brahmins and Householders of KhāṇumataSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named KhāṇumataThere he stayed nearby at AmbalaṭṭhikāNow at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest qualityNow at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrificeBulls bullocks heifers goats and ramsseven hundred of eachhad been led to the post for the sacrificeThe brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying in a forest nearbyHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen having departed Khāṇumataka they formed into companies and headed to AmbalaṭṭhikāNow at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday napHe saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikāand addressed his stewardMy steward why are the brahmins and householders headed for AmbalaṭṭhikāThe ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying at AmbalaṭṭhikāHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedTheyre going to see that Master GotamaThen Kūṭadanta thoughtIve heard thatthe ascetic Gotama knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessoriesI dont know about thatbut I wish to perform a great sacrificeWhy dont I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessoriesThen Kūṭadanta addressed his stewardWell then go to the brahmins and householders and say to themSirs the brahmin Kūṭadanta asksyou to wait as he will also go to see the ascetic GotamaYes sir replied the steward and did as he was askedThe Qualities of KūṭadantaNow at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in Khāṇumatathinking to participate in Kūṭadantas sacrificeThey heard thatKūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic GotamaThey approached Kūṭadanta and said to himIs it really true that you are going to see the ascetic GotamaYes gentlemen it is truePlease dontIts not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic GotamaFor if you do so your reputation will diminish and his will

village district is our guestand should be honored and respected as suchFor this reason too its not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see merather its appropriate for me to go to see himThis is the extent of Master Gotamas praise that I have learned But his praises are not confined to thisfor the praise of Master Gotama is limitlessWhen he had spoken those brahmins said to himAccording to Kūṭadantas praises if Master Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues itd be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him even if he had to carry his own provisions in a shoulder bagWell then gentlemen lets all go to see the ascetic GotamaThe Story of King Mahāvijitas SacrificeThen Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideBefore sitting down to one side some of the brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentKūṭadanta said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama Ive heard thatyou know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessoriesI dont know about thatbut I wish to perform a great sacrificePlease teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessoriesWell then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Kūṭadanta repliedThe Buddha said thisOnce upon a time brahmin there was a king named Mahāvijita He was rich affluent and wealthy with lots of gold and silver lots of property and assets lots of money and grain and a full treasury and storehousesThen as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mindI have achieved human wealth and reign after conquering this vast territory Why dont I hold a large sacrifice That will be for my lasting welfare and happinessThen he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to himJust now brahmin as I was in private retreat this thought came to mindI have achieved human wealth and reign after conquering this vast territoryWhy dont I perform a great sacrifice That will be for my lasting welfare and happinessBrahmin I wish to perform a great sacrificePlease instruct me It will be for my lasting welfare and happinessWhen he had spoken the brahmin high priest said to himSir the kings realm is harried and oppressed Bandits have been seen raiding villages towns and cities and infesting the highwaysBut if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed he would not be doing his dutyNow the king might thinkIll eradicate this outlaw threat by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment But thats not the right way to eradicate this barbarian obstacleThose who remain after the killing will return to harass the kings realmRather here is a plan relying on which the outlaw threat will be properly uprootedSo let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in farming and raising cattleLet the king provide funding for those who work in tradeLet the king guarantee food and wages for those in government serviceThen the people occupied with their own work will not harass the realmThe kings revenues will be greatWhen the country is secured as a sanctuary free of being harried and oppressed the happy people with joy in their hearts dancing with children at their breast will dwell as if their houses were wide openThe king agreed with the high priests advice and followed his recommendationThen the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to himI have eradicated the outlaw threat And relying on your plan my revenue is now greatSince the country is secured as a sanctuary free of being harried and oppressed the happy people with joy in their hearts dancing with children at their breast dwell as if their houses were wide openBrahmin I wish to perform a great sacrificePlease instruct me It will be for my lasting welfare and happinessThe Four AccessoriesIn that case let the king announce this throughout the realm to the aristocrat vassals ministers and counselors welltodo brahmins and welloff householders both of town and countryI wish to perform a great sacrifice Please grant your approval gentlemen it will be for my lasting welfare and happinessThe king agreed with the high priests advice and followed his recommendationAnd all of the people who were thus informed responded by sayingMay the king perform a sacrifice It is time for a sacrifice great kingAnd so these four consenting factions became accessories to the sacrificeThe Eight AccessoriesKing Mahāvijita possessed eight factorsHe was well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generationHe was attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty He was magnificent splendid remarkable to beholdHe was rich affluent and wealthy with lots of gold and silver lots of property and assets lots of money and grain and a full treasury and storehousesHe was powerful having an army of four divisions that was obedient and carried out instructions Hed probably prevail over his enemies just with his reputationHe was faithful generous a donor his door always open He was a wellspring of support making merit with ascetics and brahmins for paupers vagrants travelers and beggarsHe was very learned in diverse fields of learning He understood the meaning of diverse statements sayingThis is what that statement means that is what this statement meansHe was astute competent and intelligent able to think issues through as they bear upon the past future and presentThese are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessedAnd so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrificeFour More AccessoriesAnd the brahmin high priest had four factorsHe was well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generationHe recited and remembered the hymns and had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manHe was ethical mature in ethical conductHe was astute and clever being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladleThese are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessedAnd so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrificeThe Three ModesNext before the sacrifice the brahmin high priest taught the three modes to the kingNow though the king wants to perform a great sacrifice he might have certain regrets thinkingI shall lose a great fortune orI am losing a great fortune orI have lost a great fortune But the king should not harbor such regretsThese are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the king before the sacrificeThe Ten RespectsNext before the sacrifice the brahmin high priest dispelled the kings regret regarding the recipients in ten respectsThere will come to the sacrifice those who kill living creatures and those who refrain from killing living creaturesAs to those who kill living creatures the outcome of that is theirs aloneBut as to those who refrain from killing living creatures it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heartThere will come to the sacrifice those who steal commit sexual misconduct use divisive speech use harsh speech talk nonsense are covetous have ill will have wrong view and those who have right viewAs to those who have wrong view the outcome of that is theirs aloneBut as to those who have right view it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heartThese are the ten respects in which the high priest dispelled the kings regret regarding the recipients before the sacrificeThe Sixteen RespectsNext while the king was performing the great sacrifice the brahmin high priest educated encouraged fired up and inspired the kings mind in sixteen respectsNow while the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might sayKing Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice but he did not announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and countryThats the kind of great sacrifice that this king performsThose who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacyFor the king did indeed announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and countryLet the king know this as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heartWhile the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might sayKing Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice but he did not announce it to the ministers and counselors welltodo brahmins and welloff householders both of town and country Thats the kind of great sacrifice that this king performsThose who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacyFor the king did indeed announce it to all these peopleLet the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heartWhile the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might saythat he does not possess the eight factorsThose who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacyFor the king does indeed possess the eight factorsLet the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heartWhile the king is performing the great sacrifice someone might saythat the high priest does not possess the four factorsThose who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacyFor the high priest does indeed possess the four factorsLet the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice relinquish rejoice and gain confidence in his heartThese are the sixteen respects in which the high priest educated encouraged fired up and inspired the kings mind while he was performing the sacrificeAnd brahmin in that sacrifice no cattle were killed no goats were killed and no chickens or pigs were killed There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures No trees were felled for the sacrificial post No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrificeNo bondservants employees or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful facesThose who wished to work did so while those who did not wish to did notThey did the work they wanted to and did not do what they didnt want toThe sacrifice was completed with just ghee oil butter curds honey and molassesThen the aristocrat vassals ministers and counselors welltodo brahmins and welloff householders of both town and country came to the king bringing abundant wealth and saidSire this abundant wealth is specially for you alone may Your Highness accept itTheres enough raised for me through regular taxes Let this be for you and here take even moreWhen the king turned them down they withdrew to one side to think up a planIt wouldnt be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homesKing Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice Let us make an offering as an auxiliary sacrificeThen the aristocrat vassals of town and country set up gifts to the east of the sacrificial pitThe ministers and counselors of town and country set up gifts to the south of the sacrificial pitThe welltodo brahmins of town and country set up gifts to the west of the sacrificial pitThe welloff householders of town and country set up gifts to the north of the sacrificial pitAnd brahmin in that sacrifice too no cattle were killed no goats were killed and no chickens or pigs were killed There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures No trees were felled for the sacrificial post No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrificeNo bondservants employees or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful facesThose who wished to work did so while those who did not wish to did notThey did the work they wanted to and did not do what they didnt want toThe sacrifice was completed with just ghee oil butter curds honey and molassesAnd so there were four consenting factions eight factors possessed by King Mahāvijita four factors possessed by the high priestand three modesBrahmin this is called the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessoriesWhen he said this those brahmins made an uproarHooray for such sacrifice Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrificeBut the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silenceSo those brahmins said to himHow can you not applaud the ascetic Gotamas fine wordsIts not that I dont applaud what he saidIf anyone didnt applaud such fine words their head would explodeBut gentlemen it occurs to me thatthe ascetic Gotama does not saySo I have heard or It ought to be like thisRather he just saysSo it was then this is how it was thenIt occurs to me thatthe ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King Mahāvijita the owner of the sacrifice or else the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for himDoes Master Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice or having facilitated it and then when his body broke up after death being reborn in a good place a heavenly realmI do recall that brahmin For at that time I was the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrificeA Regular Gift as an Ongoing Family SacrificeBut Master Gotama apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialThere is brahminBut what is itThe regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciatesthis sacrifice brahmin has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialWhat is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings yet are more fruitful and beneficial compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessoriesBecause neither perfected ones nor those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrificeWhy is thatBecause beatings and throttlings are seen thereBut the regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciatesperfected ones and those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrificeWhy is thatBecause no beatings and throttlings are seen thereThis is the cause brahmin this is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings yet are more fruitful and beneficial compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessoriesBut Master Gotama apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories and those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialThere is brahminBut what is itWhen someone gives a dwelling specially for the Saṅgha of the four quartersBut is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialWhen someone with confident heart goes for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the SaṅghaBut is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialWhen someone with a confident heart undertakes the training rulesto refrain from killing living creatures stealing sexual misconduct lying and alcoholic drinks that cause negligenceBut is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialThere is brahminIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics They enter and remain in the first absorption This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficial They enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThis sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficialThey extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficialThey understand  there is no return to any state of existenceThis sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former yet is more fruitful and beneficialAnd brahmin there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice which is better and finer than thisKūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay FollowerWhen he had spoken Kūṭadanta said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAnd these bulls bullocks heifers goats and ramsseven hundred of eachI release them I grant them life Let them eat green grass and drink cool water and may a cool breeze blow upon themThe Realization of the Fruit of StreamEntryThen the Buddha taught Kūṭadanta step by step witha talk on giving ethical conduct and heavenHe explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciationAnd when he knew that Kūṭadantas mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhassuffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dyein that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin KūṭadantaEverything that has a beginning has an endThen Kūṭadanta saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions He said to the BuddhaWould Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from meThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Kūṭadanta got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingAnd when the night had passed Kūṭadanta had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time sayingIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Kūṭadanta together with the mendicant Saṅgha where he sat on the seat spread outThen Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one sideThen the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired him with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and leftLong DiscoursesThe WheelTurning MonarchTaking Refuge in OneselfSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at MātulāThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants be your own island your own refuge with no other refuge Let the teaching be your island and your refuge with no other refugeAnd how does a mendicant do thisThey meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThey meditate observing an aspect of feelings principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThats how a mendicant is their own island their own refuge with no other refuge Thats how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge with no other refugeYou should roam inside your own territory the domain of your fathersIf you roam inside your own territory the domain of your fathers Māra wont catch you or get hold of youIt is due to undertaking skillful qualities that this merit growsKing DaḷhanemiOnce upon a time mendicants there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extended to all four sides he achieved stability in the country and he possessed the seven treasuresHe had the following seven treasuresthe wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasureHe had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemiesAfter conquering this land girt by sea he reigned by principle without rod or swordThen after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his menMy good man when you see that the heavenly wheeltreasure has receded back from its place please tell meYes Your Majesty replied that manAfter many thousand years had passed that man saw that the heavenly wheeltreasure had receded back from its place So he went to King Daḷhanemi and saidPlease sire you should know that your heavenly wheeltreasure has receded back from its placeSo the king summoned the crown prince and saidDear prince my heavenly wheeltreasure has receded back from its placeIve heard thatwhen this happens to a wheelturning monarch he does not have long to liveI have enjoyed human pleasures Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasuresCome dear prince rule this land surrounded by oceanI shall shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAnd so after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessSeven days later the heavenly wheeltreasure vanishedThen a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and saidPlease sire you should know that the heavenly wheeltreasure has vanishedAt that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappinessHe went to the royal sage and saidPlease sire you should know that the heavenly wheeltreasure has vanishedWhen he said this the royal sage said to himDont be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheeltreasure My dear the wheeltreasure is not inherited from your fatherCome now my dear implement the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchIf you do so its possible thaton a fifteenth day sabbath having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbaththe heavenly wheeltreasure will appear to you with a thousand spokes with rim and hub complete in every detailThe Noble Duties of a WheelTurning MonarchBut sire what are the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchWell then my dear relying only on principlehonoring respecting and venerating principle having principle as your flag banner and authorityprovide just protection and security for your court troops aristocrats vassals brahmins and householders people of town and country ascetics and brahmins beasts and birdsDo not let injustice prevail in the realmPay money to the penniless in the realmAnd there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who avoid intoxication and negligence are settled in patience and gentleness and who tame calm and extinguish themselves From time to time you should go up to them and askSirs what is skillful What is unskillful What is blameworthy What is blameless What should be cultivated What should not be cultivated Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happinessHaving heard them you should reject what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillfulThese are the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchThe WheelTreasure AppearsYes Your Majesty replied the new king to the royal sage And he implemented the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchWhile he was implementing them on a fifteenth day sabbath he had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbathAnd the heavenly wheeltreasure appeared to him with a thousand spokes with rim and hub complete in every detailSeeing this the king thoughtI have heard that when the heavenly wheeltreasure appears to a king in this way he becomes a wheelturning monarchAm I then a wheelturning monarchThen the anointed king rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheeltreasure with his right hand sayingRoll forth O wheeltreasure Triumph O wheeltreasureThen the wheeltreasure rolled towards the eastAnd the king followed it together with his army of four divisions In whatever place the wheeltreasure stood still there the king came to stay together with his armyAnd any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to the wheelturning monarch and saidCome great king Welcome great king We are yours great king instruct usThe wheelturning monarch saidDo not kill living creatures Do not steal Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not lie Do not drink alcohol Maintain the current level of taxationAnd so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassalsThen the wheeltreasure having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again rolled towards the south Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again it rolled towards the west Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again it rolled towards the north followed by the king together with his army of four divisionsIn whatever place the wheeltreasure stood still there the king came to stay together with his armyAnd any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to the wheelturning monarch and saidCome great king Welcome great king We are yours great king instruct usThe wheelturning monarch saidDo not kill living creatures Do not steal Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not lie Do not drink alcohol Maintain the current level of taxationAnd so the rulers of the northern quarter became his vassalsAnd then the wheeltreasure having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean returned to the royal capital There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle illuminating the royal compoundOn Subsequent WheelTurning MonarchsAnd for a second timeand a thirdand a seventh time a wheelturning monarch was established in exactly the same way And after many years the seventh wheelturning monarch went forth handing the realm over to the crown princeSeven days later the heavenly wheeltreasure vanishedThen a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and saidPlease sire you should know that the heavenly wheeltreasure has vanishedAt that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappinessBut he didnt go to the royal sage and ask about the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchHe just governed the country according to his own ideasSo governed the nations did not prosper like before as they had when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchThen the ministers and counselors the treasury officials military officers guardsmen and advisers gathered and said to the kingSire when governed according to your own ideas the nations do not prosper like before as they did when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchIn your realm are found ministers and counselors treasury officials military officers guardsmen and advisersboth ourselves and otherswho remember the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchPlease Your Majesty ask us about the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchWe will answer youOn the Period of DeclineSo the anointed king asked the assembled ministers and counselors treasury officials military officers guardsmen and advisers about the noble duties of a wheelturning monarchAnd they answered himBut after listening to them he didnt provide just protection and security Nor did he pay money to the penniless in the realmAnd so poverty grew widespreadWhen poverty was widespread a certain person stole from others with the intention to commit theftThey arrested himand presented him to the king sayingYour Majesty this person stole from others with the intention to commit theftThe king said to that personIs it really true mister that you stole from others with the intention to commit theftIts true sireWhat was the reasonSire I cant surviveSo the king paid some money to that person sayingWith this money mister keep yourself alive and provide for your mother and father partners and children Work for a living and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heavenYes Your Majesty replied that manBut then another man stole something from othersThey arrested himand presented him to the king sayingYour Majesty this person stole from othersThe king said to that personIs it really true mister that you stole from othersIts true sireWhat was the reasonSire I cant surviveSo the king paid some money to that person sayingWith this money mister keep yourself alive and provide for your mother and father partners and children Work for a living and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins thats conducive to heaven ripens in happiness and leads to heavenYes Your Majesty replied that manPeople heard about thisIt seems the king is paying money to anyone who steals from othersIt occurred to themWhy dont we steal from othersSo then another man stole something from othersThey arrested himand presented him to the king sayingYour Majesty this person stole from othersThe king said to that personIs it really true mister that you stole from othersIts true sireWhat was the reasonSire I cant surviveThen the king thoughtIf I pay money to anyone who steals from others it will only increase the stealingId better make an end of this person finish him off and chop off his headThen he ordered his menWell then my men tie this mans arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum Then take him out the south gate and make an end of him finish him off and chop off his headYes Your Majesty they replied and did as he commandedPeople heard about thisIt seems the king is chopping the head off anyone who steals from othersIt occurred to themWed better have sharp swords made Then when we steal from others well make an end of them finish them off and chop off their headsThey had sharp swords made Then they started to make raids on villages towns and cities and to infest the highwaysAnd they chopped the heads off anyone they stole fromAnd so mendicants from not paying money to the penniless poverty became widespread When poverty was widespread

teachings not learned before from anotherSome time later Vipassī meditated observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregatesSuch is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of formSuch is feeling such is the origin of feeling such is the ending of feelingSuch is perception such is the origin of perception such is the ending of perceptionSuch are choices such is the origin of choices such is the ending of choicesSuch is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousnessMeditating like this his mind was soon freed from defilements by not graspingThe Appeal of BrahmāThen the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha thoughtWhy dont I teach the DhammaThen he thoughtThis principle I have discovered is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astuteBut people like attachment they love it and enjoy itIts hard for them to see this thing that is specific conditionality dependent originationIts also hard for them to see this thing that is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishmentAnd if I were to teach the Dhamma others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for meAnd then these verses which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to himIve struggled hard to realize thisenough with trying to explain itThis teaching is not easily understoodby those mired in greed and hateThose caught up in greed cant seewhats subtle going against the streamdeep hard to see and very finefor theyre shrouded in a mass of darknessSo as the Buddha Vipassī reflected like this his mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen a certain Great Brahmā knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking thoughtOh my goodness The world will be lost the world will perish For the mind of the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha inclines to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha VipassīHe arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī and saidSir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teachingThere will be those who understand the teachingWhen he said this the Buddha Vipassī said to himI too thought this BrahmāWhy dont I teach the DhammaThen it occurred to meIf I were to teach the Dhamma others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for meSo as I reflected like this my mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaFor a second timeand a third time that Great Brahmā begged the Buddha to teachThen understanding Brahmās invitation the Buddha Vipassī surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha because of his compassion for sentient beingsAnd he saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did notIts like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotusesSome of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwaterSome of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the waters surface And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to themIn the same way the Buddha Vipassī saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyesThen that Great Brahmā knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking addressed him in verseStanding high on a rocky mountainyou can see the people all aroundIn just the same way allseer wise onehaving ascended the Temple of Truthrid of sorrow look upon the peopleswamped with sorrow oppressed by rebirth and old ageRise hero Victor in battle leader of the caravanwander the world without obligationLet the Blessed One teach the DhammaThere will be those who understandThen the Buddha Vipassī addressed that Great Brahmā in verseFlung open are the doors to the deathlessLet those with ears to hear decide their faithThinking it would be troublesome Brahmā I did not teachthe sophisticated sublime Dhamma among humansThen the Great Brahmā knowing that his request for the Buddha Vipassī to teach the Dhamma had been granted bowed and respectfully circled him keeping him on his right before vanishing right thereThe Chief DisciplesThen the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha thoughtWho should I teach first of allWho will quickly understand this teachingThen he thoughtThat Khaṇḍa the kings son and Tissa the high priests son are astute competent clever and have long had little dust in their eyesWhy dont I teach them first of all They will quickly understand this teachingThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the tree of awakening and reappeared near the capital city of Bandhumatī in the deer park named SanctuaryThen the Buddha Vipassī addressed the park keeperMy dear park keeper please enter the city and say this to the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son TissaSirs the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary He wishes to see youYes sir replied the park keeper and did as he was askedThen the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa had the finest carriages harnessedThen they mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out from Bandhumatī for the SanctuaryThey went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the Buddha Vipassī on footThey bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step witha talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciationAnd when he knew that their minds were ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhassuffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dyein that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son TissaEverything that has a beginning has an endThey saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma They went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions They said to the Buddha VipassīExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysWe go for refuge to the Blessed One and to the teachingSir may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddhas presenceAnd they received the going forth the ordination in the Buddha Vipassīs presenceThen the Buddha Vipassī educated encouraged fired up and inspired them with a Dhamma talkHe explained the drawbacks of conditioned phenomena so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of extinguishmentBeing taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not graspingThe Going Forth of the Large CrowdA large crowd of  people in the capital of Bandhumatī heardthat the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha had arrived at Bandhumatī and was staying in the deer park named SanctuaryAnd they heard that the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa had shaved off their hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddhas presenceIt occurred to themThis must be no ordinary teaching and training no ordinary going forth in which the kings son Khaṇḍa and the high priests son Tissa have gone forthIf even they go forth why dont we do the sameThen those  people left Bandhumatī for the deer park named Sanctuary where they approached the Buddha Vipassī bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step witha talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciationAnd when he knew that their minds were ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhassuffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dyein that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those  peopleEverything that has a beginning has an endThey saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma They went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions They said to the Buddha VipassīExcellent sir ExcellentAnd just like Khaṇḍa and Tissa they asked for and received ordination Then the Buddha taught them furtherBeing taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not graspingThe  Who Had Gone Forth PreviouslyThe  people who had gone forth previously also heardIt seems the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary And he is teaching the DhammaThen they too went to see the Buddha Vipassī realized the Dhamma went forth and became freed from defilementsThe Allowance to WanderNow at that time a large Saṅgha of  mendicants were residing at BandhumatīAs the Buddha Vipassī was in private retreat this thought came to his mindThe Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large What if I was to urge themWander forth mendicants for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansLet not two go by one roadTeach the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureThere are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teachingThere will be those who understand the teachingBut when six years have passed you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic codeThen a certain Great Brahmā knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha VipassīHe arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī and saidThats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy OneThe Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large Please urge them to wander as you thoughtAnd sir Ill make sure that when six years have passed the mendicants will return to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic codeThats what that Great Brahmā saidThen he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Vipassī keeping him on his right side before vanishing right thereThen in the late afternoon the Buddha Vipassī came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants telling them all that had happened Then he saidWander forth mendicants for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansLet not two go by one roadTeach the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureThere are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teachingThere will be those who understand the teachingBut when six years have passed you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic codeThen most of the mendicants departed to wander the country that very dayNow at that time there were  monasteries in IndiaAnd when the first year came to an end the deities raised the cryGood sirs the first year has endedNow five years remainWhen five years have passed you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic codeAnd when the second year the third year the fourth year the fifth year came to an end the deities raised the cryGood sirs the fifth year has endedNow one year remainsWhen one year has passed you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic codeAnd when the sixth year came to an end the deities raised the cryGood sirs the sixth year has endedNow is the time that you must go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic codeThen that very day the mendicants went to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code Some went by their own psychic power and some by the psychic power of the deitiesAnd there the Blessed One Vipassī the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha recited the monastic code thusPatient acceptance is the ultimate austerityExtinguishment is the ultimate say the BuddhasNo true renunciate injures anothernor does an ascetic hurt anotherNot to do any evilto embrace the goodto purify ones mindthis is the instruction of the BuddhasNot speaking ill nor doing harmrestraint in the monastic codemoderation in eatingstaying in remote lodgingscommitment to the higher mindthis is the instruction of the BuddhasBeing Informed by DeitiesAt one time mendicants I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal treeAs I was in private retreat this thought came to mindIts not easy to find an abode of sentient beings where I havent previously abided in all this long time except for the gods of the pure abodesWhy dont I go to see themThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared with the Aviha godsIn that order of gods many thousands many hundreds of thousands of deities approached me bowed stood to one side and said to meNinetyone eons ago good sir the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world perfected and fully awakenedHe was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat familyKoṇḍañña was his clanHe lived for  yearsHe was awakened at the root of a trumpet flower treeHe had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and TissaHe had three gatherings of disciplesone of  one of  and one of all of them mendicants who had ended their defilementsHe had as chief attendant a mendicant named AsokaHis father was King Bandhumahis birth mother was Queen Bandhumatīand their capital city was named BandhumatīAnd such was his renunciation such his going forth such his striving such his awakening and such his rolling forth of the wheel of DhammaAnd good sir after leading the spiritual life under that Buddha Vipassī we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn hereIn that order of gods many hundreds of deities approached me bowed stood to one side and said to meIn the present fortunate eon good sir you have arisen in the world perfected and fully awakenedYou were born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat familyGotama is your clanFor you the lifespan is short brief and fleeting A longlived person lives for a century or a little moreYou were awakened at the root of a peepul treeYou have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and MoggallānaYou have had one gathering of disciples mendicants who had ended their defilementsYou have as chief attendant a mendicant named nandaYour father was King Suddhodanayour birth mother was Queen Māyāand your capital city was KapilavatthuAnd such was your renunciation such your going forth such your striving such your awakening and such your rolling forth of the wheel of DhammaAnd good sir after leading the spiritual life under you we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn hereThen together with the Aviha gods I went to see the Atappa gods the Gods Fair to See and the Fair Seeing GodsThen together with all these gods I went to see the Gods of Akaniṭṭha where we had a similar conversationAnd that is how the Realized One is able to recollect the caste names clans lifespan chief disciples and gatherings of disciples of the Buddhas of the past who have become completely extinguished cut off proliferation cut off the track finished off the cycle and transcended suffering It is both because I have clearly comprehended the principle of the teachingsand also because the deities told meThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesAbout PāṭikaputtaOn SunakkhattaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas near the Mallian town named AnupiyaThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Anupiya for almsThen it occurred to himIts too early to wander for alms in AnupiyaWhy dont I go to the wanderer Bhaggavagottas monastery to visit himSo thats what he didThen the wanderer Bhaggavagotta said to the BuddhaCome Blessed OneWelcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readyThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outwhile Bhaggavagotta took a low seat sat to one sideand said to the BuddhaSir a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and saidNow Bhaggava I have rejected the BuddhaNow I no longer live dedicated to himSir is what Sunakkhatta said trueIndeed it is BhaggavaA few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me bowed sat down to one side and saidNow I reject the BuddhaNow I shall no longer live dedicated to youWhen Sunakkhatta said this I said to himBut Sunakkhatta did I ever say to youCome live dedicated to meNo sirOr did you ever say to meSir I shall live dedicated to the BuddhaNo sirSo it seems that I did not ask you tolive dedicated to menor did you say you wouldlive dedicated to meIn that case you silly man are you really in a position to be rejecting anythingSee how far you have strayedBut sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for meBut Sunakkhatta did I ever say to youCome live dedicated to me and I will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for youNo sirOr did you ever say to meSir I shall live dedicated to the Buddha and the Buddha will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for meNo sirSo it seems that I did not ask this of you and you did not require it of meIn that case you silly man are you really in a position to be rejecting anythingWhat do you think SunakkhattaWhether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of sufferingIt does sirSo it seems that whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of sufferingIn that case what is the point of superhuman demonstrations of psychic powerSee how far you have strayed you silly manBut sir the Buddha never describes the origin of the world to meBut Sunakkhatta did I ever say to youCome live dedicated to me and I will describe the origin of the world to youNo sirOr did you ever say to meSir I shall live dedicated to the Buddha and the Buddha will describe the origin of the world to meNo sirSo it seems that I did not ask this of you and you did not require it of meIn that case you silly man are you really in a position to be rejecting anythingWhat do you think SunakkhattaWhether or not the origin of the world is described does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of sufferingIt does sirSo it seems that whether or not the origin of the world is described my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of sufferingIn that case what is the point of describing the origin of the worldSee how far you have strayed you silly manIn many ways Sunakkhatta you have praised me like this in the Vajjian capitalThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedIn many ways you have praised the teaching like this in the Vajjian capitalThe teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselvesIn many ways you have praised the Saṅgha like this in the Vajjian capitalThe Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples is practicing the way thats good direct methodical and proper It consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the worldI declare this to you Sunakkhatta I announce this to youThere will be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama Thats why he resigned the training and returned to a lesser lifeThats what theyll sayThough I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hellOn KorakkhattiyaBhaggava this one time I was staying in the land of the Thūlus where they have a town named UttarakāThen I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe entered Uttarakā for alms with Sunakkhatta the Licchavi as my second monkNow at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya had taken a vow to behave like a dog When food is tossed on the ground he gets down on all fours eating and devouring it just with his mouthSunakkhatta saw him doing thisand thoughtThat ascetic is a true holy manThen knowing what Sunakkhatta was thinking I said to himDont you claim to be an ascetic a follower of the Sakyan you silly manBut why does the Buddha say this to meWhen you saw that naked ascetic Korakkhattiya didnt you thinkThat ascetic is a true holy manYes sirBut sir are you jealous of the perfected onesIm not jealous of the perfected ones you silly manRather you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in youDont create lasting harm and suffering for yourselfThat naked ascetic Korakkhattiya who you imagine to be a true holy man will die of flatulence in seven daysAnd when he dies hell be reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the KālakañjasAnd theyll throw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiverIf you wish Sunakkhatta go to Korakkhattiya and ask himwhether he knows his own destinyIts possible that he will answerReverend Sunakkhatta I know my own destinyIve been reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the KālakañjasSo Bhaggava Sunakkhatta went to see Korakkhattiya and said to himReverend Korakkhattiya the ascetic Gotama has declaredthat you will die of flatulence in seven daysAnd when you die youll be reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the KālakañjasAnd when you die theyll throw you in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiverBut by eating just a little food and drinking just a little wateryoull prove what the ascetic Gotama says to be falseThen Sunakkhatta counted up the days until the seventh day as happens when you have no faith in the Realized OneBut on the seventh day the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya died of flatulenceAnd when he passed away he was reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the KālakañjasAnd when he passed away they threw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiverSunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about thisSo he went to see Korakkhattiya in the charnel ground on the clump of vetiver There he struck Korakkhattiya with his fist three timesReverend Korakkhattiya do you know your destinyThen Korakkhattiya got up rubbing his back with his hands and saidReverend Sunakkhatta I know my own destinyIve been reborn in the very lowest rank of demons named the Kālakañjas After speaking he fell flat right thereThen Sunakkhatta came to me bowed and sat down to one sideI said to himWhat do you think SunakkhattaDid the declaration I made about Korakkhattiya turn out to be correct or notIt turned out to be correctWhat do you think SunakkhattaIf that is so has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or notClearly sir a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performedThough I performed such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say thisBut sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for meSee how far you have strayedThough I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hellOn the Naked Ascetic KaḷāramaṭṭakaThis one time Bhaggava I was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka was residing in Vesālī And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material possessions and fameHe had undertaken these seven vowsAs long as I live I will be a naked ascetic not wearing clothes As long as I live I will be celibate not having sex As long as I live I will consume only meat and alcohol not eating rice and porridgeAnd I will not go past the following tree shrines near Vesālī the Udena shrine to the east the Gotamaka to the south the Sattamba to the west and the Bahuputta to the northAnd it was due to undertaking these seven vows that he had reached the peak of material possessions and fameSo Bhaggava Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and asked him a questionBut when he couldnt answer ithe displayed annoyance hate and bitternessSo Sunakkhatta thoughtIve offended the holy man the perfected one the asceticI mustnt create lasting harm and suffering for myselfThen Sunakkhatta came to me bowed and sat down to one sideI said to himDont you claim to be an ascetic a follower of the Sakyan you silly manBut why does the Buddha say this to meDidnt you go to see the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and ask him a questionBut when he couldnt answer ithe displayed annoyance hate and bitternessThen you thoughtIve offended the holy man the perfected one the asceticI mustnt create lasting harm and suffering for myselfYes sirBut sir are you jealous of perfected onesIm not jealous of the perfected ones you silly manRather you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in youDont create lasting harm and suffering for yourselfThat naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka who you imagine to be a true holy manwill shortly be clothed living with a partner eating rice and porridge having gone past all the shrines near Vesālī And he will die after losing all his fameAnd thats exactly what happenedSunakkhatta heard about thisHe came to me bowed and sat down to one sideI said to himWhat do you think SunakkhattaDid the declaration I made about Kaḷāramaṭṭaka turn out to be correct or notIt turned out to be correctWhat do you think SunakkhattaIf that is so has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or notClearly sir a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performedThough I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say thisBut sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for meSee how far you have strayedThough I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hellOn the Naked Ascetic PāṭikaputtaThis one time Bhaggava I was staying right there near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta was residing in Vesālī And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material possessions and fameHe was telling a crowd in VesālīBoth the ascetic Gotama and I speak from knowledgeOne who speaks from knowledge ought to display a superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from knowledgeIf the ascetic Gotama meets me halfwaythere we should both perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic powerIf he performs one demonstration of psychic power Ill perform twoIf he performs two Ill perform fourIf he performs four Ill perform eightHowever many demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs Ill perform doubleThen Sunakkhatta came to me bowed sat down to one side and told me of all thisI said to himSunakkhatta the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence unless he gives up that statement and that intention and lets go of that viewIf he thinks he cancome into my presence without giving up those things his head may explodeCareful what you say Blessed One Careful what you say Holy OneBut why do you say this to me SunakkhattaSir the Buddha has definitively asserted thatPāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into the Buddhas presence otherwisehis head may explodeBut Pāṭikaputta might come into the Buddhas presence in disguise proving the Buddha wrongSunakkhatta would the Realized One make an ambiguous statementBut sir did you make that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputtas mind with your mindOr did deities tell you about itBoth SunakkhattaFor Ajita the Licchavi general has recently passed away and been reborn in the host of the ThirtyThreeHe came and told me thisThe naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless sirhe is a liarFor he has declared of me in the Vajjian capitalAjita the Licchavi general has been reborn in the Great HellBut that is not trueI have been reborn in the host of the ThirtyThreeThe naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless sirhe is a liarPāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into the Buddhas presence otherwisehis head may explodeThus I both made that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputtas mind with my mindand deities told me about itSo Sunakkhatta Ill wander for alms in Vesālī After the meal on my return from almsround Ill go to Pāṭikaputtas monastery for the days meditationNow you may tell him if you so wishOn Demonstrations of Psychic PowerThen Bhaggava I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe entered Vesālī for almsAfter the meal on my return from almsround I went to Pāṭikaputtas monastery for the days meditationThen Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesālī to see the very wellknown Licchavis and said to themSirs after his almsround the Buddha has gone to Pāṭikaputtas

couldnt get up from his seatWhen the Licchavi minister knewthat Pāṭikaputta had losthe returned to the assembly and saidPāṭikaputta has lost sirsWhen he said this I said to the assemblyPāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence otherwisehis head may explodeEven if the good Licchavis were to thinkLets bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him with a pair of oxen But either the straps will break or Pāṭikaputta willThen Bhaggava Jāliya the pupil of the woodbowl ascetic stood up and said to the assemblyWell then sirs wait a moment Ill goHopefully Ill be able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the assemblySo Jāliya went to see Pāṭikaputta and saidCome forth Reverend Pāṭikaputta Its best for you to come forthAll these very wellknown people have come forth and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the days meditationYou said youd meet the ascetic Gotama halfwayThe ascetic Gotama has come the first half and is sitting in your monasteryThe ascetic Gotama has told the assemblythat youre not capable of coming into his presenceAnd he said that even if the Licchavistry to bind you with straps and drag you with a pair of oxen either the straps will break or you willCome forth Pāṭikaputta When you come forth well make you win and the ascetic Gotama loseWhen he had spoken Pāṭikaputta said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seatThen Jāliya said to PāṭikaputtaWhats up Reverend Pāṭikaputta Is your bottom stuck to the bench or is the bench stuck to your bottomYou say Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as you might you cant get up from your seatAnd as he was speaking Pāṭikaputta said Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he couldnt get up from his seatWhen Jāliya knewthat Pāṭikaputta had lost he said to himOnce upon a time Reverend Pāṭikaputta it occurred to a lion king of beastsWhy dont I make my lair near a certain forestTowards evening I can emerge from my den yawn look all around the four directions roar my lions roar three times and set out on the huntHaving slain the very best of the deer herd and eaten the most tender flesh I could return to my denAnd so thats what he didNow there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lions leavings becoming arrogant and strongHe thoughtWhat does the lion king of beasts have that I dontWhy dont I also make my lair near a certain forestTowards evening I can emerge from my den yawn look all around the four directions roar my lions roar three times and set out on the huntHaving slain the very best of the deer herd and eaten the most tender flesh I could return to my denAnd so thats what he didBut when he tried to roar a lions roar he only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal And what is a pathetic jackals squeal next to the roar of a lionIn the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One you presume to attack the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaWho are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones the perfected ones the fully awakened BuddhasWhen Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this similehe said to himSeeing himself as equal to the lionthe jackal presumed Im the king of the beastsBut in reality he only managed to yelpand whats a sad jackals squeal to the roar of a lionIn the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One you presume to attack himWhen Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this similehe said to himFollowing in the steps of anotherseeing himself grown fat on scrapsuntil he doesnt even see himselfthe jackal presumes hes a tigerBut in reality he only managed to yelpand whats a sad jackals squeal to the roar of a lionIn the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One you presume to attack himWhen Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this similehe said to himGorged on frogs and mice from the barnand carcasses tossed in the cemeterythriving in the great empty woodthe jackal presumed Im the king of the beastsBut in reality he only managed to yelpand whats a sad jackals squeal to the roar of a lionIn the same way reverend while living on the harvest of the Holy One enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One you presume to attack the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaWho are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones the perfected ones the fully awakened BuddhasWhen Jāliya couldnt get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this similehe returned to the assembly and saidPāṭikaputta has lost sirs He says Im coming sir Im coming But wriggle as he might he cant get up from his seatWhen he said this I said to the assemblyThe naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence unless he gives up that statement and that intention and lets go of that viewIf he thinks he cancome into my presence without giving up those things his head may explodeThe good Licchavis might even thinkLets bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him with a pair of oxen But either the straps will break or Pāṭikaputta willPāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence otherwisehis head may explodeThen Bhaggava I educated encouraged fired up and inspired that assembly with a Dhamma talk I released that assembly from the great bondage and lifted  beings from the great swamp Next I entered upon the fire element rose into the sky to the height of seven palm trees and created a flame another seven palm trees high blazing and smoking Finally I landed at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofThen Sunakkhatta came to me bowed and sat down to one sideI said to himWhat do you think SunakkhattaDid the declaration I made about Pāṭikaputta turn out to be correct or notIt turned out to be correctWhat do you think SunakkhattaIf that is so has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or notClearly sir a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performedThough I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say thisBut sir the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for meSee how far you have strayedThough I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this he still left this teaching and training like someone on the highway to hellOn Describing the Origin of the WorldBhaggava I understand the origin of the worldI understand this and what goes beyond it Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding I have realized extinguishment within myself Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruinThere are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as created by the Lord God by BrahmāI go up to them and sayIs it really true that this is the venerables viewAnd they answer YesI say to themBut how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the Lord God by BrahmāBut they cannot answer and they even question me in returnSo I answer themThere comes a time when reverends after a very long period has passed this cosmos contractsAs the cosmos contracts sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radianceThere they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeThere comes a time when after a very long period has passed this cosmos expandsAs it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appearsThen a certain sentient beingdue to the running out of their lifespan or meritpasses away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of BrahmāThere they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeBut after staying there all alone for a long time they become dissatisfied and anxiousOh if only another being would come to this state of existenceThen other sentient beingsdue to the running out of their lifespan or meritpass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that beingThere they too are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeNow the being who was reborn there first thinksI am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornWhy is thatBecause first I thoughtOh if only another being would come to this state of existenceSuch was my hearts wish and then these creatures came to this state of existenceAnd the beings who were reborn there later also thinkThis must be Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornAnd we have been created by himWhy is thatBecause we see that he was reborn here first and we arrived laterAnd the being who was reborn first is more longlived beautiful and illustrious than those who arrived laterIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no furtherHe who is Brahmāthe Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornis permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternityWe who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existenceThis is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the Lord God by BrahmāThat is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you sayBhaggava I understand the origin of the worldI understand this and what goes beyond itYet since I do not misapprehend that understanding I have realized extinguishment within myself Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruinThere are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as due to those depraved by playI go up to them and sayIs it really true that this is the venerables viewAnd they answer YesI say to themBut how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved by playBut they cannot answer and they even question me in returnSo I answer themReverends there are gods named depraved by playThey spend too much time laughing playing and making merryAnd in doing so they lose their mindfulness and they pass away from that host of godsIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no furtherThe gods not depraved by play dont spend too much time laughing playing and making merrySo they dont lose their mindfulness and dont pass away from that host of godsThey are permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternityBut we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing playing and making merry In doing so we lost our mindfulness and passed away from that host of godsWe are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existenceThis is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved by playThat is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you sayBhaggava I understand the origin of the worldDirectly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruinThere are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as due to those who are malevolentI go up to them and sayIs it really true that this is the venerables viewAnd they answer YesI say to themBut how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those who are malevolentBut they cannot answer and they even question me in returnSo I answer themReverends there are gods named malevolentThey spend too much time gazing at each other so they grow angry with each other and their bodies and minds get tiredThey pass away from that host of godsIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no furtherThe gods who are not malevolent dont spend too much time gazing at each other so they dont grow angry with each other their bodies and minds dont get tired and they dont pass away from that host of godsThey are permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternityBut we who were malevolent spent too much time gazing at each other so our minds grew angry with each other our bodies and minds got tired and we passed away from that host of godsWe are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existenceThis is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those who are malevolentThat is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you sayBhaggava I understand the origin of the worldDirectly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruinThere are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as having arisen by chanceI go up to them and sayIs it really true that this is the venerables viewAnd they answer YesI say to themBut how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about by chanceBut they cannot answer and they even question me in returnSo I answer themReverends there are gods named nonpercipient beingsWhen perception arises they pass away from that host of godsIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception but no furtherThe self and the cosmos arose by chanceWhy is thatBecause formerly I didnt exist Now from not being Ive changed into beingThis is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about by chanceThat is what we have heard Reverend Gotama just as you sayI understand this and what goes beyond it Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding I have realized extinguishment within myself Directly knowing this the Realized One does not come to ruinThough I speak and explain like this certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false hollow lying untruthful claimThe ascetic Gotama has a distorted perspective and so have his monksWhen one enters and remains in the liberation of the beautiful at that time one only perceives what is uglyBut I dont say thatI say thisWhen one enters and remains in the liberation of the beautiful at that time one only perceives what is beautifulThey are the ones with a distorted perspective sir who regard the Buddha and the mendicants in this waySir I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can enter and remain in the liberation on the beautifulIts hard for you to enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful since you have a different view creed preference practice and traditionCome now Bhaggava carefully preserve the confidence that you have in meIf its hard for me to enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful since I have a different view creed preference practice and traditionI shall carefully preserve the confidence that I have in the BuddhaThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the wanderer Bhaggavagotta was happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesWith JanavasabhaDeclaring the Rebirths of People From Nādika and ElsewhereSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick houseNow at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all over the nations the Kāsis and Kosalans Vajjis and Mallas Cetīs and Vasas Kurus and Pañcālas Macchas and SūrasenasThis one was reborn here while that one was reborn thereOver fifty devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters Theyve been reborn spontaneously and will be extinguished there not liable to return from that worldMore than ninety devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters and weakened greed hate and delusion Theyre oncereturners who will come back to this world once only then make an end of sufferingIn excess of five hundred devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters Theyre streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningWhen the devotees of Nādika heard about the Buddhasanswers to those questions they became uplifted and overjoyed full of rapture and happinessVenerable nanda heard of the Buddhas statements and the Nādikans happinessnandas SuggestionThen Venerable nanda thoughtBut there were also Magadhan devoteesmany and of long standing toowho have passed awayYoud think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees who have passed awayBut they too had confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and had fulfilled their ethicsThe Buddha hasnt declared their passingIt would be good to do so for many people would gain confidence and so be reborn in a good placeThat King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a just and principled king who benefited the brahmins and householders of town and countryPeople still sing his praisesThat just and principled king who made us so happy has passed away Life was good under his dominionHe too had confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and had fulfilled his ethicsPeople sayUntil his dying day King Bimbisāra sang the Buddhas praisesThe Buddha hasnt declared his passingIt would be good to do so for many people would gain confidence and so be reborn in a good placeBesides the Buddha was awakened in Magadhaso why hasnt he declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devoteesIf he fails to do so they will be dejectedAfter pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private nanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the BuddhaHe bowed sat down to one side and told the Buddha of his concerns finishing by sayingWhy hasnt the Buddha declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees If he fails to do so they will be dejectedThen nanda after making this suggestion regarding the Magadhan devotees got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingSoon after nanda had left the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Nādika for almsHe wandered for alms in Nādika After the meal on his return from almsround he washed his feet and entered the brick house He paid heed paid attention and concentrated wholeheartedly on the fate of Magadhan devotees and sat on the seat spread out thinkingI shall know their destiny where they are reborn in the next lifeAnd he saw where they had been rebornThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat Emerging from the brick house he sat on the seat spread out in the shade of the porchThen Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir you look so serene your face seems to shine owing to the clarity of your facultiesHave you been abiding in a peaceful meditation today sirThe Buddha then recounted what had happened since speaking to nanda revealing that he had seen the destiny of the Magadhan devotees He continuedJanavasabha the SpiritThen nanda an invisible spirit called outI am Janavasabha Blessed OneI am Janavasabha Holy Onenanda do you recall having previously heard such a name as JanavasabhaNo sir But when I heard the word I got goosebumpsI thoughtThis must be no ordinary spirit to bear such an exalted name as JanavasabhaAfter making himself heard while invisible nanda a very beautiful spirit appeared in front of meAnd for a second time he called outI am Bimbisāra Blessed OneI am Bimbisāra Holy OneThis is the seventh time I have been reborn in the company of the Great King Vessavaṇa After passing away from there I am now able to become a king of nonhumansSeven from here seven from therefourteen transmigrations in allThats how many past livesI can recollectFor a long time Ive known that I wont be reborn in the underworld but that I still hope to become a oncereturnerIts incredible and amazing that you the venerable spirit Janavasabha should sayFor a long time Ive been aware that I wont be reborn in the underworld and also But I still hope to become a oncereturner But from what source do you know that youve achieved such a high distinctionNone other than the Blessed Ones instruction None other than the Holy Ones instructionFrom the day I had absolute devotion to the Buddha I have known that I wont be reborn in the underworld but that I still hope to become a oncereturnerJust now sir I had been sent out by the great king Vessavaṇa to the great king Virūḷhakas presence on some business and on the way I saw the Buddha giving his attention to the fate of the Magadhan devoteesBut it comes as no surprise that I have heard and learned the fate of the Magadhan devotees in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking to his assemblyIt occurred to meI shall see the Buddha and inform him of thisThese are the two reasons Ive come to see the BuddhaThe Council of the GodsSir it was more than a few days agoon the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the entry to the rainy seasonwhen all the gods of the ThirtyThree were sitting together in the Hall of JusticeA large assembly of gods was sitting all around and the Four Great Kings were seated at the four directionsThe Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east facing west in front of his godsThe Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south facing north in front of his godsThe Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west facing east in front of his godsThe Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north facing south in front of his godsWhen the gods of the ThirtyThree have a gathering like this that is how they are seatedAfter that come our seatsSir those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshone the other gods in beauty and gloryThe gods of the ThirtyThree became uplifted and overjoyed at that full of rapture and happiness sayingThe heavenly hosts swell while the demon hosts dwindleSeeing the joy of those gods Sakka lord of gods celebrated with these versesThe gods rejoicethe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingand seeing the new godsso beautiful and gloriouswho have come here after leadingthe spiritual life under the BuddhaThey outshine the othersin beauty glory and lifespanHere are the distinguished disciplesof he whose wisdom is vastSeeing this they delightthe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingThe gods of the ThirtyThree became even more uplifted and overjoyed at that sayingThe heavenly hosts swell while the demon hosts dwindleThen the gods of the ThirtyThree having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice advised and instructed the Four Great Kings on the subjectAnd each stood at his own seat without departingThe Kings were instructedand heeded good adviceWith clear and peaceful mindsthey stood by their own seatsThen in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared surpassing the glory of the godsThen Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeAs indicated by the signslight arising and radiance appearingBrahmā will appearFor this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā namely light arising and radiance appearingAs indicated by the signsBrahmā will appearFor this is the sign of Brahmāa light vast and greatOn SanaṅkumāraThen the gods of the ThirtyThree sat in their own seats sayingWe shall find out what has caused that light and only when we have realized it shall we go to itAnd the Four Great Kings did likewiseHearing that the gods of the ThirtyThree agreed in unisonWe shall find out what has caused that light and only when we have realized it shall we go to itWhen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal formFor the gods of the ThirtyThree arent able to see a Brahmās normal appearanceWhen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree he outshines the other gods in beauty and gloryas a golden statue outshines the human formWhen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seatThey all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised thinkingNow Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he choosesAnd the god on whose couch Brahmā sits is overjoyed and brimming with happinesslike a king on the day of his coronationThen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid corporeal form taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha and appeared to the gods of the ThirtyThreeRising into the air he sat crosslegged in the skylike a strong man might sit crosslegged on a wellappointed couch or on level groundSeeing the joy of those gods Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these versesThe gods rejoicethe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingand seeing the new godsso beautiful and gloriouswho have come here after leadingthe spiritual life under the BuddhaThey outshine the othersin beauty glory and lifespanHere are the distinguished disciplesof he whose wisdom is vastSeeing this they delightthe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingThat is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spokeAnd while he was speaking on that topic his voice had eight qualities it was clear comprehensible charming audible rounded undistorted deep and resonantHe makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes but it doesnt extend outside the assemblyWhen someone has a voice like this theyre said to have the voice of BrahmāThen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra having manifested thirtythree corporeal forms sat down on the couches of each of the gods of the ThirtyThree and addressed themWhat do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansFor consider those who have gone for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and have fulfilled their ethics When their bodies break up after death some are reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others some with the Gods Who Love to Create some with the Joyful Gods some with the Gods of Yama some with the Gods of the ThirtyThree and some with the Gods of the Four Great KingsAnd at the very least they swell the hosts of the fairiesThat is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spokeAnd while he was speaking on that topic each of the gods fanciedThe one sitting on my couch is the only one speakingWhen one is speakingall the forms speakWhen one sits in silencethey all remain silentBut those gods imaginethe ThirtyThree with their Lordthat the one on their seatis the only one to speakThe Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra merged into one corporeal form Then he sat on the couch of Sakka lord of gods and addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeDeveloping the Bases of Psychic PowerWhat do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the four bases of psychic power have been clearly described by the Blessed Onethe one who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddhafor the multiplication generation and transformation of corporeal forms through psychic powerWhat fourIts when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm and active effortThey develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy and active effortThey develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development and active effortThey develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry and active effortThese are the four bases of psychic power that have been clearly described by the Buddha for the multiplication generation and transformation of corporeal forms through psychic powerAll the ascetics and brahmins in the pastor present who wield the many kinds of psychic power do so by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic powerGentlemen do you see such psychic might and power in meYes Great BrahmāI too became so mighty and powerful by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic powerThat is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spokeAnd having spoken about that he addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeThe Three OpeningsWhat do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has understood the three opportunities for achieving happinessWhat threeFirst take someone who lives mixed up with sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitiesAfter some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones properly attend to how it applies to them and practice accordinglyThey live aloof from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitiesThat gives rise to pleasure and more than pleasure happinesslike the joy thats born from gladnessThis is the first opportunity for achieving happinessNext take someone whose coarse physical verbal and mental processes have not died downAfter some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones properly attend to how it applies to them and practice accordinglyTheir coarse physical verbal and mental processes die downThat gives rise to pleasure and more than pleasure happinesslike the joy thats born from gladnessThis is the second opportunity for achieving happinessNext take someone who doesnt truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillfulwhat is blameworthy and what is blameless what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated what is inferior and what is superior and what is on the side of dark and the side of brightAfter some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones properly attend to how it applies to them and practice accordinglyThey truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful and so onKnowing and seeing like this ignorance is given up and knowledge arisesThat gives rise to pleasure and more than pleasure happinesslike the joy thats born from gladnessThis is the third opportunity for achieving happinessThese are the three opportunities for achieving happiness that have been understood by the BuddhaThat is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spokeAnd having spoken about that he addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeMindfulness MeditationWhat do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has clearly described the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for achieving what is skillfulWhat fourIts when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body internallykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldAs they meditate in this way they become rightly immersed in that and rightly sereneThen they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples bodies externallyThey meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples feelings externallyThey meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples minds externallyThey meditate observing an aspect of principles internallykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldAs they meditate in this way they become rightly immersed in that and rightly sereneThen they give rise to knowledge and vision of other peoples principles externallyThese are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation that the Buddha has clearly described for achieving what is skillfulThat is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spokeAnd having spoken about that he addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeSeven Prerequisites of ImmersionWhat do the good gods of the ThirtyThree think about how much the Buddha has clearly described the seven prerequisites of immersion for the development and fulfillment of right immersionWhat sevenRight view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort and right mindfulnessUnification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites is called noble right immersion with its vital conditions and with its prerequisitesRight view gives rise to right thoughtRight thought gives rise to right speech Right speech gives rise to right action Right action gives rise to right livelihood Right livelihood gives rise to right effort Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion Right immersion gives rise to right knowledge Right knowledge gives rise to right freedomIf anything should be rightly described asa teaching thats well explained by the Buddha visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves and the doors to the deathless are flung open its thisFor the teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselvesand the doors of the deathless are flung openWhoever has experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and has the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones and whoever is spontaneously reborn and is trained in the teaching in excess of  such Magadhan devotees have passed away having ended three fetters Theyre streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningAnd there are oncereturners here tooAnd as for other peoplewho I think have shared in meritI couldnt even number themfor fear of speaking falselyThat is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke And while he was speaking on that topic this thought came to the great king VessavaṇaIts incredible its amazing That there should be such a magnificent Teacher and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching And that such achievements of high distinction should be made knownAnd then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra knowing what the great king Vessavaṇa was thinking said to himWhat does Great King Vessavaṇa think In the past too there was such a magnificent Teacher and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching And such achievements of high distinction were made knownIn the future too there will be such a magnificent Teacher and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching And such achievements of high distinction will be made knownThat sir is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke to the gods of the ThirtyThree And the great king Vessavaṇa having heard and learned it in the presence of Brahmā as he was speaking on that topic informed his own assemblyAnd the spirit Janavasabha having heard and learned it in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking on that topic to his own assembly informed the BuddhaAnd the Buddha having heard and learned it in the presence of the spirit Janavasabha and also from his own direct knowledge informed Venerable nanda And Venerable nanda having heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha informed the monks nuns laymen and laywomenAnd thats how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humansLong DiscoursesWith AmbaṭṭhaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named IcchānaṅgalaHe stayed in a forest near IcchānaṅgalaThe Section on PokkharasātiNow at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in Ukkaṭṭhā It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest qualityPokkharasāti heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearbyHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThe Brahmin Student AmbaṭṭhaNow at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha He was one who recited and remembered the hymns and had mastered in the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man He had been authorized as a master in his own teachers scriptural heritage of the three Vedas with the wordsWhat I know you knowAnd what you know I knowThen Pokkharasāti addressed AmbaṭṭhaDear Ambaṭṭha the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby Its good to see such perfected onesPlease dear Ambaṭṭha go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputationThrough you I shall learn about Master GotamaBut sir how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputationDear Ambaṭṭha the thirtytwo marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies no otherIf he stays at home he becomes a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extends to all four sides he achieves stability in the country and he possesses the seven treasuresHe has the following seven treasuresthe wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasureHe has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemiesAfter conquering this land girt by sea he reigns by principle without rod or swordBut if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness he becomes a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha who draws back the veil from the worldBut dear Ambaṭṭha I am the one who gives the hymnsand you are the one who receives themYes sir replied Ambaṭṭha He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti keeping him to his right He mounted a maredrawn chariot and together with several students set out for the forest near IcchānaṅgalaHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and entered the monastery on footAt that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open airThen the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and saidGentlemen where is Master Gotama at presentFor we have come here to see himThen those mendicants thoughtThis Ambaṭṭha is from a wellknown family and he is the pupil of the wellknown brahmin PokkharasātiThe Buddha wont mind having a discussion together with such gentlemenThey said to AmbaṭṭhaAmbaṭṭha thats his dwelling with the door closed Approach it quietly without hurrying go onto the porch clear your throat and knock with the latch The Buddha will open the doorSo he approached the Buddhas dwelling and knocked and the Buddha opened the doorAmbaṭṭha and the other students entered the dwellingThe other students exchanged greetings with the Buddha and when the greetings and polite conversation were over sat down to one sideBut while the Buddha was sitting Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while walking around or standingSo the Buddha said to himAmbaṭṭha is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachers walking around or standing while Im sitting speaking some polite words or otherThe First Use of the Word RiffraffNo Master GotamaFor it is proper for one brahmin to converse with another while both are walking standing sitting or lying downBut as to these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman I converse with them as I do with Master GotamaBut Ambaṭṭha you must have come here for some purpose You should focus on thatThough this Ambaṭṭha is unqualified he thinks hes qualified What is that but lack of qualificationsWhen he said this Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of being described as unqualified He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself sayingThe ascetic Gotama will be worsted He said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama the Sakyan clan are rudeand argumentativeRiffraff they are and riffraff they remain They dont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahminsIt is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyansriffraff that they aredont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahminsAnd thats how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word riffraff for the first timeThe Second Use of the Word RiffraffBut Ambaṭṭha how have the Sakyans wronged youThis one time Master Gotama I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher the brahmin PokkharasātiI approached the Sakyans in their meeting hallNow at that time several Sakyans and Sakyan princes were sitting on high seats poking each other with their fingers giggling and playing together In fact they even presumed to giggle at me and didnt invite me to a seatIt is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyansriffraff that they aredont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahminsAnd thats how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word riffraff for the second timeThe Third Use of the Word RiffraffEven a little quail Ambaṭṭha speaks as she likes in her own nestKapilavatthu is the Sakyans own place Ambaṭṭha Its not worthy of the Venerable Ambaṭṭha to lose his temper over such a small thingMaster Gotama there are these four castesaristocrats brahmins merchants and workersThree of these castesaristocrats merchants and workersin fact succeed only in serving the brahminsIt is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyansriffraff that they aredont honor respect revere worship or venerate brahminsAnd thats how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word riffraff for the third timeThe Word Son of Bondservants is UsedThen it occurred to the BuddhaThis Ambaṭṭha puts the Sakyans down too much by calling them riffraff Why dont I ask him about his own clanSo the Buddha said to himWhat is your clan AmbaṭṭhaI am a Kaṇhāyana Master GotamaBut recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father the Sakyans were the children of the masters while youre descended from the son of a female bondservant of the SakyansBut the Sakyans claim King Okkāka as their grandfatherOnce upon a time King Okkāka wishing to divert the royal succession to the son of his most beloved queen banished the elder princes from the realmOkkāmukha Karakaṇḍa Hatthinika and SinisūraThey made their home beside a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas where there was a large teak groveFor fear of diluting their lineage they slept with their own sistersThen King Okkāka addressed his ministers and counselorsWhere sirs have the princes settled nowSire there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas by a large grove of sāka the teak tree Theyve settled thereFor fear of diluting their lineage they are sleeping with their own saka sistersThen Ambaṭṭha King Okkāka expressed this heartfelt sentimentThe princes are indeed Sakyans The princes are indeed the best SakyansFrom that day on the Sakyans were recognized and he was their founderNow King Okkāka had a female bondservant named DisāShe gave birth to a black boyWhen he was born Black Boy saidWash me mum bathe me Get this filth off of me I will be useful for youWhereas these days when people see goblins they know them as goblinsin those days they knew goblins as blackboysThey saidHe spoke as soon as he was borna blackboy is born A goblin is bornFrom that day on the Kaṇhāyanas were recognized and he was their founderThats how recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father the Sakyans were the children of the masters while youre descended from the son of a female bondservant of the SakyansWhen he said this those students said to himMaster Gotama please dont put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservantHes wellborn a gentleman learned a good speaker and astute Hes capable of having a dialogue with Master Gotama about thisSo the Buddha said to themWell students if you think thatAmbaṭṭha is illborn not a gentleman uneducated a poor speaker witless and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with meBut if you think thathes wellborn a gentleman learned a good speaker astute and capable of having a dialogue with me about this then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with meHe is capable of having a dialogue We will be silent and let Ambaṭṭha have a dialogue with Master GotamaSo the Buddha said to AmbaṭṭhaWell Ambaṭṭha theres a legitimate question that comes up You wont like it but you ought to answer anywayIf you dont answer but dodge the issue remain silent or simply leave your head will explode into seven pieces right hereWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaAccording to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachers what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas and who is their founderWhen he said this Ambaṭṭha kept silentFor a second time the Buddha put the questionand for a second time Ambaṭṭha kept silentSo the Buddha said to himAnswer now Ambaṭṭha Now is not the time for silenceIf someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha their head explodes into seven pieces there and thenNow at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇi holding a massive iron spear burning blazing and glowing stood in the sky above Ambaṭṭha thinkingIf this Ambaṭṭha doesnt answer when asked a third time Ill blow his head into seven pieces there and thenAnd both the Buddha and Ambaṭṭha could see VajirapāṇiAmbaṭṭha was terrified shocked and awestruck Looking to the Buddha for shelter protection and refuge he sat down close by the Buddha and saidWhat did you sayPlease repeat the questionWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaAccording to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachers what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas and who is their founderI have heard Master Gotama that it is just as you sayThats the origin of the Kaṇhāyanasand thats who their founder isThe Discussion of Ambaṭṭhas HeritageWhen he said this those students made an uproarIt turns out Ambaṭṭha is illborn not a gentleman son of a Sakyan bondservant and that the Sakyans are sons of his mastersAnd it seems that the ascetic Gotama spoke only the truth though we presumed to rebuke himThen it occurred to the BuddhaThese students put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant Why dont I get him out of thisSo the Buddha said to the studentsStudents please dont put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservantThat Black Boy was an eminent sageHe went to a southern country and memorized the Prime Spell Then he approached King Okkāka and asked for the hand of his daughter MaddarūpīThe king said to himWho the hell is this son of a bondservant to ask for the hand of my daughter Angry and upset he fastened a razortipped arrowBut he wasnt able to either shoot it or to relax itThen the ministers and counselors approached the sage Black Boy and saidSpare the king sirspare himThe king will be safe But if he shoots the arrow downwards there will be an earthquake across the entire realmSpare the king sir and spare the countryBoth king and country will be safe But if he shoots the arrow upwards there will be no rain in the entire realm for seven yearsSpare the king sir spare the country and let there be rainBoth king and country will be safe and the rain will fall And if the king aims the arrow at the crown prince he will be safe and untouchedSo the ministers said to OkkākaOkkāka must aim the arrow at the crown princeHe will be safe and untouchedSo King Okkāka aimed the arrow at the crown prince And he was safe and untouchedThen the king was terrified shocked and awestruck Scared by the prime punishment he gave the hand of his daughter MaddarūpīStudents please dont put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant That Black Boy was an eminent sageThe Supremacy of the AristocratsThen the Buddha addressed AmbaṭṭhaWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaSuppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl and they had a sonWould he receive a seat and water from the brahminsHe would Master GotamaAnd would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guestsThey wouldAnd would the brahmins teach him the hymns or notThey wouldAnd would he be kept from the women or notHe would notAnd would the aristocrats anoint him as kingNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause his maternity is unsuitableWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaSuppose a brahmin boy was to sleep with an aristocrat girl and they had a sonWould he receive a seat and water from the brahminsHe would Master GotamaAnd would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guestsThey wouldAnd would the brahmins teach him the hymns or notThey wouldAnd would he be kept from the women or notHe would notAnd would the aristocrats anoint him as kingNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause his paternity is unsuitableAnd so Ambaṭṭha the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior whether comparing women with women or men with menWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaSuppose the brahmins for some reason were to shave a brahmins head inflict him with a sack of ashes and banish him from the nation or the cityWould he receive a seat and water from the brahminsNo Master GotamaAnd would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guestsNo Master GotamaAnd would the brahmins teach him the hymns or notNo Master GotamaAnd would he be kept from the women or notHe would beWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaSuppose the aristocrats for some reason were to shave an aristocrats head inflict him with a sack of ashes and banish him from the nation or the cityWould he receive a seat and water from the brahminsHe would Master GotamaAnd would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors an offering of a dish of milkrice a sacrifice or a feast for guestsThey wouldAnd would the brahmins teach him the hymns or notThey wouldAnd would he be kept from the women or notHe would notAt this point Ambaṭṭha that aristocrat has reached rock bottom with head shaven inflicted with a sack of ashes and banished from city or nationYet still the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferiorBrahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verseThe aristocrat is first among peoplewho take clan as the standardBut one accomplished in knowledge and conductis first among gods and humansThat verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra not poorly sung well spoken not poorly spoken beneficial not harmful and it was approved by meFor I also say thisThe aristocrat is first among peoplewho take clan as the standardBut one accomplished in knowledge and conductis first among gods and humansKnowledge and ConductBut what Master Gotama is that conduct and what is that knowledgeAmbaṭṭha in the supreme knowledge and conduct there is no discussion of ancestry or clan or prideYou deserve me or You dont deserve meWherever there is giving and taking in marriage there is such discussionWhoever is attached to questions of ancestry or clan or pride or to giving and taking in marriage is far from the supreme knowledge and conductThe realization of supreme knowledge and conduct occurs when youve given up such thingsBut what Master Gotama is that conduct and what is that knowledgeAmbaṭṭha its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureA householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clanThey gain faith in the Realized Oneand reflect Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption This pertains to their conductFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption This pertains to their conductFurthermore with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption This pertains to their conductFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption This pertains to their conductThis is that conductWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge and visionThis pertains to their knowledge They understand There is no return to any state of existenceThis pertains to their knowledgeThis is that knowledgeThis mendicant is said to be accomplished in knowledge and also accomplished in conduct and also accomplished in knowledge and conductAnd Ambaṭṭha there is no accomplishment in knowledge and conduct that is better or finer than thisFour DrainsThere are these four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conductWhat fourFirstly take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct plunges into a wilderness region carrying their stuff with a shoulderpole thinkingthey will get by eating fallen fruitIn fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conductThis is the first drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conductFurthermore take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit plunges into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket thinkingthey will get by eating tubers and fruitIn fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conductThis is the second drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conductFurthermore take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit or to get by eating tubers and fruit sets up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwells there serving the sacred flameIn fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conductThis is the third drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conductFurthermore take some ascetic or brahmin who not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit or to get by eating tubers and fruit or to serve the sacred flame sets up a fire chamber in the central square and dwells there thinkingWhen an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters I will honor them as best I canIn fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conductThis is the fourth drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conductThese are the four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conductWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaIs this supreme knowledge and conduct seen in your own traditionNo Master GotamaWho am I and my tradition compared with the supreme knowledge and conductWe are far from thatWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaSince youre not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct have you with your tradition plunged into a wilderness region carrying your stuff with a shoulderpole thinkingyou will get by eating fallen fruitNo Master GotamaWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaHave you with your tradition  plunged into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket thinkingyou will get by eating tubers and fruitNo Master GotamaWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaHave you with your tradition  set up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwelt there serving the sacred flameNo Master GotamaWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaHave you with your tradition  set up a fire chamber in the central square and dwelt there thinkingWhen an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters I will honor them as best I canNo Master GotamaSo you with your tradition are not only inferior to the supreme knowledge and conductyou are even inferior to the four drains that affect the supreme knowledge and conductBut you have been told this by your teacher the brahmin PokkharasātiWho are these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman compared with conversation with the brahmins of the three knowledges Yet he himself has not even fulfilled one of the drainsSee Ambaṭṭha how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged youBeing Like the Sages of the PastBut Pokkharasāti lives off an endowment provided by King Pasenadi of KosalaBut the king wont even grant him an audience face to faceWhen he consults he does so behind a curtainWhy wouldnt the king grant a face to face audience with someone whod receive his legitimate presentation of foodSee Ambaṭṭha how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged youWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaSuppose King Pasenadi was holding consultations with warriorchiefs or chieftains while sitting on an elephants neck or on horseback or while standing on the mat in a chariotAnd suppose hed get down from that place and stand asideThen along would come a worker or their bondservant whod stand in the same place and continue the consultationThis is what King Pasenadi says and this too is what the king saysThough he spoke the kings words and gave the kings advicedoes that qualify him to be the king or the kings ministerNo Master GotamaIn the same way Ambaṭṭha the brahmin seers of the past were Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taughtYou might imagine that since youve learned their hymns by heart in your own tradition that makes you a hermit or someone on the path to becoming a hermit But that is not possibleWhat do you think AmbaṭṭhaAccording to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins the teachers of teachersdid those ancient brahmin hermitsnicely bathed and anointed with hair and beard dressed bedecked with jewels earrings and bracelets dressed in whiteamuse themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation like you do today in your traditionNo Master GotamaDid they eat boiled fine rice garnished with clean meat with the dark grains picked out served with many soups and sauces like you do today in your traditionNo Master GotamaDid they amuse themselves with girls wearing thongs that show off their curves like you do today in your traditionNo Master GotamaDid they drive about in chariots drawn by mares with plaited manes whipping and lashing them onward with long goads like you do today in your traditionNo Master GotamaDid they get men with long swords to guard them in fortresses with moats dug and barriers in place like you do today in your traditionNo Master GotamaSo Ambaṭṭha in your own tradition you are neither hermit nor someone on the path to becoming a hermitWhoever has any doubt or uncertainty about me let them ask me and I will clear up their doubts with my answerSeeing the Two MarksThen the Buddha came out of his dwelling and proceeded to begin walking mindfullyand Ambaṭṭha did likewiseThen while walking beside the Buddha Ambaṭṭha scrutinized his body for the thirtytwo marks of a great manHe saw all of them except for twowhich he had doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThen it occurred to the BuddhaThis brahmin student Ambaṭṭha sees all the marks except for twowhich he has doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThen the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Ambaṭṭha would see his retracted private partsAnd he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongueThen Ambaṭṭha thoughtThe ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking noneHe said to the BuddhaWell now sir I must go I have many duties and much to doPlease Ambaṭṭha go at your convenienceThen Ambaṭṭha mounted his maredrawn chariot and leftNow at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti had come out from Ukkaṭṭhā together with a large group of brahmins and was sitting in his own park just waiting for AmbaṭṭhaThen Ambaṭṭha entered the parkHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the brahmin Pokkharasāti on footHe bowed and sat down to one side and Pokkharasāti said to himI hope dear Ambaṭṭha you saw the Master GotamaI saw him sirWell does he live up to his reputation or notHe does sirMaster Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking noneAnd did you have some discussion with himAnd what kind of discussion did you have with himThen Ambaṭṭha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussedThen Pokkharasāti said to AmbaṭṭhaOh our bloody fake scholar our fake learned man who pretends to be proficient in the three Vedas A man who behaves like this ought when their body breaks up after death to be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellIts only because you repeatedly attacked Master Gotama like that that he kept bringing up charges against usAngry and upset he kicked Ambaṭṭha overand wanted to go and see the Buddha right awayPokkharasāti Visits the BuddhaThen those brahmins said to PokkharasātiIts much too late to visit the ascetic Gotama todayYou can visit him tomorrowSo Pokkharasāti had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he mounted a carriage and with attendants carrying torches set out from Ukkaṭṭhā for the forest near IcchānaṅgalaHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and entered the monastery on footHe went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama has my pupil the student Ambaṭṭha come hereYes he has brahminAnd did you have some discussion with himAnd what kind of discussion did you have with himThen the Buddha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussedThen Pokkharasāti said to the BuddhaAmbaṭṭha is a fool Master Gotama Please forgive himMay the student Ambaṭṭha be happy brahminThen Pokkharasāti scrutinized the Buddhas body for the thirtytwo marks of a great manHe saw all of them except for twowhich he had doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThen it occurred to the BuddhaPokkharasāti sees all the marks except for twowhich he has doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThen the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Pokkharasāti would see his retracted private partsAnd he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tonguePokkharasāti thoughtThe ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking noneHe said to the BuddhaWould Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept todays meal from meThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Pokkharasāti announced the time to himIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Pokkharasāti together with the mendicant Saṅgha where he sat on the seat spread outThen Pokkharasāti served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods while his students served the SaṅghaWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Pokkharasāti took a low seat and sat to one sideThen the Buddha taught him step by step witha talk on giving ethical conduct and heavenHe explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciationAnd when the Buddha knew that Pokkharasātis mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhassuffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dyein that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin PokkharasātiEverything that has a beginning has an endPokkharasāti Declares Himself a Lay FollowerThen Pokkharasāti saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions He said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there just so has Master Gotama made the Teaching clear in many waysTogether with my children wives retinue and ministers I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeJust as Master Gotama visits other devoted families in Ukkaṭṭhā may he visit mineThe brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you rise in your presence give you a seat and water and gain confidence in their hearts That will be for their lasting welfare and happinessThats good of you to say householderLong DiscoursesWith MahāliOn the Brahmin EmissariesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were residing in Vesālī on some businessThey heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the BuddhaNow at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddhas attendantThe brahmin emissaries went up to him and saidMaster Nāgita where is Master Gotama at presentFor we want to see himIts the wrong time to see the Buddha he is on retreatSo right there the brahmin emissaries sat down to one side thinkingWell go only after weve seen Master GotamaOn Oṭṭhaddha the LicchaviOṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roofHe bowed stood to one side and said to NāgitaMaster Nāgita where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor we want to see himIts the wrong time to see the Buddha he is on retreatSo right there Oṭṭhaddha also sat down to one side thinkingIll go only after Ive seen the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaThen the novice Sīha approached NāgitaHe bowed stood to one side and said to NāgitaSir Kassapa these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis have come here to see the Buddha Itd be good if these people got to see the BuddhaWell then Sīha tell the Buddha yourselfYes sir replied SīhaHe went to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and told him of the people waiting to see him addingSir itd be good if these people got to see the BuddhaWell then Sīha spread out a seat in the shade of the dwellingYes sir replied Sīha and he did soThen the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread outThen the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one sideOṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one sideOṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha Sir a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and saidMahāli soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years I see heavenly sights that are pleasant sensual and arousing but I dont hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant sensual and arousingThe heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta cannot hear do such sounds really exist or notOneSided ImmersionSuch sounds really do exist but Sunakkhatta cannot hear themWhat is the cause sir what is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear them even though they really do existMahāli take a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly soundsWhen they have developed immersion for that purposethey see heavenly sights but dont hear heavenly soundsWhy is thatBecause that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that wayFurthermore take a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the southern quarter western quarter northern quarter above below across That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that wayTake a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to hear heavenly sounds but not to see heavenly sightsWhen they have developed immersion for that purposethey hear heavenly sounds but dont see heavenly sightsWhy is thatBecause that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that wayFurthermore take a mendicant who has developed onesided immersion to the southern quarter western quarter northern quarter above below across That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that wayTake a mendicant who has developed twosided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to both hear heavenly sounds and see heavenly sightsWhen they have developed immersion for that purposethey both see heavenly sights and hear heavenly soundsWhy is thatBecause that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that wayFurthermore take a mendicant who has developed twosided immersion to the southern quarter western quarter northern quarter above below across That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that wayThis is the cause Mahāli this is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant sensual and arousing even though they really do existSurely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing such a development of immersionNo Mahāli the mendicants dont lead the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing such a development of immersionThere are other things that are finer for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under meThe Four Noble FruitsBut sir what are those finer thingsFirstly Mahāli with the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningThis is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under meFurthermore a mendicantwith the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusionis a oncereturner They come back to this world once only then make an end of sufferingThis too is one of the finer thingsFurthermore with the ending of the five lower fetters a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that worldThis too is one of the finer thingsFurthermore a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsThis too is one of the finer thingsThese are the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under meThe Noble Eightfold PathBut sir is there a path and a practice for realizing these thingsThere is MahāliWell what is itIt is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionThis is the path and the practice for realizing these thingsOn the Two RenunciatesThis one time Mahāli I was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas MonasteryThen two renunciatesthe wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattikacame and exchanged greetings with meWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they stood to one side and said to meReverend Gotama are the soul and the body the same thing or they are different thingsWell then reverends listen and pay close attention I will speakYes reverend they repliedI said thisTake the case when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics They enter and remain in the first absorptionWhen a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of themThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsIt would reverendBut reverends I know and see like thisNevertheless I do not sayThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things They enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of themThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsIt would reverendBut reverends I know and see like thisNevertheless I do not sayThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision When a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of themThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsIt would reverendBut reverends I know and see like thisNevertheless I do not sayThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsThey understand  there is no return to any state of existenceWhen a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of themThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsIt would not reverendBut reverends I know and see like thisNevertheless I do not sayThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi was happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesWith LohiccaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at SālavatikāNow at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest qualityNow at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconceptionShould an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality they ought not inform anyone else For what can one person do for anotherSuppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bondThats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for anotherLohicca heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Sālavatikā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen Lohicca addressed his barber RosikaHere dear Rosika go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd then ask him whether hetogether with the mendicant Saṅgha might please accept tomorrows meal from the brahmin LohiccaYes sir Rosika repliedHe did as he was asked andthe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Rosika got up from his seat went to Lohicca and said to himI gave the Buddha your messageand he acceptedAnd when the night had passed Lohicca had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time sayingHere dear Rosika go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time sayingIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyYes sir Rosika replied He did as he was askedThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicantsNow Rosika was following behind the Buddhaand told him of Lohiccas views addingSir please dissuade him from that harmful misconceptionHopefully thatll happen Rosika hopefully thatll happenThen the Buddha approached Lohiccas home where he sat on the seat spread outThen Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsQuestioning LohiccaWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Lohicca took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha said to himIs it really true Lohicca that you have such a harmful misconceptionShould an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality they ought not inform anyone else For what can one person do for anotherSuppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bondThats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for anotherYes Master GotamaWhat do you think LohiccaDo you reside in SālavatikāYes Master GotamaLohicca suppose someone were to sayThe brahmin Lohicca reigns over SālavatikāHe alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Sālavatikā and not share them with anyone elseWould the person who spoke like that make it difficult for those whose living depends on you or notThey would Master GotamaBut is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindlyUnkindly sirBut does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostilityHostility sirAnd when the heart is full of hostility is there right view or wrong viewWrong view Master GotamaAn individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I sayhell or the animal realmWhat do you think LohiccaDoes King Pasenadi reign over Kāsī and KosalaYes Master GotamaLohicca suppose someone were to sayKing Pasenadi reigns over Kāsī and KosalaHe alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Kāsī and Kosala and not share them with anyone elseWould the person who spoke like that make it difficult for yourself and others whose living depends on King Pasenadi or notThey would Master GotamaBut is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindlyUnkindly sirBut does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostilityHostility sirAnd when the heart is full of hostility is there right view or wrong viewWrong view Master GotamaAn individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I sayhell or the animal realmSo it seems Lohicca that should someone say such a thing either of Lohicca or of King Pasenadithat is wrong viewIn the same way suppose someone were to sayShould an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality they ought not inform anyone else For what can one person do for anotherSuppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bondThats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for anotherNow there are gentlemen who relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One achieve a high distinction such as the following they realize the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturn the fruit of nonreturn or the fruit of perfection And in addition there are those who ripen the seeds for rebirth in a heavenly state The person who spoke like that makes it difficult for them Theyre acting unkindly their heart is full of hostility and they have wrong viewAn individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I sayhell or the animal realmThree Teachers Who Deserve to Be ReprimandedLohicca there are three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimandedWhen someone reprimands such teachers the reprimand is true substantive legitimate and blamelessWhat threeFirstly take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessnessThey teach their disciplesThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessBut their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the teachers instructionThat teacher deserves to be reprimandedVenerable you havent reached the goal of the ascetic life and when you teach disciplesthey proceed having turned away from the teachers instructionIts like a man who makes advances on a woman though she pulls away or embraces her though she turns her backThats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one do for anotherThis is the first kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimandedFurthermore take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessnessThey teach their disciplesThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessTheir disciples do want to listen They pay attention and apply their minds to understand They dont proceed having turned away from the teachers instructionThat teacher deserves to be reprimandedVenerable you havent reached the goal of the ascetic life and when you teach disciplesthey dont proceed having turned away from the teachers instructionIts like someone who abandons their own field and presumes to weed someone elses field Thats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one do for anotherThis is the second kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimandedFurthermore take a teacher who has reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessnessThey teach their disciplesThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessBut their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the teachers instructionThat teacher deserves to be reprimandedVenerable you have reached the goal of the ascetic life yet when you teach disciplesthey proceed having turned away from the teachers instructionSuppose someone cut off an old bond only to create another new bondThats the consequence of such a wicked greedy deed I say For what can one person do for anotherThis is the third kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimandedThese are the three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimandedWhen someone reprimands such teachers the reprimand is true substantive legitimate and blamelessA Teacher Who Does Not Deserve to Be ReprimandedWhen he had spoken Lohicca said to the BuddhaBut Master Gotama is there a teacher in the world who does not deserve to be reprimandedThere is LohiccaBut who is that teacherIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics They enter and remain in the first absorption A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimandedWhen someone reprimands such a teacher the reprimand is false baseless illegitimate and blameworthyThey enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionA teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded They understand  there is no return to any state of existenceA teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded When someone reprimands such a teacher the reprimand is false baseless illegitimate and blameworthyWhen he had spoken Lohicca said to the BuddhaSuppose Master Gotama a person was on the verge of falling off a cliff and another person were to grab them by the hair pull them up and place them on firm groundIn the same way when I was falling off a cliff Master Gotama pulled me up and placed me on safe groundExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeLong DiscoursesWhat Came FirstSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery in the stilt longhouse of Migāras motherNow at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being ordainedThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air beneath the shade of the longhouseVāseṭṭha saw himand said to BhāradvājaReverend Bhāradvāja the Buddha is walking mindfully in the open air beneath the shade of the longhouseCome reverend lets go to the BuddhaHopefully well get to hear a Dhamma talk from himYes reverend replied BhāradvājaSo they went to the Buddha bowed and walked beside himThen the Buddha said to VāseṭṭhaVāseṭṭha you are both brahmins by birth and clan and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family I hope you dont have to suffer abuse and insults from the brahminsActually sir the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical insults to the fullest extentBut how do the brahmins insult youSir the brahmins sayOnly brahmins are the first caste other castes are inferior
