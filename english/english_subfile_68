were to anoint massage bathe and rub themand even if they were to defecate and urinate right thereEven if you were to establish your mother and father as supreme monarchs of this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would still not have done enough to repay themWhy is thatParents are very helpful to their children they raise them nurture them and show them the worldBut you have done enough more than enough to repay them if you encourage settle and ground unfaithful parents in faith unethical parents in ethical conduct stingy parents in generosity or ignorant parents in wisdomThen a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaWhat does Master Gotama teach What does he explainBrahmin I teach action and inactionBut in what way does Master Gotama teach action and inactionI teach inaction regarding bad bodily verbal and mental conduct and the many kinds of unskillful thingsI teach action regarding good bodily verbal and mental conduct and the many kinds of skillful thingsThis is the kind of action and inaction that I teachExcellent Master Gotama  From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeThen the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaHow many kinds of people in the world are worthy of a religious donation And where should a gift be givenHouseholder there are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donationthe trainee and the masterThese are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donation and thats where you should give a giftThat is what the Buddha saidThen the Holy One the Teacher went on to sayIn this world the trainee and the masterare worthy of offerings dedicated to the godsThey are upright in bodyspeech and mindThis is the field for sponsors of sacrificewhats given here is very fruitfulSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras motherThere Sāriputta addressed the mendicantsReverends mendicantsReverend they repliedSāriputta said thisI will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fettered externallyListen and pay close attention I will speakYes reverend they repliedSāriputta said thisWho is a person fettered internallyIts a mendicant who is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertakenWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in one of the orders of godsWhen they pass away from there theyre a returner who comes back to this state of existenceThis is called a person who is fettered internally a returner who comes back to this state of existenceWho is a person fettered externallyIts a mendicant who is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertakenThey enter and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mindWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in one of the orders of godsWhen they pass away from there theyre a nonreturner not coming back to this state of existenceThis is called a person who is fettered externally a nonreturner who does not come back to this state of existenceFurthermore a mendicant is ethical  they keep the rules theyve undertakenThey simply practice for disillusionment dispassion and cessation regarding sensual pleasuresThey simply practice for disillusionment dispassion and cessation regarding future livesThey practice for the ending of cravingThey practice for the ending of greedWhen their body breaks up after death they are reborn in one of the orders of godsWhen they pass away from there they are nonreturners not coming back to this state of existenceThis is called a person who is fettered externally a nonreturner who does not come back to this state of existenceThen several peacefulminded deities went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to the BuddhaSir Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fettersThe assembly is overjoyedSir please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassionThe Buddha consented in silenceThen the Buddha as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from Jetas Grove and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother in front of SāriputtaHe sat on the seat spread outSāriputta bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to himJust now Sāriputta several peacefulminded deities came up to me bowed and stood to one sideThose deities said to meSir Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fettersThe assembly is overjoyedSir please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassionThose deities though they number ten twenty thirty forty fifty or sixty can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each otherSāriputta you might thinkSurely those deities since so many of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other must have developed their minds in that placeBut you should not see it like thisIt was right here that those deities developed their mindsSo you should train like thisWe shall have peaceful faculties and peaceful mindsThats how you should trainWhen your faculties and mind are peaceful your acts of body speech and mind will be peaceful thinkingWe shall present the gift of peace to our spiritual companionsThats how you should trainThose wanderers who follow other paths Sāriputta who have not heard this exposition of the teaching are lostSo I have heardAt one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying at Varaṇā on the bank of the Kaddama LakeThen the brahmin rāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to MahākaccānaWhat is the cause Master Kaccāna what is the reason why aristocrats fight with aristocrats brahmins fight with brahmins and householders fight with householdersIt is because of their insistence on sensual desire their shackles avarice and attachment that aristocrats fight with aristocrats brahmins fight with brahmins and householders fight with householdersWhat is the cause Master Kaccāna what is the reason why ascetics fight with asceticsIt is because of their insistence on views their shackles avarice and attachment that ascetics fight with asceticsMaster Kaccāna is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on

staying the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHe brahmin has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on viewsWhen this was said the brahmin rāmadaṇḍa got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three timesHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the

the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAt one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā in Gundas GroveThen the brahmin Kandarāyana went up to Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him  He sat down to one side and said to MahākaccānaI have heard Master Kaccāna that the ascetic Kaccāna doesnt bow to old brahmins the elderly and senior who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seatAnd this is indeed the casefor the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins elderly and senior who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seatThis is not appropriate Master KaccānaThere is the stage of an elder and the stage of youth as explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaIf an elder though eighty ninety or a hundred years old still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking morethey are reckoned as a child not a seniorIf a youth young blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of lifedoes not dwell in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking morethey are reckoned as astute a seniorWhen this was said the brahmin Kandarāyana got up from his seat placed his robe over one shoulder and bowed with his head at the feet of the young mendicants sayingThe masters are elders at the stage of the elderwe are youths at the stage of youthExcellent Master Kaccāna  From this day forth may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAt a

MountainNow at that time a wanderer called Sarabha had recently left this teaching and trainingHe was telling a crowd in RājagahaI learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyanthen I left their teaching and trainingThen several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Rājagaha for almsThey heard what Sarabha was sayingThen after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himThe wanderer called Sarabha has recently left this teaching and trainingHe was telling a crowd in RājagahaI learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyanthen I left their teaching and trainingSir please go to the wanderers monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to see Sarabha the wanderer out of compassionThe Buddha consented in silenceThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderers monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to visit Sarabha the wandererHe sat on the seat spread out and said to the wanderer SarabhaIs it really true Sarabha that youve been sayingI learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyanthen I left their teaching and trainingWhen he said this Sarabha kept silentFor a second time the Buddha said to SarabhaTell me Sarabha what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the SakyanIf youve not learned it fully Ill fill you inBut if you have learned it fully Ill agreeFor a second time Sarabha kept silentFor a third time the Buddha said to SarabhaSarabha the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the SakyanIf youve not learned it fully Ill fill you inBut if you have learned it fully Ill agreeFor a third time Sarabha kept silentThen those wanderers said to SarabhaThe ascetic Gotama has offered to tell you anything you ask forSpeak reverend Sarabha what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the SakyanIf youve not learned it fully hell fill you inBut if you have learned it fully hell agreeWhen this was said Sarabha sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to sayKnowing this the Buddha said to the wanderersWanderers someone might say to meYou claim to be a fully awakened Buddha but regarding these things youre not fully awakened Then Id carefully pursue press and grill them on that pointWhen grilled by me they would without a doubt fall into one of these three categories Theyd dodge the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points Theyd display annoyance hate and bitterness Or theyd sit silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say like

having roared his lions roar three times in the wanderers monastery on the bank of the Sappinī river rose into the sky and flew awaySoon after the Buddha left those wanderers gave Sarabha a comprehensive tonguelashingReverend Sarabha youre just like an old jackal in the formidable wilderness who thinks Ill roar a lions roar but they still only manage to squeal and yelp like a jackalIn

sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by the deities or by ascetics and brahminsThat bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the resultThen after grilling them about the third messenger of the gods King Yama falls silentThen the wardens of hell punish them with the fivefold crucifixionThey drive redhot stakes through the hands and feet and another in the middle of the chestAnd there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminatedThen the wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes They hang them upsidedown and hack them with hatchets They harness them to a chariot and drive them back and forth across burning ground blazing and glowing They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals blazing and glowing Then the wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a redhot copper pot burning blazing and glowingThere theyre seared in boiling scum and theyre swept up and down and round and roundAnd there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminatedThen the wardens of hell toss them into the Great HellNow about that Great HellFour are its corners four its doorsneatly divided in equal partsSurrounded by an iron wallof iron is its roofThe ground is even made of ironit burns with fierce fireThe heat forever radiatesa hundred leagues aroundOnce upon a time King Yama thoughtThose who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishmentsOh I hope I may be reborn as a human being And that a Realized Onea perfected one a fully awakened Buddhaarises in the world And that I may pay homage to the BuddhaThen the Buddha can teach me Dhamma so that I may understand his teachingNow I dont say this because Ive heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin I only say it because Ive known seen and realized it for myselfThose people who are negligentwhen warned by the gods messengersa long time they sorrowwhen they go to that wretched placeBut those good and peaceful peoplewhen warned by the gods messengersnever neglectthe teaching of the noble onesSeeing the peril in graspingthe origin of birth and deaththeyre freed by not graspingwith the ending of birth and deathHappy theyve come to a safe placeextinguished in this very lifeTheyve gone beyond all threats and perilsand risen above all sufferingNumbered DiscoursesBrahminsWith SaṅgāravaThen Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama we who are called brahminsmake sacrifices and encourage others to make sacrificesNow Master Gotama both of these peoplethe one who sacrifices and the one who encourages others to sacrificeare doing good for many people on account of that sacrificeBut Master Gotama when someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness they tame calm and extinguish themselves alone That being so they are doing good for just one person on account of that going forthWell then brahmin Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think brahminA Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedCome this is the path this is the practice Practicing like this I realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual life with my own insight and I make it knownPlease all of you practice like this and you too will realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual life and will live having realized it with your own insightSo the teacher teaches Dhamma and others practice accordingly in their hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousandsWhat do you think brahminThis being so are they doing good for just one person or for many people on account of going forthThis being so Master Gotama they are doing good for many people on account of going forthWhen he said this Venerable nanda said to SaṅgāravaBrahmin which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialSaṅgārava said to nandaThose such as the masters Gotama and nandaare honored and praised by meFor a second time nanda said to SaṅgāravaBrahmin I didnt ask youwho you honor and praiseI asked youwhich of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialFor a second time Saṅgārava said to nandaThose such as the masters Gotama and nandaare honored and praised by meFor a third time nanda said to SaṅgāravaBrahmin I didnt ask youwho you honor and praiseI asked youwhich of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficialFor a third time Saṅgārava said to nandaThose such as the masters Gotama and nandaare honored and praised by meThen it occurred to the BuddhaThough nanda asked him a sensible question three times Saṅgārava falters without answeringWhy dont I give him a way outSo the Buddha said to SaṅgāravaBrahmin what came up in the conversation among the kings retinue today sitting together in the royal compoundMaster Gotama this came upFormerly it seems there were fewer mendicants but more of them displayed superhuman demonstrations of psychic powerwhile these days there are more mendicants but fewer display superhuman demonstrations of psychic powerThis is what came up in the conversation among the kings retinue today while sitting together in the royal compoundBrahmin there are three kinds of demonstrationWhat threeA demonstration of psychic power a demonstration of revealing and a demonstration of instructionAnd what is the demonstration of psychic powerIts when someone wields the many kinds of psychic powermultiplying themselves and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful They control the body as far as the Brahmā realmThis is called the demonstration of psychic powerAnd what is the demonstration of revealingIn one case someone reveals by means of a signThis is what youre thinking such is your thought and thus is your state of mindAnd even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwiseIn another case someone reveals after hearing it from humans or nonhumans or deitiesThis is what youre thinking such is your thought and thus is your state of mindAnd even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwiseIn another case someone reveals by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considersThis is what youre thinking such is your thought and thus is your state of mindAnd even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwiseIn another case someone comprehends the mind of a person who has attained the immersion thats free of placing the mind and keeping it connected They understandJudging by the way this persons intentions are directed immediately after this mind state theyll think this thoughtAnd even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwiseThis is called the demonstration of revealingAnd what is a demonstration of instructionIts when someone instructs others like thisThink like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved thatThis is called a demonstration of instructionThese are the three kinds of demonstrationOf these three kinds of demonstration which do you consider to be the finestRegarding this Master Gotama a demonstration of psychic poweris experienced only by the one who performs it occurring only to themThis seems to me like a magic trickAnd the demonstration where someone reveals something by means of a signor after hearing it from humans nonhumans or deitiesor by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considersor by comprehending the mind of another personis also experienced only by the one who performs it occurring only to themThis also seems to me like a magic trickBut as to the demonstration where someone instructs othersThink like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved thatI prefer this demonstration Master Gotama Its the finest of the three kinds of demonstrationIts incredible Master Gotama its amazinghow well this was said by Master Gotama We regard Master Gotama as someone who possesses these three kinds of demonstrationFor Master Gotama wields the many kinds of psychic power  controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realmAnd Master Gotama comprehends the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected He understandsJudging by the way this persons intentions are directed immediately after this mind state theyll think this thoughtAnd Master Gotama instructs others like thisThink like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved thatYour words are clearly invasive and intrusive brahminNevertheless I will answer youFor I do wield the many kinds of psychic power  controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realmAnd I do comprehend the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected I understandJudging by the way this persons intentions are directed immediately after this mind state theyll think this thoughtAnd I do instruct others like thisThink like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved thatBut Master Gotama is there even one other mendicant who possesses these three kinds of demonstration apart from Master GotamaTheres not just one hundred mendicants brahmin who possess these three kinds of demonstration nor two three four or five hundred but many more than thatBut where are these mendicants now stayingRight here brahmin in this Saṅgha of mendicantsExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeNumbered DiscoursesBrahminsWith JāṇussoṇiThen the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him Seated to one side he said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama whoever has a sacrifice an offering of food for ancestors a dish of milkrice prepared for an auspicious ceremony or a gift to give should give it to the brahmins who have mastered the three Vedic knowledgesBut brahmin how do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is proficient in the three Vedic knowledgesMaster Gotama its when a brahmin is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation He recites and remembers the hymns and has mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knows philology and grammar and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manThats how the brahmins describe a brahmin who is proficient in the three Vedic knowledgesBrahmin a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble OneBut Master Gotama how is one a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble OneMaster Gotama please teach me thisWell then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Jāṇussoṇi repliedThe Buddha said thisBrahmin its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures enters and remains in the fourth absorptionWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis is the first knowledge that they attainIgnorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThis is the second knowledge that they attainIgnorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is

origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis is the third knowledge that they attainIgnorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteOne who is perfect in precepts and observancesresolute and serenewhose mind is masteredunified serenewho knows their past livesand sees heaven and places of lossand has attained the end of rebirththat sage has perfect insightBecause of these three knowledgesa brahmin is a master of the three knowledgesThats who I call a threeknowledge masterand not some mere reciterThis brahmin is a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble OneMaster Gotama the master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble OneAnd Master Gotama a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the three knowledges in the

to timethe foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimityIf a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses solely on the foundation of immersion its likely their mind will incline to lazinessIf they focus solely on the foundation of exertion its likely their mind will incline to restlessnessIf they focus solely on the foundation of equanimity its likely their mind wont properly become immersed in samādhi for the ending of defilementsBut when a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses from time to time on the foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimity their mind becomes pliable workable and radiant not brittle and has properly entered immersion for the ending of defilementsIts like when a goldsmith or a goldsmiths apprentice prepares a forge fires the crucible picks up some gold with tongs and puts it in the crucible From time to time they fan it from time to time they sprinkle water on it and from time to time they just watch over itIf they solely fanned it the gold would likely be scorchedIf they solely sprinkled water on it the gold would likely cool downIf they solely watched over it the gold would likely not be properly processedBut when that goldsmith fans it from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and watches over it from time to time that gold becomes pliable workable and radiant not brittle and is ready to be workedThen the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament they want whether a bracelet earrings a necklace or a golden garlandIn the same way a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on three foundations from time to timethe foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimity When a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses from time to time on the foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimity their mind becomes pliable workable and
