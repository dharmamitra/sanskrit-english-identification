The Buddha said this
Firstly brahmin someone has done bad things and not done good things by way of body speech and mind
So what theyve done and what theyve not done is why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Furthermore brahmin someone has done good things and not done bad things by way of body speech and mind
So what theyve done and what theyve not done is why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Excellent Master Gotama  From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Then Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
nanda I absolutely say that you should not do bad things by way of body speech and mind
But sir if someone does these things that should not be done what drawbacks should they expect
They should expect these drawbacks
They blame themselves
After examination sensible people criticize them
They get a bad reputation
They feel lost when they die
And when their body breaks up after death they are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
These are the drawbacks they should expect
nanda I absolutely say that you should do good things by way of body speech and mind
But sir if someone does these things that should be done what benefits should they expect
They should expect these benefits
They dont blame themselves
After examination sensible people praise them
They get a good reputation
They dont feel lost when they die
And when the body breaks up after death they are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
These are the benefits they should expect
Mendicants give up the unskillful
It is possible to give up the unskillful
If it wasnt possible I wouldnt say
Give up the unskillful
But it is possible and so I say
Give up the unskillful
And if giving up the unskillful led to harm and suffering I would not say
Give up the unskillful
But giving up the unskillful leads to welfare and happiness so I say
Give up the unskillful

Peaceful Mind
Mendicants I will teach you the level of the bad person and the level of the good person
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
What is the level of the bad person
The bad person is ungrateful and thankless
for the wicked only know how to be ungrateful and thankless
It is totally the level of a bad person to be ungrateful and thankless
The good person is grateful and thankful
for the virtuous only know how to be grateful and thankful
It is totally the level of a good person to be grateful and thankful
Mendicants I say that these two people cannot easily be repaid
Mother and father
You would not have done enough to repay your mother and father even if you were to carry your mother around on one shoulder and your father on the other and if you lived like this for a hundred years and if you were to anoint massage bathe and rub them
and even if they were to defecate and urinate right there
Even if you were to establish your mother and father as supreme monarchs of this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would still not have done enough to repay them
Why is that
Parents are very helpful to their children they raise them nurture them and show them the world
But you have done enough more than enough to repay them if you encourage settle and ground unfaithful parents in faith unethical parents in ethical conduct stingy parents in generosity or ignorant parents in wisdom
Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
What does Master Gotama teach What does he explain
Brahmin I teach action and inaction
But in what way does Master Gotama teach action and inaction
I teach inaction regarding bad bodily verbal and mental conduct and the many kinds of unskillful things
I teach action regarding good bodily verbal and mental conduct and the many kinds of skillful things
This is the kind of action and inaction that I teach
Excellent Master Gotama  From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
How many kinds of people in the world are worthy of a religious donation And where should a gift be given
Householder there are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donation
the trainee and the master
These are two kinds of people in the world who are worthy of a religious donation and thats where you should give a gift
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
In this world the trainee and the master
are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods
They are upright in body
speech and mind
This is the field for sponsors of sacrifice
whats given here is very fruitful
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
I will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fettered externally
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
Who is a person fettered internally
Its a mendicant who is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in one of the orders of gods
When they pass away from there theyre a returner who comes back to this state of existence
This is called a person who is fettered internally a returner who comes back to this state of existence
Who is a person fettered externally
Its a mendicant who is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken
They enter and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in one of the orders of gods
When they pass away from there theyre a nonreturner not coming back to this state of existence
This is called a person who is fettered externally a nonreturner who does not come back to this state of existence
Furthermore a mendicant is ethical  they keep the rules theyve undertaken
They simply practice for disillusionment dispassion and cessation regarding sensual pleasures
They simply practice for disillusionment dispassion and cessation regarding future lives
They practice for the ending of craving
They practice for the ending of greed
When their body breaks up after death they are reborn in one of the orders of gods
When they pass away from there they are nonreturners not coming back to this state of existence
This is called a person who is fettered externally a nonreturner who does not come back to this state of existence
Then several peacefulminded deities went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to the Buddha
Sir Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters
The assembly is overjoyed
Sir please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion
The Buddha consented in silence
Then the Buddha as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from Jetas Grove and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother in front of Sāriputta
He sat on the seat spread out
Sāriputta bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Just now Sāriputta several peacefulminded deities came up to me bowed and stood to one side
Those deities said to me
Sir Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters
The assembly is overjoyed
Sir please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion
Those deities though they number ten twenty thirty forty fifty or sixty can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other
Sāriputta you might think
Surely those deities since so many of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other must have developed their minds in that place
But you should not see it like this
It was right here that those deities developed their minds
So you should train like this
We shall have peaceful faculties and peaceful minds
Thats how you should train
When your faculties and mind are peaceful your acts of body speech and mind will be peaceful thinking
We shall present the gift of peace to our spiritual companions
Thats how you should train
Those wanderers who follow other paths Sāriputta who have not heard this exposition of the teaching are lost
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying at Varaṇā on the bank of the Kaddama Lake
Then the brahmin rāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna
What is the cause Master Kaccāna what is the reason why aristocrats fight with aristocrats brahmins fight with brahmins and householders fight with householders
It is because of their insistence on sensual desire their shackles avarice and attachment that aristocrats fight with aristocrats brahmins fight with brahmins and householders fight with householders
What is the cause Master Kaccāna what is the reason why ascetics fight with ascetics
It is because of their insistence on views their shackles avarice and attachment that ascetics fight with ascetics
Master Kaccāna is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views
There is brahmin
Who in the world has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views
In the eastern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī
There the Blessed One is now staying the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
He brahmin has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views
When this was said the brahmin rāmadaṇḍa got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
He who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views
Excellent Master Kaccāna Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā in Gundas Grove
Then the brahmin Kandarāyana went up to Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him  He sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna
I have heard Master Kaccāna that the ascetic Kaccāna doesnt bow to old brahmins the elderly and senior who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat
And this is indeed the case
for the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins elderly and senior who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat
This is not appropriate Master Kaccāna
There is the stage of an elder and the stage of youth as explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
If an elder though eighty ninety or a hundred years old still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more
they are reckoned as a child not a senior
If a youth young blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life
does not dwell in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more
they are reckoned as astute a senior
When this was said the brahmin Kandarāyana got up from his seat placed his robe over one shoulder and bowed with his head at the feet of the young mendicants saying
The masters are elders at the stage of the elder
we are youths at the stage of youth
Excellent Master Kaccāna  From this day forth may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
At a time when bandits are strong kings are weak
Then the king is not at ease when going out or coming back or when touring the provinces
The brahmins and householders likewise are not at ease when going out or coming back or when inspecting their business activities
In the same way at a time when bad mendicants are strong goodhearted mendicants are weak
Then the goodhearted mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha or they stay in the borderlands
This is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of many people of gods and humans
At a time when kings are strong bandits are weak
Then the king is at ease when going out or coming back or when inspecting the provinces
The brahmins and householders likewise are at ease when going out or coming back or when inspecting their business activities

Then the bad mendicants continually adhere to silence in the midst of the Saṅgha or they leave for some place or other
This is for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
Mendicants I dont praise wrong practice for these two for laypeople and renunciates
Because of wrong practice neither laypeople nor renunciates succeed in completing the procedure of the skillful teaching
I praise right practice for these two for laypeople and renunciates
Because of right practice both laypeople and renunciates succeed in completing the procedure of the skillful teaching
Mendicants by memorizing the discourses incorrectly taking only a semblance of the phrasing some mendicants shut out the meaning and the teaching They act for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of many people of gods and humans
They make much bad karma and make the true teaching disappear
But by memorizing the discourses well not taking only a semblance of the phrasing some mendicants reinforce the meaning and the teaching They act for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of the people of gods and humans
They make much merit and make the true teaching continue

Unskillful Roots
Mendicants there are these three unskillful roots
What three
Greed hate and delusion
Greed is a root of the unskillful
When a greedy person chooses to act by way of body speech or mind that too is unskillful
When a greedy person overcome by greed causes another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power that too is unskillful
And so these many bad unskillful things are produced in them born sourced originated and conditioned by greed
Hate is a root of the unskillful
When a hateful person chooses to act by way of body speech or mind that too is unskillful
When a hateful person overcome by hate causes another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power that too is unskillful
And so these many bad unskillful things are produced in them born sourced originated and conditioned by hate
Delusion is a root of the unskillful
When a deluded person chooses to act by way of body speech or mind that too is unskillful
When a deluded person overcome by delusion causes another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power that too is unskillful
And so these many bad unskillful things are produced in them born sourced originated and conditioned by delusion
Such a person is said to have speech thats illtimed false meaningless not in line with the teaching and training
Why is this
This person causes another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power
So when someone makes a valid criticism theyre scornful and admit nothing
When someone makes a baseless criticism they make no effort to explain This is why thats untrue this is why thats false
Thats why such a person is said to have speech thats illtimed false meaningless not in line with the teaching and training
Such a personovercome with bad unskillful qualities born of greed hate and delusionsuffers in the present life with anguish distress and fever
And when the body breaks up after death they can expect to be reborn in a bad place
Suppose a sal axlewood or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camels foot creepers It would fall to ruin and disaster
In the same way such a personovercome with bad unskillful qualities born of greed hate and delusionsuffers in the present life with anguish distress and fever
And when the body breaks up after death they can expect to be reborn in a bad place
These are the three unskillful roots
There are these three skillful roots
What three
Contentment love and understanding
Contentment is a root of the skillful
When a contented person chooses to act by way of body speech or mind that too is skillful
When a contented person not overcome by greed doesnt cause another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power that too is skillful
And so these many skillful things are produced in them born sourced originated and conditioned by contentment
Love is a root of the skillful
When a loving person chooses to act by way of body speech or mind that too is skillful
When a loving person not overcome by hate doesnt cause another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power that too is skillful
And so these many skillful things are produced in them born sourced originated and conditioned by love
Understanding is a root of the skillful
When an understanding person chooses to act by way of body speech or mind that too is skillful
When an understanding person not overcome by delusion doesnt cause another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power that too is skillful
And so these many skillful things are produced in them born sourced originated and conditioned by understanding
Such a person is said to have speech thats welltimed true meaningful in line with the teaching and training
Why is this
This person doesnt cause another to suffer under a false pretextby execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishmentthinking Im powerful I want power
So when someone makes a valid criticism they admit it and arent scornful
When someone makes a baseless criticism they make an effort to explain
This is why thats untrue this is why thats false
Thats why such a person is said to have speech thats welltimed true meaningful in line with the teaching and training
For such a person bad unskillful qualities born of greed hate and delusion are cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future
In the present life theyre happy free of anguish distress and fever
and theyre also extinguished in the present life
Suppose a sal axlewood or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camels foot creepers
Then along comes a person with a spade and basket
Theyd cut the creeper out by the roots dig them up and pull them out down to the fibers and stems
Then theyd split the creeper apart cut up the parts and chop it into splinters Theyd dry the splinters in the wind and sun burn them with fire and reduce them to ashes Then theyd sweep away the ashes in a strong wind or float them away down a swift stream
In the same way for such a person bad unskillful qualities born of greed hate and delusion are cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future
In the present life theyre happy free of anguish distress and fever

With Sāriputta
Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Maybe Ill teach Dhamma in brief
maybe in detail
maybe both in brief and in detail
But its hard to find anyone who understands
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
Let the Buddha teach Dhamma in brief in detail and both in brief and in detail
There will be those who understand the teaching
So Sāriputta you should train like this
Therell be no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli and well live having achieved the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where ego possessiveness and underlying tendency to conceit are no more
Thats how you should train
When a mendicant has no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and no ego possessiveness or underlying tendency to conceit for all external stimuli and they live having attained the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where ego possessiveness and underlying tendency to conceit are no more
theyre called
a mendicant who has cut off craving untied the fetters and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering
And Sāriputta this is what I was referring to in The Way to the Beyond in The Questions of Udaya when I said
The abandoning of both
sensual perceptions and aversion
the dispelling of dullness
and the cessation of remorse
Pure equanimity and mindfulness
preceded by investigation of principles
this I declare is liberation by enlightenment

Take the case of someone who cultivates precepts and observances a lifestyle and a spiritual path taking this as the essence If unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline thats not fruitful
However if unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow that is fruitful

So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Whatever dangers there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever perils there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever hazards there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Its like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass and burns down even a bungalow plastered inside and out draftfree with latches fastened and windows shuttered
In the same way whatever dangers there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever perils there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever hazards there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
So the fool is dangerous but the astute person is safe
The fool is perilous but the astute person is not
The fool is hazardous but the astute person is not
Theres no danger peril or hazard that comes from the astute
So you should train like this
We will reject the three things by which a fool is known and we will undertake and follow the three things by which an astute person is known

Whats the gratification in the world Whats the drawback Whats the escape
Then it occurred to me
The pleasure and happiness that arise from the world this is its gratification
That the world is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawback
Removing and giving up desire and greed for the world this is its escape
As long as I didnt truly understand the worlds gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are I didnt announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans

What three
You might discuss the past
That is how it was in the past
You might discuss the future
That is how it will be in the future
Or you might discuss the present
This is how it is at present
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion
When a person is asked a question if it needs to be answered definitively and they dont answer it definitively or if it needs analysis and they answer without analyzing it or if it needs a counterquestion and they answer without a counterquestion or if it should be set aside and they dont set it aside then that person is not competent to hold a discussion
When a person is asked a question if it needs to be answered definitively and they answer it definitively or if it needs analysis and they answer after analyzing it or if it needs a counterquestion and they answer with a counterquestion or if it should be set aside and they set it aside then that person is competent to hold a discussion
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion
When a person is asked a question if theyre not consistent about what their position is and what it isnt about what they propose about speaking from what they know and about the appropriate procedure then that person is not competent to hold a discussion
When a person is asked a question if they are consistent about what their position is and what it isnt about what they propose about speaking from what they know and about the appropriate procedure then that person is competent to hold a discussion
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion
When a person is asked a question if they dodge the issue distract the discussion with irrelevant points or display annoyance hate and bitterness then that person is not competent to hold a discussion
When a person is asked a question if they dont dodge the issue distract the discussion with irrelevant points or display annoyance hate and bitterness then that person is competent to hold a discussion
You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion
When a person is asked a question if they intimidate crush mock or seize on trivial mistakes then that person is not competent to hold a discussion
When a person is asked a question if they dont intimidate crush mock or seize on trivial mistakes then that person is competent to hold a discussion
You can know whether or not a person has whats required by seeing how they take part in a discussion
If they lend an ear they have whats required if they dont lend an ear they dont have whats required
Someone who has whats required directly knows one thing completely understands one thing gives up one thing and realizes one thing
and then they experience complete freedom
This is the purpose of discussion
consultation
the requirements
and listening well that is the liberation of the mind by not grasping
Those who converse with hostility
too sure of themselves arrogant
ignoble attacking virtues
they look for flaws in each other
They rejoice together when their opponent
speaks poorly and makes a mistake
becoming confused and defeated
but the noble ones dont discuss like this
If an astute person wants to hold a discussion
connected with the teaching and its meaning
the kind of discussion that noble ones hold
then that wise one should start the discussion
knowing when the time is right
neither hostile nor arrogant
Not overexcited
contemptuous or aggressive
or with a mind full of jealousy
theyd speak from what they rightly know
They agree with what was well spoken
without criticizing what was poorly said
Theyd not persist in finding faults
nor seize on trivial mistakes
neither intimidating nor crushing the other
nor would they speak with sly implications
Good people consult
for the sake of knowledge and clarity
Thats how the noble ones consult
this is a noble consultation
Knowing this an intelligent person
would consult without arrogance

Sabbath
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
Then Visākhā Migāras mother went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to her
So Visākhā where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Today sir Im observing the sabbath
There are Visākhā these three sabbaths
What three
The sabbath of the cowherds the sabbath of the Jains and the sabbath of the noble ones
And what is the sabbath of the cowherds
Its just like a cowherd who in the late afternoon takes the cows back to their owners They reflect
Today the cows grazed in this place and that and they drank in this place and that
Tomorrow the cows will graze in this place and that and drink in this place and that
In the same way someone keeping the sabbath reflects
Today I ate this and that and had a meal of this and that
Tomorrow Ill eat this and that and have a meal of this and that
And so they spend their day with a mind full of covetousness
Thats the sabbath of the cowherds
When the cowherds sabbath is observed like this its not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful
And what is the sabbath of the Jains
Theres a kind of ascetic belonging to a group called the Jains
They encourage their disciples
Please good people dont hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the east
Dont hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the west
Dont hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the north
Dont hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the south
So they encourage kindness and compassion for some creatures and not others
On the sabbath they encourage their disciples
Please good people take off all your clothes and say
I dont belong to anyone anywhere And nothing belongs to me anywhere
But their mother and father still know
This is our child
And they know
This is my mother and father
Partner and child still know
This is our supporter
And they know
This is my partner and child
Bondservants workers and staff still know
This is our master
And they know
These are my bondservants workers and staff
So at a time when they should be encouraged to speak the truth the Jains encourage them to lie
This I say is lying
When the night has passed they use their possessions once more though theyve not been given back to them
This I say is stealing
Thats the sabbath of the Jains
When the Jains sabbath is observed like this its not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful
And what is the sabbath of the noble ones

How much so
Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countriesAṅga Magadha Kāsī Kosala Vajjī Malla Ceti Vaṅga Kuru Pañcāla Maccha Sūrusena Assaka Avanti Gandhāra and Kambojafull of the seven treasures
This wouldnt be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors
Why is that
Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods
Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of the Four Great Kings
Thirty such days make up a month
Twelve such months make up a year
The life span of the gods of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of these divine years
Its possible that a woman or man who has observed the eightfactored sabbath willwhen their body breaks up after deathbe reborn in the company of the gods of the Four Great Kings
This is what I was referring to when I said
Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods

This is what I was referring to when I said

Sixteen hundred years in the human realm is one day and night for the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others
Thirty such days make up a month
Twelve such months make up a year
The life span of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others is sixteen thousand of these divine years
Its possible that a woman or man who has observed the eightfactored sabbath willwhen their body breaks up after deathbe reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others
This is what I was referring to when I said
Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods
You shouldnt kill living creatures or steal
or lie or drink alcohol
Be celibate refraining from sex
and dont eat at night the wrong time
Not wearing garlands or applying fragrance
you should sleep on a low bed or a mat on the ground
This is the eightfactored sabbath they say
explained by the Buddha who has gone to sufferings end
The moon and sun are both fair to see
radiating as far as they revolve
Those shining ones in the sky light up the quarters
dispelling the darkness as they traverse the heavens
All of the wealth thats found in this realm
pearls gems fine beryl too
horngold or mountain gold
or natural gold dug up by marmots
theyre not worth a sixteenth part
of the sabbath with its eight factors
as starlight cannot rival the moon
So an ethical woman or man
who has observed the eightfactored sabbath
having made merit whose outcome is happiness
blameless they go to a heavenly place
Numbered Discourses
The Great Chapter
With Sarabha
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
Now at that time a wanderer called Sarabha had recently left this teaching and training
He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha
I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan
then I left their teaching and training
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Rājagaha for alms
They heard what Sarabha was saying
Then after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
The wanderer called Sarabha has recently left this teaching and training
He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha
I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan
then I left their teaching and training
Sir please go to the wanderers monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to see Sarabha the wanderer out of compassion
The Buddha consented in silence
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderers monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to visit Sarabha the wanderer
He sat on the seat spread out and said to the wanderer Sarabha
Is it really true Sarabha that youve been saying
I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan
then I left their teaching and training
When he said this Sarabha kept silent
For a second time the Buddha said to Sarabha
Tell me Sarabha what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan
If youve not learned it fully Ill fill you in
But if you have learned it fully Ill agree
For a second time Sarabha kept silent
For a third time the Buddha said to Sarabha
Sarabha the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan
If youve not learned it fully Ill fill you in
But if you have learned it fully Ill agree
For a third time Sarabha kept silent
Then those wanderers said to Sarabha
The ascetic Gotama has offered to tell you anything you ask for
Speak reverend Sarabha what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan
If youve not learned it fully hell fill you in
But if you have learned it fully hell agree
When this was said Sarabha sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say
Knowing this the Buddha said to the wanderers
Wanderers someone might say to me
You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha but regarding these things youre not fully awakened Then Id carefully pursue press and grill them on that point
When grilled by me they would without a doubt fall into one of these three categories Theyd dodge the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points Theyd display annoyance hate and bitterness Or theyd sit silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say like Sarabha
Wanderers someone might say to me
You claim to have ended all defilements but you still have these defilements Then Id carefully pursue press and grill them on that point
When grilled by me they would without a doubt fall into one of these three categories Theyd dodge the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points Theyd display annoyance hate and bitterness Or theyd sit silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say like Sarabha
Wanderers someone might say to me
Your teaching does not lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering Then Id carefully pursue press and grill them on that point
When grilled by me they would without a doubt fall into one of these three categories Theyd dodge the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points Theyd display annoyance hate and bitterness Or theyd sit silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say like Sarabha
Then the Buddha having roared his lions roar three times in the wanderers monastery on the bank of the Sappinī river rose into the sky and flew away
Soon after the Buddha left those wanderers gave Sarabha a comprehensive tonguelashing
Reverend Sarabha youre just like an old jackal in the formidable wilderness who thinks Ill roar a lions roar but they still only manage to squeal and yelp like a jackal
In the same way when the ascetic Gotama wasnt here you said Ill roar a lions roar but you only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal
Youre just like a golden oriole who thinks Ill cry like a cuckoo but they still only manage to cry like a golden oriole
In the same way when the ascetic Gotama wasnt here you said Ill cry like a cuckoo but you still only managed to cry like a golden oriole
Youre just like a bull that thinks to bellow only when the cowstall is empty
In the same way you only thought to bellow when the ascetic Gotama wasnt here
Thats how those wanderers gave Sarabha a comprehensive tonguelashing

Bharaṇḍu Kālāma
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans when he arrived at Kapilavatthu
Mahānāma the Sakyan heard that he had arrived
He went up to the Buddha bowed and stood to one side
The Buddha said to him
Go into Kapilavatthu Mahānāma and check if theres a suitable guest house where I can spend the night
Yes sir replied Mahānāma He returned to Kapilavatthu and searched all over the city but he couldnt see a suitable guest house for the Buddha to spend the night
Then Mahānāma went up to the Buddha and said to him
Sir theres no suitable guest house in Kapilavatthu for you to spend the night
But there is this Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma who used to be the Buddhas spiritual companion
Why dont you spend the night at his hermitage
Go Mahānāma and set out a mat
Yes sir replied Mahānāma He went to Bharaṇḍus hermitage where he set out a mat and got footwashing water ready Then he went back to the Buddha and said to him
The mat and footwashing water are set out
Please sir go at your convenience
Then the Buddha went to Bharaṇḍus hermitage sat down on the seat spread out
and washed his feet
Then it occurred to Mahānāma
Its too late to pay homage to the Buddha today
Hes tired
Tomorrow Ill pay homage to the Buddha He bowed to the Buddha and respectfully circled him keeping him on his right then he left
Then when the night had passed Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Mahānāma there are these three teachers found in the world
What three
One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures
but not of sights or feelings
One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures and sights
but not of feelings
One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures sights and feelings
These are the three teachers found in the world
Do these three teachers have the same goal or different goals
When he said this Bharaṇḍu said to Mahānāma
Say theyre the same Mahānāma
The Buddha said
Say theyre different Mahānāma
For a second time Bharaṇḍu said
Say theyre the same Mahānāma
The Buddha said
Say theyre different Mahānāma
For a third time Bharaṇḍu said
Say theyre the same Mahānāma
The Buddha said
Say theyre different Mahānāma
Then it occurred to Bharaṇḍu
The Buddha has rebuked me three times in front of this illustrious Mahānāma
Why dont I leave Kapilavatthu
Then Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma left Kapilavatthu
never to return

Guaranteed
Mendicants when a mendicant has three things their practice is guaranteed and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements
What three
Its when a mendicant guards the sense doors eats in moderation and is dedicated to wakefulness
And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
Thats how a mendicant guards the sense doors
And how does a mendicant eat in moderation
Its when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat
Not for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice In this way I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and I will live blamelessly and at ease
Thats how a mendicant eats in moderation
And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness
Its when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day purifying their mind from obstacles In the evening they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation In the middle of the night they lie down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up In the last part of the night they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation purifying their mind from obstacles
This is how a mendicant is dedicated to wakefulness
When a mendicant has these three things their practice is guaranteed and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements

Suppose mendicants a donkey followed behind a herd of cattle thinking
I can moo too I can moo too
But it doesnt look like a cow or sound like a cow or leave a footprint like a cow
Still it follows behind a herd of cattle thinking
I can moo too I can moo too
In the same way some mendicant follows behind the mendicant Saṅgha thinking
Im a monk too Im a monk too
But they dont have the same enthusiasm for undertaking the training in the higher ethics the higher mind and the higher wisdom as the other mendicants
Still they follow behind the mendicant Saṇgha thinking
Im a monk too Im a monk too
So you should train like this
We will have keen enthusiasm for undertaking the training in the higher ethics the higher mind and the higher wisdom

Seclusion
Mendicants wanderers who follow other paths advocate three kinds of seclusion
What three
Seclusion in robes almsfood and lodgings
Wanderers who follow other paths advocate this kind of seclusion in robes They wear robes of sunn hemp mixed hemp corpsewrapping cloth rags lodh tree bark antelope hide whole or in strips kusa grass bark woodchips human hair horsetail hair or owls wings
This is what wanderers who follow other paths advocate for seclusion in robes
Wanderers who follow other paths advocate this kind of seclusion in almsfood
They eat herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survive on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruit
This is what the wanderers who follow other paths advocate for seclusion in almsfood
Wanderers who follow other paths advocate this kind of seclusion in lodgings They stay in a wilderness at the root of a tree in a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw or a threshinghut
This is what wanderers who follow other paths advocate for seclusion in lodgings
These are the three kinds of seclusion that wanderers who follow other paths advocate
In this teaching and training there are three kinds of seclusion for a mendicant
What three
Firstly a mendicant is ethical giving up unethical conduct being secluded from it
They have right view giving up wrong view being secluded from it
Theyve ended defilements giving up defilements being secluded from them
When a mendicant has these three kinds of seclusion
theyre called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith being pure and grounded in the essential
When a farmers rice field is ripe
theyd have the rice cut swiftly
gathered swiftly
transported swiftly
made into heaps swiftly
threshed swiftly
the straw and chaff removed swiftly
winnowed swiftly
brought over swiftly
pounded swiftly
and have the husks removed swiftly
In this way that farmers crop would reach the peak and the pith being pure and consisting only of what is essential
In the same way when a mendicant is ethical giving up unethical conduct being secluded from it
when they have right view giving up wrong view being secluded from it
when theyve ended defilements giving up defilements being secluded from them
theyre called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith being pure and grounded in the essential

This person is very helpful to another
These are the three people who are very helpful to another person
And I say that there is noone more helpful to another than these three people
And I also say that its not easy to repay these three people by bowing down to them rising up for them greeting them with joined palms and observing proper etiquette for them or by providing them with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick

Gold has coarse corruptions sand soil and gravel
A panner or their apprentice pours it into a pan where they wash rinse and clean it
When thats been eliminated there are medium corruptions in the gold fine grit and coarse sand
The panner washes it again
When thats been eliminated there are fine corruptions in the gold fine sand and black grime
The panner washes it again
When thats been eliminated only gold dust is left
A goldsmith or their apprentice places the gold in a crucible where they blow melt and smelt it
Still the gold is not settled and the dross is not totally gone Its not pliable workable or radiant but is brittle and not completely ready for working
But the goldsmith keeps on blowing melting and smelting it
The gold becomes pliable workable and radiant not brittle and ready to be worked
Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament they want whether a bracelet earrings a necklace or a golden garland
In the same way a mendicant who is committed to the higher mind has coarse corruptions bad bodily verbal and mental conduct A sincere capable mendicant gives these up gets rid of eliminates and obliterates them

The Great Chapter
At Venāgapura
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Venāgapura
The brahmins and householders of Venāgapura heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Venāgapura
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then the brahmins and householders of Venāgapura went up to the Buddha
Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent Then the brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura said to the Buddha
Its incredible Master Gotama its amazing
how your faculties are so very clear and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright
Its like a golden brown jujube in the autumn
or a palm fruit freshly plucked from the stalk
or a pendant of river gold fashioned by a deft smith well wrought in the forge and placed on a cream rug where it shines and glows and radiates
In the same way your faculties are so very clear and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright
Surely Master Gotama gets when he wants without trouble or difficulty various kinds of high and luxurious bedding such as
sofas couches woolen coversshagpiled colorful white embroidered with flowers quilted embroidered with animals doubleor singlefringedand silk covers studded with gems as well as silken sheets woven carpets rugs for elephants horses or chariots antelope hide rugs and spreads of fine deer hide with a canopy above and red cushions at both ends

Brahmin when I am living supported by a village or town I robe up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe enter the town or village for alms
After the meal on my return from almsround I enter a wood
I gather up some grass or leaves into a pile and sit down crosslegged with my body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled I enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture I enter and remain in the third absorption where I meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
With the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
When Im practicing like this if I walk at that time I walk like the gods

At one time Venerable nanda was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Then the Licchavis Abhaya and Paṇḍitakumāra went up to Venerable nanda bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir the Jain leader Nāṭaputta claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thus
Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and waking
He advocates the elimination of past karma by mortification and breaking the bridge by not making new karma
So with the ending of karma suffering ends with the ending of suffering feeling ends and with the ending of feeling all suffering will have been worn away
This is how to go beyond suffering by means of this purification by wearing away in this very life
What sir does the Buddha say about this
Abhaya these three kinds of purification by wearing away have been rightly explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
What three
Its when Abhaya a mendicant is ethical restrained in the code of conduct with good behavior and supporters Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken
They dont perform any new deeds and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little
This wearing away is visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
Then a mendicant accomplished in ethics quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption  second absorption  third absorption  fourth absorption
They dont perform any new deeds and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little
This wearing away is visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
Then a mendicant accomplished in immersion realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
They dont perform any new deeds and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little
This wearing away is visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
These are the three kinds of purification by wearing away that have been rightly explained by the Buddha  in order to realize extinguishment
When he said this Paṇḍitakumāra said to Abhaya
Dear Abhaya is there anything in what nanda has said so well that you would disagree with
How could I not agree with what was said so well by nanda
If anyone didnt agree with him their head would explode

First Training
Mendicants each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules come up for recitation in which gentlemen who love themselves train
These are all included in the three trainings
What three
The training in the higher ethics the higher mind and the higher wisdom
These are the three trainings that include them all
Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics but has limited immersion and wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual path They keep the rules theyve undertaken
With the ending of three fetters theyre a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics but has limited immersion and wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual path They keep the rules theyve undertaken
With the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion theyre a oncereturner They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics and immersion but has limited wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual path They keep the rules theyve undertaken
With the ending of the five lower fetters theyre reborn spontaneously They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that world
Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics immersion and wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual path They keep the rules theyve undertaken
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
So mendicants if you practice partially you succeed partially If you practice fully you succeed fully
These training rules are not a waste I say

Then a welltodo Brahmin went up to the Buddha and seated to one side he said to him

In the old days this world was as crowded as hell just full of people The villages towns and capital cities were no more than a chickens flight apart
What is the cause sir what is the reason why these days human numbers have dwindled a decline in population is evident and whole villages towns cities and countries have disappeared
These days brahmin humans just love illicit desire Theyre overcome by immoral greed and mired in wrong thoughts
Taking up sharp knives they murder each other And so many people perish
This is the cause this is the reason why these days human numbers have dwindled
Furthermore because these days humans just love illicit desire 
the heavens dont provide enough rain
so theres famine a bad harvest with blighted crops that turn to straw
And so many people perish
This is the cause this is the reason why these days human numbers have dwindled
Furthermore because these days humans just love illicit desire 
native spirits let vicious monsters loose And so many people perish
This is the cause this is the reason why these days human numbers have dwindled

Second The Four Great Kings
Once upon a time mendicants Sakka lord of gods guiding the gods of the ThirtyThree recited this verse
Whoever wants to be like me
would observe the sabbath
complete in all eight factors
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days
and the eighth day of the fortnight
as well as on the fortnightly special displays
But that verse was poorly sung by Sakka lord of gods not well sung poorly spoken not well spoken
Why is that
Because Sakka lord of gods is not exempt from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress He is not exempt from suffering I say
But for a mendicant who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentit is appropriate to say

He went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said
Sir I trust the Buddha slept well
Yes prince I slept well
I am one of those who sleep at ease in the world
The winter nights are cold sir and its the week of midwinter when the snow falls Rough is the ground trampled under the cows hooves and thin is the mat of leaves The leaves are sparse on the trees the ocher robes are cold and cold blows the north wind
And yet the Buddha says
Yes prince I slept well
I am one of those who sleep at ease in the world
Well then prince Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like

while his four wives attend to him in all manner of agreeable ways
What do you think prince would he sleep at ease or not
Or how do you see this

Of those who sleep at ease in the world he would be one
What do you think prince
Is it not possible that a fever born of greedphysical or mentalmight arise in that householder or householders son burning him so he sleeps badly

The greed that burns that householder or householders son making them sleep badly has been cut off at the root by the Realized One made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future

The Realm of the Gods
Mendicants if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you
Reverend do you lead the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama so that you can be reborn in the realm of the gods
Being questioned like this wouldnt you be horrified repelled and disgusted
Yes sir
So it seems that you are horrified repelled and disgusted by divine lifespan beauty happiness fame and sovereignty
How much more then should you be horrified embarrassed and disgusted by bad conduct by way of body speech and mind

About Pacetana
At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Once upon a time there was a king named Pacetana
Then King Pacetana addressed his chariotmaker
In six months time my good chariotmaker there will be a battle
Are you able to make me a new pair of wheels
I can Your Majesty replied the chariotmaker
Then when it was six days less than six months later the chariotmaker had finished one wheel
Then King Pacetana addressed his chariotmaker
In six days time there will be a battle Is my new pair of wheels finished
Now that it is six days less than six months Your Majesty I have finished one wheel
Are you able to finish the second wheel in these six days
Saying I can Your Majesty the chariotmaker finished the second wheel in six days Taking the pair of wheels he went up to King Pacetana and said this to the king
Your Majesty these are your two new wheels finished
But my good chariotmaker what is the difference between the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months and the wheel finished in just six days
Because I cant see any difference between them
But Your Majesty there is a difference
See now what it is
Then the chariotmaker rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days
It rolled as far as the original impetus took it then wobbled and fell down
Then he rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days less than six months
It rolled as far as the original impetus took it then stood still as if fixed to an axle
But what is the cause my good chariotmaker what is the reason why the wheel that was finished in six days wobbled and fell
while the one that was finished in six days less than six months stood still as if fixed to an axle
The wheel that was finished in six days Your Majesty is crooked flawed and defective in rim spoke and hub
Thats why it wobbled and fell
The wheel that was finished in six days less than six months Your Majesty is not crooked flawed and defective in rim spoke and hub
Thats why it stood still as if fixed to an axle
Now mendicants you might think
Surely that chariotmaker must have been someone else at that time
But you should not see it like that
I myself was the chariotmaker at that time
Then I was skilled in the crooks flaws and defects of wood
Now that I am a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha I am skilled in the crooks flaws and defects of actions by body speech and mind
Whatever monk or nun has not given up the crooks flaws and defects of body speech and mind has fallen from the teaching and training just like the wheel that was finished in six days
Whatever monk or nun has given up the crooks flaws and defects of body speech and mind is established in the teaching and training just like the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months
So you should train like this
We will give up the crooks flaws and defects of body speech and mind
Thats how you should train

Imperturbable
Mendicants these three people are found in the world
What three
First a person going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying If theyre set on that committed to it and meditate on it often without losing it when they die theyre reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of infinite space
The lifespan of the gods of infinite space is twenty thousand eons
An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm
But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then theyre extinguished in that very life
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person as regards their place of rebirth
Furthermore a person going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying If theyre set on that committed to it and meditate on it often without losing it when they die theyre reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of infinite consciousness
The lifespan of the gods of infinite consciousness is forty thousand eons
An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm
But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then theyre extinguished in that very life
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person as regards their place of rebirth
Furthermore a person going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying If theyre set on that committed to it and meditate on it often without losing it when they die theyre reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of nothingness
The lifespan of the gods of nothingness is sixty thousand eons
An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm
But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then theyre extinguished in that very life
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person as regards their place of rebirth

These are the three fine thoroughbred horses
And what are the three fine thoroughbred people
One fine thoroughbred person

And how is a fine thoroughbred person 
fast beautiful and well proportioned
Its when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
This is how theyre fast I say
When asked a question about the teaching or training they answer without faltering
This is how theyre beautiful I say
They receive robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
This is how theyre well proportioned I say
This is how a fine thoroughbred person is fast beautiful and well proportioned

Third Training
Mendicants each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules come up for recitation in which gentlemen who love themselves train
These are all included in the three trainings
What three
The training in the higher ethics the higher mind and the higher wisdom
These are the three trainings that include them all
Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics immersion and wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual path They keep the rules theyve undertaken
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished between one life and the next
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished upon landing
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished without extra effort
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished with extra effort
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream going to the Akaniṭṭha realm
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion theyre a oncereturner They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of three fetters theyre a oneseeder They will be reborn just one time in a human existence then make an end of suffering
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of three fetters they go from family to family They will transmigrate between two or three families and then make an end of suffering
If they dont penetrate so far with the ending of three fetters they have at most seven rebirths They will transmigrate at most seven times among gods and humans and then make an end of suffering
So mendicants if you practice fully you succeed fully If you practice partially you succeed partially
These training rules are not a waste I say

Second With Anuruddha
Then Venerable Anuruddha went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to him
Heres the thing Reverend Sāriputta With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human I survey the entire galaxy
My energy is roused up and unflagging my mindfulness is established and lucid my body is tranquil and undisturbed and my mind is immersed in samādhi
But my mind is not freed from the defilements by not grasping
Well Reverend Anuruddha when you say
With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human I survey the entire galaxy thats your conceit
And when you say
My energy is roused up and unflagging my mindfulness is established and lucid my body is tranquil and undisturbed and my mind is immersed in samādhi thats your restlessness
And when you say
But my mind is not freed from the defilements by not grasping thats your remorse
It would be good to give up these three things Instead of focusing on them apply your mind to the deathless
After some time Anuruddha gave up these three things Instead of focusing on them he applied his mind to the deathless
Then Anuruddha living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

Makkhali that silly man has this doctrine and view
There is no power in deeds action or energy
Now all the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past taught the efficacy of deeds action and energy
But Makkhali opposes them by saying
There is no power in deeds action or energy
All the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will teach the efficacy of deeds action and energy
But Makkhali opposes them by saying
There is no power in deeds action or energy
I too the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha in the present teach the efficacy of deeds action and energy

With Tikaṇṇa
Then Tikaṇṇa the brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
Seated to one side in front of the Buddha Tikaṇṇa praised the brahmins who were proficient in the three Vedas
Such are the brahmins masters of the three Vedic knowledges Thus are the brahmins masters of the three Vedic knowledges
But brahmin how do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges
Master Gotama its when a brahmin is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation He recites and remembers the hymns and has mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knows philology and grammar and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
Thats how the brahmins describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges
Brahmin a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
But Master Gotama how is one a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
Master Gotama please teach me this
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Tikaṇṇa replied
The Buddha said this
Brahmin its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
With the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives That is
one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding
They remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food
This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
This is the first knowledge that they attain
Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they acted out of that wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they acted out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This is the second knowledge that they attain
Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This is the third knowledge that they attain
Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
For someone whose ethical conduct doesnt waver
who is alert practicing absorption
whose mind is mastered
unified serene
That wise one dispels the darkness
master of the three knowledges destroyer of death
For the welfare of gods and humans
he has given up everything they say
Accomplished in the three knowledges
living without confusion
bearing the final body
they revere the awakened Gotama
Who knows their past lives
and sees heaven and places of loss
and has attained the ending of rebirth
that sage has perfect insight
Its because of these three knowledges
that a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges
Thats who I call a threeknowledge master
and not some mere reciter
This brahmin is a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
Master Gotama a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
And Master Gotama a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One

Mendicants even a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king does not wield power without having their own king
When he said this one of the mendicants asked the Buddha
But who is the king of the wheelturning monarch the just and principled king
It is principle monk said the Buddha
Monk a wheelturning monarch provides just protection and security for his court relying only on principlehonoring respecting and venerating principle having principle as his flag banner and authority
He provides just protection and security for his aristocrats vassals troops brahmins and householders people of town and country ascetics and brahmins beasts and birds
When he has done this he wields power only in a principled manner
And this power cannot be undermined by any human enemy
In the same way monk a Realized One a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha a just and principled king provides just protection and security regarding bodily actions relying only on principlehonoring respecting and venerating principle having principle as his flag banner and authority
This kind of bodily action should be cultivated This kind of bodily action should not be cultivated
Furthermore a Realized One  provides just protection and security regarding verbal actions saying
This kind of verbal action should be cultivated This kind of verbal action should not be cultivated  And regarding mental actions
This kind of mental action should be cultivated This kind of mental action should not be cultivated

There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village
A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next days meal
The mendicant accepts if they want
When the night has passed they robe up in the morning take their bowl and robe and approach that householders home where they sit on the seat spread out
The householder or their child serves and satisfies them with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods
The mendicant thinks
Its so good that this householder serves me with a variety of delicious foods
Then they think
I really hope this householder serves me with a variety of delicious foods in the future too
They eat that food tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escape
They think about it with sensual malicious or cruel thoughts
A gift to such a mendicant is not very fruitful I say
Why is that
Because that mendicant is negligent
Take another case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village
A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next days meal
The mendicant accepts if they want
When the night has passed they robe up in the morning take their bowl and robe and approach that householders home where they sit on the seat spread out
The householder or their child serves and satisfies them with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods
It never occurs to them
Its so good that the householder or their child serves and satisfies me with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods
They dont think
I really hope this householder serves me with a variety of delicious foods in the future too
They eat that almsfood untied uninfatuated unattached seeing the drawback and understanding the escape
They think about it with thoughts of renunciation good will or harmlessness
A gift to such a mendicant is very fruitful I say
Why is that
Because that mendicant is diligent

Sir I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha

I wonder how far a Blessed One a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha can make their voice heard
He was a disciple nanda Realized Ones are immeasurable
For a second time 
For a third time nanda said to the Buddha
 I wonder how far a Blessed One a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha can make their voice heard
nanda have you heard of a thousandfold lesser world system a galaxy
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
Let the Buddha speak
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then nanda listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir nanda replied
The Buddha said this
nanda a galaxy extends a thousand times as far as the moon and sun revolve and the shining ones light up the quarters
In that galaxy there are a thousand moons a thousand suns a thousand Sinerus king of mountains a thousand Indias a thousand Western Continents a thousand Northern Continents a thousand Eastern Continents four thousand oceans four thousand Great Kings a thousand realms of the Gods of the Four Great Kings a thousand realms of the Gods of the ThirtyThree of the Gods of Yama of the Joyful Gods of the Gods who Love to Create of the Gods who Control the Creations of Others and a thousand Brahmā realms
This is called a thousandfold lesser world system a galaxy
A world system that extends for a thousand galaxies
is called a millionfold middling world system a galactic cluster
A world system that extends for a thousand galactic clusters
is called a billionfold great world system a galactic supercluster
If he wished nanda a Realized One could make his voice heard throughout a galactic supercluster or as far as he wants
But how would the Buddha make his voice heard so far
First nanda a Realized One would fill the galactic supercluster with light
When sentient beings saw the light the Realized One would project his call so that theyd hear the sound
Thats how a Realized One could make his voice heard throughout a galactic supercluster or as far as he wants
When he said this Venerable nanda said to Venerable Udāyī
Im so fortunate so very fortunate
to have a teacher with such power and might
When he said this Venerable Udāyī said to Venerable nanda
What is it to you Reverend nanda if your teacher has such power and might
When he said this the Buddha said to Venerable Udāyī
Not so Udāyī not so
If nanda were to die while still not free of greed he would rule as king of the gods for seven lifetimes and as king of all India for seven lifetimes because of the confidence of his heart

I still rehearse now the teachings that I rehearsed as a human being
And I also rehearse teachings that I didnt rehearse as a human being
Just as the Buddha these days lives crowded by monks nuns laymen and laywomen by rulers and their ministers and teachers of other paths and their disciples

At Paṅkadhā
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants He arrived at a town of the Kosalans named Paṅkadhā
and stayed there
Now at that time a monk called Kassapagotta was resident at Paṅkadhā
There the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training rules
Kassapagotta became quite impatient and bitter thinking
This ascetic is much too strict
When the Buddha had stayed in Paṅkadhā as long as he wished he set out for Rājagaha
Traveling stage by stage he arrived at Rājagaha
and stayed there
Soon after the Buddha left Kassapagotta became quite remorseful and regretful thinking
Its my loss my misfortune
that when the Buddha was talking about the training rules I became quite impatient and bitter thinking
he was much too strict
Why dont I go to the Buddha and confess my mistake to him
Then Kassapagotta set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for Rājagaha
Eventually he came to Rājagaha and the Vultures Peak
He went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened saying
I have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of me to become impatient and bitter when the Buddha was educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training rules and to think
This ascetic is much too strict
Please sir accept my mistake for what it is so I will restrain myself in future
Indeed Kassapa you made a mistake
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly I accept it
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is deal with it properly and commit to restraint in the future
Kassapa take the case of a senior mendicant who doesnt want to train and doesnt praise taking up the training They dont encourage other mendicants who dont want to train to take up the training And they dont truthfully and substantively praise at the right time those mendicants who do want to train I dont praise that kind of senior mendicant
Why is that
Because hearing that I praised that mendicant other mendicants might want to keep company with them Then they might follow their example which would be for their lasting harm and suffering
Thats why I dont praise that kind of senior mendicant
Take the case of a middle mendicant who doesnt want to train 
Take the case of a junior mendicant who doesnt want to train 
Thats why I dont praise that kind of junior mendicant

A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the first teachers

Brahmā is a term for your parents
First teachers is a term for your parents
Worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods is a term for your parents
Why is that
Parents are very helpful to their children they raise them nurture them and show them the world
Parents are said to be Brahmā
and first teachers its said
Theyre worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods from their children
for they love their offspring
Therefore an astute person
would revere them and honor them
with food and drink

and by washing their feet
Because they look after

And who is the person with upsidedown wisdom
Its someone who often goes to the monastery to hear the teaching in the presence of the mendicants
The mendicants teach them Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And they reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
But even while sitting there that person doesnt pay attention to the beginning middle or end of the discussion
And when they get up from their seat they dont pay attention to the beginning middle or end of the discussion
Its like when a pot full of water is tipped over so the water drains out and doesnt stay

These are the three kinds of people found in the world
A person with upsidedown wisdom
is stupid and cannot see
and even if they frequently
go into the mendicants presence
such a person cant learn
the beginning middle or end
of the discussion
for their wisdom is lacking
The person with wisdom on their lap
is better than that its said
but even if they frequently
go into the mendicants presence
such a person can only learn
the beginning middle and end
while sitting in that seat
but theyve only grasped the phrasing
for when they get up their understanding fails
and what theyve learned is lost
The person with wide wisdom
is better than that its said
and if they too frequently
go into the mendicants presence
such a person can learn
the beginning middle and end
while sitting in that seat
and when theyve grasped the phrasing
they remember it with the best of intentions
That peacefulhearted person
practicing in line with the teaching

Messengers of the Gods
Messengers of the Gods
There are mendicants these three messengers of the gods
What three
Firstly someone does bad things by way of body speech and mind
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Then the wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama saying
Your Majesty this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father ascetics and brahmins or honor the elders in the family
May Your Majesty punish them
Then King Yama pursues presses and grills them about the first messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a maneighty ninety or a hundred years oldbent double crooked leaning on a staff trembling as they walk ailing past their prime with teeth broken hair grey and scanty or bald skin wrinkled and limbs blotchy
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
I too am liable to grow old Im not exempt from old age Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir
I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Indeed theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by the deities or by ascetics and brahmins
That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings a woman or a man sick suffering gravely ill collapsed in their own urine and feces being picked up by some and put down by others
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
I too am liable to become sick Im not exempt from sickness Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir
I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Well theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by the deities or by ascetics and brahmins
That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the third messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings a woman or a man dead for one two or three days bloated livid and festering
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
I too am liable to die Im not exempt from death Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir
I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Well theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by the deities or by ascetics and brahmins
That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then after grilling them about the third messenger of the gods King Yama falls silent
Then the wardens of hell punish them with the fivefold crucifixion
They drive redhot stakes through the hands and feet and another in the middle of the chest
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Then the wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes 
They hang them upsidedown and hack them with hatchets 
They harness them to a chariot and drive them back and forth across burning ground blazing and glowing 
They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals blazing and glowing 
Then the wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a redhot copper pot burning blazing and glowing
There theyre seared in boiling scum and theyre swept up and down and round and round
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Then the wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell
Now about that Great Hell
Four are its corners four its doors
neatly divided in equal parts
Surrounded by an iron wall
of iron is its roof
The ground is even made of iron
it burns with fierce fire
The heat forever radiates
a hundred leagues around
Once upon a time King Yama thought
Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments
Oh I hope I may be reborn as a human being And that a Realized Onea perfected one a fully awakened Buddhaarises in the world And that I may pay homage to the Buddha
Then the Buddha can teach me Dhamma so that I may understand his teaching
Now I dont say this because Ive heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin I only say it because Ive known seen and realized it for myself
Those people who are negligent
when warned by the gods messengers
a long time they sorrow
when they go to that wretched place
But those good and peaceful people
when warned by the gods messengers
never neglect
the teaching of the noble ones
Seeing the peril in grasping
the origin of birth and death
theyre freed by not grasping
with the ending of birth and death
Happy theyve come to a safe place
extinguished in this very life
Theyve gone beyond all threats and perils
and risen above all suffering

With Saṅgārava
Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama we who are called brahmins
make sacrifices and encourage others to make sacrifices
Now Master Gotama both of these peoplethe one who sacrifices and the one who encourages others to sacrificeare doing good for many people on account of that sacrifice
But Master Gotama when someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness they tame calm and extinguish themselves alone That being so they are doing good for just one person on account of that going forth
Well then brahmin Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think brahmin
A Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
Come this is the path this is the practice Practicing like this I realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual life with my own insight and I make it known
Please all of you practice like this and you too will realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual life and will live having realized it with your own insight
So the teacher teaches Dhamma and others practice accordingly in their hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands
What do you think brahmin
This being so are they doing good for just one person or for many people on account of going forth
This being so Master Gotama they are doing good for many people on account of going forth
When he said this Venerable nanda said to Saṅgārava
Brahmin which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
Saṅgārava said to nanda
Those such as the masters Gotama and nanda
are honored and praised by me
For a second time nanda said to Saṅgārava
Brahmin I didnt ask you
who you honor and praise
I asked you
which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
For a second time Saṅgārava said to nanda
Those such as the masters Gotama and nanda
are honored and praised by me
For a third time nanda said to Saṅgārava
Brahmin I didnt ask you
who you honor and praise
I asked you
which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings yet is more fruitful and beneficial
For a third time Saṅgārava said to nanda
Those such as the masters Gotama and nanda
are honored and praised by me
Then it occurred to the Buddha
Though nanda asked him a sensible question three times Saṅgārava falters without answering
Why dont I give him a way out
So the Buddha said to Saṅgārava
Brahmin what came up in the conversation among the kings retinue today sitting together in the royal compound
Master Gotama this came up
Formerly it seems there were fewer mendicants but more of them displayed superhuman demonstrations of psychic power
while these days there are more mendicants but fewer display superhuman demonstrations of psychic power
This is what came up in the conversation among the kings retinue today while sitting together in the royal compound
Brahmin there are three kinds of demonstration
What three
A demonstration of psychic power a demonstration of revealing and a demonstration of instruction
And what is the demonstration of psychic power
Its when someone wields the many kinds of psychic power
multiplying themselves and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm
This is called the demonstration of psychic power
And what is the demonstration of revealing
In one case someone reveals by means of a sign
This is what youre thinking such is your thought and thus is your state of mind
And even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwise
In another case someone reveals after hearing it from humans or nonhumans or deities
This is what youre thinking such is your thought and thus is your state of mind
And even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwise
In another case someone reveals by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers
This is what youre thinking such is your thought and thus is your state of mind
And even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwise
In another case someone comprehends the mind of a person who has attained the immersion thats free of placing the mind and keeping it connected They understand
Judging by the way this persons intentions are directed immediately after this mind state theyll think this thought
And even if they reveal this many times it turns out exactly so not otherwise
This is called the demonstration of revealing
And what is a demonstration of instruction
Its when someone instructs others like this
Think like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved that
This is called a demonstration of instruction
These are the three kinds of demonstration
Of these three kinds of demonstration which do you consider to be the finest
Regarding this Master Gotama a demonstration of psychic power
is experienced only by the one who performs it occurring only to them
This seems to me like a magic trick
And the demonstration where someone reveals something by means of a sign
or after hearing it from humans nonhumans or deities
or by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers
or by comprehending the mind of another person
is also experienced only by the one who performs it occurring only to them
This also seems to me like a magic trick
But as to the demonstration where someone instructs others
Think like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved that
I prefer this demonstration Master Gotama Its the finest of the three kinds of demonstration
Its incredible Master Gotama its amazing
how well this was said by Master Gotama We regard Master Gotama as someone who possesses these three kinds of demonstration
For Master Gotama wields the many kinds of psychic power  controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm
And Master Gotama comprehends the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected He understands
Judging by the way this persons intentions are directed immediately after this mind state theyll think this thought
And Master Gotama instructs others like this
Think like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved that
Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive brahmin
Nevertheless I will answer you
For I do wield the many kinds of psychic power  controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm
And I do comprehend the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected I understand
Judging by the way this persons intentions are directed immediately after this mind state theyll think this thought
And I do instruct others like this
Think like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved that
But Master Gotama is there even one other mendicant who possesses these three kinds of demonstration apart from Master Gotama
Theres not just one hundred mendicants brahmin who possess these three kinds of demonstration nor two three four or five hundred but many more than that
But where are these mendicants now staying
Right here brahmin in this Saṅgha of mendicants
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

Brahmins
With Jāṇussoṇi
Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him Seated to one side he said to the Buddha
Master Gotama whoever has a sacrifice an offering of food for ancestors a dish of milkrice prepared for an auspicious ceremony or a gift to give should give it to the brahmins who have mastered the three Vedic knowledges
But brahmin how do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is proficient in the three Vedic knowledges
Master Gotama its when a brahmin is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation He recites and remembers the hymns and has mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knows philology and grammar and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
Thats how the brahmins describe a brahmin who is proficient in the three Vedic knowledges
Brahmin a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
But Master Gotama how is one a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
Master Gotama please teach me this
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Jāṇussoṇi replied
The Buddha said this
Brahmin its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures 
enters and remains in the fourth absorption
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives with features and details
This is the first knowledge that they attain
Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This is the second knowledge that they attain
Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This is the third knowledge that they attain
Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen darkness is destroyed and light has arisen as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
One who is perfect in precepts and observances
resolute and serene
whose mind is mastered
unified serene
who knows their past lives
and sees heaven and places of loss
and has attained the end of rebirth
that sage has perfect insight
Because of these three knowledges
a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges
Thats who I call a threeknowledge master
and not some mere reciter
This brahmin is a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
Master Gotama the master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is quite different from a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
And Master Gotama a master of three knowledges according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the three knowledges in the training of the Noble One
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

The Great Chapter
With the Kālāmas of Kesamutta
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kālāmas named Kesamutta
The Kālāmas of Kesamutta heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Kesamutta
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha 
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then the Kālāmas went up to the Buddha
Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent Seated to one side the Kālāmas said to the Buddha
There are sir some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta
They explain and promote only their own doctrine while they attack badmouth disparage and smear the doctrines of others
Then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesamutta
They too explain and promote only their own doctrine while they attack badmouth disparage and smear the doctrines of others
So sir were doubting and uncertain
I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth and who speaks falsehood
It is enough Kālāmas for you to be doubting and uncertain
Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter
Please Kālāmas dont go by oral transmission dont go by lineage dont go by testament dont go by canonical authority dont rely on logic dont rely on inference dont go by reasoned contemplation dont go by the acceptance of a view after consideration dont go by the appearance of competence and dont think The ascetic is our respected teacher
But when you know for yourselves
These things are unskillful blameworthy criticized by sensible people and when you undertake them they lead to harm and suffering then you should give them up
What do you think Kālāmas
Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm
Harm sir
A greedy individual overcome by greed kills living creatures steals commits adultery lies and encourages others to do the same Is that for their lasting harm and suffering
Yes sir
What do you think Kālāmas
Does hate come up in a person for their welfare or harm
Harm sir
A hateful individual overcome by hate kills living creatures steals commits adultery lies and encourages others to do the same Is that for their lasting harm and suffering
Yes sir
What do you think Kālāmas
Does delusion come up in a person for their welfare or harm
Harm sir

Indeed brahmins youre old elderly and senior
And you havent done what is good and skillful nor have you made a shelter from fear
This world is led on by old age sickness and death
But restraint here by way of body speech and mind is the shelter protection island refuge and haven for the departed
This life so very short is led onward
Theres no shelter for someone whos been led on by old age

Messengers of the Gods
First The Four Great Kings
On the eighth day of the fortnight mendicants the ministers and counselors of the Four Great Kings wander about the world thinking
Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents ascetics and brahmins honoring the elders in their families observing the sabbath staying awake and making merit
And on the fourteenth day of the fortnight the sons of the Four Great Kings wander about the world thinking
Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents  and making merit
And on the fifteenth day sabbath the Four Great Kings themselves wander about the world thinking
Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents  and making merit
If only a few humans are paying due respect to their parents  and making merit
then the Four Great Kings address the gods of the ThirtyThree seated together in the Hall of Justice
Only a few humans are paying due respect to their parents  and making merit
Then the gods of the ThirtyThree are disappointed thinking
The heavenly hosts will dwindle while the demon hosts will swell
But if many humans are paying due respect to their parents  and making merit
then the Four Great Kings address the gods of the ThirtyThree seated together in the Hall of Justice
Many humans are paying due respect to their parents  and making merit
Then the gods of the ThirtyThree are pleased thinking
The heavenly hosts will swell while the demon hosts will dwindle
Once upon a time Sakka lord of gods guiding the gods of the ThirtyThree recited this verse
Whoever wants to be like me
would observe the sabbath
complete in all eight factors
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days
and the eighth day of the fortnight
as well as on the fortnightly special displays
But that verse was poorly sung by Sakka lord of gods not well sung poorly spoken not well spoken
Why is that
Sakka lord of gods is not free of greed hate and delusion
But for a mendicant who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentit is appropriate to say
Whoever wants to be like me

With Mahānāma the Sakyan
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Now at that time the Buddha had recently recovered from an illness
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
For a long time sir I have understood your teaching like this
Knowledge is for those with immersion not those without immersion
But sir does immersion come first then knowledge
Or does knowledge come first then immersion
Then Venerable nanda thought
The Buddha has recently recovered from an illness
and this Mahānāma asks him a question thats too deep
Why dont I take him off to one side and teach him the Dhamma
Then nanda took Mahānāma by the arm led him off to one side and said to him
Mahānāma the Buddha has spoken of the ethics immersion and wisdom of a trainee and the ethics immersion and wisdom of an adept
What is the ethics of a trainee
Its when a mendicant is ethical restrained in the monastic code with good behavior and supporters Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken
This is called the ethics of a trainee
And what is the immersion of a trainee
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption  second absorption  third absorption  fourth absorption
This is called the immersion of a trainee
And what is the wisdom of a trainee
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
This is called the wisdom of a trainee
Then a noble discipleaccomplished in ethics immersion and wisdomrealizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
In this way the Buddha has spoken of the ethics immersion and wisdom of both a trainee and an adept

Bitter
At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Benares for alms
While the Buddha was walking for alms near the cowhitching place at the wavy leaf fig he saw a disgruntled monk who was looking for pleasure in external things unmindful without situational awareness or immersion with straying mind and undisciplined faculties
The Buddha said to him
Monk dont be bitter
If youre bitter corrupted by carrion flies will without a doubt plague and infest you
Hearing this advice of the Buddha that monk was struck with a sense of urgency
Then after the meal on his return from almsround the Buddha told the mendicants what had happened 
When he said this one of the mendicants asked the Buddha
Sir what is this bitterness
What is carrion
And what are the flies
Desire is bitterness
ill will is the carrion
and bad unskillful thoughts are the flies
If youre bitter corrupted by carrion flies will without a doubt plague and infest you
When your eyes and ears are unguarded
and youre not restrained in your sense faculties
fliesthose lustful thoughts
will plague you
A mendicant whos bitter
corrupted by carrion
is far from being extinguished
anguish is their lot

They dont kill living creatures steal commit sexual misconduct lie or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence Theyre ethical of good character
They live at home with a heart rid of the stain of stinginess freely generous openhanded loving to let go committed to charity loving to give and to share
Ascetics and brahmins everywhere praise them for these good qualities

When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
I have heard Master Gotama that the ascetic Gotama says this
Gifts should only be given to me not to others
Gifts should only be given to my disciples not to the disciples of others
Only what is given to me is very fruitful not what is given to others
Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful not what is given to the disciples of others
I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and do not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
For we dont want to misrepresent Master Gotama
Vaccha those who say this
do not repeat what I have said
They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue
Anyone who prevents another from giving makes an obstacle and a barrier for three people
What three
The giver is obstructed from making merit The receiver is obstructed from getting what is offered And theyve already broken and damaged themselves
Anyone who prevents another from giving makes an obstacle and a barrier for these three people
Vaccha this is what I say
You even make merit by tipping out dishwashing water in a cesspool or a sump with living creatures in it thinking
May any creatures here be nourished
How much more then for human beings
However I also say that a gift to an ethical person is more fruitful than one to an unethical person Theyve given up five factors and possess five factors
What are the five factors theyve given up
Sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubt
These are the five factors theyve given up
What are the five factors they possess
The entire spectrum of an adepts ethics immersion wisdom freedom and knowledge and vision of freedom
These are the five factors they possess
I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and possesses these five factors is very fruitful
Cows may be black or white
red or tawny
mottled or uniform

But when one is born among them
the bull thats tamed
a behemoth powerful

they yoke the load just to him

So it is for humans
wherever they may be born

workers or outcastes and scavengers
one is born among them
tamed true to their vows
Firm in principle accomplished in ethical conduct
truthful conscientious
theyve given up birth and death
Complete in the spiritual journey
with burden put down detached
theyve completed the task and are free of defilements
Gone beyond all things
theyre extinguished by not grasping
In that flawless field
a religious donation is abundant
Fools who dont understand

give their gifts to those outside
and dont attend the peaceful ones
But those who do attend the peaceful ones

Each of us has spoken from the heart
Come reverends lets go to the Buddha and tell him about this
As he answers so well remember it
Yes reverend they replied
Then Sāriputta Saviṭṭha and Mahākoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Then Sāriputta told the Buddha of all they had discussed
In this matter Sāriputta its not easy to definitively declare that
one of these three people is finest

Associates
These three people are found in the world
What three
There is a person you shouldnt associate with accompany or attend
There is a person you should associate with accompany and attend
There is a person you should associate with accompany and attend with honor and respect
Who is the person you shouldnt associate with accompany or attend
Its someone who is inferior in terms of ethics immersion and wisdom
You shouldnt associate with accompany or attend such a person except out of kindness and compassion
Who is the person you should associate with accompany and attend
Its someone who is similar in terms of ethics immersion and wisdom
You should associate with accompany and attend such a person
Why is that
Thinking Since our ethical conduct is similar we can discuss ethics the conversation will flow and well both be at ease
Since our immersion is similar we can discuss immersion the conversation will flow and well both be at ease
Since our wisdom is similar we can discuss wisdom the conversation will flow and well both be at ease
Thats why you should associate with accompany and attend such a person
Who is the person you should associate with accompany and attend with honor and respect
Its someone who is superior in terms of ethics immersion and wisdom
You should associate with accompany and attend such a person with honor and respect
Why is that
Thinking Ill fulfill the entire spectrum of ethical conduct I havent yet fulfilled or support with wisdom in every situation the ethical conduct Ive already fulfilled
Ill fulfill the entire spectrum of immersion I havent yet fulfilled or support with wisdom in every situation the immersion Ive already fulfilled
Ill fulfill the entire spectrum of wisdom I havent yet fulfilled or support with wisdom in every situation the wisdom Ive already fulfilled
Thats why you should associate with accompany and attend this person with honor and respect
These are the three people found in the world
A man who associates with an inferior goes downhill
but associating with an equal youll never decline
following the best youll quickly rise up
so you should keep company with people better than you

In Charge
There are mendicants these three things to put in charge
What three
Putting oneself the world or the teaching in charge
And what mendicants is putting oneself in charge
Its when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut and reflects like this
I didnt go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe
almsfood lodgings or rebirth in this or that state
But I was swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress I was swamped by suffering mired in suffering
And I thought Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
But it would not be appropriate for me to seek sensual pleasures like those I abandoned when I went forth or even worse
Then they reflect
My energy shall be roused up and unflagging mindfulness shall be established and lucid my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi
Putting themselves in charge they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless and they keep themselves pure
This is called putting oneself in charge
And what mendicants is putting the world in charge
Its when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut and reflects like this
I didnt go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe
almsfood lodgings or rebirth in this or that state
But I was swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress I was swamped by suffering mired in suffering
And I thought Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
And now since Ive now gone forth I might have sensual malicious or cruel thoughts But the population of the world is large
and there are ascetics and brahmins who have psychic powertheyre clairvoyant and can read the minds of others
They see far without being seen even by those close and they understand the minds of others
They would know me
Look at this gentleman hes gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness but hes living mixed up with bad unskillful qualities
And there are deities too who have psychic powertheyre clairvoyant and can read the minds of others
They see far without being seen even by those close and they understand the minds of others
They would know me
Look at this gentleman hes gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness but hes living mixed up with bad unskillful qualities
Then they reflect
My energy shall be roused up and unflagging mindfulness shall be established and lucid my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi
Putting the world in charge they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless and they keep themselves pure
This is called putting the world in charge
And what mendicants is putting the teaching in charge
Its when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut and reflects like this

But I was swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress I was swamped by suffering mired in suffering
And I thought Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
The teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
I have spiritual companions who live knowing and seeing
Now that Ive gone forth in this well explained teaching and training it would not be appropriate for me to live lazy and heedless
Then they reflect
My energy shall be roused up and unflagging mindfulness shall be established and lucid my body shall be tranquil and undisturbed and my mind shall be immersed in samādhi
Putting the teaching in charge they give up the unskillful and develop the skillful they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless and they keep themselves pure
This is called putting the teaching in charge
These are the three things to put in charge
Theres no privacy in the world
for someone who does bad deeds
Youll know for yourself
whether youve lied or told the truth
When you witness your good self
you despise it
while you disguise
your bad self inside yourself
The gods and the Realized One see
the fool who lives unjustly in the world
So with yourself in charge live mindfully
with the world in charge be alert and practice absorption
with the teaching in charge live in line with that teaching
a sage who tries for the truth doesnt deteriorate
Māras destroyed the terminators overcome
one who strives reaches the end of rebirth
Poised clever knowing the world
that sage identifies with nothing at all

Second Training
Mendicants each fortnight over a hundred and fifty training rules come up for recitation in which gentlemen who love themselves train
These are all included in the three trainings
What three
The training in the higher ethics the higher mind and the higher wisdom
These are the three trainings that include them all
Take the case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics but has limited immersion and wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual life They keep the rules theyve undertaken
With the ending of three fetters they have at most seven rebirths
They will transmigrate at most seven times among gods and humans and then make an end of suffering
With the ending of three fetters they go from family to family They will transmigrate between two or three families and then make an end of suffering
With the ending of three fetters theyre a oneseeder They will be reborn just one time in a human existence then make an end of suffering
With the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion theyre a oncereturner They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics and immersion but has limited wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual path They keep the rules theyve undertaken
With the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream going to the Akaniṭṭha realm
With the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished with extra effort
With the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished without extra effort
With the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished upon landing
With the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished between one life and the next
Take another case of a mendicant who has fulfilled their ethics immersion and wisdom
They break some lesser and minor training rules but are restored
Why is that
Because I dont say theyre incapable of that
But theyre constant and steady in their precepts regarding the training rules that are fundamental befitting the spiritual path They keep the rules theyve undertaken
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
So mendicants if you practice partially you succeed partially If you practice fully you succeed fully These training rules are not a waste I say

Assemblies
Mendicants these are the three assemblies
What three
An assembly of the best a divided assembly and a harmonious assembly
And what is an assembly of the best
An assembly where the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack nor are they backsliders Instead they take the lead in seclusion rousing energy for attaining the unattained achieving the unachieved and realizing the unrealized And those who come afterwards follow their example
They too are not indulgent or slack nor are they backsliders Instead they take the lead in seclusion rousing energy for attaining the unattained achieving the unachieved and realizing the unrealized
This is called an assembly of the best
And what is a divided assembly
An assembly where the mendicants argue quarrel and fight continually wounding each other with barbed words This is called a divided assembly
And what is a harmonious assembly
An assembly where the mendicants live in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyes This is called a harmonious assembly
When the mendicants live in harmony like this they make much merit
At that time the mendicants live in a holy dwelling that is the hearts release by rejoicing
When theyre joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when theyre blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
Its like when it rains heavily on a mountain top and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows crevices and creeks As they become full they fill up the pools The pools fill up the lakes the lakes fill up the streams and the streams fill up the rivers And as the rivers become full they fill up the ocean
In the same way when the mendicants are in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyes they make much merit
At that time the mendicants live in a holy dwelling that is the hearts release by rejoicing
When theyre joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when theyre blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi

A Delicate Lifestyle
My lifestyle was delicate mendicants most delicate extremely delicate
In my fathers home lotus ponds were made just for me
In some blue water lilies blossomed while in others there were pink or white lotuses just for my benefit
I only used sandalwood from Kāsī and my turbans jackets sarongs and upper robes also came from Kāsī
And a white parasol was held over me night and day with the thought
Dont let cold heat grass dust or damp bother him
I had three stilt longhousesone for the winter one for the summer and one for the rainy season
I stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season where I was entertained by musiciansnone of them men
While the bondservants workers and staff in other houses are given rough gruel with pickles to eat in my fathers home they eat fine rice with meat
Amid such prosperity and such a delicate lifestyle I thought
When an uneducated ordinary personwho is liable to grow old not being exempt from old agesees someone else who is old theyre horrified repelled and disgusted overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation
But since I too am liable to grow old it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified embarrassed and disgusted when I see someone else who is old
Reflecting like this I entirely gave up the vanity of youth
When an uneducated ordinary personwho is liable to get sick not being exempt from sicknesssees someone else who is sick theyre horrified repelled and disgusted overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation
But since I too am liable to get sick it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified embarrassed and disgusted when I see someone else who is sick
Reflecting like this I entirely gave up the vanity of health
When an uneducated ordinary personwho is liable to die not being exempt from deathsees someone else who is dead theyre horrified repelled and disgusted overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation
But since I too am liable to die it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified embarrassed and disgusted when I see someone else who is dead
Reflecting like this I entirely gave up the vanity of life
There are these three vanities
What three
The vanity of youth of health and of life
Intoxicated with the vanity of youth an uneducated ordinary person does bad things by way of body speech and mind
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Intoxicated with the vanity of health 
Intoxicated with the vanity of life an uneducated ordinary person does bad things by way of body speech and mind
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Intoxicated with the vanity of youth health or life a mendicant resigns the training and returns to a lesser life
For others sickness is natural
and so are old age and death
Though this is how their nature is
ordinary people feel disgusted
If I were to be disgusted
with creatures whose nature is such
it would not be appropriate for me
since my life is just the same
Living in such a way
I understood the reality without attachments
I mastered all vanities
of health of youth
and even of life
seeing safety in renunciation
Zeal sprang up in me
as I looked to extinguishment
Now Im unable
to indulge in sensual pleasures
theres no turning back

Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact

Foundations
Mendicants a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on three foundations from time to time
the foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimity
If a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses solely on the foundation of immersion its likely their mind will incline to laziness
If they focus solely on the foundation of exertion its likely their mind will incline to restlessness
If they focus solely on the foundation of equanimity its likely their mind wont properly become immersed in samādhi for the ending of defilements
But when a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses from time to time on the foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimity their mind becomes pliable workable and radiant not brittle and has properly entered immersion for the ending of defilements
Its like when a goldsmith or a goldsmiths apprentice prepares a forge fires the crucible picks up some gold with tongs and puts it in the crucible From time to time they fan it from time to time they sprinkle water on it and from time to time they just watch over it
If they solely fanned it the gold would likely be scorched
If they solely sprinkled water on it the gold would likely cool down
If they solely watched over it the gold would likely not be properly processed
But when that goldsmith fans it from time to time sprinkles water on it from time to time and watches over it from time to time that gold becomes pliable workable and radiant not brittle and is ready to be worked
Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament they want whether a bracelet earrings a necklace or a golden garland
In the same way a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on three foundations from time to time
the foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimity 
When a mendicant dedicated to the higher mind focuses from time to time on the foundation of immersion the foundation of exertion and the foundation of equanimity their mind becomes pliable workable and radiant not brittle and has properly entered immersion for the ending of defilements
They become capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
If they wish
May I wield the many kinds of psychic power 
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman may I hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or far 
May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements
They are capable of realizing it in each and every case

Persons
These three kinds of people are found in the world
What three
The blind the oneeyed and the twoeyed
Who is the blind person
Its someone who doesnt have the kind of vision thats needed to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth theyve already acquired
Nor do they have the kind of vision thats needed to know the difference between qualities that are skillful and unskillful blameworthy and blameless inferior and superior and those on the side of dark and bright
This is called a blind person
Who is the person with one eye
Its someone who has the kind of vision thats needed to acquire more wealth and to increase the wealth theyve already acquired
But they dont have the kind of vision thats needed to know the difference between qualities that are skillful and unskillful blameworthy and blameless inferior and superior and those on the side of dark and bright
This is called a oneeyed person
Who is the person with two eyes
Its someone who has the kind of vision thats needed to acquire more wealth and to increase the wealth theyve already acquired
And they have the kind of vision thats needed to know the difference between skillful and unskillful blameworthy and blameless inferior and superior or qualities on the side of dark and bright
This is called a twoeyed person
These are the three people found in the world
Neither suitable wealth
nor merit do they make
They lose on both counts
those who are blind with ruined eyes
And now the oneeyed
person is explained
By methods good and bad
that devious person seeks wealth
Both by fraudulent thieving deeds
and also by lies
the young mans skilled at piling up money
and enjoying sensual pleasures
From here they go to hell
the oneeyed person is ruined
And now the twoeyed is explained
the best individual
Their wealth is earned legitimately
money acquired by their own hard work
They give with best of intentions
that peacefulhearted person
They go to a good place
where there is no sorrow
The blind and the oneeyed
you should avoid from afar
But you should keep the twoeyed close

With Five Factors
Mendicants I will teach you how to develop noble right immersion with five factors
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And how do you develop noble right immersion with five factors
Firstly a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption It has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
They drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion
Its like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish sprinkling it little by little with water
They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture spread through inside and out yet no moisture oozes out
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion
Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion
This is the first way to develop noble right immersion with five factors
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
They drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion
Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion
Its like a deep lake fed by spring water
Theres no inlet to the east west north or south and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time
But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches steeps fills and spreads throughout the lake Theres no part of the lake thats not spread through with cool water
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion
Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion
This is the second way to develop noble right immersion with five factors
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption They meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
They drench steep fill and spread their body with bliss free of rapture
Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of rapture
Its like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater
From the tip to the root theyre drenched steeped filled and soaked with cool water
Theres no part of them thats not spread through with cool water
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture
Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of rapture
This is the third way to develop noble right immersion with five factors
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption It is without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind
Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mind
Its like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth
Theres no part of the body thats not spread over with white cloth
In the same way they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind
Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mind
This is the fourth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors
Furthermore the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped attended borne in mind and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant
Its like when someone views someone else Someone standing might view someone sitting or someone sitting might view someone lying down
In the same way the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped attended borne in mind and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant
This is the fifth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors
When the noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
If a strong man was to tip it any which way would water pour out
Yes sir
In the same way when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
Suppose there was a square walled lotus pond on level ground full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
If a strong man was to open the wall on any side would water pour out
Yes sir
In the same way when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads with a goad ready
Then a deft horse trainer a master charioteer might mount the chariot taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left Hed drive out and back wherever he wishes whenever he wishes
In the same way when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way
a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case

ordinary people feel disgusted
If I were to be disgusted
with creatures whose nature is such
it would not be appropriate for me
since my life is just the same
Living in such a way
I understood the reality without attachments
I mastered all vanities
of health of youth
and even of life
seeing safety in renunciation
Zeal sprang up in me
as I looked to extinguishment
Now Im unable
to indulge in sensual pleasures

Like a fragrant pink lotus

There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the mendicants
Reverends take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics immersion and wisdom They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling
That is possible
If they dont reach enlightenment in this very life then surpassing the company of gods that consume solid food theyre reborn in a certain host of mindmade gods There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling
That is possible
When he said this Venerable Udāyī said to him
This is not possible Reverend Sāriputta it cannot happen
But for a second  and a third time Sāriputta repeated his statement
And for a third time Udāyī said to him
This is not possible Reverend Sāriputta it cannot happen
Then Venerable Sāriputta thought
Venerable Udāyī disagrees with me three times and not one mendicant agrees with me
Why dont I go to see the Buddha
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and said to the mendicants
Reverends take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics immersion and wisdom They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling
There is such a possibility
If they dont reach enlightenment in this very life theyre reborn in the company of a certain host of mindmade gods who surpass the gods that consume solid food There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling

But Udāyī do you believe in a mindmade body
For those gods sir who are formless made of perception

How on earth could you imagine youve got something worth saying
Then the Buddha said to Venerable nanda
nanda Theres a senior mendicant being harassed and you just watch it happening
Dont you have any compassion for a senior mendicant who is being harassed
Then the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics immersion and wisdom They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling
That is possible
If they dont reach enlightenment in this very life theyre reborn in the company of a certain host of mindmade gods who surpass the gods that consume solid food There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling

That is what the Buddha said
When he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling
Then not long after the Buddha had left Venerable nanda went to Venerable Upavāṇa and said to him
Reverend Upavāṇa theyve been harassing other senior mendicants
but I didnt question them
I wouldnt be surprised if the Buddha makes a statement about this when he comes out of retreat later this afternoon He might even call upon Venerable Upavāṇa himself
And right now I feel timid
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall where he sat on the seat spread out and said to Upavāṇa
Upavāṇa how many qualities should a senior mendicant have to be dear and beloved to their spiritual companions respected and admired
Sir a senior mendicant with five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions respected and admired

They get the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen they want without trouble or difficulty
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions respected and admired
Good good Upavāṇa
A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions respected and admired
If these five qualities are not found in a senior mendicant why would their spiritual companions honor respect revere or venerate them Because of their broken teeth gray hair and wrinkled skin

How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body is impure but whose behavior by way of speech is pure
Suppose a mendicant wearing rag robes sees a rag by the side of the road Theyd hold it down with the left foot spread it out with the right foot tear out what was intact and take it away with them
In the same way at that time you should ignore that persons impure behavior by way of body and focus on their pure behavior by way of speech
Thats how to get rid of resentment for that person
How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of speech is impure but whose behavior by way of body is pure

Then another person traveling along the road sees them
and thinks of them with nothing but compassion kindness and sympathy
Oh may this person get suitable food or medicine or a competent carer or someone to bring them to the neighborhood of a village
Why is that
So that they dont come to ruin right here
In the same way at that time you should ignore that persons impure behavior by way of speech and body and the fact that they dont get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time and think of them with nothing but compassion kindness and sympathy
Oh may this person give up bad conduct by way of body speech and mind and develop good conduct by way of body speech and mind
Why is that
So that when their body breaks up after death theyre not reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Thats how to get rid of resentment for that person
How should you get rid of resentment for a person whose behavior by way of body and speech is pure and who gets an openness and clarity of heart from time to time

Theyd plunge into the lotus pond to bathe and drink And after emerging theyd sit or lie down right there in the shade of the trees

Then Doṇa the brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over Doṇa sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama I have heard that
the ascetic Gotama doesnt bow to old brahmins the elderly and senior who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat
And this is indeed the case
for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins elderly and senior who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat
This is not appropriate Master Gotama
Doṇa do you too claim to be a brahmin
Master Gotama if anyone should be rightly called
a brahmin its me
For I am well born on both my mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation I recite and remember the hymns and have mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth I know philology and grammar and am well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
Doṇa the ancient brahmin hermits were Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times These days brahmins continue to sing and chant it They continue chanting what was chanted reciting what was recited and teaching what was taught
Those seers described five kinds of brahmins
A brahmin who is equal to Brahmā one who is equal to a god one who toes the line one who crosses the line and the fifth is a brahmin outcaste
Which one of these are you Doṇa
Master Gotama we dont know about these five kinds of brahmins We just know the word brahmin
Master Gotama please teach me this matter so I can learn about these five brahmins
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Doṇa replied
The Buddha said this
Doṇa how is a brahmin equal to Brahmā
Its when a brahmin is well born on both the mothers and the fathers sides coming from a clean womb back to the seventh paternal generation incontestable and irreproachable in discussions about ancestry
For fortyeight years he leads the virginal spiritual life studying the hymns
Then he seeks a fee for his teacher but only by legitimate means not illegitimate
In this context Doṇa what is legitimate
Not by farming trade raising cattle archery government service or one of the professions but solely by living on alms not scorning the alms bowl
Having offered the fee to his teacher he shaves off his hair and beard dresses in ocher robes and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness
Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Having developed these four Brahmā meditations when the body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a Brahmā realm
Thats how a brahmin is equal to Brahmā
And how is a brahmin equal to a god
Its when a brahmin is well born on both the mothers and the fathers sides

He has sex only with a brahmin woman He does not have sex with a woman from a caste of aristocrats merchants workers outcastes hunters bamboo workers chariotmakers or wastecollectors Nor does he have sex with women who are pregnant breastfeeding or outside the fertile half of the month that starts with menstruation
And why does the brahmin not have sex with a pregnant woman
If a brahmin had sex with a pregnant woman the boy or girl would be born in too much filth
Thats why the brahmin doesnt have sex with a pregnant woman
And why does the brahmin not have sex with a breastfeeding woman
If a brahmin had sex with a breastfeeding woman the boy or girl would drink back the semen
Thats why the brahmin doesnt have sex with a breastfeeding woman
And why does the brahmin not have sex outside the fertile half of the month that starts with menstruation Because his brahmin wife is not there for sensual pleasure fun and enjoyment but only for procreation
Having ensured his progeny through sex he shaves off his hair and beard dresses in ocher robes and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness
When he has gone forth quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities he enters and remains in the first absorption  second absorption  third absorption  fourth absorption
Having developed these four absorptions when the body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Thats how a brahmin is equal to god
And how does a brahmin toe the line
Its when a brahmin is well born on both the mothers and the fathers sides

Having ensured his progeny through sex his child makes him happy Because of this attachment he stays in his family property and does not go forth from the lay life to homelessness
As far as the line of the ancient brahmins extends he doesnt cross over it
Thats why hes called a brahmin who toes the line
Thats how a brahmin toes the line

Sir suppose there were two disciples equal in faith ethics and wisdom
One is a giver one is not
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
When they have become gods would there be any distinction or difference between them
There would be Sumanā said the Buddha
As a god the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects
divine lifespan beauty happiness fame and sovereignty
As a god the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects
But sir if they pass away from there and come back to this state of existence as human beings would there still be any distinction or difference between them
There would be Sumanā said the Buddha
As a human being the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects
human lifespan beauty happiness fame and sovereignty

As a renunciate the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects
Theyd usually use only what theyve been invited to acceptrobes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickrarely using them without invitation
When living with other spiritual practitioners they usually treat them agreeably by way of body speech and mind rarely disagreeably
As a renunciate the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects
But sir if they both attain perfection as perfected ones would there still be any distinction or difference between them
In that case I say there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other
Its incredible sir its amazing
Just this much is quite enough to justify giving gifts and making merit
For merit is helpful for those who have become gods human beings and renunciates

perfect in ethics

This is the second blissful meditation 
Furthermore a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Saṅgha

Seeing the peril in the hells
you should shun bad deeds
Taking up the teaching of the noble ones
an astute person should shun them
You shouldnt harm living beings
so long as strength is found
Nor should you knowingly speak falsehood
or take what is not given
Content with your own partners
you should stay away from the partners of others
A man shouldnt drink liquor or wine
as they confuse the mind
You should recollect the Buddha
and reflect on the teaching
You should develop a harmless mind of welfare
which leads to the realms of gods
When suitable gifts to give are available
to someone who wants and needs merit
a religious donation is abundant
if given first to the peaceful ones
I will tell of the peaceful ones
Sāriputta listen to me
Cows may be black or white
red or tawny
mottled or uniform
or pigeoncolored
But when one is born among them
the bull thats tamed
a behemoth powerful
wellpaced in pulling forward
they yoke the load just to him
regardless of his color
So it is for humans
wherever they may be born
among aristocrats brahmins merchants
workers or outcastes and scavengers
but when one is born among them
tamed true to their vows
Firm in principle accomplished in ethical conduct
truthful conscientious
theyve given up birth and death
and have completed the spiritual journey
With burden put down detached
theyve completed the task and are free of defilements
Gone beyond all things
theyre extinguished by not grasping
In that flawless field
a religious donation is abundant
Fools who dont understand
stupid uneducated
give their gifts to those outside
and dont attend the peaceful ones
But those who do attend the peaceful ones
wise esteemed as sages
and whose faith in the Holy One
has roots planted deep
they go to the realm of the gods
or are born here in a good family
Gradually those astute ones
reach extinguishment

Hindrances
Mother and Son
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time a mother and son had both entered the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī
as a monk and a nun
They wanted to see each other often
The mother wanted to see her son often
and the son his mother
Seeing each other often they became close
Being so close they became intimate
And being intimate lust overcame them
With their minds swamped by lust without resigning the training and declaring their inability to continue they had sex
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
Mendicants how could that silly man imagine that
a mother cannot lust for her son or that a son cannot lust for his mother
Compared to the sight of a woman I do not see a single sight that is so arousing sensuous intoxicating captivating and infatuating and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary
Sentient beings are lustful greedy tied infatuated and attached to the sight of a woman
They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a womans sight
Compared to the sound  smell  taste  touch of a woman I do not see a single touch that is so arousing sensuous intoxicating captivating and infatuating and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary
Sentient beings are lustful greedy tied infatuated and attached to the touch of a woman
They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a womans touch
When a woman walks she occupies a mans mind
When a woman stands  sits  lies down  laughs  speaks  sings  cries  is injured she occupies a mans mind Even when a woman is dead she occupies a mans mind
For if anyone should be rightly called an allround snare of Māra its females
You might chat with someone who has knife in hand
You might even chat with a goblin
You might sit close by a viper
whose bite would take your life
But never should you chat
one on one with a female
They captivate the unmindful
with a glance and a smile
Or scantily clad
they speak charming words
Its not good to sit with such a person
even if shes injured or dead
These five kinds of sensual stimulation
are apparent in a womans body
sights sounds tastes smells
and touches so delightful
Those swept away by the flood of sensual pleasures
not comprehending them

Gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut he sits down crosslegged with his body straight and establishes mindfulness right there
He gives up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities he enters and remains in the first absorption  second absorption  third absorption  fourth absorption
When his mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablehe extends it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
He truly understands This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering He truly understands These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements Knowing and seeing like this his mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance When freed he knows it is freed
He understands Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

About Gavesī
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
While traveling along a road the Buddha saw a large sal grove in a certain spot
He left the road went to the sal grove and plunged deep into it And at a certain spot he smiled
Then Venerable nanda thought
What is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiled
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason
So Venerable nanda said to the Buddha
What is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiled
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason
Once upon a time nanda there was a city in this spot that was successful and prosperous and full of people
And Kassapa a blessed one a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha lived supported by that city
He had a lay follower called Gavesī who had not fulfilled all the precepts
And the five hundred lay followers who were taught and advised by Gavesī also had not fulfilled all the precepts
Then Gavesī thought
Im the helper leader and adviser of these five hundred lay followers yet neither I nor they have fulfilled the precepts
Were the same Im in no way better
So let me do better
Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them
From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who has fulfilled the precepts
Then those five hundred lay followers thought
The venerable Gavesī is our helper leader and adviser
and now he will fulfill the precepts
Why dont we do the same
Then those five hundred lay followers went to Gavesī and said to him
From this day forth may Venerable Gavesī remember these five hundred lay followers as having fulfilled the precepts
Then Gavesī thought
Im the helper leader and adviser of these five hundred lay followers and both I and they have fulfilled the precepts
Were the same Im in no way better
So let me do better
Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them
From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who is celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sex
Then those five hundred lay followers did the same 
Then Gavesī thought
These five hundred lay followers 
are celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sex
Were the same Im in no way better
So let me do better
Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them
From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who eats in one part of the day abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time
Then those five hundred lay followers did the same 
Then Gavesī thought
These five hundred lay followers 
eat in one part of the day abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time
Were the same Im in no way better
So let me do better
Then the lay follower Gavesī went up to the blessed one Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha and said to him
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
And he received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination the mendicant Gavesī living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And the mendicant Gavesī became one of the perfected
Then those five hundred lay followers thought
Venerable Gavesī is our helper leader and adviser
He has shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness
Why dont we do the same
Then those five hundred lay followers went up to the blessed one Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha and said to him
Sir may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddhas presence
And they did receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddhas presence
Then the mendicant Gavesī thought
I get the supreme bliss of freedom whenever I want without trouble or difficulty
Oh may these five hundred mendicants do the same
Then those five hundred mendicants living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
They understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And so nanda those five hundred mendicants headed by Gavesī trying to go higher and higher better and better realized the supreme bliss of freedom
So you should train like this
Trying to go higher and higher better and better we will realize the supreme bliss of freedom
Thats how you should train

And I say that these five things are not got by praying or wishing for them

Agreeable
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of the householder Ugga of Vesālī where he sat on the seat spread out
Then Ugga went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha
The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable
My sal flower porridge is agreeable
may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion
Sir I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha
The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable
My pork with jujube is agreeable
may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion
 My fried vegetable stalks are agreeable
may the Buddha please accept them from me out of compassion
So the Buddha accepted them out of compassion
 My boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out served with many soups and sauces is agreeable
may the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion
 My cloths imported from Kāsī are agreeable
may the Buddha please accept them from me out of compassion
So the Buddha accepted them out of compassion
 My couch spread with woolen coversshagpiled or embroidered with flowersand spread with a fine deer hide with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends is agreeable
But sir I know that
this is not proper for the Buddha
However this plank of sandalwood is worth over a thousand dollars
May the Buddha please accept it from me out of compassion
So the Buddha accepted it out of compassion
And then the Buddha rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of appreciation
The giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable
enthusiastically giving clothing bedding
food and drink and various requisites
to those of upright conduct
Knowing the perfected ones to be like a field
for whats given offered and not held back
a good person gives whats hard to give
the giver of the agreeable gets the agreeable
And then the Buddha having rejoiced with Ugga with these verses of appreciation got up from his seat and left
Then after some time Ugga passed away
and was reborn in a host of mindmade gods
At that time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then late at night the glorious god Ugga lighting up the entire Jetas Grove went up to the Buddha bowed and stood to one side
The Buddha said to him

When a noble disciple has these five kinds of overflowing merit and goodness its not easy to grasp how much merit they have by saying that
this is the extent of their overflowing merit  that leads to happiness
Its simply reckoned as an incalculable immeasurable great mass of merit
Its like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean Its not easy to say
This is how many gallons how many hundreds thousands hundreds of thousands of gallons there are
