The Girl Seeks the Male The Primal Deity Guards the Way The story tells how Pig leapt down the mountainside and found a narrow pathAfter following it for nearly two miles he came across two shemonsters drawing water from a wellHow did he know that they both were monsters Each of them had on her head an extremely unfashionable hairstyle held up by bamboo slivers that stood one foot two or three inches highEvil monsters Pig called going up to themThe two of them looked at each other and said What an outrageous monk We dont know him and weve never had words with him So why did he call us evil monsters In their fury the monsters raised the pole with which they were going to carry the water and struck at Pigs headAfter a few blows that he could not ward off as he was unarmed the idiot rushed back up the mountain with his head covered by both hands shouting Brother Go back The monsters are vicious Whats so vicious about them Monkey askedThere were two evil spirits drawing water from the well in the hollow said Pig and they hit me three or four times with their carryingpole just because I spoke to them What did you call them Monkey askedEvil monsters Pig repliedYou got off lightly then laughed MonkeyJourney to the West Im most obliged for your concern replied PigMy head has swollen up where they hit it and you tell me Ive got off lightly Soft words will get you anywhere on earth act rough and you wont move a single step replied MonkeyAs theyre local fiends from round here and were monks from far away youd have had to be a bit polite even if youd had fists growing all over your bodyDo you think they should have hit me instead of you You were the one who called them evil monstersCourtesy first I never realized said PigLiving on human flesh in the mountains since childhood as you have said Monkey can you recognize two kinds of tree I dont know Pig saidWhich two trees The willow and the sandalwood Monkey repliedThe willow has a very soft nature so that craftsmen can carve it into holy images or make statues of the Tathagata out of it Its gilded painted set with jewels decorated with flowers and many worshippers burn incense to it It receives unbounded blessingsBut the sandalwood is so hard that its used as the pressingbeam in the oilpress with iron hoops round its head and its hit with iron hammers tooThe only reason it suffers like this is because its to hard You should have told me all this before said Pig then I wouldnt have been beaten Now go back and find out the truth said Brother MonkeyBut if I go there again theyll recognize me Pig replied Then turn into something else said MonkeyBut even if I do turn into something else brother how am I to question them asked PigWhen you look different go up to them and bow to them Monkey replied See how old they areIf theyre about the same age as us call them Miss and if theyre a lot older call them Lady What a terrible climbdownwhy should we be treating them as our relations when theyre strangers from this far away said PigThats not treating them as relations replied Monkey Its just a way of getting the truth out of themIf theyre the ones whove got our master well be able to act and if it isnt them we wont lose any time before going to fight elsewhere Youre right said PigIm going back The splendid idiot tucked his rake in his belt went down into the hollow shook himself and turned into a far darkskinned monkHe swaggered as he went up to the monsters chanted a loud naaaw of respect and said Respectful greetings ladies This monks much better the two monsters said with delightHe expresses his respects and knows how to address us properly Then they asked him Where are you from venerable elder From somewhere Pig repliedJourney to the West And where are you going they askedSomewhere Pig repliedWhats your name they asked What it is Pig replied againBetter he may be the monsters said with a laugh but he wont tell us about himselfHe just echoes our questions Ladies Pig asked why are you fetching water You wouldnt know monk the demons replied with smilesOur lady brought a Tang Priest back to the cave last night and she wants to look after him well As the water in our cave is none too clean shes sent us two to fetch some of this good water produced by the mating of the Yin and the Yang Shes laid on a vegetarian banquet as well for the Tang Priest shes going to marry him this evening As soon as he heard this the idiot rushed straight back up the mountain shoutingFriar Sand bring the luggage here at onceWere dividing it up Why brother Friar Sand askedWhen weve divided it up you can go back to maneating in the Flowing Sands River Pig replied Ill return to Gao Village to see my wife Big Brother can play the sage on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and the white dragon can be a dragon in the ocean againThe masters getting married in this evil spirits caveLets all go and settle down Youre talking nonsense again you idiot replied Brother MonkeyI bloody well am not Pig retortedThose two evil spirits who were carrying water said a moment ago that a vegetarian wedding feast is being laid on for the master How can you say things like that when the evil spirits are holding the master prisoner in the cave and hes longing for us to go in and rescue him said MonkeyHow can we rescue him Pig askedYou two bring the horse and the luggage while we go with the two shemonsters as our guides Monkey repliedWhen we reach the entrance we can act together The idiot could only go with Monkey as he followed the two monsters for five or six miles deep into the mountains before suddenly disappearingSo the master was captured by a devil in broad daylight exclaimed Pig with surpriseYouve got good eyesight said MonkeyHow can you possibly tell what they really were Those two monsters were carrying the water along when suddenly they disappearedThey must be daytime devils I think they went into a cave said MonkeyWait while I go to have a look Journey to the West The splendid Great Sage opened his fiery eyes with their golden pupils and scanned the whole mountainHe saw no movement but did spot a ceremonial archway most intricately made with many flowers and colours triple eaves and fourfold decorations in front of the cliffGoing closer with Pig and Friar Sand he saw four large words written on it PITFALL MOUNTAINBOTTOMLESS CAVE Brothers said Monkey heres the evil spirits archway but I still dont know where the entrance is Cant be far said Friar Sand cant be farLets have a good look for it When they turned round to look they saw a great rock over three miles around at the foot of the mountain beneath the archway In the middle of it was a hole the size of a watervat which had become very slippery by repeated climbingBrother said Pig thats where the evil spirits go in and out of their cave Thats very strange said MonkeyTo be frank with the two of you Ive captured quite a few evil spirits since I started escorting the Tang Priest but Ive never seen a cave palace like this one beforePig you go down first and find out how deep it isThen Ill be able to go in and rescue the master Itll be hard said Pig with a shake of his head very hard Im very clumsyIf I tripped and fell in it might take me two or three years to reach the bottom How deep is it then Monkey askedLook Pig replied and as the Great Sage leant over the edge of the hole to take a careful look he saw to his astonishment that it was very deep indeed and must have measured over a hundred miles aroundIts very very deep brother he turned round to say Go back then Pig repliedThe masters beyond saving What a thing to say Monkey retortedHave no thoughts of being lazy put idleness out of your mind Put the luggage down and tether the horse to one of the legs of the archwayYou and Friar Sand must block the entrance with your rake and staff while I go inside to exploreIf the master really is inside Ill drive the evil spirits out with my iron cudgel and when they reach the entrance you mustnt let them outWell only be able to kill the evil spirits and rescue the master if we work together The other two accepted their ordersMonkey sprang into the hole and under his feet tea thousand coloured clouds appeared while a thousand layers of auspicious mist shielded himHe was soon at the bottom which was a very long way down Inside all was bright there was the same sunshine winds flowers fruit and trees as in the world above What a splendid place Monkey thoughtIt reminds me of the Water Curtain Cave that Heaven gave me in the place where I was bornThis is another cave paradise As he looked around he saw a gatetower with double eaves around which grew many clumps of pine and bamboo Inside were many buildingsThis must be where the evil spirit lives he thoughtIll go in and find out whats upNo waitIf I go in like this shell recognize meId better transform myself With a shake and a handspell he turned himself into a Journey to the West fly and flew lightly up to land on the gatetower and listen inFrom here he saw the monster sitting at her ease in a thatched pavilion She was dressed far more beautifully than she had been when they rescued her in the pine forest or when she had tried to catch Monkey in the monastery Her hair was piled in a crowblack coiffure She wore a green velvet waistcoatHer feet were a pair of curving golden lotuses Her fingers were as delicate as bamboo shoots in springHer powdered face was like a silver dish And her red lips were as glossy as a cherryShe was a regular beauty Even more lovely than the lady on the moonAfter capturing the pilgrim monk that morning She was going to know the pleasure of sharing his bedMonkey said nothing as he listened out for what she might sayBefore long the cherry of her lips parted as she said with great pleasure Lay on a vegetarian feast my little ones and quick My darling Tang Priest and I are going to be man and wife afterwards So its true thought Brother Monkey grinning to himselfI thought Pig was just jokingId better fly in and find the masterI wonder what state of mind hes inIf hes been led astray Im leaving him here When he spread his wings and flew inside to look he saw the Tang Priest sitting in a corridor behind a trellis covered with opaque red paper below and left clear aboveButting a hole through the trellis paper Monkey landed on the Tang Priests bald head and called Master Save me disciple replied Sanzang who recognized Monkeys voiceYoure useless Master said Monkey The evil spirit is laying on a feast and when youve eaten it you two are getting marriedI expect youll have a son or a daughter to start another generation of monks and nunsWhat have you got to be so upset about When the venerable elder heard this he gnashed his teeth and said Disciple in all the time since I left Changan accepted you as my follower at the Double Boundary Mountain and started my journey West when have I ever eaten meat or had any wicked ideasNow the evil spirit has captured me she is insisting that I mate with her If I lose my true masculine essence may I fall from the wheel of reincarnation and be fixed for ever behind the Dark Mountains never to rise again Journey to the West No need to swear any oaths said Monkey with a grinIf you really want to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven Ill take you there I cant remember the way I came in Sanzang repliedNever mind about forgetting said MonkeyYou wont get out of here as easily as you came in which was from the top downwardsIf I save you now youll have to go from the bottom upwardsIf youre very lucky youll squeeze out through the entrance and get awayBut if your lucks out you wont be able to squeeze through and sooner or later youll die of suffocation This is terrible said Sanzang the tears pouring from his eyesWhat are we to do No problem said Monkey no problemThe evil spirits getting some wine prepared for you Youll have to drink a goblet of it whether you want to or notBut you must pour it out quickly so that it makes a lot of froth Then I can turn myself into a tiny insect and fly under the bubblesWhen she gulps me down into her belly Ill tear her heart and liver to shreds and rip her guts apart Once Ive killed her youll be able to escape But that would be an inhuman thing to do disciple said SanzangIf all youre interested in is being kind youre done for Monkey repliedThe evil spirits a murderess What do you care so much about her for Oh well said Sanzang never mindBut you will have to stay with me IndeedThe Great Sage Sun guarded Tang Sanzang well The pilgrim priest depended on the Handsome Monkey KingMaster and disciple had not even finished their discussion when the evil spirit who had arranged everything came in along the corridor unlocked the doors and called Reverend sir The Tang Priest dared not replyShe addressed him again and again he dared not reply Why was thatHe was thinking that Divine energy is dispersed by an open mouth Trouble starts when the tongue begins to moveHe was thinking with all his heart that if he obstinately refused to open his mouth she might turn vicious and murder him in an instantJust when he was feeling confused wondering which difficult alternative to choose and asking himself what to do the evil spirit addressed him as Reverend sir for the third timeThe Tang Priest had no choice but to answer Here I am madam For him to give this reply was to make all the flesh fall off himNow everybody says that the Tang Priest is a sincere monk so how could he reply to the shedevil when he was on his way to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Western HeavenJourney to the West What you would not realize is that this was a crisis in which his very survival was at stake that he had absolutely no alternative and although he went through the form of replying he was free of desire insideBut when the evil spirit heard his reply she pushed the door open helped the Tang Priest to his feet held his hand stood with her side pressed against his and whispered in his earJust look at her as she lays on the charm and makes herself alluring in every possible wayShe did not realize that Sanzang was full of revulsionFrom the way shes making herself so seductive Monkey thought with a wry grin to himself Im worried that she might get the master interested IndeedThe monk in demon trouble met a pretty girl The shedevils beauty was truly superbHer slender jade eyebrows were like two willow leaves Her round face was set off with peach blossomEmbroidered shoes gave a sight of a pair of phoenixes Her crowblack hair was piled high at the templesAs smiling she led the master by his hand His cassock was tinged with orchid and muskHer arms around him the shedevil took the master to a thatched pavilion and said Reverend sir Ive had a drink brought here to have with you Lady said the Tang Priest as a monk I can take no impure food I know the evil spirit repliedAs the water in the cave isnt clean Ive sent for some of the pure water from the mating of the Yin and the Yang up on the mountain and had a banquet of fruit and vegetables preparedAfter that you and I are going to have some fun When the Tang Priest went into the pavilion with her this is what could be seenAll within the gates Was decked in silks and embroideries Throughout the hall Incense rose from golden lion censersBlackpainted inlaid tables were set in rows Journey to the West On which stood darklacquered bamboo dishesOn the inlaid tables Were all kinds of delicacies In the bamboo dishes Were vegetarian delightsCrab apples olives lotus seeds grapes torreyanuts hazelnuts pinenuts lichees longans chestnuts water caltrops jujubes persimmons walnuts gingko nuts kumquats and orangesThere was the fruit that grows on every hill The fresh vegetables of each season Beancurd wheat gluten treeear fungus fresh bamboo shoots button mushrooms gill fungus yams sealwort agar day lily fried in vegetable oil Hyacinth beans cowpeas prepared with mature saucesCucumbers gourds gingko turnip greensPeeled aubergines were cooked like quails Seeded wax gourds Taro stewed tender and sprinkled with sugar Turnips boiled in vinegarPungent chili and ginger made it all delicious All the dishes were a balance of bland and saltyRevealing the tips of her jade fingers she raised a dazzling golden goblet that she filled with fine wine Dearest reverend gentleman she said handing it to him my darling have a drink to celebrate our happy union Sanzang was covered with embarrassment as he took the wineHe poured a libation into the air as he prayed silently Devas who guard the Dharma Guardians of the Four Quarters and the Centre Four Duty Gods your disciple Chen Xuanzang has benefited from the secret protection of all you deities sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin on my journey to pay my respects at the Thunder Monastery see the Buddha and seek the scriptures I have now been captured by an evil spirit on my way She is forcing me to marry her and has now handed me this cup of wine to drinkIf this really is pure wine I can force myself to drink it and still be able to succeed and see the BuddhaBut if it is impure wine I will be breaking my vows and fall for ever into the bitterness of the wheel of rebirth Journey to the West The Great Sage Sun made himself tiny and was like a secret informant behind his masters earWhen he spoke Sanzang was the only one who could hear himKnowing that his master was normally fond of the pure wine of grapes he told him to drain the gobletSanzang had no choice but to do so quickly refill the goblet and hand it back to the evil spiritAs he filled it bubbles of happiness formed on the surface of the wineBrother Monkey turned himself into the tiniest of insects and flew lightly under the bubblesBut when the spirit took the goblet she put it down instead of drinking from it bowed twice to the Tang Priest and spoke loving words to him with charming bashfulnessBy the time she lifted the cup the bubbles had burst and the insect was revealedNot realizing that it was Monkey transformed the evil spirit took it for a real insect lifted it out with her little finger and flicked it awaySeeing that as things were not going as he intended he would be unable to get into her belly Monkey turned himself into a hungry eagleIndeed Jade claws gold eyes and iron wings In terrible might he rose above the cloudsCunning hares and foxes felt faint at just the sight And hid among mountains and rivers for hundred of miles aroundWhen hungry it chased small birds into the wind And rose to the gate of heaven when repleteMurderous were its talons of steel In times of triumph it stayed aloof in the cloudsMonkey flew up swung his jade claws and noisily overturned the tables smashing all the fruit vegetables and crockery and leaving the Tang Priest alone there as he flew offThis was so terrifying that the shedevils heart and gall were split open and the Tang Priests flesh and bones were turned crispShivering and shaking the evil spirit threw her arms round the Tang Priest and said Dearest reverend gentleman wherever did that come from I dont know Sanzang replied I went to a great deal of trouble to arrange this vegetarian feast for you the shedevil saidGoodness only knows where that feathered brute flew in from and smashed our crockery Smashing the crockery doesnt really matter the junior demons said but all the food has been spilt on the floorIts too dirty to eat now Sanzang by now realized that this was all the result of Monkeys magic but he dared not say soJourney to the West Little ones said the shedevil I realize now It must be heaven and earth that sent that thing down here because they cant tolerate my holding the Tang Priest prisonerClear all the broken dishes up and lay on another banquet Never mind whether its vegetarian or not Heaven can be our matchmaker and the earth our guarantor After that the Tang Priest and I will become man and wife We will say no more of her as she took the Tang Priest to sit in the East corridorInstead the story tells of how Monkey flew out turned back into himself reached the entrance to the cave and shouted Open up Friar Sand Pig shouted our big brothers here As the two of them drew their weapons away Monkey sprang outIs there an evil spirit in there Pig asked grabbing hold of himIs the master in there Yes yes said MonkeyThe master must be having a hard time in there said Pig Are his arms tied behind his back Or is he all roped upIs she going to steam him or boil him None of them Monkey repliedShed just had a vegetarian feast served and was going to do it with him So youve been lucky then said PigYou must have drunk a wedding toast Idiot retorted Monkey Never mind about having a wedding drinkI can hardly keep him alive Then why are you here Pig askedMonkey told how he had seen the master and done his transformations ending Dont let your fears run away with you brothersThe masters here and when I go back in this time Ill definitely rescue him Going back inside Monkey turned into a fly and landed on the gatetower to listenHe could hear the shedevil snorting with fury as she gave instructions within the pavilion Little ones bring whatever there is vegetarian or not and burn paper as offerings to the deitiesIll ask heaven and earth to be the matchmakersIm definitely going to marry him When Monkey heard this he smiled to himself and thought That shedevils completely shameless Shes locked a monk up in her home and now shes going to mess around with him in broad daylightBut dont be in too much of a hurryGive me time to go in and have a look round With a buzz he flew along the corridor to see the master sitting inside tears streaming down his faceMonkey squeezed in landed on Sanzangs head and called Master Recognizing the voice Sanzang sprang to his feet and said with toothgnashing fury Macaque Other people get their courage from a big gall but they have to wrap their bodies around itYour gall is so big that you wrap it round your bodyYou used your magical powers of transformation to smash the crockery but what use is thatBy fighting that shedevil youve only made her more sexcrazed than ever She is arranging a banquet with vegetarian and impure food all mixed up and is determined to mate with meWhere will this all end Smiling to himself again Monkey replied Dont be angry with me MasterIve got a way to save you Journey to the West How will you save me the Tang Priest askedWhen I flew up just now said Monkey I saw that she has a garden behind hereYou must lure her into the garden to fool around and Ill rescue you from there How will you rescue me from the garden the Tang Priest askedGo to the peach trees in the garden with her and stay thereWait till Ive flown to a branch of the peach tree and turned into a red peachWhen you want to eat a peach pick the red one firstthat will be meShell be bound to pick one too You must insist on giving her the red oneOnce shes swallowed it Ill be in her stomach When I tear her stomach to pieces and rip her guts to shreds shell be dead and youll be freed With your powers you ought to fight her said SanzangWhy do you want to get into her stomach You dont understand Master Monkey repliedIf it were easy to get in and out of this cave of hers I would be able to fight her But this place is very hard to get into or out of the way out is complicated and difficultIf I started a fight with her all the fiends in her den young and old would overpower meThen how would it endWe must act carefully if were all to make a clean getaway Sanzang nodded believing all that Monkey said adding only You must stay with me I know said monkey I knowIll be on your head When master and disciple had settled their plan Sanzang leaned forward took hold of the bars in the corridors gates and called out Lady lady As soon as she heard this the evil spirit came rushing over a simpering smile on her face to ask What do you have to say to me my wonderful darling Lady replied Sanzang ever since leaving Changan and starting on my journey to the West I have had to cross mountains and rivers every single dayWhen I was staying in the Zhenhai Monastery last night I caught a bad chill and I have been in a sweat todayI was just beginning to feel a little better today when in your kindness good lady you brought me into your immortals palaceAs I have been sitting here all day I am now feeling in rather low spirits againCould you take me somewhere to cheer myself up and have a little fun The evil spirit was utterly delightedSo youre feeling a bit interested are you my wonderful darling she said You and I will go into the garden for some funLittle ones she called fetch the key open the garden gates and sweep the paths in the garden The demons all hurried off to open the gates and tidy the place upMeanwhile the evil spirit was opening the screen and helping the Tang Priest outJust watch the many young demonsall willowy beauties with oiled hair and powdered facescrowding around the Tang Priest as they head for the gardenWhat a splendid monk he was walking amid these beauties in their gauze and brocade for no other purpose than to be deaf and dumbIf instead of having an iron heart set on the Buddha he had been any ordinary man susceptible to wine and women he would never have succeeded in fetching the scripturesWhen they reached the entrance to the garden the evil spirit whispered seductively My wonderful darling lets have some fun hereitll cheer you up They went into the garden hand in hand and when he looked up he saw that it was indeed a splendid place This is what could be seen Journey to the West All over the winding paths Bluish lichens growSecluded gauze windows Kept dark by embroidered curtainsWhen the breeze arises Silks and brocades float in the airWhen the gentle rain stops falling The smooth white skin and jadelike flesh are revealedThe sunscorched apricot Is red as an immortals rainbow clothes spread out to dry The plantain in the moonlight Is bluer than Lady Taizhen waving her feather fanWhitewashed walls enclose The golden orioles that sing in ten thousand willowsWithin the empty halls Butterflies flit among begonias in the courtyardLook at the Hall of Crystallized Perfumes The Green Moth Hall The Hall to Recover from Drunkenness The Hall of Longing Rolling up the brilliance one behind the other On the red curtains Hooks hold tassels like prawn whiskers Now look at the Pavilion to Ease Pain The Pavilion of Simplicity The Pavilion of Thrushes Journey to the West The Four Rains Pavilion All towering and lofty And bearing on decorated tablets Their names in archaic scriptLook too at the Pool Where Cranes Bathe The Gobletwashing Pool The Pool of Delight in the Moon The Pool for Cleansing Tassels Where amid duckweed and algae the gold scales shineThen there is the Kiosk of Ink Flowers The Kiosk of Strange Boxes The Interesting Kiosk The Kiosk for Admiring the Clouds Where bubbles like green ants float on the wine in jade ladles and gobletsAround the pools and pavilions Stand rocks from Lake Taihu Rocks of purple crystal Yingluo rocks Jin River rocks Greenish and overgrown with tigerwhisker rushesEast and West of the kiosks and balls are found A Wooden Mountain A Turquoise Screen Mountain A Howling Wind Mountain A Jade Mushroom Mountain All covered in phoenixtail bambooJourney to the West Trellises of briar roses And garden roses Growing by a swing As a curtain of silk and brocadeA Pine Pavilion A Magnolia Pavilion Opposite a Saussurea Pavilion Forming a wall of jade with embroidered hangingsHerbaceous and tree peonies are rivals in luxuriance The nightclosing magnolias and the jasmine Are charming every yearMoist with dewdrops are the purple buds They ought to be painted or drawnThe red hibiscus fills the sky with flaming splendor A marvellous subject for poetryWhen it comes to fine scenery This makes Lang Garden or Penglai not worth a mention And as for the flowers The finest peonies of Luoyang count for nothing beside themIn the battle of the blossoms late in the spring The garden lacks only the flowers of jadeThe venerable elder led the shedevil by the hand as they strolled in the garden admiring the endless displays of rare and exotic bloomsAs they went through many a hall and pavilion he really did seem to be going into an exquisite placeLooking up he realized that he was by the peach groveMonkey pinched his masters head to remind himFlying to a branch of a peach tree Brother Monkey shook himself and turned into a red peach and a most fetchingly red one at thatLady the venerable elder said to the evil spirit what beautifully scented flowers Journey to the West and ripe fruit you have in this gardenThe blooms are so fragrant bees vie for their nectar The birds all compete for the fruit on the branchesWhy are some of the peaches on the trees red and some green If there were no Yin and Yang in the heavens the sun and moon would not be bright the evil spirit replied with a smileIf there were no Yin and Yang in the earth the plants and trees would not growAnd if there were no Yin and Yang among people there would be no sexual differenceThe peaches on the Southern Yang side of these trees are red because they ripen first in the suns heat The peaches on the Northern Yin side are green because they get no sun and are still unripeIts all because of the Yin and the Yang Thank you lady for your explanation Sanzang repliedI did not know that He then reached out and picked a red peach while the evil spirit also picked a green oneSanzang bowed as he handed the red one respectfully to the evil spirit with the words Lady you love what is attractive so wont you take this red peach and give me the green one The shedevil made the exchange thinking with concealed delight What a nice monk He really is a good manHe is being so loving to me even before were man and wife With great pleasure she paid him her affectionate respectsAs the Tang Priest started to eat the green peach at once the evil spirit was delighted to do likewise opening her mouth to bite into the red oneWhen she parted her red lips and revealed her silver teeth the impatient Monkey did not give her time to bite him but rolled straight down her throat into her stomachReverend gentleman the terrified evil spirit said that peach is a terrorWhy did it roll straight down and not let me bite it Lady Sanzang replied the first ripe fruits of a garden are very deliciousThat is why it went down so fast But it shot straight down before Id had time to spit the stone out the evil spirit repliedBecause you are such a lover of what is fine and beautiful and enjoyed it so much said Sanzang you swallowed it before you could bring the stone out Once inside her stomach Monkey turned back into himselfMaster he called no need to argue with her nowIve succeeded Dont be too hard on her disciple Sanzang repliedWho are you talking to the evil spirit asked when she heard thisI am talking to my disciple Sun Wukong Sanzang repliedWhere is he the evil spirit asked Journey to the West In your stomach Sanzang repliedHe was the red peach you have just eaten Thats the end of me exclaimed the evil spirit in horrorIf that apes got into my stomach Im deadSun the Novice why did you go to such lengths to get into my stomach No particular reason replied Monkey from inside herI just wanted to eat the six leaves of your liver and your lungs and your heart with its three hairs and seven aperturesIm going to clean your insides right out and leave you a skeleton spirit This sent the evil spirits souls scattering in terror and shivering and shaking she clung tightly to the Tang Priest and said Reverend gentleman I had thought that Our destinies were from former lives joined by a red thread Our love was as close as the water and the fishI never imagined that we lovebirds would be parted Or that the phoenixes would fly to East and WestWhen the waters rose under Lan Bridge the rendezvous failed The meeting came to nothing in the misty templeAfter brief joy we are parted once more In whatever year will I meet you again When Monkey heard all this from inside her stomach he was afraid that the venerable elder would have another attack of benevolence and let her talk her way out of the problem Thereupon he started to wield fist and foot striking out in martial postures and leveling everything around him He punched her stomach almost to ribbonsUnable to bear the pain the evil spirit collapsed in the dust not daring to utter a single word for some timeAs she was not speaking Monkey imagined that she must be dead and eased offShe then recovered her breath to some extent and called out Where are you little ones Now once in the garden the creatures had all had the understanding to go off picking flowers playing in the grass and amusing themselves leaving the shedevil alone with the Tang Priest for a romantic conversationAs soon as they heard her calling they rushed over to see the evil spirit lying on the ground her face a terrible color as she groaned unable to move They hurriedly helped her up crowding round and asking Whats wrong madamHave you had a heart attack No no the evil spirit repliedDont ask any questions Ive got someone inside meTake the monk outside if you want to save my life Journey to the West The junior devils actually did start to carry the Tang Priest at which Monkey yelled from inside her belly Dont any of you dare carry himYou must take my master out yourselfIll only spare your life when youve carried him outside This left the evil spirit with no choice as all she cared about was saving her skinAt once she struggled to her feet lifted the Tang Priest on her back and headed outside followed by the junior devils asking Where are you going Madam To this the evil spirit replied As long as the lakes and the bright moon remain Ill surely find somewhere to put my golden hook Once Ive taken this wretch outside Ill find myself another man The splendid evil spirit went straight by cloud to the mouth of the cave where the clang of weapons and wild shouts could be heardDisciple said Sanzang why can I hear weapons outside Its Pig rubbing his rake replied MonkeyGive him a shout Bajie Sanzang shoutedFriar Sand said Pig when he heard this the masters out The two of them drew back their rake and staff letting the evil spirit carry the Tang Priest outIndeed The Mind Ape had subdued a monster from the inside The Earth and Wood door guards welcomed the holy monkIf you dont know whether the evil spirits life was spared listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe MindApe Recognizes the Refiner of Cinnabar The Girl Reverts to Her True Nature The story tells how after Sanzang had been carried out of the cave by the evil spirit Friar Sand went up to him and asked Where is my oldest brother now that you have come out Master Journey to the West He must know what hes doing said PigI expect hes exchanged himself for the master to get him out Your brother is in her stomach Sanzang replied pointing at the evil spirit It is terribly filthy Pig saidWhatever are you doing in thereCome out Open your mouth said Monkey from inside Im coming out The shedevil did indeed open her mouth wideMonkey made himself very small sprang up into her throat and was just about to emerge when he became worried that she might cheat and bite him He then pulled out his iron cudgel blew on it with magic breath called Change and turned it into a jujube stone with which he wedged her jaw openWith one bound he then leapt outside taking the iron cudgel with him bowed to resume his own form and raised his cudgel to strike herAt once she drew a pair of fine swords parrying his blow with a loud clang They fought a splendid battle on the mountain topA pair of dancing flying swords defended her face The goldbanded cudgel struck at her headOne was a heavenborn monkey the Mindape The other had the bones of an earthborn girl turned spirit The two of them both had been smitten by anger Hatred arose at the celebration the party was endedOne longed to mate with the primal masculinity The other wanted to defeat the incarnation of the femaleWhen the cudgel was raised to the sky cold mists spread out The swords shook up the earths black dirt like a sieveBecause the elder would visit the Buddha They were locked in fierce combat each showing great prowessWhen water conflicts with fire motherhood is out When Yin and Yang cannot combine each goes its own wayAfter the two had been fighting for a very long time The earth moved the mountains shook and the trees were destroyed Journey to the West The sight of their struggle made Pig grumble resentfully about MonkeyBrother he said turning to Friar Sand our elder brother is messing aroundWhen he was in her stomach just now he could have used his fists to make her belly red with blood rip it open and come out That would have settled her scoreWhy did he have to come out through her mouth and fight herWhy did he let her run wild Youre right Friar Sand replied but it was thanks to him that the master was rescued from the depths of the cave even if he is in a fight with her nowLets ask the master to sit here by himself while we two use our weapons to help our brother beat the evil spirit No no said Pig with a wave of his handHes got his magic powers Wed be useless What a thing to say retorted Friar SandThis is in all of our interestsWe may not be much use but even a fart can strengthen a breeze Now that the idiots dander was up he brandished his rake and shouted Come on Ignoring the master they rode the wind and went for the evil spirit striking wildly at her with their rake and staffThe evil spirit who was already finding Brother Monkey too much to handle realized that she would be unable to hold out against two more of them At once she turned and fledAfter her brothers Monkey shoutedSeeing that they were so hot on her heels the evil spirit took the embroidered shoe off her right foot blew on it with a magic breath said a spell called Change and turned it into her own double swinging a pair of swordThen she shook herself turned into a puff of wind and went straight back There she was fleeing for her life because she was no match for themWhat happened next was quite unexpected Sanzangs evil star had still not gone away As the evil spirit reached the archway in front of the entrance to the cave she saw the Tang Priest sitting there by himself so she went up to him threw her arm round him grabbed the luggage bit through the bridle and carried him back inside horse and allThe story tells not of her but of Pig who exploited an opening to fell the evil spirit with one blow of his rake only to find that she was really an embroidered shoeYou pair of idiots said Monkey when he saw it You should have been looking after the masterNobody asked you to help What about that then Friar Sand said PigI said we shouldnt come hereThat ape has had a brainstorm We beat the monster for him and he gets angry with us Beaten the monster indeed Monkey saidThe monster fooled me yesterday by leaving a shoe behind when I was fighting herGoodness knows how the master is now that youve left himLets go straight back and see The three of them hurried back to find that the master had disappeared there was no sign at all of him the luggage or the white horsePig started rushing all over the place in a panic with Friar Sand searching alongside him The Great Sage Sun was also most anxiousAs he searched he noticed half of the bridle rope lying askew beside the pathPicking it up he could not hold back his tears as he called in a loud voice MasterWhen I went I took my leave of you three and the horse and all I find on my return is this rope It was indeed a case of Being reminded of the steed by seeing the saddle Journey to the West Missing the beloved amid ones tearsThe sight of Monkeys tears gave Pig an uncontrollable urge to throw back his head and laugh out loud Blockhead said Monkey abusivelyDo you want us to break up again Thats not what I mean said Pig still laughing The masters been carried back into the caveAs the saying goes third time luckyYouve already been into the cave twice so if you go in again youre sure to rescue the master Very well then said Monkey wiping away his tears as this is the way things are I have no choice Ill have to go back inYou two dont have to worry about the luggage or the horse any more so guard the cavemouth properly The splendid Great Sage turned round and sprang into the cave This time he did no transformations but appeared in his own dharma formThis is what he was like His cheeks looked strange but his heart was strong As a monster since childhood his magic was mightyA misshapen face that looked like a saddle Eyes fiery bright with golden lightHis hairs were harder than needles of steel And striking was the pattern of his tigerskin kiltIn the sky he could scatter a myriad clouds In the sea he could stir up thousandfold wavesOnce with his strength he fought heavenly kings Putting a hundred and eight thousand warriors to flightHis title was Great Sage Equaling Heaven He was an expert with the goldbanded cudgelToday in the West he was using his powers To return to the cave and rescue SanzangJourney to the West Watch Monkey as he stops his cloud and heads straight for the evil spirits residence where he found the gates under the gate towers shutNot caring whether or not it was the right thing to do he smashed them open with one swing of his cudgel and charged insideIt was completely quiet and deserted and the Tang Priest was nowhere to be seen in the corridorThe tables and chairs in the pavilion and all the utensils had completely disappearedAs the cave measured over a hundred miles around the evil spirit had very many hiding places in itThis was where she had brought the Tang Priest the previous time only to be found by Monkey so after catching him this time she had moved him elsewhere in case Monkey came looking for him againNot knowing where they had gone Monkey stamped his foot and beat his chest with fury letting himself call out at the top of his voice MasterYou are a Tang Sanzang formed in misfortune a pilgrim monk molded from disaster I know the way well enough Why isnt he hereWhere should I look for him Just when he was howling with impatience and anxiety his nose was struck by a whiff of incense which brought him back to himself This incense smoke is coming from the back he thought so I suppose they must be there He strode in at the back his cudgel in his hand but still saw no sign of lifeWhat he did see were three side rooms Near the back wall was a lacquered offertory table carved with dragons on which stood a gilt incenseburner From this came heavily scented incense smokeOn the table was a tablet inscribed with letters of gold to which the offerings were being made The letters read Honoured Father Heavenly King Li In a slightly inferior position was written Honoured Elder Brother Third Prince Nezha The sight filled Monkey with delightHe stopped searching for the monster and the Tang Priest rubbed his cudgel between his fingers to make it as small as an embroidery needle tucked it inside his ear gathered up the tablet and the incenseburner with a sweep of his arms and went straight back out through the gates on his cloudsHe was still chortling with glee when he reached the mouth of the caveWhen Pig and Friar Sand heard him they unblocked the entrance to the cave and greeted him with You look so happy you must have saved the master elder brother No need for us to save him Monkey replied with a smileWe can ask this tablet for him But that tablet isnt an evil spirit and it cant talk said Pig so how can you ask it for him Look at it said Monkey putting the tablet on the groundWhen Friar Sand went up to look he saw Honoured Father Heavenly King Li and Honoured Elder Brother Third Prince Nezha written on itWhat does this mean Friar Sand askedThe evil spirit makes offerings to it Monkey repliedWhen I charged into her place there was nobody about only this tabletI think she must be a daughter of Heavenly King Li and the younger sister of Prince Nezha who so longed for the lower world that she pretended to be an evil spirit and carried our master offSo who better to demand the master fromYou two keep guard here while I take this tablet up to Heaven to lodge a complaint with the Jade Emperor and force those heavenly kings to give our master back Brother said Pig theres a saying that goes Bring a capital charge and pay for it with your own head You can only do a thing like that if youre in the rightBesides a case in the celestial court isnt something to be started lightly Youd better tell me what sort of case youre going to bring I know what Im going to do Monkey repliedIm going to produce this tablet and incenseburner as evidence and submit a written deposition too What will you write in your deposition Pig asked himWill you tell me Journey to the West To this Brother Monkey replied The complainant Sun Wukong whose age is stated in this document is the disciple of the monk Tang Sanzang who is going from the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western HeavenHe submits a complaint that an imitation evil spirit has committed a kidnap Li Jing the Pagodacarrying Heavenly King and his son Prince Nezha have been slack in controlling their womens quarters He has allowed his daughter to run away and turn into an evil spirit in the Bottomless Cave in Mount Pitfall where she has lured countless deluded people to their deathsShe has now carried my master into a remote corner where he cannot be foundIf I had not submitted this complaint I would have been deeply worried that the heavenly king and his son in their wickedness had deliberately incited his daughter to become a spirit and cause general disasterI beg Your Majesty in your mercy to summon the heavenly king to attend a hearing bring the demon under control and deliver my master I would be deeply grateful if Your Majesty would determine the correct penalty for this offenceThis is my respectful submission When Pig and Friar Sand heard this they said with delight Brother youre bound to win if you submit so reasonable a complaintBe as quick as you canIf you lose any time you may be too late to stop the evil spirit killing our master Ill hurry said Brother Monkey Ill hurryIll be back in the time it takes to cook rice at the longest or to make a cup of tea if Im quick With one bound the splendid Great Sage carried the tablet and the incenseburner straight up by auspicious cloud to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven where the Heavenly Kings Powerful and Protector of the Nation greeted him with bows letting him in and not daring to block his wayHe went straight to the Hall of Universal Radiance where the four heavenly teachers Zhang Ge Xu and Qiu showed him great courtesy and asked Why are you here Great Sage Ive got a complaint here Monkey repliedThere are a couple of people I want to lodge a complaint against The scoundrel thought the appalled heavenly teachers who can he be wanting to sue They had no choice but to lead him to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and submit their report to the Jade Emperor who ordered that Monkey be summoned hiMonkey then put down the tablet and the incenseburner bowed to the emperor and presented his complaintThis was taken by the Ancient Immortal Ge who spread it out on the emperors tableWhen the emperor had read it through from the beginning and learned what had happened he approved the deposition wrote an imperial rescript on it and sent the Great White Planet the Metal Planet Changgeng to the Cloud Tower Palace to summon the Pagodacarrying Heavenly King Li to the imperial presence Monkey then stepped forward and submitted this memorialI beg that the Heavenly Sovereign will punish him effectively as otherwise there will be further trouble Let the complainant go too the Jade Emperor orderedWhat me said MonkeyHis Majesty has issued his decree said the Four Heavenly Teachers so you go with the Metal Planet Monkey then went with the planet by cloudThey were soon at the Cloud Tower Palace the residence of the heavenly kingThe Metal Star saw a page standing at the palace gatesJourney to the West Recognizing the planet the boy went inside to report The Great White Planet is here The heavenly king then came out to welcome the planetSeeing that the planet was carrying a decree from the Jade Emperor the heavenly king ordered incense to be burned before turning round and seeing to his fury that Monkey had come tooWhy do you think he was furiousWhen Monkey had made great havoc in heaven all those years earlier the Jade Emperor had appointed the heavenly king as Demonquelling High Marshal and Prince Nezha as Great God of the Three Altars of the Seas to lead the heavenly troops and subdue Monkey They had been repeatedly worsted in battleIt was resentment at this defeat five hundred years earlier that goaded him to furyOld Changgeng he said to the planet showing his irritation what kind of decree have you brought here It is a case that the Great Sage Sun has brought against you the planet repliedThe heavenly king had been in a bad enough temper before this but the word case provoked a thunderous outburst of furyWhat case has he got against me He accuses you of masquerading as an evil spirit and kidnapping the planet saidWill you please burn incense and read it for yourself Seething with anger the heavenly king had an incense table set up looked into the sky as he thanked the emperor for his grace made his obeisances opened out the decree and read it throughWhen he saw what it contained he thumped the incense table and exclaimed That ape has trumped up a pack of lies Please keep your temper the planet repliedA tablet and an incenseburner have been submitted to His Majesty as evidenceHe says it was your daughter who did it All I have are my three sons and a single daughter said the heavenly kingMy elder son Jinzha serves the Tathagata Buddha as a Vanguard Guardian of the Law DharmaMy second son Moksa is a disciple of Guanyin in the Southern OceanMy third son Nezha stays with me as my escort at all timesMy daughter Zhenying is only six and an innocent child She could not possibly have become an evil spiritIf you dont believe me Ill carry her out to show youThis ape is really a disgraceNever mind that Im one of the most distinguished elder statesmen in heaven and been given the authority to cut heads off before reporting to the throne not even an ordinary commoner in the lower world should be falsely accusedAs the Legal Code says the penalty for false accusation is three grades higher than the crime alleged He then ordered his underlings to fetch demonbinding rope and tie Monkey upThe Mighty Miracle God General Fishbelly and General Yaksha who were drawn up outside the court rushed on Monkey and tied him upHeavenly King Li the Metal Planet pleaded please dont invite disasterI have come here with him from the imperial presence under orders from His Majesty to summon youThat rope of yours is heavy and it could very quickly hurt him badly or strangle him Metal Star the heavenly king replies theres no way Im going to stand for his false trumpedup chargeWont you take a seat while I fetch my demonhacking sword to kill this ape withIll report to His Majesty with you after Ive done that At the sight of the heavenly king fetching the sword the planet trembled with terror Journey to the West Youve made a terrible mistake he said to Monkey A case before the emperor isnt to be lightly startedYouve brought this disaster on yourself by not finding the facts out properly and youll die for it This is terrible Monkey was completely unafraidDont worry old man he said with a chuckle this is nothing This has always been my way of doing businessI lose out at first and win in the end Before the words were all out of his mouth the heavenly kings sword swung down towards Monkeys headBut Prince Nezha was already in front of Monkey parrying the blow with his great sword used for cutting men in half at the waist and calling Please calm your temper father This greatly shocked the heavenly kingVery strangeIf a son used his broadsword to block his fathers cutlass he ought to be bawled out so why did Nezhas father turn pale with shockNow when this son had been born to the heavenly king the word Ne was written on the palm of his left hand and Zha on his right one which was why he was called NezhaWhen only three days old the young prince had caused great trouble by plunging into the sea to clean himself He had kicked the water crystal palace down captured a dragon and insisted on pulling its sinews out to make a beltOn learning about this the heavenly king had been so worried about the disastrous consequences that he had decided to kill the boyThis had made Nezha so indignant that he had seized a sword cut off his flesh and returned it to his mother then picked his bones clean and given them back to his fatherHaving returned his fathers seed and his mothers blood he had taken his soul straight off to the Western Paradise to appeal to the BuddhaWhen the Buddha who was expounding the sutras to all the Bodhisattvas heard a call of Help from within his curtained and jeweled canopy he had looked with his wise eyes and seen that it was Nezhas soulHe had made Nezha bones out of green lotus root and clothes from lotus leaves then recited the spell to revive the dead Thus it was that Nezha had come back to lifeHe had used his divine ability and great magical powers to subdue ninetysix caves of demons through dharmaAfter this Nezha had wanted to kill his father in revenge for having had to pick the flesh off his own bones leaving the heavenly king with no choice but to beg the help of the Tathagata BuddhaFor the sake of harmony the Buddha had given the heavenly king an intricatelymade golden AsYouWill reliquary pagoda in each story of which were Buddhas radiant with splendorThe Buddha called on Nezha to regard these Buddhas as his father thereby ending the hatred between themThis is why Heavenly King Li is called the PagodabearerAs the heavenly king was at home off duty that day and not carrying the pagoda he was afraid that Nezha was set on revenge This was why he turned pale with terrorSo he turned his hand back to take the golden pagoda from its stand and hold it as he asked Nezha What do you want to say to me sonWhy have you parried my sword with your broadsword Throwing his broadsword down Nezha kowtowed to his father as he replied Father Your Majesty there is a daughter of our family in the lower world My boy the heavenly king replied I have only had you four children Where could I have got another daughter from You have forgotten Your Majesty Nezha repliedThe girl was once an evil spiritThree hundred years ago she became a monster She stole and ate some of the Tathagatas incense flowers and candles on Vulture Peak and the Tathagata sent us to capture her with heavenly soldiersWhen she was caught she should have been beaten to death but the Tathagata said Journey to the West Raise fish in deep water but never catch them Feed deer in the depths of the mountains in the hope of eternal life So we spared her lifeIn her gratitude she bowed to you as her adoptive father Your Majesty and to me as her elder brother She set up a tablet to us in the lower world to burn incenseI never imagined shed become an evil spirit again and try to ruin the Tang Priest Now Sun the Novice has trailed her to her den and brought the tablet up here to use in a case against us before the Jade EmperorShe is your adopted daughter not my real sister This came as a terrible shock to the heavenly king Son he said I really had forgottenWhats she called She has three names the prince replied Where she originally came from she was called Goldnosed Whitehaired Mouse SpiritThen she was called HalfBodhisattvaGuanyin because she had stolen the incense flowers and candlesWhen she was forgiven and sent down to the lower world she changed her name again and became Lady Earthgusher Only then did the heavenly king come to his sensesHe put his pagoda down and started to untie Monkey himself At this Monkey started playing it upDont you dare try to untie me he saidIf you want to do something you can carry me roped up as I am to see the emperorThen Ill win my case The heavenly king felt weak from terror and the prince could say nothing Everybody fell backThe Great Sage meanwhile was rolling about and playing it up insisting that the heavenly king take him to the emperorThe heavenly king could do nothing except beg the Metal Planet to put in a good word for himThere is an old saying the planet replied that one should always be lenientYou went too far you tied him up and were going to kill himThe monkey is a notorious troublemaker How do you expect me to deal with himFrom what your worthy son has said she is your daughter even though adopted rather than your own and a child by adoption is especially dearHowever one argues it you are guilty Surely you can find some way of putting in a good word for me and helping me off the hook venerable planet said the heavenly kingI would like to end the quarrel between you the planet replied but I have never done him a good turn that I can remind him of Tell him how it was you who proposed that he should be amnestied and given an official post said the heavenly kingThe Metal Planet did then step forward stroke Brother Monkey and say Great Sage wont you let us take the rope off before going to see the emperor just for my sake No need to bother old man Monkey repliedIm a good roller and I can roll all the way there Youve got no decent feelings you monkey said the planet with a smileI did you some good turns in the old days but you wont do this little thing for me Journey to the West What good turn did you ever do me Monkey askedWhen you were a monster on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit you subdued tigers and dragons forcibly removed yourself from the register of death and assembled hordes of fiends to run wild and wreak havoc Heaven wanted to have you arrested It was only because I made strong representations that an edict of amnesty and recruitment was issued and you were summoned to Heaven to be appointed Protector of the HorsesYou drank some of the Jade Emperors wine of immortality and it was only because I made strong representations again that you were given the title of Great Sage Equaling HeavenBut you refused to know your place You stole the peaches and the wine and robbed Lord Lao Zi of his elixir and so it went on till you ended up in a state of no death and no birthIf it hadnt been for me youd never have got where you are today As the ancients put it Monkey replied Dont even share a grave with an old man when youre deadall hell do is complain I was just a Protector of the Horses who made havoc in the heavenly palace there was nothing much apart from thatOh well never mind Ill show you a bit of consideration as youre such an old manHe can untie me himself Only then did the heavenly king dare step forward untie the rope and ask Brother Monkey to dress and take the seat of honour while they all took it in turn to pay their respects to himOld man Monkey said to the Metal Planet what about it thenI told you I lose first and win later Thats my way of doing businessMake him hurry and see the emperordelay could be disastrous for my master Dont be impatient the Metal Planet saidAfter everything thats happened we should take a cup of tea If you drink his tea accept favours from him take a bribe to let a criminal escape and treat imperial edicts with disrespect I wonder what youll be charged with Monkey repliedI wont stop for tea the Metal Planet replied I wont stop for teaYoure even trying to frame meHurry up Heavenly King Li we must be on our way The heavenly king dared not go for fear that Monkey would concoct some unfounded story and start playing it up if Monkey started talking wildly he would be unable to argue against him So once again the heavenly king pleaded with the Metal Planet to put in a good word for himI have a suggestion to make the planet said to MonkeyWill you follow it Ive already agreed about being tied up and hacked at Monkey replied What else have you to sayTell me Tell meIf its a good idea Ill follow it and if it isnt dont blame me Fight a lawsuit for one day and itll go on for ten said the Metal PlanetYou brought a case before the emperor saying that the evil spirit is the heavenly kings daughter and the heavenly king says she isntYou two will argue endlessly in front of His Majesty but I tell you that a day in heaven is a year in the lower worldIn that year the evil spirit will have your master under her control in the cave and she wont just have married him By then there may have been a happy event and she may have had a little baby monkThen your great enterprise will be ruined Yes thought Monkey his head bowed when I left Pig and Friar Sand I said Id be back in the time it takes to cook a meal at longest and at quickest before they could make a cup of tea Ive been ages already and it might be too lateOld man he said aloud Ill take your adviceHow do we obey this imperial decree Have Heavenly King Li muster his troops and go down with you to subdue the demon the Metal Planet replied while I report back to the emperor Journey to the West What will you say Monkey askedIll report that the plaintiff has absconded and that the defendant is therefore excused the planet repliedThats very fine said Monkey with a grin I show you consideration and you accuse me of abscondingTell him to muster his troops and wait for me outside the Southern Gate of Heaven while you and I report back on our mission If he says anything when hes there Ill be accused of treason exclaimed the heavenly king with terrorWhat do you take me for asked MonkeyIm a real man Once Ive given my word a team of horses couldnt take it backId never slander you The heavenly king thanked Monkey who went with the Metal Planet to report back on their mission while the heavenly king mustered his heavenly troops and went straight to the outside of the Southern Gate of HeavenWhen the Metal Planet and Monkey had their audience with the Jade Emperor they said The person who has trapped the Tang Priest is the Goldennosed Whitehaired Mouse turned spirit She has fraudulently set up a tablet to the heavenly king and his sonAs soon as he found out the heavenly king mustered his troops to go and subdue the demonWe beg your Celestial Majesty to forgive him Once the Jade Emperor knew what had happened he dropped the prosecution in his heavenly mercyMonkey then went back on his cloud to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven where he found the heavenly king and the prince waiting for him with their heavenly soldiers draw up on paradeThe heavenly commanders met the Great Sage amid blustering winds and seething mists then they all took their clouds straight down to Mount PitfallPig and Friar Sand were wideeyed at the sight of the heavenly hosts coming down with Brother MonkeyGreeting the heavenly king with due courtesy the idiot said We have put you to great trouble in coming here You dont realize Marshal Tian Peng the heavenly king replied that it was because my son and I accepted a jossstick from her that the evil spirit in her wickedness captured your masterPlease dont be angry with us for being so longIs this Mount PitfallWhere is the entrance to the cave I know the way very well by now said MonkeyThis cave is called the Bottomless Cave and it measures over a hundred miles around The evil spirit has a great many holes in itLast time my master was held in the gate tower with double eaves but its deadly quiet now Theres not even the shadow of a demonI dont know where shes taken him to now To this the heavenly king replied No matter how many the tricks she may try Shell never escape from the nets of the sky Well think of something else when we get to the cave entrance Journey to the West They all then started out and after they had gone three or four miles they reached the great rockThis is it Monkey said pointing at the entrance that was no larger than the mouth of a large jarYoull never capture the tigers cub unless you go into the tigers lair observed the heavenly kingWho dares go in first Ill go said MonkeyNo Ill go first objected Prince NezhaI was the one the emperor ordered to capture the demon The idiot then started acting tough shouting It ought to be me first Stop that din said the heavenly kingIll decide The Great Sage Sun and the prince will go down with the soldiers while we three hold the entrance Then well have a coordinated action inside and outside which will make it impossible for her to find her way up to heaven or go further underground That will show her a bit of our powers Yes sir they all said in assentWatch as Monkey and Prince Nezha slip into the cave at the head of their troopsAs they rode their clouds they looked around and saw that it really was a fine cave The pair of sun and moon as before A vista of rivers and hills like the other worldWarm mists spread over pools and wells of pearl Much more there is to admire down hereCrimson houses painted halls Red cliffs green fields Willows in the spring and lotos in the autumn A rare and splendid cave heavenAn instant later they brought their clouds to a halt and went straight to the mansion where the evil spirit had lived beforeThey went from gateway to gateway in their search yelling and shouting as they went deeper and deeper inside trying one place after the next All the grass for a hundred miles was trampled away But where was the evil spirit Where was SanzangThe wicked beast everyone was saying she must have got out of this cave ages agoShell be far away by now What they did not know was that down underneath a dark corner in the Southeast of the cave there was another smaller cave where behind a pair of tiny gates there was a tiny cottage with flowers growing in pots and a few canes of bamboo beside the eaves The atmosphere was dark and heavy with fragranceThis was Journey to the West where the evil spirit had carried Sanzang and was going to force him to marry herShe was sure that Monkey would never find them none of them realized that her union was fated to be thwartedThe junior devils were jabbering away in a great crush when a bolder one among them stretched outside the cave for a look around only for her head to butt into a heavenly soldier who shouted Theyre here At this Monkey flew into a rage grasped the goldbanded cudgel and charged straight down inThe cave was tiny and all the demons from the big cave were in there so that when Prince Nezha sent his heavenly soldiers crowding into the attack not a single one of the demons could hideMonkey found the Tang Priest the dragon horse and the baggageThe senior demon was at her wits end All she could do was to kowtow to Prince Nezha begging him to spare her lifeWe are here to arrest you at the Jade Emperors command Prince Nezha replied which is not something to be treated lightlyMy father and I were nearly in terrible trouble because of you He then shouted at the top of his voice Heavenly soldiers fetch demonbinding ropeTie all those evil spirits up The senior demon too had to suffer for a whileThey all went back out of the cave together by cloudMonkey was chuckling with delight when the heavenly king withdrew his guard from the mouth of the cave and greeted Monkey with the words Now I can meet your master Many thanks said Monkey many thanks and he led Sanzang to bow in gratitude to the heavenly king and the princeFriar Sand and Pig were all for chopping the senior devil into tiny pieces but the heavenly king said She was arrested at the Jade Emperors command and must not be mistreatedWe must go to report back on our mission The heavenly king and Prince Nezha at the head of their heavenly troops and divine officers escorted the evil spirit as a prisoner to report to the heavenly court and receive the emperors verdict on herMeanwhile Brother Monkey guarded the Tang Priest while Friar Sand collected the luggage and Pig went over to the horse and invited the master to ride Then they all set out along their way againIndeed The silken net had been cut the golden sea dried up The precious lock undone and troubles left behindIf you do not know what lay in store for them on their way ahead listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Indestructible Proteges of the Buddha Complete Enlightenment The Dharma King Comes to the Truth Through His Own Nature Journey to the West The story tells how Tang Sanzang kept his masculine essence intact and escaped from the terrible snare of mist and flowersAs he headed Westwards with Brother Monkey he did not notice that it was already summerwarm breezes were beginning to blow and the early summer rain was falling It was a beautiful sight Dark is the shade under tender green In the gentle breeze the swallows lead their youngNew lotus leaves are opening on the ponds Elegant bamboo is gradually revivingThe fragrant plants join their blue to the sky Mountain flowers carpet all the groundBeside the stream the rushes are like swords The fiery pomegranate blossom makes the picture even more magnificentAs the master and his three disciples traveled along enduring the heat they suddenly noticed two rows of tall willows from under the shade of which an old woman emerged leaning on a small boy Dont go any further monk she called out Stop your horse and go back East as soon as you canThe road West leads nowhere This gave Sanzang so bad a fright that he sprang off the horse made a gesture of greeting and said Venerable Bodhisattva in the words of the ancients The seas breadth allows the fish to leap The skys emptiness lets birds fly How could there possibly be no way to the West To this the old woman replied pointing Westwards If you go that way you will come to the capital of Dharmadestructia in a couple of milesThe king formed a hatred of Buddhism in an earlier existence and in his present life he is punishing it without just causeTwo years ago he made a monstrous vow to kill ten thousand Buddhist monks In that time hes killed  unknown monks in successionHes just waiting for four famous monks to make up his ten thousand so that he will fulfil the vowIf you go into the city you will be throwing away your lives for nothing At the sound of this Sanzang was so terrified that he shivered and shook as he replied Venerable Bodhisattva I am deeply moved by your great kindness and infinitely grateful tooBut tell me is there a suitable way I could take that does not go into the city Journey to the West Theres no way round the old woman replied with a laugh no way roundThe only way youll get past it is if you can fly At this Pig started shooting his mouth off from where he stood beside themDont try to put us off We can all fly Monkeys fiery eyes with their golden pupils really could distinguish good from evil and he saw that the old woman and the little boy on whom she was leaning were in fact the Bodhisattva Guanyin and the page SudhanaHe hastily flung himself to the ground and began to kowtow calling out Bodhisattva your disciple failed to welcome youIm sorry The Bodhisattva then rose slowly on her multicolored cloud so startling the venerable elder that his legs gave way under him and he kowtowed as he knelt there for all he was worthPig and Friar Sand also fell to their knees in alarm and kowtowed to heavenA moment later she was heading straight back to the Southern Sea amid auspicious cloudsMonkey then got up and supported his master as he said Get up pleaseThe Bodhisattvas already gone back to her island Wukong Sanzang said if you knew she was the Bodhisattva why did you not say so before You ask too many questions Monkey replied with a grinWhen I started kowtowing wasnt that early enough It was lucky the Bodhisattva told us that Dharmadestructia where they kill monks is ahead of us Pig and Friar Sand said to MonkeyWhatever are we to do Dont be afraid idiot Monkey repliedWeve come to no harm from any of the vicious demons and evil monsters weve met already or in the tigers dens and dragons pools weve been inThis is just a country of ordinary people Whats there to be so scared ofThe only thing is that we cant stay here Its getting late in the day and some of the villagers are coming back from market in the town It will be no good if they see were monks and raise a hue and cryWed better take the master away from the main road to some quiet and secluded spot where we can discuss things Sanzang accepted Monkeys suggestion and they slipped away from the main road to a hollow in the ground where they sat downBrother said Monkey you two look after the master while I turn myself into something and go into town to take a look around Ill find a side road that we can get away along tonight Disciple said Sanzang dont take this lightly The royal law is implacableYou must be careful Dont worry said Monkey with a smile dont worryI can cope This said the Great Sage leapt whistling up into the airIt was very strange No rope to hold on to above No pole to support him belowOthers are all like their parents Journey to the West But the weight of his bones was lowAs he stood in the clouds looking down he saw that the city was full of the most happy and auspicious atmosphereWhat a splendid place Monkey saidWhy are they trying to destroy the Dharma here He looked around for a while and in the gathering dusk he saw Bright lights at the crossroads Incense and bells in the ninefold hallThe seven brightest stars shone in the blue heavens And the travelers stopped moving in all eight directionsFrom the army barracks The painted bugle could just be heard In the drum tower The copper waterclock began to dripAll around the evening mists were dense Cold fog was thick in the marketsTwo by two the couples went to their beds As the bright moons disk was rising in the EastIf I went down into the streets to look for our way with a face like this he thought anyone I saw would be sure I was a monkId better change He made a spell with his hands said the magic words shook himself and turned into a moth the sort that flies into the lantern A tiny body a pair of delicate wings Who puts out the lamp and flies into the candle when seeking the lightFormed by changing its own original body It makes its magic response in grass thats decayingLoving the burning light of the candles flame Journey to the West Endlessly flying around it with never a pause The purpleclad moth with its scented wings drives off the fireflies What it likes best is the windless calm of the nightWatch him as he flutters and flies straight to the main streets and the markets keeping close to the eaves and the corners of the buildings he passesAs he was flying along he noticed an angled row of houses on a corner with a lantern hanging above each doorwayThey must be celebrating the Lantern Festival here he thoughtWhy else is that line of lighted lanterns there Stiffening his wings and flying up for a closer look he saw that on a square lantern outside the middle house was written Accommodation for Commercial Travelers with Wang the Seconds Inn beneath it Only then did Monkey realize that this was an innStretching his head forward for a closer look he saw eight or nine men inside who had all eaten their supper taken off their clothes and hats washed their hands and feet and gone to bedThe master will get through Monkey thought with secret delightHow did he know thatBecause he was having a wicked idea he would wait till they were all asleep then steal their clothes and hats so that he and his companions could go into the city dressed as laymenOh dear This was one of those things that dont turn out as you want them toWhile Monkey was still thinking about his plan Wang the Second went up to the merchants and said Please be vigilant gentlemen We have villains here as well as decent peopleYou must all be careful about your clothes and luggage As you can imagine the travelling merchants were all very vigilant and the innkeepers advice made them more cautious than everSo they all got out of bed and said Youre quite right host We travelers have a hard time Were always worried that if theres some emergency when were asleep we may not wake up and if things go wrong were in a messYoud better take all our clothes hats and bags and look after them for us insideTomorrow morning you can give them back to us when we get up Wang the Second then took all the clothes he could find into his own roomMonkey anxiously spread his wings flew in there and landed on the hat stand from where he saw Wang the Second take the lantern down from the door lower the blinds and shut the door and window Only then did he go into his bedroom undress and lie downNow Wang the Second had a wife and two children who were crying and making a noise in no hurry to sleepWangs wife then started mending a torn piece of clothing so that she too was still awakeIf I have to wait till that woman stops working and goes to sleep thought Monkey Ill be keeping the master waiting too He then started worrying that if he left it till much later the city gates would be shut so he lost patience and flew down into the flame of the lampIt was indeed a case of He was ready to die when he dived at the blaze And with brows scarred by fire to live out his daysJourney to the West Having extinguished the lamp he shook himself and turned into a rat who gave a couple of squeaks jumped down grabbed hats and clothes and went outsideOld man the woman said with alarm this is terribleA rats turned into a spirit When Monkey heard this he used another trick blocking the doorway and yelling at the top of his voice That womans talking nonsense Wang the Second Ignore herIm not a rat turned spiritAs a decent man I dont do underhanded things Im the Great Sage Equaling Heaven come down to earth to protect the Tang Priest while he goes to fetch the scriptures from the Western HeavenIve come to borrow these clothes as a disguise for my master because your king is so wickedIll bring them back soon when were out of the city Once Wang the Second heard this he scrambled out of bed and started groping around the floor in the dark He was in such a rush that when he got hold of his trousers he thought they were his shirt there was no way he could put them on no matter how he triedBy now the Great Sage had used lifting magic to escape on his cloud which he turned round to go straight back to the hollow by the roadSanzang was looking out for him fixedly by the bright light of the moon and the stars and as soon as he saw Monkey approaching he called out Can we get through the capital of Dharmadestructia disciple Coming up and laying the clothes down in front of him Monkey replied Master you wont get through Dharmadestructia as a monk Brother said Pig who do you think youre making things hard for Its easy to stop being a monkAll you have to do is stop shaving your head for six months and let your hair grow We cant wait six months Monkey repliedWere going to turn into laymen right now But thats a completely ridiculous thing to say said a shocked PigWere all monks now and if we turned into laymen straight away we wouldnt be able to wear hatsEven if we could pull them tight enough at the edges weve got no hair to tie the string at the top to Stop fooling about Sanzang shouted and be seriousWhat do you really have in mind Ive had a good look at this city Master Monkey replied and although the king is a wicked one who kills monks he is a true son of heaven There is an auspicious glow and a happy atmosphere above the cityI know my way round the streets now and I can understand and talk the local languageIve just borrowed these hats and clothes from an inn for us to dress ourselves up as laymen in Well go into the city put up for the night get up at the fourth watch and ask the innkeeper to fix us some vegetarian foodAt the fifth watch well go out through the gate and head West along the main roadIf we meet anyone who tries to stop us we can talk our way out of it Ill tell him we were sent by the ruler of their suzerain state The king of Dharmadestructia wont dare hold us upHell let us go on our way Our big brother has arranged things very well said Friar SandLets do as he suggests The venerable elder did indeed have no option but to take off his monastic tunic and hat and put on a laymans clothing and headwearFriar Sand changed too but Pigs head was too big for him to be able to wear a hatMonkey fetched needle and thread tore two hats open and sewed them into a single one Then he put the hat on Pigs head and found a garment big enough for him to wearFinally he dressed himself and said Gentlemen we must ban the words master and disciples on this journey Journey to the West What else can we call each other Pig asked We must talk like people who address each other as brothers Monkey repliedThe master can call himself Tang the Eldest You can be Hogg the Third and Friar Sand can be Sand the Fourth Ill be Sun the SecondBut when we are in the inn none of you must say anything Leave all the talking to meWhen they ask what line of business were in Ill say were horse dealersIll pretend that the white horse is a sample and that there are ten of us altogether of whom we four have come ahead to book rooms at an inn and sell this horseThe innkeeper will be bound to treat us well then Well be properly looked after and before we leave Ill find a piece of broken tile and turn it into silver to pay him withThen well be able to go on our way Although he was not happy about it the Tang Priest had to go along with thisThe four of them hurried to the city leading the horse and carrying the luggageAs this was a very peaceful place the city gates were still open although it was already nightThey went straight into the city and as they passed the gateway of Wang the Seconds inn they could hear shouting insidePeople were yelling My hats disappeared and My clothes have gone Pretending he did not know what this was all about Monkey took them to an inn further along on the other side of the roadThis inn was still showing its lantern so Monkey went up to the gateway and called Do you have a vacant room for us innkeeper Yes yes a woman answered from insidePlease come upstairs gentlemen Before she had finished speaking a man came out to take the horse Monkey handed him the horse to take insideHe then led the master into the building in the shadow of the lampUpstairs there were tables and chairs conveniently arranged and when the window was opened they all sat down in the clear moonlightWhen someone came with a lighted lamp Monkey blocked the doorway blew it out and said No need for a lamp on a bright night like this No sooner had the man with the lamp gone down than a maid came up with four bowls of teaMonkey took the bowls from her only for her to be followed by a woman who looked to be about fiftysix or fiftyseven coming up the stairsStanding beside Monkey she asked Where are you gentlemen fromWhat fine goods do you have Were from the North Monkey replied and weve got a few poor horses to sell Youre very young to be a horse dealer the woman saidThis gentleman is Tang the Eldest Monkey explained this is Hogg the Third and this is Sand the fourthIm Sun the Second an apprentice But your surnames are all different said the woman with a smileYes Monkey replied our surnames are different but we all live together There are ten of us brothers altogether and we four have come ahead to fix our board and lodgingThe other six have found a place outside the city to stay tonight It would have been awkward for them to come into the city as theyve got a herd of horsesTheyll come in tomorrow morning when weve fixed some accommodationWe wont go home till weve sold the horses How many horses are there in your herd the woman askedOver a hundred of all ages Monkey replied Theyre all like that one of ours except that they come in different colours Journey to the West MrSun the woman said with a laugh you really know how to travel You should have come straight hereno other inn would be able to put you upWe have a big courtyard well supplied with troughs and tethering posts and plenty of fodder too We could feed several hundred horses here Theres just one thing I should mentionIve been keeping this inn for many years and its quite well knownMy late husband was called Zhao but Im afraid he died long ago so this is now called Widow Zhaos InnWe have three classes of entertainment for our guestsLets get sordid money matters out of the way then we can be more civilized later The first thing is to discuss the tariffs and agree on one so that we know where we stand when its time to settle the accounts Quite right Monkey repliedWhat are your three classes of entertainmentAs the saying goes Your tariffs may be low your tariffs may be dear But treat us all the same who come from far or near What do your tariffs involveCould you explain them to me We have first second and thirdclass tariffs the old woman repliedThe first class is a banquet with five kinds of fruit and five different dishes The tables are set with confectionery lions and immortals fighting Two gentlemen share a table and there are young ladies to sing to them and sleep with them It costs half an ounce of silver per head the price of the room included Id agree to that Monkey repliedWhere we come from half an ounce wouldnt even pay for a girl For the secondclass tariff the woman continued you all eat from the same dishes of food and we provide fruit and warm wine that you help yourselves to in your drinking games No young ladies are provided and it costs one fifth of an ounce of silver each Id agree to that too Monkey repliedWhat about the third class I wouldnt like to discuss it with such distinguished gentlemen as yourselves she repliedNo harm in telling us about it Monkey replied so that we can choose what suits us best Nobody waits on you in the third class she said and we provide a big pot of rice for you to eat from as you willWhen youre full theres straw for you to spread out on the ground and sleep on where it suits youAt dawn you give us a few coppers for the rice and I can assure you we wont argue about how much Were in luck said Pig were in luck Thats the sort of deal I likeIll eat my fill from the cauldron then have a bloody good sleep in front of the stove What nonsense brother said MonkeyWeve earned an ounce or two of silver on our travelsGive us the firstclass treatment Make some good tea the woman said with great delight and tell the kitchen to get the food ready quickly She then went downstairs calling out Kill chickens and geese and boil up some pickled meat for them to have with their rice Journey to the West Then she shouted Kill a pig and a sheepWhat cant be eaten today can be served tomorrowGet some good wine Use the best white rice and make some pancakes with white flour When Sanzang heard all this from upstairs he said Whatever shall we do Sun the SecondTheyre going to slaughter chickens geese a pig and a sheep If they bring us all these we wont be able to eat them as were all vegetarians Ive got an idea said Monkey and he stamped in the doorway and called out MrsZhao come up here What instructions do you have for me sir she askedDont kill any living creatures today Were eating vegetarian food today Monkey repliedAre you gentlemen permanent vegetarians or just vegetarians for this month asked the woman in surpriseNeither replied MonkeyWere vegetarians on gengshen days Todays one so we have to eat meatless foodBut after the third watch tonight itll be a xinyou day and the restrictions wont applyKill them tomorrowLay on some vegetarian food today and make it firstclass This made the woman happier than ever Dont slaughter anything she said hurrying downstairs dont slaughter anythingFetch some treeear fungus Fujian bamboo shoots beancurd and wheat gluten Pick some green vegetables in the garden make vermicelli soup steam some brad rolls boil more white rice and make some scented tea Now the cooks were experts because they cooked every day so that everything was ready in an instant to be set out upstairsThey also had some confectioneries of lions and immortals that were already made for the four travelers to eat their fill ofWhen the question was asked Would you like some mild wine Brother Monkey replied Eldest Brother Tang wont have any but the rest of us will have a few cups The widow then fetched a jug of warm wineWhen drinks had been poured out for the three of them they heard the sound of banging against wooden boardsHas some furniture fallen over downstairs missus Monkey askedNo the woman replied Its some retainers from my farm who arrived late this evening with rent rice We let them sleep downstairsAs we were shortstaffed when you gentlemen arrived I told them to take the sedanchairs to the brothel to fetch some young ladies to keep you company They must have hit the underneath of the floorboards with the chairpoles You mentioned that before Monkey said But dont send for them nowTodays a fast day and besides our brothers arent here yetTheyll be here tomorrow for sure Then we can all send for some callgirls and have a good time in your excellent establishment before we sell our horses and go What good men the woman said what good menThat way youll all stay friends and you wont waste your energy Then she ordered that the sedanchairs be brought back in as the whores were not to be fetchedThe four of them finished their wine and food the utensils were cleared away and the meal was overWhere are we going to sleep Sanzang whispered in Monkeys earUpstairs Monkey replied Journey to the West Too dangerous Sanzang repliedWe have all had so hard a journey that we may well fall fast asleep If any of the inn people come in to tidy up and our hats have rolled off they will see our bald heads realize that we are monks and raise a hue and cry That would be a disaster Youre right said Monkey going out to stamp his foot again What instructions do you have this time MrSun the woman asked coming upstairs once moreWhere are we to sleep Monkey askedUpstairs is best she replied There are no mosquitoes and theres a South wind Open the windows wide and youll sleep beautifully We wont be able to said Monkey Our MrHogg the Third has a touch of gout Mr Sand the Fourth has some rheumatism in his shoulder Brother Tang can only sleep in the dark and I dont like the light myselfSo this is no place for us to sleep As the woman went downstairs leaning on the banisters and sighing her daughter who was carrying a child in her arms came up to her and said Mother as the saying goes Be stuck on a sandbank for ten days then said past nine sandbanks in one Its too hot now to be doing much business but once autumn begins well have more than we can handleWhat are you sighing like that for Its not because business is slack daughter the older woman repliedI was just going to close the inn up this evening when four horse dealers came and took a room They wanted the firstclass tariffI was hoping to make a little silver out of them and Im sighing because we wont earn muchtheyre fasting As theyve already eaten they cant very well go to another inn the daughter replied And well be able to make money out of them when we serve them meat and wine tomorrow Theyre all poorly the older woman replied and want somewhere dark to sleep because they dont like drafts or lightAll the rooms in the inn have got missing tiles so where am I going to find somewhere dark for themItd be best to write off the cost of the meal and tell them to stay somewhere else But we do have somewhere dark in the house mother her daughter replied where theres no draft and no lightItll do splendidly Where the older woman askedThe big trunk that father had made when he was still alive the daughter replied Its four feet wide seven feet long and three feet high and big enough for seven people to sleep inTell them to sleep in the trunk I dont know whether itll do said the older womanIll ask themSun if you wont have our poky little room theres nowhere darker here than our big trunk Itll keep out light and drafts So why dont you sleep in the trunk Splendid Monkey repliedShe then told several of the retainers to carry the trunk out and open the lid while inviting her guests to come downstairsMonkey led the master and Friar Sand carried the luggage as they went to the trunk following in the lanterns shadowThe reckless Pig was the first to climb insideFriar Sand lifted the luggage in then helped the Tang Priest in before getting in himselfWheres our horse Monkey askedJourney to the West Tied up eating hay in the stables at the back replied the servant who was attending themBring it here said Monkey and bring the trough tooTether the animal next to the trunk Only then did he get inside himself and call out Shut the lid Mrs Zhao fasten the hasp and padlock itAnd look it over for us Glue paper wherever it lets in the lightOpen it again early tomorrow morning Youre very particular the widow saidAfter that the doors were fastened and everyone went to bedThe story switches to the four of them in the chest Poor thingsThey were wearing hats the weather was very hot and it was airless and stuffyThey took off their hats and clothes and fanned themselves with their monastic hats for lack of fansThey were all crowded in next to each other and did not fall asleep till the second watchMonkey however wanted to make trouble so he stayed awake He put his hand out and gave Pig a pinch on the legThe idiot pulled his leg in and mumbled Go to sleep Weve had a hard dayWhat do you want to fool around pinching peoples hands and feet for We started by laying out five thousand ounces of silver said Monkey aloud deliberately making mischief and we sold those horses the other day for three thousand Weve got four thousand in the two bags and well sell this herd of horses for another three thousand That means well have doubled our capitalThats not bad Pig who was sleepy did not bother to reply Now the floor staff the watercarriers and the kitchen porters were in league with banditsAfter hearing Brother Monkey talking about all the money they had several of them slipped off to fetch twenty or more armed bandits to come with torches to rob the four horse tradersAs they charger in through the gates they gave Widow Zhao and her daughter such a fright that shivering and shaking they fastened the doors of their room and let the robbers take whatever they wanted outsideNow the bandits were not after the inns property but were looking for the guestsWhen they went upstairs and found no sign of them there they lit their torches and held them out while they looked all around All they could see was a large trunk in the courtyard to the bottom of which was tethered a white horse The lid was tightly locked and could not be prized openTravelling merchants all know what theyre about the bandits saidThis trunk looks so strong that its bound to be full of purses valuables and silkLets steal the horse take the trunk out of town open it up and share out whats insideThat would be the best thing wouldnt it The bandits then found some rope with which they lifted the box and carried it off swinging and swayingBrother said Pig woken up by this go to sleep Why are you rocking us Shut up Monkey repliedNobodys rocking us Sanzang and Friar Sand had been abruptly awoken too and they asked Whos carrying us Keep quiet said Monkey keep quietLet them carry us If they carry us to the Western Heaven well be saved the trouble of walking But the successful bandits were not heading WestInstead they headed towards the East of the city killing the soldiers on the city gate opening it and letting themselves outThis caused a sensation in the streets and the markets where the watchmen of all the shops reported it to the commanderinchief of the city garrison and the East city commissionerAs this was their responsibility the commanderinchief and the East city Journey to the West commissioner mustered a force of infantry cavalry and bowmen that left the city in pursuit of the banditsSeeing that resistance to so powerful a government force would have been pointless the bandits abandoned the trunk and the white horse scattered into the undergrowth and disappearedThe government troops did not catch even half a robber all they captured was the trunk and the white horse with which they returned in triumphThe commanderinchief examined the horse in the light of the lamps and saw that it was a fine one Threads of silver grew in his mane In his tail hung strands of jadeForget about Eight Chargers and dragon steeds This was steadier than the great Sushuang Its bones alone would have sold for a thousand ounces of silver It could gallop after the wind for three thousand milesWhen it climbed a mountain it merged into the clouds As it neighed at the moon it was as white as snowIt was truly a dragon from an ocean island A unicorn of Jade in the human worldThe commanderinchief rode the white horse instead of his own steed as he led his men back into the city The trunk was carried to his headquarters where he and the East city commissioner sealed it with strips of paper on which they wrote and set a guard over it till morning when they would submit a memorial to the king and request a decision on what to do with itAfter that the other troops were dismissedThe story now tells how the venerable Tang Priest was grumbling at Monkey inside the chest Ape he said youve killed me this timeIf I had been arrested outside and taken to the king of Dharmadestructia I might well have been able to put up a good argument in my defenseBut now I am here locked in this trunk I have been carried off by bandits and recaptured by the army When we are shown to the king tomorrow we will be all ready for him to put to the sword and make up his ten thousand There are people outside exclaimed MonkeyIf they open the trunk and take you out youll either be tied up or hung upIf you dont want to be tied or strung up youd better show a little patienceWhen were taken to see this deluded king tomorrow Ill definitely be able to talk my way out of things I guarantee that not one hair of yours will be harmedSo stop worrying and go back to sleep In the third watch Monkey used one of his magic powersSlipping his cudgel out he blew on it with a magic breath called Change and turned it into a triple auger with which he drilled two or three holes near the bottom of the chest forming a single larger holeHe put the auger away shook himself turned into an ant and Journey to the West crawled outThen he turned back into himself and rode his cloud straight to the palace gatesThe king was fast asleep at the time so Monkey used his Great All powerful Bodydividing MagicPlucking all the hairs out of his left arm he blew on them with a magic breath called Change and turned them into little MonkeysThen he pulled all the hairs out from his right arm blew on them with a magic breath called Change and turned them into sleepinsectsNext he recited the magic word Om and told the local deity of the place to take the little Monkeys to distribute them throughout the palace to all the officials in every office and department of government Each holder of official rank was given a sleepinsect to ensure that he or she would sleep soundly and not get upMonkey then took his goldbanded cudgel in his hands squeezed it waved it called Change treasure and turned it into over a thousand razors of the sort used for shaving the headTaking one himself he told all the little monkeys to take one each and shave the heads of everyone in the inner quarters of the palace and in all the government departments and officesThis was indeed a case of When the Dharma king would destroy it the Dharma is infinite The Dharma runs through heaven and earth opening the Great WayThe origins of ten thousand Dharmas all come down to one The features of the Three Vehicles are basically the sameHe bored through the trunk to find out the news Distributed his golden hairs to smash delusion Determined to bring the Dharma king to the true achievement To the eternal emptiness of what is not born and dies notThat night the headshaving was completed so Monkey said another spell to dismiss the local deity shook himself to bring all the hairs back to his arms then touched all the razors to turn them back into their true form as the goldbanded cudgel which he made much smaller and hid in his ear againFinally he reverted to being an ant crawled back into the trunk and went on guarding the Tang Priest in his time of dangerWhen the palace ladies in the inner quarters got up to wash and do their hair before dawn the next morning they all found that their hair had goneThe same had happened to all the eunuchs senior and junior who moved around the palaceThey all crowded to the outside of the royal bedchamber where they played music to wake the king up all holding back their tears but not daring to speakBefore long the queen in the palace woke up to find her hair gone tooWhen she hurried with lanterns to the dragon bed she found a monk sleeping in the brocade quilt at which she could restrain her tongue no longer thus awakening the kingWhen the king suddenly opened his eyes wide and saw the queens bald head he got straight out of bed and said Why are you like that my queen Youre the same Your Majesty she repliedThe king then rubbed his head which gave him such a fright that the three souls in his body groaned and his seven spirits flew off into the air Journey to the West What has happened to me he exclaimedJust when he was in this panicky state the royal consorts the palace ladies and the eunuchs young and old all fell to their knees their heads shaved bald and said Lord we have all been turned into monks At the sight of them the king wept We think this must be because of all the monks we have killed he said He then gave these ordersNone of you are to say anything about the loss of our hair as if you do the civil and military officials may slander our country and say that it has been badly governedLet us now hold court in the throne hall Now all the officials high and low in all the departments and offices of government went to court to pay their respects before dawnAs it turned out all these men had lost their hair in the night too and they all submitted memorials reporting the factAll that could be heard was The whip of silence sounding three times at the royal audience As all report that their heads have now been shavedIf you do not know what happened to the booty in the trunk that the commanderinchief had recaptured and whether the Tang Priest and his three disciples were to live or die listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Mindape is jealous of the Mother of Wood The Demon Chief Plots to Devour the Master of Dhyana The story tells how when the king held his dawn audience the civil and military officials all carried memorials Sovereign Lord they reported we beg you to forgive your servants for their lack of decorum Gentlemen the king replied you are all as courteous as everWhat lack of decorum are you showing Sovereign Lord they said we do not know why but all of your servants lost their hair last night Holding in his hand these memorials about the lost hair the king descended from his dragon throne to say to the officials Indeed we do not know why either but everyone in the palace young and old lost their hair last night King and ministers alike all wept as they said From now on we will not dare kill any more monks The king then returned to his throne and the officials took their places in their proper ranksThe king then said Let those with business here come forward from their ranks to reportIf there is no other business the curtain may be rolled up and the audience ended The commanderinchief of the capitals garrison then moved forward from the ranks of military officials and the East city commissioner moved forward from the ranks of the civil officials to kowtow at the steps of the throne and report We were patrolling the city on Your Majestys orders last night when we recaptured a Journey to the West trunk of bandits booty and a white horseAs we do not dare take unauthorized action over these we beg Your Majesty to issue an edict The king was delighted Bring it here trunk and all he orderedThe two officials then returned to their own offices mustered a full complement of soldiers and had the trunk carried out Sanzang who was inside felt his soul leaving his bodyDisciples he said what shall we say in our defense when we reach the king Shut up said Monkey with a grin Ive fixed everythingWhen the trunks opened the king will bow to us as his teachersThe only thing is that Pig mustnt quarrel about precedence If they dont kill me thatll be heaven Pig repliedWhat would I want to quarrel about Before these words were all out of his mouth they had been carried to the palace entrance and in through the Tower of Five Phoenixes to be set at the foot of the steps to the throneOn being invited by the two officials to have the trunk opened and look inside the king ordered that this be doneNo sooner was the lid lifted than Pig who could restrain himself no longer sprang outside giving all the officials such a fright that they shivered unable to speakNext Brother Monkey could be seen helping the Tang Priest out while Friar Sand lifted the luggage outSeeing that the commanderinchief was holding the white horse Pig went up to him made an angry noise and said Thats my horseHand it over This so terrified the official that he collapsed head over heelsThe four pilgrims all stood upright in the middle of the steps and when the king saw that they were monks he came down at once from his dragon throne sent for his queen and consorts from the inner quarters descended the steps of the throne hall bowed to them along with all his officials and asked What brings you venerable gentlemen here I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor to go to the Great Thunder Monastery in India in the West to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true scriptures Sanzang repliedVenerable Master the king said you have come from far awayBut why did you sleep in this trunk last night I knew that Your Majesty had sworn a vow to kill Buddhist monks Sanzang replied which is why I did not dare to visit your illustrious country openly but disguised myself as a layman to arrive late at night to find lodging in one of your innsWe slept in the trunk because we were afraid that our real identity would be discoveredUnfortunately the trunk was stolen by bandits then brought back here by the commanderinchiefNow that I have been able to see Your Majestys dragon countenance the clouds have cleared away and the sun has come outI hope that Your Majesty will pardon and release me ascetic monk that I ammy gratitude will be as deep as the ocean Venerable Master the king replied you are a distinguished monk from our suzerain heavenly dynasty It was wrong of us not to go out to welcome youFor years we have been fulfilling a vow to kill monks because a monk once maligned us The vow we made to heaven was to kill ten thousand monks to make up a round numberWe never imagined that today we would return to the truth and that we would all be turned into monksNow all of us king officials queen and consorts have had our hair shaved off I beg Venerable Master that you will not be grudging with your lofty virtue and will take us as your disciples Journey to the West When Pig heard this he started roaring with laughterIf youre going to be our disciples what introductory presents have you got for us If you will accept us as your follower Master the king replied we will present you with all the wealth in our kingdom Dont talk about wealth to us said Brother Monkey as were proper monksAs long as you inspect and return our passport and escort us out of the city I can guarantee that your monarchy will last for ever and that you will enjoy a long and happy life On hearing this the king ordered his office of foreign relations to arrange a great feast at which monarch and officials together returned to the one truthThe passport was immediately inspected and returned after which Sanzang was asked to change the name of the countryDharma in the name of Your Majestys country is excellent Monkey said but the destructia part is nonsenseNow that weve come here you should change the name to DharmarespectiaThis would guarantee Clear waters and victory for a thousand generations Timely winds and rain with universal peace The king thanked them for their gracious kindness had the royal carriage prepared and escorted the Tang Priest and his three disciples Westwards out of the cityWe will say no more of how monarch and subjects now held to the true faith but tell how after leaving the king of Dharmarespectia the venerable elder said happily from on his horse What excellent magic you used WukongIt worked very well Elder brother said Friar Sand where did you find so many barbers to shave all those heads in one night Monkey then told them all about how he had used his miraculous powers at which they all laughed so much they could not stopJust as they were feeling so cheerful a great mountain came into view blocking their wayReining in the horse the Tang Priest said Disciples see how high that mountain isYou must be very careful Dont worry said Monkey with a grin dont worryI promise you nothing will go wrong Dont say that Sanzang repliedI can see those jutting peaks and even from a distance it looks rather sinister Storm clouds are streaming from it and I am beginning to feel frightenedMy whole body is turning numb and my spirits are disturbed You have already forgotten the Heart Sutra that the Rooks Nest Hermit taught you said Brother MonkeyI can still remember it Sanzang saidEven if you can still remember that said Monkey there is a quatrain that youve forgotten What quatrain Sanzang asked to which Monkey replied Journey to the West Do not go far to seek the Buddha on Vulture Peak Vulture Peak is in your heartEverybody has a Vulture Peak stupa Under which to cultivate conduct Of course I know it disciple said SanzangAccording to that quatrain the thousands of scriptures all come down to cultivating the heart Goes without saying Monkey repliedWhen the heart is purified it can shine alone When the heart is preserved all perceptions are pureIf there is any mistake then laziness follows And success will not come in a myriad yearsAs long as your will is sincere Thunder Peak is before your eyesBut if youre as scared frightened and disturbed as this the Great Way is distant and Thunder Peak is far far awayForget those wild fears and come with me When the venerable elder heard this his spirits were revived and his worries disappearedThe four of them had only gone a few more steps when they reached the mountainWhen they raised their eyes this was what they saw A fine mountain Dappled with many coloursWhite clouds drifted around the peak And cool were the shadows of the trees in front of the cliffThe birds rustled in the leaves The beasts were ferociousJourney to the West Among the woods were a thousand pines On the ridge a few bamboosHowls came from gray wolves seizing their prey And roars from hungry tigers fighting over foodLong screamed the wild apes searching for fruit The Davidsdeer climbed through blossoms into mists of greenThe wind was blowing The waters babbled And hidden birds sang in the deserted passHere and there wisteria was climbing While rare flowers bloomed by the stream amid orchidsIntricately shaped and strange were the rocks And sheer rose the cragsFoxes and raccoondogs ran in packs Badgers and apes were playing in groupsThe travelers were worried by so high and steep a mountain Why was the ancient track so twistedWhile master and disciples were moving timidly ahead they heard the howling of a windTheres a wind said Sanzang in fearIn the spring there are mild winds Monkey replied in the summer hot ones in the autumn golden ones and in the winter North windsThere are winds in all four seasons Whats so frightening about a wind This wind is blowing very hard Sanzang repliedIt is definitely not a wind from heaven But winds always come from the earth and clouds from mountains Monkey replied so how could there be a wind from heaven Before he had finished speaking a mist aroseThat mist really was Darkness joining up with the sky Journey to the West Obscurity making the whole earth dimThe sun had completely vanished from sight And no bird sangAll was as indistinct as primal chaos And the air seemed filled with flying dustThe trees on the mountain could not be seen Where had the herbgatherers goneWukong said Sanzang in fright why is there this mist when the wind is still blowing Dont get upset Monkey repliedGet off your horse Master Ill go and see whether or not its sinister while you two keep guard brothers The splendid Great Sage needed only to bow in order to be in midairHolding his hand to his brow for shade he opened his fiery eyes wide and looked down to see an evil spirit sitting at the foot of a beetling scarJust look and see what he was like A mighty body full of charm A heroic manner of great vigorThe fangs protruding from his mouth were drills of steel His nose hung like a jade hook in the middleHis golden eyes with pupils round gave animals a fright Demons and gods were scared of his bristling silver whiskersHe sat upright by the cliff in terrible might Making the mist and wind as he hatched his plotOn either side of him some thirty or forty junior demons could be seen all drawn up in line and blowing out mist and wind for all they were worthMonkey grinned at this and thought So my master is clairvoyant He said it wasnt a heavenly wind and it was in fact caused by this evil spirit trying to fool usNow if I went straight down and hit him with what they call a garlicsmasher thatd kill him sure enough but it would ruin my reputation Monkey had been a true hero all his life and was quite incapable of playing a dirty trick like that Journey to the West Id better go back and give Pig some attention Ill ask him to hit the evil spirit firstIf Pigs good enough to kill the evil spirit well be in luckIf he isnt and the evil spirit captures him I can come back to rescue him and win myself a bit of fameHes always putting on such an act and being so lazyhe wont make an effort Still he is very greedy and partial to a good feedI think Ill try a trick on him and see how that works At once he brought his cloud down to land in front of Sanzang who asked Are the wind and the mist sinister or not Its clear now Monkey repliedTheyve gone Yes said Sanzang they have eased off a little Master said Monkey with a smile my eyesight is very good usually but this time I was wrongI thought thered probably be a monster behind that wind and mist but there wasnt What caused them then Sanzang askedTheres a village not far ahead Monkey replied where the people are so pious that theyre steaming white rice and white breadrolls to feed monks withI think that the mist must have been steam escaping from their steamersIt was the result of their goodness When Pig heard this he thought Monkey was telling the truth so he grabbed hold of him and whispered Did you eat their food before you came back Only a bit Monkey repliedThe vegetable dishes were too saltyI didnt want to eat too much Screw that said PigId eat my fill of it however salty it wasIf it made me really thirsty Id come back for a drink of water Would you like some Monkey asked Sure thing Pig repliedIm hungry and Id like some nowWhat do you think You mustnt even talk about it said MonkeyAs the ancient book says When the father is present the son must do nothing on his own account Our master whos as good as a father to you is here so none of us should dare go ahead If youll say nothing about it Im going replied Pig with a grinLets see how you do it Monkey repliedIll say nothing When it came to eating the idiot knew a thing or two He went up to his master made a loud naaaw of respect and said Master elder brother has just told me that there are people in a village ahead of us who feed monksJust look at that horse It looks as though its going to start playing it up Well be causing a lot of trouble if we have to ask for grass and other fodder for itLuckily the wind and the clouds have gone now so why dont you all sit here for a while while I fetch some tender grass We can go and beg for food from that house when weve fed the horse Splendid said the Tang Priest with delightI wondered why youve become so hardworking todayBe as quick as you can Journey to the West Smiling secretly to himself the idiot started outBrother said Monkey catching up and grabbing hold of him they feed monks all right but only goodlooking ones In that case Ill have to change again said PigYes said Brother Monkey you change The splendid idiot who could perform thirtysix transformations went into a hollow on the mountainside made a spell with his hands said the magic words shook himself and turned himself into a short skinny monk beating a wooden fishshaped dram with his hand and mumbling Oh great one oh great one because he knew no scriptures to reciteAfter putting away the wind and the mist the evil spirit ordered all his devils to form a circle round the main road ready for any travelersThe idiots luck was out and he was soon inside the trap and surrounded by the devils who grabbed at his clothes and his silken sash as they all crowded in on him together Dont pull Pig saidYou can let me eat in all your houses in turn What do you want to eat monk the devils askedYou feed monks here Pig replied and Ive come to be fed So youre hoping to be fed are you monk said the demonsYou dont seem to realize that what we like doing best here is eating monksWere all evil immortals whove found the Way here in the mountains and the only thing we want to do is to catch you monks take you home with us pop you in the steamer till youre tender and eat youAnd youre still hoping for a vegetarian meal At this Pigs heart was filled with terror and he started complaining about Monkey That Protector of the Horses is a crookHe lied to me about them feeding monks in this village There arent any villagers here and theres nobody who feeds monksTheyre all evil spirits The idiot was being tugged at so hard that he turned back into himself pulled the rake out from his belt and struck out wildly driving all the junior devils backThey rushed back to report to the senior demon Disaster Your Majesty What disaster the senior demon askedA neatlooking monk came along in front of the mountain they replied so we decided to catch him and steam himWe were going to keep what we couldnt eat now for a bad dayThen to our astonishment he transformed himself What did he turn himself into the senior demon askedNot into anything human they repliedHes got a long snout big ears and a bristly mane on his back He lashed out furiously at us with a rake that he used twohandedHe gave us such a terrible fright that weve run straight back to report to Your Majesty Dont be afraid the senior demon saidLet me go and have a look Swinging his iron mace he went up for a closer look and saw that the idiot really was hideousThis is what he looked like Journey to the West A snout like a husking hammer over three feet long Tusks like silver nails protruding from his mouthTwo round eyes that flashed like lightning A pair of ears that made a howling wind when they flappedThe bristles behind his head were rows of iron arrows All of his hide was rough and green and scabbyIn his hands he held an amazing object A ninetoothed rake of which everyone was afraidSummoning up his courage the evil spirit shouted Where are you fromWhats your nameTell me at once and Ill spare your life To this Pig replied with a laugh So you cant recognize your own ancestor Pig either my boyCome closer and Ill tell you For my huge mouth and tusks and mighty powers I was made Marshal Tian Peng by the Jade Emperor Commanding eighty thousand marines on the River of Heaven And happy amid all the joys of the heavenly palaceBecause when drunk I fluted with a palace lady I decided to play the hero for a whileOne butt from my snout destroyed the Dipper and Bull Palace I ate the magic mushrooms of the Queen Mother of the WestThe Jade Emperor himself gave me two thousand hammerblows Made me an exile from the world of HeavenThis made me determined to nourish my spirit And become an evil monster in the lower worldJust when I had made a good marriage in Gao Village Journey to the West Fate brought me up against my brother MonkeyHe subdued me with his goldbanded cudgel I was forced to bow my head and enter the Buddhist faithI do the heavy work saddle the horse and carry luggage I must have been the Tang Priests debtor in an earlier lifeAs the ironfooted Marshal Tian Peng my surname was Zhu My name as a Buddhist is Zhu Bajie When the evil spirit heard this he shouted So youre the Tang Priests discipleIve long heard that his flesh is very tasty Youre one of the people I most want to catch Im not going to spare you now youve fallen into my clutchesStay where you are and take this from my mace Evil beast Pig repliedYou must have been a dyer before What do you mean I must have been a dyer the evil spirit askedIf you werent a dyer how come you know how to use a pestle Pig retorted and with no further argument the monster was upon him striking furiouslyThey fought a fine battle in the mountain hollow A ninetoothed rake An iron maceAs the rake went through its movements they were like a howling gale The maces skilful blows came as thick and fast as rainOne was an unknown ogre blocking the mountain road The other was the offending Tian Peng now guarding his true natures masterWhen ones nature is right monsters cause no fear When the mountain is high earth cannot come from metalOne fought with his mace like a python from a pool The others rake was like a dragon from the watersTheir angry shouts shook mountains and rivers Journey to the West Their mighty roars caused terror down in hellEach of the heroes displayed his prowess Staking his life on his magical powersWe will say no more of how Pig set a mighty wind blowing as he fought the evil spirit who ordered his junior devils to keep Pig surroundedInstead the story tells how Brother Monkey suddenly gave a bitter laugh behind the Tang Priests backWhy are you laughing like that elder brother Friar Sand askedPig really is an idiot Monkey replied As soon as he heard that they feed monks there he fell for my trick Hes been away a long time nowIf hed beaten the evil spirit with a single blow of his rake youd have seen him coming back in triumph by now loudly insisting on his great victoryBut if the demons been too much for him and captured him my lucks out Goodness only knows how often hell have cursed the Protector of the Horses behind my backSay nothing while I go to take a look around Wujing With that the splendid Great Sage who did not want the venerable elder to know what was happening quietly pulled a hair out of the back of his head blew on it with magic breath said Change and turned it into his own double to stay with the master together with Friar SandThen his real self disappeared as he leapt up into the air to look around He saw the idiot lashing out wildly with his rake at the devils who were surrounding him and gradually getting the better of him This was more than Monkey could bearBringing his cloud down to land he shouted at the top of his voice Take it easy PigMonkeys here Recognizing that it was Monkeys voice gave the idiot a chance to be more ferocious than ever as he hit wildly forward with his rakeThe evil spirit was no match for him You werent up to much before monk he said so how come youre so fierce now Youd better stop bullying me now my lad Pig replied Ive got one of my people here now A moment later he was swinging wildly again with the rakeThe evil spirit unable to stave off the blows led his devils away in defeatAs soon as Monkey saw that the devils had been beaten he drew no closer but went straight back on his cloud shook the hair and put it back on his bodyWith his mortal fleshly eyes the Tang Priest noticed nothing of thisBefore long a triumphant Pig returned too so exhausted that his nose was dripping with snot as he foamed at the mouth and was panting loudlyMaster he called When the Tang Priest saw him he exclaimed in astonishment Pig you went to fetch some grass for the horse Why have you come back in so terrible a stateWere there watchmen on the mountain who wouldnt let you cut any The idiot flung his rake down beat his chest and stamped his feet as he replied Dont ask me about it Master If I had to tell you Id die of shame What would you be so ashamed of Sanzang askedJourney to the West Elder brother tricked me Pig repliedHe told me that it wasnt an evil spirit behind that wind and mist He said there was nothing sinister about it but that it was from a village where the people were so pious that they were steaming white rice and breadrolls made with white flour to feed monks withI believed him As I was so hungry I thought Id go ahead to beg for some Fetching grass for the horse was only an excuse I never expected to be surrounded by a crowd of evil spiritsThey gave me a hard fight and if Monkey hadnt helped me out with his mourners staff Id have had no hope of escaping and getting back here The idiots talking nonsense said Monkey who was standing beside them with a smileIf youve taken to robbery youre trying to get a whole gaolful of people into troubleIve been looking after the master hereIve never left his side It is true Sanzang said Wukong has never left my side The idiot then sprang up shouting You dont understand MasterHes got a double Is there really a monster there Wukong Sanzang askedMonkey could keep his deception up no longer There are a few little devils Monkey replied with a bow and a smile but they wont dare give us any troubleCome here Pig Im going to look after youWere going to escort the master along this steep mountain path as if we were an army on the march How Pig askedYoull be the commander of the vanguard Monkey replied going in front and clearing the wayIf the evil spirit doesnt show up again that will be that but if he does you fight him When you beat the evil spirit thatll be something to your credit Reckoning that the evil spirits powers were much the same as his own Pig said Very well thenIm ready to die at his handsIll take the lead Idiot said Monkey if you start by saying such unlucky things youll never get anywhere As you know brother Pig replied When a gentleman goes to a banquet He gets either drunk or well filled When a hero goes into a battle He gets either wounded or killedBy saying something unlucky first Ill make myself stronger later This delighted Monkey who saddled the horse and invited the master to ride while Friar Sand carried the luggage as they all followed Pig into the mountainsJourney to the West The evil spirit meanwhile led a few of his underlings who had survived the rout straight back to his cave where he sat brooding in silence high up above a rocky precipiceMany of the junior devils who looked after things in his household came up to him and asked Why are you so miserable today Your MajestyYoure usually insuch high spirits when you come back Little ones said the demon king usually when I go out to patrol the mountains I can be sure of bringing home a few people or animals Ive caught to feed you withToday my luck was outIve met my match Who the junior devils askedA monk the demon king replied a disciple of the Tang Priest from the East whos going to fetch the scriptures Hes called Zhu BajieHe went for me so hard with his rake that he beat me I had to run awayIm thoroughly fed up For ages now Ive heard it said that the Tang Priest is an arhat who has cultivated his conduct for ten successive lifetimes Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for everTo my surprise hes come to my mountain today and it would have been an ideal time to catch him cook him and eat him I never realized hed have a disciple like that one Before he had finished saying this a junior devil slipped forward from the ranksFirst he gave three sobs in front of the demon king then three laughsWhy sob then laugh shouted the demon kingThe junior devil fell to his knees as he replied Because Your Majesty just said that you wanted to eat the Tang PriestHis flesh isnt worth eating But everyone says that a piece of his flesh will make you live as long as the heavens said the demon kingHow can you say that its not worth eating If he were so good to eat the junior devil replied hed never have got this far Other demons would have eaten him upAnd hes got three disciples with him Do you know who the demon king askedThe senior disciple is Sun the Novice said the junior devil and the third disciple is Friar SandThe one you met must have been his second disciple Zhu Bajie How does Friar Sand compare with Zhu Bajie asked the demon kingHes much the same the junior devil said What about Sun the Novice the demon king asked at which the junior devil thrust out his tongue in horror and replied I darent tell youThat Monkey has tremendous magic powers and can do all sorts of transformationsFive hundred years ago he made terrible havoc in heaven None of the heavenly warriors dared give him any trouble from the Twentyeight Constellations the Star Lords of the Nine Bright Shiners the Gods of the Twelve Branches the Five Officers and the Four Ministers the East and West Dippers and the Gods of the North and the South to the Five Peaks and the Four Rivers How can you have the nerve to want to eat the Tang Priest How do you know so much about him the demon king askedJourney to the West I used to live in the Lion Cave of the demon king on Lion Ridge the junior devil replied He was reckless enough to want to eat the Tang Priest and that Sun the Novice smashed his way in through the gates with his goldbanded cudgel It was terrible They were wiped outLuckily I had enough sense to escape by the back door and come here where Your Majesty allowed me to stayThats how I know about his powers The senior demon turned pale with shock when he heard this it was a case of the commanderinchief being afraid of the soothsayers wordsHow could he help being alarmed when he heard all this from one of his own peopleJust when they were all feeling terrified another junior devil stepped forward and said Dont be so upset and afraid Your Majesty As the saying goes easy does itIf you want to catch the Tang Priest let me make you a plan to capture him What plan the senior demon askedI have a plan to divide the petals of the plum blossom What do you mean by dividing the petals of the plum blossom the demon king askedCall the roll of all the devils in the cave the junior devil replied Choose the best hundred from all thousand of them then the best ten out of that hundred and finally the best three out of the tenThey must be capable and good at transformations Have them all turn into Your Majestys doubles wear Your Majestys helmet and armor carry Your Majestys mace and lie in wait in three different placesFirst send one out to fight Zhu Bajie then one to fight Sun the Novice and finally one to fight Friar Sand This way youll only have to spare three junior devils to draw the three disciples awayThen Your Majesty will be able to stretch down from midair with your cloudgrabbing hand to catch the Tang Priest Hell be in the bag Itll be as easy as catching flies in a dish of fish juiceNothing to it This suggestion delighted the demon king who said What a brilliant plan brilliantIf I dont catch the Tang Priest this way thatll be thatBut if I do I can assure you youll be richly rewardedIll make you commander of the vanguard The junior devil kowtowed to thank him for his grace and went off to call the roll of the devilsAfter all the monsters in the cave had been carefully checked through three capable junior devils were selected They turned into the senior devils doubles and went to lie in wait for the Tang Priest with their iron macesThe venerable Tang elder meanwhile was following Pig along the way without a care in the worldWhen they had been going for some time there was a crashing sound from beside the track and out leapt a junior devil who rushed straight at them evidently to grab SanzangThe evil spirits here Pig Monkey shoutedGet him The idiot who was taken in by the imposture hacked wildly at the devil with his rakeThe evil spirit parried Pigs blows with his mace as he met the onslaughtWhile the battle between the pair of them ebbed and flowed on the mountainside there was a noise in the undergrowth as another monster sprang out and charged at the Tang PriestThis is bad Master said Monkey Pig cant see straight Hes let the monster escape to catch youIm going to fight him Pulling his cudgel out in a flash he went up to the monster shouting Where dyou think youre goingTake this Without saying a word the evil spirit raised his mace to meet the attackBut while the two of them were locked in combat swinging at each other there was a howling wind from the other side of the mountain and a Journey to the West third evil spirit sprang out who also rushed straight at the Tang PriestWhen Friar Sand saw it he exclaimed in alarm Master big brother and second brother both cant see straight Theyve let the evil spirit get away to catch youStay on the horse while I get him Friar Sand was taken in tooBrandishing his staff he blocked the evil spirits iron mace and started a bitter combat It was a wild fight with shouts and awful yells and they drew further and further awayWhen the demon king saw from up in the sky that the Tang Priest was alone on the horse he reached down with his fiveclawed steel hook and seized himThe master lost horse and stirrups as the evil spirit carried him off in a gust of windThis was a case of When the dhyananature encountered a monster the true achievement was hard The monk of the river current met once more with a star of disasterBringing his wind down to land the demon king took the Tang Priest into the cave and called Commander of the vanguard The junior devil who had made the plan came forward knelt and said I am not worthy How can you say that the demon king repliedOnce the commanderinchief has spoken white becomes blackWhat I said before was that if I failed to catch the Tang Priest that would be that but that if I succeeded Id make you my commander of the vanguardYour brilliant plan has succeeded today so there is no reason why I should break faith with youBring the Tang Priest here and tell the underlings to fetch water scrub the cooking pot fetch some firewood and light the fireWhen hes been steamed you and I will each have a piece of his flesh and live for ever Your Majesty the commander of the vanguard replied he mustnt be eaten yet Why ever not the demon king askedWeve captured him It wouldnt matter if you ate him Your Majesty said the commander of the vanguard as far as Zhu Bajie and Friar Sand are concerned They would be reasonable But Im worried about that Sun the Novice hed be really vicious If he found out wed eaten the Tang Priest he wouldnt come to give us a straight fightHed just thrust that goldbanded cudgel of his into the mountainside and make a hole so big that the whole mountain would collapseWed be homeless What do you suggest commander of the vanguard the demon king askedIn my opinion the commander replied we should send the Tang Priest out to the back garden tie him to a tree and starve him for two or three daysThat will clean him up inside and let us make sure that the three disciples dont come here looking for him Once weve found out that theyve gone home we can bring the Tang Priest out and enjoy him at our leisureThatd be better wouldnt it Yes yes the senior demon said with a laughYoure right commander of the vanguard An order was issued and the Tang Priest taken into the back garden to be roped to a tree while all the junior devils went out to the front to keep watchLook at the venerable elder as he suffers in his bonds tied up Journey to the West tightly and unable to stop the tears rolling down his cheeks Disciples he called where did you chase those demons to when you went to capture them in the mountainsI have been captured by a wicked ogre and have met with disaster When will I ever see you againThe pain is killing me Just when the tears from both eyes were joining in a single stream he heard someone calling from a tree opposite Venerable elder youre here too Taking control of himself the Tang Priest asked Who are you Im a woodcutter who lives on this mountain the other replied Ive been tied up here for three daysI reckon theyre going to eat me Woodcutter said the Tang Priest with tears in his eyes If you die it will only be you You have nothing else to worry about But if I die it wont be a clean end What do you mean it wont be a clean end venerable elder the woodcutter askedYou have no parents wife or children so if you die thatll be that I am from the East the Tang Priest replied and was going to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven I was going on the orders of Emperor Taizong of the Tang to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true scriptures This was to save all the lonely souls in the underworld who have nobody to care for themIf I lose my life today the vain waiting will kill my sovereign and I will let down his ministersCountless wronged souls in the City of the Unjustly Slain will suffer a terrible disappointment and never ever be able to escape from the wheel of life The true achievement will all be turned to dust in the windHow can that possibly be considered a clean end When the woodcutter heard this the tears fell from his eyes as he said If you die that is all there to it But my death will be even more painful for me to bearI lost my father when I was a boy and live alone with my mother Because we had no property I have had to make our living as a woodcutterMy aged mother is eightytwo this year and I am her only supportIf I die who will there be to bury herIts very hard to bearthe pain of it is killing me When the venerable elder heard this he began to wail aloud Oh dear oh dear Even the mountain man thinks of his mother I am reciting the sutras in vainServing ones monarch and serving ones parents are both the same in principleYou are moved by your mothers goodness to you and I by my sovereign lords goodness to me This was indeed a case of Weeping eyes looking at eyes that weep Journey to the West A heartbroken one who sees off one with a broken heartBut we will say no more of Sanzangs sufferings as we return to Monkey who after driving the junior devil back down the grassy slope rushed back to the track to find that his master had disappeared All that was left were the white horse and the luggageIn his alarm he led the horse and shouldered the carryingpole as he headed for the top of the mountain in his search for the masterOh dearIndeed The longsuffering monk of the river current had met with new suffering The Great Sage subduer of demons had run into a demonIf you do not know how his search for his master ended listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Mother of Wood Lends His Might in Defeating the Ogre The Metal Lord Uses His Magic to Wipe Out the Monster The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey was leading the horse and carrying the baggage while he searched the whole mountain top calling out for his master Suddenly Pig came running up to him puffing and panting to ask Why are you shouting like that brother The masters disappeared Brother Monkey replied Have you seen him Why did you have to play that trick on me when I was being a good monk with the Tang Priest Pig asked What was all that about me being commander of the vanguardI had to fight for my life before I could beat that evil spirit and come back in one pieceYou and Friar Sand were looking after the master so why ask me about it I dont blame you brother said MonkeySomehow or other your eyes must have gone blurredyou let the evil spirit get away and come back to catch the master againWhen I went off to fight it I told Friar Sand to look after the master and hes disappeared too I expect hes taken the master somewhere for a crap said Pig with a grin but before he had finished speaking Friar Sand turned upWheres the master Friar Sand Monkey askedYou two must both be blind retorted Friar Sand letting the evil spirit escape to come back for the masterWhen I went to fight the evil spirit the master was left in the horse by himself At this Monkey leapt with rage shouting Hes fooled meHes fooled me Journey to the West Hows he fooled you Friar Sand askedIt was a dividing the petals of the plum blossom trick Monkey replied to draw us three off so that he could make a blow for the heart and carry off the masterWhatever in the name of Heaven are we to do He could not stop the tears from streaming down his cheeks at which Pig said Dont cry If you cry youre a pustuleHe cant be far away He must be on this mountainLets look for him The three of them had no better plan than to look for him on the mountainWhen they had covered some six or seven miles they saw a cave palace at the foot of a beetling precipice Cleancut pinnacles blocking the light Towering and grotesqueshaped rocksThe fragrance of rate and wonderful flowers The beauty of red apricots and green peachesThe ancient trees in front of the precipice Forty spans round and with bark scarred by frost and rain The azure pines standing outside the gates Two thousand feet of green blue reaching up to the skyPairs of wild cranes That dance in the breeze at the mouth of the cave Mountain birds in couples Chirping by day at the ends of the branchesClumps of yellow creepers like ropes Rows of misty willows with leaves like hanging goldWater fills the pools that are square All over the mountain are caves that are deepIn the pools that are square Dragons lie hidden with scales unchangedIn the mountains deep caves Dwell ogres that long have been eaters of humansJourney to the West This can be matched with the lands of immortals A den where the winds and the vapors are storedWhen Monkey saw this he took two or three paces forward sprang towards the gates and saw that they were shut tight Above them was a horizontal stone tablet on which was written in large letters LINKED RING CAVE BROKEN RIDGE HIDDEN MISTS MOUNTAIN Strike Pig said Monkey This is where the evil spirit livesThe master must be here At this the idiot turned vicious raised his rake and brought it down on the gates with all his strength smashing a big hole in them and shouting Ogre send my master out at once if you dont want me to smash your gates down and finish the lot of you off At this the junior devils on the gates rushed back inside to report Disaster Your Majesty What disaster the senior demon askedSomeones smashed a hole in the front gates and is yelling that he wants his master the junior devils repliedI wonder which ones come looking for him said the demon king in a state of great alarmDont be frightened said the commander of the vanguardLet me go out and take a look He hurried straight to the front gates twisted his head to one side and craned to look through the hole that had been smashed in them He saw someone with a long snout and big ears Dont worry Your Majesty he turned round and shouted at the top of his voice its Zhu Bajie Hes not up to much and he wont dare try any nonsense on usIf he does we can open the gates and drag him inside to put in the steamer tooThe only one to worry about is that hairycheeked monk with a face like a thunder god Brother said Pig when he heard this from outside hes not scared of me but he is of you The masters definitely inside Come here quick Evil damned beast said Monkey abusivelyYour grandfather Monkey is hereSend my master out and Ill spare your life This is terrible Your Majesty the commander of the vanguard reportedSun the Novice is here looking for him too At this the demon king started complaining Its all because of your petaldividing or whatever you called it Youve brought disaster on usHow is this going to end Journey to the West Dont worry Your Majesty the commander of the vanguard replied and dont start grumbling yetThat Sun the Novice is a monkey of great breadth of spirit Although he has such tremendous magical power hes partial to flatteryWell take an imitation human head out to fool him with say a few flattering things to him and tell him weve eaten his master alreadyIf we can take him in the Tang Priest will be ours to enjoyIf we cant well have to think again But where are we to get an imitation human head the demon king askedIll see if I can make one the commander of the vanguard repliedThe splendid ogre then cut a piece of willow root with an axe of pure steel into the shape of a human head spurted some human blood on it from his mouth to make it all sticky and told a junior devil to take it to the gates on a lacquer tray calling My Lord Great Sage please overcome your anger and allow me to address you Brother Monkey really was partial to being flattered and when he heard himself being addressed as My Lord Great Sage he grabbed hold of Pig and said Dont hit himLets hear what he has to say To this the junior devil with the tray replied When my king took your master into the cave the junior devils were naughty and behaved very badlyThey gobbled and gnawed and grabbed and bit and ate the whole of your master up except his head which I have here If youve eaten him up thats that Monkey repliedBring the head out and let me see whether its real or false The junior devil threw the head out through the hole in the gates a sight that started Pig howling and saying This is terribleThe master went in looking one way and hes come out looking like this Idiot said Monkey have a look and find out if its real before you start crying Youre shameless said Pig how could there ever be such a thing as a fake human head This ones a fake Brother Monkey repliedHow can you tell Pig askedWhen you throw a real human head it lands quietly Monkey explained but when you throw a fake it makes a loud noise like a pair of wooden clappersIf you dont believe me Ill throw it for youListen He picked the head up and threw it against a rock where it gave a hollow ringIt was loud brother said Friar SandThat means its a fake said MonkeyIll make it turn back into its real self to show you Producing his goldbanded cudgel in a flash he hit the head openWhen Pig looked he saw that it was a piece of willow rootThis was too much for the idiot who started talking abusivelyIll get you you hairy lot he said you may have hidden my master in your cave and fooled your ancestor Pig with a piece of willow root but dont imagine that my master is just a willowtree spirit in disguise The junior devil who was holding the tray was thrown into such a panic by this that he ran shaking with fear back to report Its terrible terrible terrible Whats so terribly terrible then the senior demon askedJourney to the West Zhu Bajie and Friar Sand were taken in but Monkeys like an antique dealerhe really knows his stuff the junior demon repliedHe could tell it was an imitation headIf only we could give him a real human head he might go away But how are we to get one the senior demon wondered then continued Fetch a human head we havent eaten yet from the flaying shed The devils then went to the shed and choose a fresh head after which they gnawed all the skin off it till it was quite smooth and carried it out on a tray My lord Great Sage the messenger said I am afraid it was a fake head last timeBut this really is Lord Tangs headOur king had kept it so as to bring good fortune to our cave but now hes making a special offering of it He then threw the head out through the hole in the gates it landed with a thud and rolled on the ground gory with bloodSeeing that this human head was a real one Monkey could not help starting to wail in which he was joined by Pig and Friar SandStop crying brother said Pig holding back his tearsThis is very hot weather and the head will soon become putrid Im going to fetch and bury it while its still freshWe can cry for him afterwards Youre right said Monkey and the idiot cradled the head against his chest not caring about the filth as he hurried up the cliff till he found a Southfacing spot where the winds and the natural forces were gathered Here he hacked out a hole with his rake buried the head and piled a gravemound over itOnly then did he say to Friar Sand You and big brother weep over him while I look for some offerings Going down to the side of a gill he broke off some willow branches and gathered a few pebblesTaking them back up to the tomb he planted the willow branches on either side and piled the pebbles in front of itWhats all that about Monkey askedThe willow branches are used instead of cypresses to shade the masters tomb for the time being Pig answered and the pebbles are offerings to him instead of cakes Cretin Monkey shouted Hes already deadWhat do you want to go offering him stones for Just to show what the living feel Pig replied and out of mourning and respect Youd better cut that nonsense out Monkey replied Tell Friar Sand to come hereHe can guard the tomb and keep an eye on the horse and the luggage while we two go and smash the cave palace up capture the monster and break his body into ten thousand bitsThen well have avenged the master Youre absolutely right big brother said Friar Sand through his tearsYou two be careful Ill keep watch here The splendid Pig then took off his black brocade tunic tied his undershirt tightly picked up his rake and followed MonkeyThe two of them rushed straight for the stone gates and with no more ado they smashed them down and shouted with a yell that made the heavens shake Give us our Tang Priest back alive This sent the souls flying from all the devils old and young in the cave who complained that the commander of the vanguard had wronged themHow are we going to deal with these monks now theyve fought their way in through the gates the demon king askedThe ancients used to say the commander of the vanguard replied Put your hand in a basket of fish and its bound to stink Now were in this weve got to see it throughWell just have to take our troops into battle Journey to the West with these monks When the demon heard this he had no alternative but to issue the order Stand together my little onesBring your best weapons with you and come with me They then charged out through the entrance of the cave with a great war cryThe Great Sage and Pig quickly fell back a few paces before they held the devilish onslaught on a piece of flat ground on the mountainside shouting Whos your bestknown bossWhos the ogre who captured our master The devils had now palisaded their position over which a multicolored embroidered flag flew and the demon king shouted straight back as he held the iron mace Damned monks Dont you know who I amIm the Great King of the Southern Mountains and Ive been running wild here for hundreds of yearsIve eaten your Tang Priest upWhat are you going to do about it Youve got a nerve you hairy beast retorted Monkey abusivelyHow old are you daring to call yourself after the Southern MountainsLord Lao Zi was the ancestor who opened up heaven and earth but even he sits on the right of the Supreme Pure OneThe Tathagata Buddha is the Honoured One who rules the world and he sits below the Great RocConfucius the Sage is the Honoured One of the Confucian School and all hes called is MasterSo how dare you call yourself Great King of the Southern Mountains and talk about running wild for several hundred years Dont move and take this from your grandfathers cudgel The evil spirit twisted aside to avoid the cudgel which he parried with his iron maceHow dare you try to put me down like that monkeyface said the monster glaring furiouslyWhat kind of powers have you got acting like a maniac at my gates Ill get you you nameless beast replied Brother Monkey with a grinYou evidently dont know who I am so just stand there and make yourself brave while I tell you My ancestral home is in the Eastern Continent Where heaven and earth nourished me for thousands of yearsOn the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was a magic stone egg When the egg broke open my roots were insideMy birth was not like that of an ordinary being My body was formed when sun and moon mated cultivated myself with formidable effect Heaven gave me a perceptive and cinnabar headAs the Great Sage I dwelt in the palace in the clouds Using my strength in a fight against the Dipper and Bull PalaceA hundred thousand heavenly troops could get nowhere near me Journey to the West All the stars in the sky were easily subduedMy fame resounds throughout the cosmos I know all about everything between earth and skySince my conversion to Sakyamunis teachings  have been helping my master on his journey to the WestWhen I clear a path through mountains no one can stop me My skill at bridging rivers causes demons distressIn forests I use my power to seize tigers and leopards I capture wild beasts barehanded before sheer cliffsFor the sake of the Easts true achievement I have come to the Western Regions What evil monster will dare to show itselfI hate the wicked beasts who have murdered my master Their lives will all be ended at this moment These remarks both shocked and infuriated the ogre who ground his teeth sprang forward and struck at Brother Monkey with his iron maceMonkey blocked it effortlessly with his cudgel and would have said some more to him when Pig unable to restrain himself any longer started swinging wildly at the demon kings commander of the vanguardThe commander of the vanguard led his whole force into action and a hectic and splendid battle was fought on that piece of level ground on the mountainside The monk from the great and superior country in the East Was going to fetch true scriptures from the Western ParadiseThe great leopard of the Southern mountains breathed out wind and clouds To block their way through the mountains and show off his prowessWith tricks And deception He had foolishly captured the priest from Great TangThen he met Monkey with his tremendous powers Journey to the West As well as the famous Zhu BajieWhile the demons fought on level ground in the mountains Dust clouds arose and darkened the skyAbove the fray rose the junior devils roars As they thrust out wildly with spear and with swordOn the other side the monks shouted back Fighting with rake and with cudgel togetherThe Great Sage was a matchless hero And Pig in his perfection reveled in his strengthThe ancient ogre of the South And his vanguard commander For the sake of a piece of the Tang Priests flesh Were prepared to throw their own lives away These two hated them for killing their masterThe other two were set on murder because of the Tang PriestThe struggle long swayed to and fro The clashes and charges yielding no victorWhen Monkey realized that the junior devils were fighting so hard that repeated attacks were failing to drive them back he used bodydividing magic plucked out a bunch of hairs chewed them up in his mouth spat the pieces out called Change and turned them all into his own doubles each wielding a goldbanded cudgel and fighting his way into the cave from the outsideThe one or two hundred junior devils unable to cope with their attacks from all sides all fled for their lives back into the cave Monkey and Pig then fought their way back out through the enemy ranks from the insideThe evil spirits who had no sense tried to stand up to the rake and found themselves bleeding from nine wounds or resisted the cudgel and had their flesh and bones beaten to pasteThe Great King of the Southern Mountains was so alarmed that he fled for his life on his clouds and windThe commander of the vanguard who did not know how to do transformations had already fallen to Monkeys club and been revealed as what he really was an ironbacked gray wolf ogrePig went up to him turned him over by his leg and said Goodness only knows how many piglets and lambs this soandso has eaten Journey to the West Monkey meanwhile shook himself put the hair back on his body and said No time to lose idiot After the demon king Make him pay for the masters life Pig turned back but all the little Monkeys had disappearedYour magic bodies have all gone brother he exclaimedIve taken them back Monkey repliedSplendid said Pig splendid The two of them went back in triumph feeling very pleasedWhen the senior demon escaped back to the cave he told his underlings to move rocks and earth to barricade the front gatesThe surviving junior demons were all trembling with terror as they barricaded the entrance they would not have dared to stick their heads out again nowMonkey led Pig to the gates and shouted without getting any responsePigs rake made no impression when he struck them with itRealizing what had happened Monkey said Dont waste your effort PigTheyve barricaded the gates Then how are we going to avenge the master Pig askedLets go back to his grave and see Friar Sand Brother Monkey repliedWhen they got back there they found Friar Sand still weeping at which Pig became more miserable than ever throwing down his rake prostrating himself on the tomb mound and beating the ground with his hand as he howled Poor poor MasterMaster from so far awayIll never see you again Dont distress yourself so brother said MonkeyThe evil spirit may have barricaded his front gates but hes bound to have a back entrance to go in and out throughYou two wait here while I go and look for itDo be careful brother said Pig through his tears Dont get caught yourself too We could never cope if we had to wail for the master then for you by turnsWed make an awful mess of it No problem said MonkeyIve got my ways of doing things Putting his cudgel away the splendid Great Sage tightened his kilt stepped out and went back over the mountain On his way he heard the sound of flowing waterWhen he turned round to look he saw that there was a brook flowing down from above him and beside the gill was a gate to the left of which was a drainpipe from which red water was coming outGoes without saying he thoughtThat must be the back entranceIf I go as myself the junior demons may well recognize me when I open the door and see them Id better turn into a water snake to go in No hold onIf the masters spirit knows that Ive turned into a water snake hell be angry with me as a monk for turning into something so long drawnoutId better turn into a little crab No thats no good eitherThe master would be cross with me for having too many legs for a monk So he turned into a water rat who slipped into the water with a soughing sound and went straight to the inner courtyard along the drainpipeHere he thrust his head out for a look around and saw some junior devils setting out gobbets of human flesh to dry in a sunny spot Heavens said MonkeyThat must be what they cant finish from the masters flesh No doubt theyre drying it to save for a rainy dayIf I turned back into myself now went up to them and wiped them out with one swing of my cudgel Id be making myself look brave but stupidIll do another change go in to look for Journey to the West the senior devil and find out whats what With that he jumped out of the drain shook himself and turned himself into a winged antIndeed Weak and tiny and known as black colts They hide away for many a day till they have wings and can flyCasually crossing beside the bridge they draw up their ranks They enjoy battles of high strategy under the bedBecause they know when rain is coming they block their holes And build their mounds of dust that turn to ashesLight they are and delicate and quick Rarely observed as they pass the wicker gateHe spread his wings and flew straight into the inner hall unseen and unheardHere the senior demon could be seen sitting very angrily in the seat of honour while a junior devil ran up from behind to report Many congratulations Your Majesty What on the senior demon askedI was on lookout by the gill outside the back door just now the junior devil replied when suddenly I heard some loud wailsI rushed up to the top of the mountain to take a look and saw Zhu Bajie Sun the Novice and Friar Sand all bowing to a grave and weeping bitterlyI think they must have taken that head for the Tang Priests and buried it piled up a grave mound and mourned for it When Monkey overheard this he said to himself with delight From what hes said theyve still got the master here and havent eaten him yetIll take a look around and find out if hes still alive then have a word with him The splendid Great Sage then flew into the main hall and looked all around until he saw a very tiny doorway on one side of itIt was very firmly shut and when he squeezed through the narrow gap between the doors he found himself in a big garden in which he could vaguely make out the sound of sobbingFlying further inside he saw a clump of tall trees at the foot of which were tied two men One of these was the Tang PriestAs soon as Monkey saw him he felt an itch in his heart that he could not scratchHe could not help turning back into himself going up to Sanzang and calling Master When the Tang Priest saw who it was he started crying and saying Is that you WukongSave me as quickly as you can Wukong Dont keep saying my name Master Monkey replied There are people at the front and the secret may get outAs youre still alive I can rescue youThe ogres said theyd already eaten you and tricked me with an Journey to the West imitation human head Now were in a bitter struggle with themTheres no need to worry Master Just stick it out for a little longer till Ive beaten the evil spirit then Ill be able to rescue you The Great Sage said the words of a spell shook himself turned into an ant again and flew back into the hall where he landed on the main beamFrom here he saw the surviving junior devils jostling and shoutingOne of them sprang out from the crowd and said Your Majesty now they know weve blocked the main gate and they wont be able to fight their way in theyve given up hope Theyve even made a tomb for the wrong headThey spent today mourning for him and theyll do the same again tomorrow and the day after Im sure theyll go away after thatOnce we find out that theyve split up we can bring the Tang Priest out chop him up into little bits and fry him with aniseedThen everyone will be able to eat a piece when hes steaming hot and well all live forever At this another junior devil clapped his hands together and said No no hed taste much better steamed Boiling him would save some firewood another put inHes such a rare and wonderful thing said someone else that we ought to salt him down and take our time over eating him When Monkey heard all this from up among the beams he thought with fury What harm did my master ever do youWhy are you making these plans to eat him He pulled out a handful of hairs chewed them up into little pieces blew them lightly out of his mouth and silently recited the words of the spell that turned all the pieces into sleep insects These he threw into the faces of all the devils and the insects crawled up their noses gradually making the devils feel sleepyBefore long the junior devils were all lying stretched out fast asleepThe demon king was the only one left fitfully awake as he kept rubbing his face and head sneezing and pinching his nose Perhaps he knows about how to cope with sleep insects Monkey thoughtId better give him a double dose He pulled out a hair made two more sleep insects as before and threw them into the demons face to crawl up his nose one up the left nostril and one up the rightThe demon king jumped to his feet stretched yawned twice and fell fast asleep breathing heavilyQuietly delighted Monkey then sprang down from the roof and turned back into himselfHe produced his cudgel from his ear and waved it till it was the thickness of a duck egg then with a loud bang broke down the side door ran into the garden at the back and called out Master Untie me quick disciple the venerable elder saidBeing roped up like this has been agony Be patient Master said MonkeyWhen Ive killed the evil spirit Ill come and untie you He then hurried back into the hall lifted his cudgel and was about to strike when he stopped and thought No this is wrongI ought to release the master before I kill the evil spirit He went back into the garden where he changed his mind againNo Ill kill the monster first This happened two or three times till finally he came dancing back into the garden where his masters grief turned to joy at the sight of himYou monkey he said I suppose its because youre beside yourself with pleasure at seeing me still alive that youre dancing about like that Only then did Monkey go up to him untie him and help him walk awayThe man tied to the other tree then called out Please save me too in your great mercy my lord The venerable elder stopped and said Untie him too Wukong Whos he Monkey asked Journey to the West He was captured and brought here a day before me Sanzang repliedHes a woodcutter He tells me his mother is very old and he is most worried about her He is a very dutiful sonYou must save him too Doing as he was bid Monkey untied the other man and took them both out through the back gate up the scar and across the ravineThank you for rescuing this man and me worthy disciple said SanzangWhere are Wuneng and Wujing Mourning for you over there Monkey replied Give them a shout Sanzang then shouted at the top of his voice BajieBajie The idiot who had been weeping so much that his head was spinning wiped away the snot and tears to call Friar Sand the masters come back as a ghostThat him calling isnt it Idiot shouted Monkey going up to him thats no ghostIts the master himself When Friar Sand looked up and saw who it was he fell to his knees in front of Sanzang and said Master youve suffered terriblyHow did big brother rescue you Monkey then told them everything that had happenedWhen Pig heard all this he gnashed his teeth unable to restrain himself from knocking the tomb mound over with one blow of his rake digging out the head and smashing it to pulp Why are you hitting it the Tang Priest askedMaster said Pig goodness only knows what kind of wretch he was but we all mourned for him It was thanks to him that Im still alive Sanzang repliedWhen you disciples attacked their gates and demanded me they took him out to fob you off withOtherwise they would have killed meI think we should bury him properly as a mark of our monastic respect When the idiot heard his master saying this he buried that bag of flesh and bone that had been beaten to a pulp and piled up a tomb mound over itMaster said Brother Monkey with a smile wont you sit here for a while while I go to wipe them out With that he leapt down the cliff crossed the ravine went into the cave and took the ropes with which the Tang Priest and the woodcutter had been hound into the hall where he used them to truss together the arms and legs of the demon king who was still asleep He then lifted the demon up with his cudgel onto his shoulder and took him out by the back doorYou like making things difficult for yourself brother said Pig when he saw him coming from a distanceWhy dont you find another to balance him Monkey then set the demon king down in front of Pig who raised his rake and was just about to hit him when Monkey said Wait a momentWe havent captured the junior devils in the cave yet If there are any left Pig said take me in with you to smash them Smashing them would be too much trouble Monkey repliedThe best thing would be to find some firewood and wipe them out that way When the woodcutter heard this he led Pig to a hollow to the East to find some broken ends of bamboo pines that had lost their needles hollow stumps of willows creepers broken off from their roots withered artemisia old reeds rushes and dead mulberryThey carried a lot of this into the back entrance where Monkey set it alight and Pig fanned the flames with both earsThen the Great Sage sprang up shook himself and put the Journey to the West sleepinsect hairs back on his bodyWhen the junior devils woke up they were all already on firePoor thingsNone of them had the faintest chance of survivingWhen the whole cave was burnt right out the disciples went back to see the masterWhen Sanzang saw that the senior demon had woken up and was shouting he called Disciples the evil spirit has come round Pig went up and killed him with one blow of his rake whereupon the ogre turned back into his real form as a leopard spirit with a coat patterned like mugwort flowersLeopards with flowerpatterned coats can eat tigers Monkey observed and this one could turn into a human tooKilling him has prevented a lot of serious trouble in future The venerable elder could not express his gratitude strongly enough and he then mounted the saddleMy home isnt far from here to the Southwest sirs said the woodcutterI invite you to come there to meet my mother and accept my kowtows of thanks for saving my lifeThen Ill see you gentlemen along your way Sanzang was happy to accept and instead of riding he walked there with his three disciples and the woodcutter After they had followed a winding path to the Southwest for a short distance this is what they sawLichen growing across a stoneflagged path Wisteria joining across the wicker gate Chains of mountains on every side And a wood full of singing birdsA dense thicket of pine and bamboo Rare and wonderful flowers in profusionThe place is remote and deep amid the clouds A thatched cottage with a bamboo fenceWhile they were still some distance away they could make out an old woman leaning on the wicker gate with tears streaming from her eyes weeping and calling to heaven and earth for her sonAs soon as the woodcutter saw his mother he left the Tang Priest behind as he rushed straight to the gate knelt down and said Mother Im back Throwing her arms around him the woman said My boy when you didnt come home for days on end I thought the mountain lord must have caught you and killed you Ive suffered terrible heartacheIf you werent killed why didnt you come back beforeWhere are your carryingpole ropes and axe The woodcutter kowtowed as he replied Mother the mountain lord did capture me and tie me to a treeI was lucky to escape with my life thanks to these gentlemen They are arhats sent by the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western HeavenThis gentleman was captured by the mountain lord and tied to a tree as wellHis three disciples have enormous magic powers They killed the mountain lord with a single blowhe was a leopard with mugwort flower spots who had become a spiritThey burnt all the junior devils to Journey to the West death untied the senior gentleman and then untied me tooI owe them a tremendous debt of gratitudebut for them your son would certainly be deadNow that the mountain is completely safe Ill be able to walk around at night without any danger After hearing this the old woman came forward to greet Sanzang and his disciples kowtowing at every step Then she led them in through the wicker gate to sit down in the thatched cottageMother and son next performed endless kowtows as expressions of their gratitude before hastily and in a fluster preparing them some vegetarian food as a mark of their thanksBrother said Pig to the woodcutter I know youre hard up hereJust put something simple together for us Dont go to a lot of trouble and effort Quite frankly sir the woodcutter replied were very poor here We dont have any gill fungus button mushrooms peppers or aniseed All we can offer you gentlemen are some wild vegetables Were putting you to a lot of trouble said PigBe as quick as you canWere starving Itll soon be ready the woodcutter replied and before long a table and stools were set out and wiped clean and several dishes of wild vegetables servedTenderscalded day lilies White lumps of pickled scallion Knotweed and purslane Shepherds purse and goosegut blossom The swallows stay away was delicious and tender The tiny fists of beansprouts were crisp and greenIndigo heads boiled soft Whitestewed dog footprints Cats ears Wild turnips All with tender and tasty gray noodlesScissor shafts Oxpool aid Tipped in the

dont need oil when combined with dark indigoA meal of every kind of wild vegetable As a mark of the woodcutters reverent thanksWhen master and disciples had eaten their fill they packed up ready to start out againNot daring to press them to stay the woodcutter asked his mother to come out and bow to them in thanks againHe then kowtowed fetched a club of jujube wood fastened his clothes tight and came out to see them on their wayFriar Sand led the horse Pig carried the shoulderpole and Monkey followed close behind them while the master put his hands together on the back of the horse and said Brother woodcutter could you kindly lead us to the main trackWe will take out leave of you there Together they then climbed high went down slopes Journey to the West skirted ravines and negotiated inclinesDisciples said the venerable elder thoughtfully as he rode Since leaving my monarch to come to the West I have made a long journey across a great distanceAt each river and mountain I have met with disaster Barely escaping from monsters and fiendsMy heart has been set on the Three Stores of scriptures And my every thought is of Heaven aboveWhen will my toil and my labor be endedWhen will I go home my journey completed When the woodcutter heard Sanzang saying this he said Dont be so downhearted sirIts only some three hundred miles West along this road to India the land of paradise As soon as Sanzang heard this he dismounted and replied Thank you for bringing us so farNow that we are on the main track please go home now brother woodcutter and give our respects to your venerable mother We poor monks have no way to reward you for the sumptuous meal you gave us just now except by reciting surras morning and evening to protect you and your mother and enable both of you to live to be a hundred The woodcutter took his leave of them and went back by the way he had cameMaster and disciples then headed West togetherIndeed The ogre subdued and wrongs set to right he escaped from his peril Having been shown this kindness he set out on his way with the greatest of careIf you dont know how long it was till they reached the Western Heaven listen to the explanation in the next installmentWhen Heaven Is Offended in Fengxian It Stops the Rain The Great Sage Urges Goodness and Brings a Downpour Journey to the West Deep and mysterious is the Great Way What news is there of itWhen revealed it will alarm ghosts and divine beings It controls the universe Divides darkness and light In the world of true happiness there is no competitionBefore the Vulture Peak Pearls and jewels emerge Shining with every colorIt illuminates all beings that live between heaven and earth Those who understand it live as long as mountains and seasThe story tells how Sanzang and his three disciples took their leave of the woodcutter on the Hidden Clouds Mountain and hurried along the main roadAfter they had been going for several days they suddenly saw a walled and moated city not far before themWukong said Sanzang is that city ahead of us India do you think No no said Monkey shaking his headAlthough the Tathagata lives in a paradise there are no cities there Its a great mountain Vulture Peak on which are the high buildings and halls of Thunder Monastery Even if weve now reached the land of India this isnt where the Buddha livesI dont know how far India is from Vulture PeakPresumably this city is one of the frontier prefectures of IndiaWell know when we get there Soon they were outside the city where Sanzang dismounted to go in through the triple gates Here they found the people destitute and the streets desertedWhen they reached the market there were many blackclad government servants lined up on either side of a number of officials wearing their hats and sashes of office and standing under the eaves of a buildingAs the four travelers came along the road these men did not give way at all so Pig in his rough way raised his snout and shouted Out of the wayOut of the way When the men looked up with a start and saw what he looked like their bones went soft their sinews turned numb and they fell over shouting Evil spiritsEvil spirits This gave the officials standing under the eaves such a fright that they were shivering as they bowed and asked Where are you from Sanzang who was worried that his disciples would cause trouble pushed himself forward and said to the men I am a monk sent by His Majesty the Great Tang emperor to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery in the land of IndiaOur journey brings us to this distinguished place but as we do not know its name and have not yet found a place to stay we hope that you gentlemen will Journey to the West forgive us if we have caused any offence to your customs on entering your city Only then did the officials return his courtesy and say This is the prefecture of Fengxian one of the frontier prefectures of IndiaBecause we have been suffering from drought for years on end the marquis has sent us to put up a notice here calling for masters of the Dharma to pray for rain and save the people Wheres the notice asked Monkey when he heard thisHere the officials said The arcade has only just been swept clean we havent posted it yet Bring it here and show me said Brother MonkeyThe officials then opened the notice out and hung it up under the eaves Monkey and the others went up to read it and this was what was written on itShangguan Marquis of Fengxian Prefecture in Great India issues this notice to invite enlightened teachers and great masters of the Dharma This country with its prosperous soldiers and people has been afflicted with drought for years Military and civil land alike has been devastated the rivers have dried up and the ditches are emptyThere is no water in the wells and the springs have stopped flowingWhile the rich are barely managing to stay alive the poor cannot surviveA bushel of wheat costs a hundred pieces of silver a bundle of firewood costs five ouncesGirls of ten are being sold for three pints of rice boys of five are being given to whoever will take themBecause the city dwellers fear the law they pawn their clothes to buy the necessities for survival but in the countryside thugs rob and eat people in order to liveI have therefore issued this notice in the hope that wise and worthy men from all around will pray for rain to save the peopleThe will be richly rewarded for their kindness with a thousand pieces of silver This is no empty promiseLet those who would take it up come to this noticeWhen he had read it Monkey asked the officials Whats Shangguan Shangguan is our marquis surname they repliedIts a very rare surname said Monkey with a laughYouve never been to school brother said PigTheres a bit at the end of the book The Hundred Surnames that goes Ouyang and Shangguan Stop this idle chatter disciples said SanzangIf any of you know how to pray for rain bring them a fall of timely rain and save the people from this affliction that would be a very good thing indeed to doIf you cannot we must be on our way and waste no more time Whats so difficult about praying for rain Monkey askedI can turn rivers upside down stir up the sea move the stars and constellations about kick the sky churn up water in wells breathe out mist and clouds carry mountains drive the moon along and summon wind and rain Theyre all childs playNothing to them When the officials heard this they sent two of their number straight to the prefectural offices to report Your Excellency something very splendid indeed has happened The marquis who was burning incense and praying silently at the time asked what it was when he heard that something splendid had happenedWe were taking the notice to post at the entrance to the market the officials replied when four monks came along who said that they have been sent by the Great Tang in the East to the Great Thunder Monastery in India to worship the Buddha and fetch the scripturesAs soon as they Journey to the West read the notice they said they could bring timely rain which is why we have come here to report Refusing to take a sedanchair horse or large retinue the marquis went on foot in his robes of office straight to the entrance to the market in order to invite the strangers with the utmost courtesy to pray for rainHis Excellency the marquis is here it was suddenly announced and everybody moved out of the wayAs soon as he saw the Tang Priest the marquis who showed no fear of his hideous disciples prostrated himself in the middle of the street and said I am Marquis Shangguan of Fengxian Prefecture and I have bathed and perfumed myself in order to beg you teachers to pray for the rain that will save the peopleI implore you in your great mercy to give play to your divine powers and bring us deliverance Returning his courtesies Sanzang said This is no place to talkWe will be able to act when we have gone to a monastery Please come with me to my humble palace the marquis repliedWe have a pure place there Master and disciples then led the horse and carried the luggage straight to the palace where they all exchanged greetings and the marquis ordered tea and a vegetarian mealWhen the food arrived a little later Pig ate for all he was worth like a hungry tiger terrifying the waiters who trembled as they kept coming and going with more and more soup and rice They looked like the figures on one of those revolving lanterns and they could just keep him supplied until he had eaten his fill Only then did he stopWhen the meal was over the Tang Priest expressed his thanks then asked How long has the drought lasted here Your Excellency To this the marquis replied This is a part of the great land of India Fengxian Prefecture of which I am governorFor three years on end we have suffered from drought Grass does not grow and the grain has all diedBusiness is hard for rich and for poor Nearly all of the families are weeping with griefTwo thirds of the people have now died of starvation The rest barely survive like a candle flame in the windI have issued a notice for worthies And am lucky you monks have come to our landIf you bring the people a whole inch of rain A thousand in silver will be your reward Journey to the West When Monkey heard this his face showed his pleasure as he chuckled Dont say that dont say thatIf you promise us a reward of a thousand pieces of silver you wont get a single drop of rainBut if you put it in terms of accumulating merit Ill provide you with plenty of rain The marquis a thoroughly upright and good man who cared deeply for his people invited Monkey to take the seat of honour then bowed to him and said Teacher if you really can show us this great compassion this humble official will do nothing to offend against morality Please get up said Monkey only look after my master well while I do the job How are you going to do it brother asked Friar Sand You and Pig are to must come here and be my assistants outside while I summon a dragon to make rain Monkey repliedPig and Friar Sand did as he bade them and while the three of them went outside the marquis burned incense and prayedSanzang sat there reciting sutrasWhile Monkey recited the spell and said the magic words a dark cloud appeared to the East and slowly moved till it was in front of the hall it was Ao Guang the ancient dragon of the Eastern SeaAo Guang then put away his cloud feet and turned himself into human form to go up to Monkey bow low to him with full courtesy and ask What have you sent for this humble dragon to do Great Sage Please rise Monkey repliedThe only reason why I have troubled you to make this long journey is because there has been a drought in this prefecture of Fengxian for years on endId like to ask you if you couldnt send some rain I must inform you Great Sage the dragon replied that although I can make rain I can only act on the orders of HeavenI would never dare come here to make rain on my own authority without Heavens instructions As our journey brought us this way I asked you specially to come here to make rain and save the people said Monkey so why are you trying to get out of it Id never dare the dragon king repliedI came because you summoned me with the magic words Great Sage and Id never dare try to get out of itIn the first place I havent had an edict from Heaven and secondly I havent brought the magic rainmaking generals with me How could I Great SageIf you wish to be a savior you must let me go back to the sea to muster my forces while you go to the heavenly palace to obtain an imperial edict for a fall of rain and ask the officials in charge of water to release us dragons so that I can make rain in the quantities ordered Accepting the force of his argument Brother Monkey had to let the old dragon go back to the seaHe then told the Tang Priest what the dragon king had saidIn that case you had better go and do that the Tang Priest saidBut dont be telling lies Monkey then told Pig and Friar Sand to look after the master while he went up to the heavenly palaceNo sooner had the splendid Great Sage said he was going than he was out of sightWhere has Lord Sun gone the marquis asked trembling with shockJourney to the West Hes gone up to Heaven on a cloud replied Pig with a grinWith great reverence the marquis then issued an urgent order that all the people in the big and little streets of the city whether nobility high officials gentry commoners soldiers or civilians were to worship dragonking tablets and set out water urns with sprigs of willow in them in front of their gates They were also to burn incense and pray to HeavenOnce on his somersault cloud Monkey went straight to the Western Gate of Heaven where the Heavenly King Lokapala soon appeared at the head of his heavenly soldiers and warriors to greet him and say Great Sage have you fetched the scriptures yet Quite soon now Monkey repliedWeve reached a frontier prefecture called Fengxian on the borders of India nowIt hasnt rained for three whole years there and the people are suffering terribly I want to pray for rain to save themI sent for the dragon king but he told me that he couldnt do it on his own authority without a heavenly order which is why Ive come to see the Jade Emperor to request an edict I dont think its supposed to rain there the heavenly king saidI heard just now that the marquis of Fengxian had behaved disgracefully and offended both Heaven and Earth His Majesty took it badly and immediately had a rice mountain a flour mountain and a huge gold lock set up It wont rain till all three have been knocked over or snapped Not understanding what all this was about Monkey demanded to see the Jade Emperor and not daring to stop him the heavenly king let him inGoing straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness Brother Monkey was met by the four heavenly teachers who asked What are you here for Great Sage On my journey escorting the Tang Priest Ive reached Fengxian Prefecture on the frontiers of India where there is a drought Monkey repliedThe marquis there has been asking for magicians to pray for rain I sent for the dragon king to order him to make rain but he said that he could not do so on his own authority without an edict from the Jade EmperorI have now come to request an edict in order to relieve the peoples suffering But its not supposed to rain there said the four heavenly teachersAs to whether its supposed to rain or not said Monkey with a smile could I trouble you to take me in to submit a memorial so that I can find out whether I can still get a favour done To this the heavenly teacher Ge Xianweng replied As the saying goes a fly that needs a net for a veilwhat a nerve Dont talk nonsense said Xu of JingyangJust take him in Qiu Hongji Zhang Daoling Ge and Xu took Monkey to the outside of the Hall of Miraculous Mist where they reported Your Majesty Sun Wukong has reached Fengxian Prefecture in India and wants to obtain rainHe has come to ask for an edict Three years ago the Jade Emperor replied on the twentyfifth day of the twelfth month when we were inspecting the myriad heavens and travelling through the three worlds we arrived at his cityWe saw that Shangguan was most wicked he knocked over the vegetarian offerings to heaven to feed to dogs spoke foully and was guilty of lesemajeste That is why we set up those three things in the Hall of Fragrance Take Sun Wukong to see themWhen those three things have been accomplished we will issue our edict but if they are not then do not meddle in what does not concern you Journey to the West When the four heavenly teachers led Brother Monkey to the Hall of Fragrance he saw a mountain of rice about a hundred feet high and a mountain of flour about two hundred feet highBeside the rice mountain was a chicken the size of a fist eating the rice sometimes with quick pecks sometimes with slow onesBeside the flour mountain was a goldenhaired Pekinese licking the flour sometimes with long licks and sometimes with short onesTo the left of it a golden padlock about one foot three or four inches long hung from an iron frame The crossbar of the lock was about the thickness of a finger and under it was a lamp the flame of which was heating the barNot understanding what all this was about Monkey turned back to ask the heavenly teachers What does it mean When that wretch offended Heaven the Jade Emperor had these three things set up the heavenly teachers repliedThat place will only be due for rain when the chicken has eaten all the rice the dog has licked up all the flour and the lamp has melted the bar of the lock When Monkey heard this he went pale with shock and he dared make no more memorials to the throneHe left the palace hall overcome with embarrassmentDont take it so badly Great Sage said the four heavenly teachers with smiles This is something that can be resolved through goodnessOnce a single kind thought moves Heaven the rice and flour mountains will collapse and the bar of the padlock will be brokenIf you can persuade the marquis to return to goodness then blessings will come of themselves Monkey accepted their advice and instead of going back to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to take his leave of the Jade Emperor he headed straight down to the lower world and its ordinary mortalsWithin an instant he was at the Western Gate of Heaven where he saw Heavenly King Lokapala again who asked Did you get the decree you wanted Monkey told him about the rice and flour mountains and the metal lock What you said to me was quire right he continued The Jade Emperor refuses to issue a decreeJust now the heavenly teachers told me as they saw me off that the secret of blessings lay in persuading that soandso to return to goodness With that Monkey took his leave and went down to the lower world on his cloudWhen the marquis Sanzang Pig Friar Sand and the officials high and low all welcomed him back they crowded round him asking questionsMonkey then shouted at the marquis Its all because on the twentyfifth day of the twelfth month three years ago you offended Heaven and Earth that the people are suffering you wretchThats why rain wont be sent now At this the marquis was so alarmed that he fell to his knees prostrated himself on the ground and asked How do you know about what happened three years ago teacher Why did you knock the vegetarian offerings to Heaven over to feed to dogs said Monkey Youd better tell me the truth Not daring to conceal anything the marquis said On the twentyfifth of the twelfth month three years ago I was making offerings to Heaven within the palace As my wife was wicked we quarreled and said bad things to each other In an unthinking outburst of fury I knocked over the table with the offerings and scattered the vegetarian food Its true that I called the dogs to eat it up I never realized that Heaven would take offence at this and harm the common peopleFor the last couple of years it has been preying on my mind My thoughts have been disturbed and I havent been able to understand whyI never realized that it was because Heaven had taken offence that it was inflicting this disaster on the common peopleNow that you have come down to visit us teacher I beg you to enlighten me on what the upper world intends to do Journey to the West That happened to be a day on which the Jade Emperor was visiting the lower world Monkey repliedWhen he saw you feed the vegetarian food to the dogs and heard your foul language the Jade Emperor set three things up to remember you by What three things brother Pig askedIn the Hall of Fragrance he had set up a rice mountain about a hundred feet high and a flour mountain about two hundred feet highBeside the rice mountain is a chicken the size of a fist whos eating it with quick pecks and slow pecksBeside the flour mountain is a goldenhaired Pekinese licking the flour up with long licks and short licksAnd to the left is an iron frame from which hangs a golden padlock with a crossbar the thickness of a finger under which a lamp is burning and warming the barYou will only be due for rain here whenthe chickens eaten all the rice the dogs licked up all the flour and the lamp has melted the bar of the lock No problem said Pig no problemIf you take me with you brother I can do a transformation eat all the rice and flour up in one sitting and snap the bar of the lockI can guarantee rain Dont talk nonsense you idiot said MonkeyThis is a plan thats been made by Heaven Youll never be able to get there From what you say I dont know what to do said SanzangIts easy said Monkey easyAs I was leaving the four heavenly teachers said to me that this could only be solved through goodness The marquis then prostrated himself on the ground again and said imploringly I will do just as you tell me teacher If your heart can turn back to goodness Monkey replied I hope that youll at once start invoking the Buddha and reciting scriptures Then Ill be able to help youIf you persist in refusing to reform therell be nothing I can do to get you off It wont be long before Heaven executes you and your life will be beyond saving The marquis kowtowed in worship swearing to return to the faithAt once he summoned all the Buddhist and Taoist clergy in the city and ordered that a site be prepared for religious ceremonies They were all to write out documents and memorials for three daysThe marquis led his followers in burning incense and worshipping thanking Heaven and Earth and repenting of his sinsSanzang recited surras on his behalfAt the same time urgent notices were sent out ordering all the men and women young and old in all the households inside and outside the city to burn incense sticks and invoke the BuddhaFrom that moment on all ears were filled with virtuous sounds Only then did Brother Monkey feel happyYou two look after the master he said to Pig and Friar Sand while I go off for him again Where are you going this time brother Pig askedThe marquis really believed what I told him and is being reverent good and kind Monkey replied and hes sincerely invoking the Buddhas nameSo Im going back to submit another request for rain to the Jade Emperor If youre going dont lose any time brother said Friar SandThis is holding us up on our journey But do get a fall of rainitll be another true achievement for us Journey to the West The splendid Great Sage set his cloud off once more and went straight to the gate of Heaven where he met Heavenly King Lokapala againWhat have you come for now Lokapala askedThe marquis has mended his ways Monkey replied which pleased the Heavenly KingAs they were talking the Straight Spell Messenger arrived at the gate of Heaven to deliver letters and documents written by Taoist and Buddhist clergyWhen he saw Monkey the messenger bowed and said This is all the result of your successful conversion Great Sage Where are you taking those letters Monkey askedStraight to the Hall of Universal Brightness the messenger replied to give to the heavenly teachers to pass on to the Great Heavenly Honoured One the Jade Emperor In that case youd better go first and Ill follow Monkey saidThe messenger then went in through the heavenly gateGreat Sage said Heavenly King Lokapala theres no need for you to go to see the Jade EmperorYou should go to borrow some thunder gods from the Office of Response to the Primary in the Ninth Heaven then set off thunder and lightning After that therell certainly be rain Monkey accepted this suggestion and went in through the gate of HeavenInstead of going to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to ask for an edict he at once turned his cloudtreading steps towards the Office of Response to the Primary in the Ninth Heaven where the Envoy of the Thunder Gate the Corrector of Records and the Inspector of Probity appeared to bow and say Why are you here Great Sage Theres something Id like to see the Heavenly Honoured One about Monkey replied and the three envoys passed this on in a memorial to the Heavenly Honoured One who then came down from behind his screen of red clouds and nine phoenixes in full court dressWhen they had exchanged greetings Monkey said There is something I would like to request of you What might that be the Heavenly Honoured One askedWhile escorting the Tang Monk I have reached the prefecture of Fengxian said Brother Monkey and as they have long been suffering from drought there I promised to make it rain for themThe reason I have come here is to ask for the loan of some of your subordinate officials and generals in order to ask for rain I am aware that three things have been set up because the marquis there offended Heaven the Heavenly Honoured One replied but I have not yet heard that rain is due to fall there When I went to ask the Jade Emperor for an edict yesterday Monkey replied with a smile he told the heavenly teachers to take me to see the three things in the Hall of Fragrancethe mountain of rice the mountain of flour and the golden lock Rain isnt due to fall till these three things have been knocked down or brokenWhen I was feeling very upset because it was so difficult the heavenly teachers advised me to persuade the marquis and his people to do good deeds because Heaven is bound to help anyone who has a good thoughtSo theres a good chance of persuading Heaven to change its mind and delivering them from this disasterNow good thoughts are happening everywhere and all ears are filled with good soundsNot long ago the Straight Spell Messenger took letters showing that they had mended their ways and turned towards goodness to the Jade Emperor which is why Ive come to your illustrious palace to ask for the help of your Journey to the West thunder officials and thunder generals In that case the Heavenly Honoured One replied Ill send Deng Xin Zhang and Tao to take Mother Lightning and go with you to Fengxian Prefecture to make thunder Great Sage Before long the four generals and the Great Sage had reached the boundaries of Fengxian and started performing their magic in mid airA great ramble of thunder could be heard and there were sizzling flashes of lightningIndeed The lightning was like snakes of purple gold The thunder was like the noise of sleeping insects awakenedFlashes of light like flying fire Thunderclaps like landslides in the mountainsThe jagged lines lit up the whole of the sky The great noise caused the earth itself to moveWhen the red silk flashed like sprouts of plants Rivers and mountains shook for three thousand milesInside and outside the city of Fengxian nobody whether an official high or how a soldier or a civilian had heard thunder or seen lightning for three whole years and now that the thunder was booming and the lightning flashing they all fell to their knees put incense burners on their heads held sprigs of willow in their hands and said We submit to Amitabha Buddha We submit to Amitabha Buddha These good thoughts had indeed moved Heaven as is proved by an oldstyle poemWhen thoughts have been born in human minds Heaven and earth will both be awareIf evil and good do not get their due Sides have been taken by powers up thereWe will for the moment leave the Great Sage Monkey directing the thunder generals as they unleashed thunder and lightning over Fengxian Prefecture where everyone had turned back to goodness and tell how the Straight Spell Messenger took the Taoist and Buddhist documents straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness where the four heavenly teachers submitted them to the Jade Emperor in the Hall of Miraculous Journey to the West MistWhen the Jade Emperor had seen them he said As that wretch has had some virtuous thoughts see what has happened to the three things Just as he was speaking the official in charge of the Hall of Fragrance came in to report The rice and flour mountains have collapsedthe rice and flour all disappeared in an instantThe bar of the lock has also been broken Before he could finish submitting this memorial the heavenly official in attendance led in the local deity the city god and the gods of the altars from Fengxian who all bowed and reported The lord of our prefecture and every member of every household high and low of the people have been converted to the true achievement and are worshipping the Buddha and HeavenWe now beg you in your compassion to send a widespread fall of timely rain to deliver the common people When the Jade Emperor heard this he was very pleased so he issued an edictLet the departments of wind cloud and rain go to the lower world in accordance with orders At this hour on this day the clouds are to be spread the thunder shall roar and three feet and fortytwo drops of rain shall fall At once the four heavenly teachers transmitted the edict to the weather departments who were all to go to the lower world show their powers and act togetherMonkey was enjoying himself up in the sky with Deng Xin Zhang and Tao who were ordering Mother Lightning about when the arrival of all other gods filled the sky with their assemblyAs the wind and the clouds met the timely rain began to pour downThick heavy clouds Lowering black mists The rumbling of the thunder cart The searing flash of lightning A roaring gale A torrential downpourIndeed when one thought goes up to Heaven Ten thousand hopes are all fulfilledBecause the Great Sage has used his powers The landscape is darkened for thousands of milesThe wonderful rain falls like rivers and seas Hiding the country and heavens from sightWater comes pouring down the eaves Journey to the West Noisily pounding outside the windowsWhile every household invokes the Buddha All of the streets and markets are floodedTo East and West every channel is filled Winding streams meander to North and to SouthDriedup shoots receive moisture Withered trees reviveThe hemp and wheat now flourish in the fields Beans and other grains grow in the countrysideTraders happily travel to sell their wares Cheerful peasants get ready to workAfter this the millet will do well And the crops are bound to yield a bumper harvestWhen wind and rain are timely the people know content When rivers and seas are calm the world is at peaceThat day three feet and fortytwo drops of rain fell after which all the gods began to tidy up and go awayGods of the four departments yelled the Great Sage at the top of his voice stay there for a moment with your cloud followers while I tell the marquis to bow to you all and express his thanksYou may part the clouds and appear in your true forms to let this mortal see you with his own eyesThats the only way hell believe and make offerings When the gods heard this they all stayed where they were up in the cloudsMonkey then brought his cloud down to land and went straight into the prefectural palace where Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand all greeted himThe marquis kowtowed to him in thanks at every pace he tookStop thanking me said MonkeyIve asked the gods of the four departments to stay Could you tell everyone to come here to kowtow and thank them so that theyll make it rain properly in future The marquis issued urgent orders summoning everyone to give thanks and they all kowtowed with incensesticks in their handsThe gods of the four departmentsrain thunder cloud and windthen parted the clouds and revealed themselves in their true formThe dragon king appeared Journey to the West The thunder generals were revealed The clouds boys were seen The lords of the wind came downThe dragon king appeared With silver whiskers and an azure face he was really peerlessThe thunder generals were revealed With their countenances of matchless might and crooked mouthsThe cloud boys were seen Wearing gold crowns over faces like jadeThe lords of the wind came down With flustered brows and bulging eyesAll were displayed on the azure clouds Drawn up in ranks with their holy countenancesOnly then were the people of Fengxian convinced As they kowtowed burned incense and rejected evilToday they gazed up at the heavenly generals Washing their hearts as they all turned to goodnessThe gods stood there for two hours as the people kowtowed to them endlesslyMonkey rose up into the clouds again to bow to all the gods and say Ive put you to great trouble All you gentlemen may now returnIll make everyone in this prefecture give pure and lofty offerings to thank you at the due seasonFrom now on you gentlemen must send wind every five days and rain every ten days to help them out The gods all consented as he told them and returned to their own departmentsBringing his cloud down to land Monkey said to Sanzang Now that the jobs been done and the people given peace we can pack our things and be on our way again When the marquis heard this he hastened to bow and say How can you say such a thing Lord SunWhat has happened today has been an infinitely great act of kindnessI have sent people to prepare a humble banquet to thank you for your great kindnessThen I will buy some land from the people to build a monastery for you my lords with a shrine to you with inscribed tablets where offerings can be made in all four seasonsEven if I were to carve my own bones and heart it would be hard to repay a ten thousandth part of what I owe youYou cant possibly leave Journey to the West What Your Excellency says is very fine Sanzang replied but we are pilgrim monks who can only put up for the night on our journey West We cannot stay here longWe definitely must leave in a day or two The marquis refused to let them go and he ordered many people to prepare a banquet and start building a monastery that very nightThe next day there was a magnificent banquet at which the Tang Priest took the place of honour while the Great Sage Monkey sat beside him with Pig and Friar SandThe marquis and his officials high and low passed them cups of wine and dishes of food while fine music was played and so they were entertained all dayIt was a most happy occasion and there is a poem to prove it After long drought the fields received sweet rain Merchants were travelling along all watercoursesThey were deeply moved by the monks who had come to the city And by the Great Sage who had gone up to HeavenThe three things had now been accomplished One thought had brought all back to the goodFrom now on all longed for a new golden age With ideal weather and good harvests for everThe banquets went on for days as did the giving of thanks until they had been kept there for almost half a month All that remained to do was complete the monastery and the shrineOne day the marquis invited the four monks to go to inspect themHow did you complete so enormous a project so quickly asked the Tang Priest in astonishmentI pressed the laborers to work night and day without stopping and insisted most urgently that they finish quickly the marquis repliedNow I would like you gentlemen to come and inspect it You certainly are a most good and able marquis said Monkey with a smileBy now they had all reached the new monastery where they were full of admiration for the towering halls and the majestic entranceMonkey asked Sanzang to name the monasteryVery well Sanzang said I name it the Monastery of Salvation by Timely Rain Splendid said the marquis splendid He then issued a golden invitation to monks from far and wide to come to burn incense thereTo the left of the Buddha hall was a shrine to the four pilgrims at which offerings were to be made in each of the four seasons every yearTemples had also been built for the thunder gods and dragon gods to thank them for their divine effortsWhen the visit was over Sanzang ordered an early departureJourney to the West When the local people realized that the monks could be persuaded to stay no longer they all prepared parting gifts none of which the travelers would acceptThen all the officials in the prefecture escorted them on their way for ten miles with a band playing and a great display of flags and canopies Still loath to let the travelers go the officials watched with tears in their eyes till they had disappeared from sight Only then did the officials return to the city IndeedThe virtuous and holy monk left behind the Salvation Monastery The Great Sage Equaling Heaven dispensed great kindnessIf you dont know how many more days after this departure it was that they finally saw the Tathagata Buddha listen to the explanation in the next installmentWhen the Dhyana Reaches Yuhua a Display of Magic Is Given The MindApe and the Mother of Wood Take Their Own Disciples The story tells how after happily taking their leave of the marquis the Tang Priest turned to Monkey as he rode and said Worthy disciple this good result was even better than rescuing the babies in Bhiksuland and it was all your achievement In Bhiksuland you only saved  little boys said Friar SandThats no comparison with this heavy soaking rain thats saved tens of thousands of livesIve been quietly admiring my big brothers magical powers that extend right up to the heavens as well as his mercy that covers the whole earth Merciful and good our big brother may be said Pig with a laugh but its just a show of being kind Inside hes a troublemakerWhen hes with me he treats me like dirt When have I ever treated you like dirt Monkey protestedOften enough replied PigYoure always seeing to it that I get tied up hung up boiled and steamedAfter being so kind to all those tens of thousands of people in Fengxian you should have stayed there for half a year and let me have a few more good filling mealsWhy did you have to be sending us on our way When the venerable elder heard this he shouted You idiot Can you think of nothing but your greedStop quarrelling and be on your way Daring say no more Pig thrust out his snout shouldered the luggage and followed the master and his fellow disciples along the road laughing loudlyTime moved as fast as a shuttle and soon it was late autumn What could be seen was The end of ripples on the waters The mountains bones looking leanJourney to the West Red leaves fly around In the time of yellowing flowersUnder the clear and frosty sky the nights seem longer The moon shines white through the windowsMany the household fires in the evening light The water gleams cold all over the lakeThe clover fern is now white While knotweed blooms redMandarins are green and oranges yellow Willows are withering and the millet is ripeBeside the desolate village wild geese land among the reeds Cocks call by the country inn while the beans are harvestedWhen the four of them had been travelling for a long time they saw the towering shape of a city wallWukong said Sanzang waving his ridingcrop you can see theres another city thereI wonder where it is Neither of us have ever been here before Monkey replied so how could I knowLets go ahead and ask Before the words were out of his mouth an old man appeared from among some trees He was leaning on a stick lightly dressed with coconut sandals on his feet and had a sash round his waistThe Tang Priest hastily dismounted and went over to greet the old manReturning his greeting as he leaned on his stick the old man asked Where are you from reverend sir I am a poor monk sent by the Tang court in the East to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and fetch the scriptures the Tang Priest replied putting his hands together in front of his chestNow that I have come to this distinguished place I wonder which city it is that I can see in the distance and I would ask you venerable benefactor to inform me When the old man heard this he replied Enlightened master of the dhyana this humble place of ours is Yuhua County in one of the prefectures of IndiaThe lord of our city is a member of the king of Indias royal family who has been made prince of YuhuaHe is a very worthy prince who respects both Buddhist and Taoist clergy and cares deeply for the common peopleIf you go to see him he will certainly treat you with great respect Sanzang thanked the old man who went off through the woodsSanzang then turned back to tell his disciples what had happenedThe three of them were happily going to help the master back on his horse when Sanzang said Its not farThere is no need to ride The four of them Journey to the West then walked to a street beside the city wall to take a lookThis was an area where traders lived it was crowded with people and business was goodThe people looked and sounded no different from those of ChinaBe careful disciples said SanzangOn no account must you act wild At that Pig bowed his head and Friar Sand covered his face leaving only Monkey to support the masterOn both sides of the road people were crowding in to look at them shouting We only have eminent monks who subdue dragons and tigers here Weve never seen monks who subdue pigs and monkeys before This was more than Pig could standThrusting his snout at them he said Have you ever seen a monk in all your life who subdued the king of the pigs This gave all the people in the street so bad a fright that they fell back on both sides of them stumbling and tripping over trying to get awayPut that snout away at once you idiot said Monkey with a grin and dont try to make yourself look prettyJust pay attention while youre crossing the bridge The idiot lowered his head and kept grinningOnce over the drawbridge they entered the city where the main roads were bustling and prosperous with bars and houses of entertainmentIt was indeed a city in a divine region and there is a poem to prove it that goes An eternally ironstrong city like splendid brocade Full of fresh color lying next to a river near mountains Connected by boat with lakes for the movement of goods A thousand wineshops await behind curtainsEverywhere smoke rises from towering buildings Each morning the lanes are filled with the hubbub of tradersThe look of the city was much like Changan Cockcrows and the barking of dogs were all just the sameI have heard tell of the foreigners in the West Sanzang thought with secret delight but I have never come here beforeOn close examination it is no different from our Great TangThis must be what is meant by paradise When he learned that a bushel of hulled rice cost only four tenths of an ounce of silver and a pound of sesame oil only eight thousandths of an ounce of silver he realized that this truly was a place where crops grew in abundanceAfter walking for quite a long time they reached the prince of Yuhuas palaceOn either side of the palace gates were the office of the remembrancer the law courts the princes kitchens and the government hostelDisciples said Sanzang here is the palaceWait while I go inside for the prince to inspect our passport and let us on our way We cant very well stand at the gates while you go in Master said PigJourney to the West Can you not see Government Hostel written over that gateway Sanzang askedGo and sit there and see if you can buy some fodder for the horseIf the prince offers me a meal when I have my audience with him I will send for you to share it Go on in Master and dont worry said Brother MonkeyI can cope Friar Sand carried the luggage into the hostel where the staff were so alarmed by their hideous faces that they did not dare ask them any questions or send them away but could only invite them to sit downMeanwhile the master changed his habit and hat and went straight into the princes palace with the passport in his handsSoon he was met by a protocol officer who asked Where are you from reverend sir I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery Sanzang repliedNow that I have reached this distinguished place I would like to have my passport inspected and returned which is why I have come to seek an audience with His Royal Highness The protocol officer passed this on and as the prince was indeed an enlightened one he sent for Sanzang at onceSanzang bowed in greeting before the princes hall and the prince invited him into the hall to sit downWhen the prince read the passport that Sanzang handed him and saw the seals and signatures from so many countries on it he signed it himself folded it up and put it on his tableVenerable Teacher of the Nation he said you have passed through many countries on your way here from Great TangHow long has your journey taken I have kept no record of the distance Sanzang said but some years ago the Boddhisattva Guanyin appeared to me and left an address in verse in which it was said that the road would be sixty thousand miles longI have already seen fourteen winters and summers on my journey That means fourteen years the prince repliedI should imagine that there were many delays along the way It would be hard to tell of them all said SanzangThere were thousands of monsters and I dont know how much suffering to be endured before I could reach here The prince was so pleased with his visitor that he ordered his kitchens to prepare a vegetarian meal for himI wish to inform Your Royal Highness that I have three disciples Sanzang said As they are waiting outside I will not be able to delay our journey by accepting the meal The prince then ordered his aides to go straight out to invite the venerable elders three disciples into the palace to share the mealWhen the aides went out with this invitation they said We cant see them we cant see them There are three hideous monks sitting in the hostel one of their staff saidMust be them The aides and their staff then went to the hostel where they asked the people in charge Which are the disciples of the monk from Great Tang whos going to fetch the scripturesHis Royal Highness has invited them to a meal As soon as Pig who was sitting there snoozing heard the word meal he could not help jumping up and saying We are we are at the sight of which the palace aides souls flew from their bodies as they shivered and said A pig demonA pig demon When Monkey heard this he seized hold of Pig and said Act a bit more civilized brother and dont be so wild When the officials saw Monkey they all said A monkey spiritA monkey spirit Journey to the West Theres no need to be frightened said Friar Sand raising his hands together in polite greetingWere all disciples of the Tang Priest A stove god a stove god was the officials reaction to the sight of himMonkey then told Pig to lead the horse and Friar Sand to shoulder the carryingpole as they followed the officials staff into the prince of Yuhuas palaceThe aides went ahead to announce themWhen the prince looked up and saw how ugly they were he too was frightened Do not be alarmed Your Royal Highness said Sanzang putting his hands together in front of his chestAlthough my rough disciples are ugly they have good hearts Pig intoned a noise of respect and said How do you do This made the prince feel even more alarmedAll my rough disciples are from the wilds and the mountains and they do not know how to behave Sanzang explained so please forgive them Overcoming his fear the prince told the superintendent of his kitchens to take the monks to eat in the Gauze PavilionSanzang thanked the prince came down from the hall to proceed to the pavilion with his disciples then grumbled at Pig You idiot he said youve not a shred of mannersIf you had kept your mouth shut that would have been fine but why did you have to be so coarseThat one remark from you was enough to knock a mountain over I did better by not making a respectful chant said Monkey and I saved a bit of my breath too You didnt even intone the chant properly said Friar Sand to PigFirst of all you stuck your snout out and roared It makes me hopping mad said PigThe other day the master told me that the polite thing when I met someone was to say How do you do I do it today and you tell me its wrongHow do you want me to behave I told you to say How do you do when you meet people Sanzang replied but not to make such a fool of yourself when you meet a princeAs the saying goes things like people come in gradesWhy cant you see the differences of social rank While he was still making these remarks the superintendent of the kitchens led servants in to set out tables and chairs and serve the vegetarian feastThen the monks stopped talking and started eating their mealWhen the prince withdrew from the palace hall to his living quarters his three sons noticed his pallor and asked What has given you such a fright today Father A most remarkable monk has arrived the prince repliedHe has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures and he came to present his passportWhen I invited him to take a meal he told me that he had some disciples outside the palace so I asked them inWhen they came in a moment later they didnt kowtow to me but just said How do you do That was upsetting enoughThen when I looked at them I saw that they were all as ugly as demons which gave me quite a shockThats why Im looking pale Now the three young princes were no ordinary boys They were all fond of the martial arts so they stretched out their hands rolled up their sleeves and said They must be evil spirits from the mountains disguised as Journey to the West humansWait while we fetch our weapons and take a look at them Splendid young princes The eldest wielded a browhigh rod the second a ninetoothed rake and the third a blackpainted cudgel and the three of them strode with great valour and spirit out of the palace shouting Whats this about monks fetching scripturesWhere are they Young prince replied the superintendent of the kitchens and the others on their knees theyre eating in the Gauze Pavilion The young princes then charged straight in without stopping to think as they shouted Are you men or monstersTell us at once and well spare your lives This gave Sanzang such a fright that he turned pale dropped his bowl bowed to them and replied I have come from Great Tang to fetch the scripturesI am a man not a monster You look human enough the princes said but the three ugly ones are definitely monsters Pig kept eating and ignored them while Friar Sand and Monkey bowed and said Were all humanOur faces may be ugly but our hearts are good and despite our clumsy bodies we have good naturesWhere are you three from and why are you shooting your mouths off so wildly These three gentlemen are His Royal Highnesss sons explained the superintendent of the kitchens and the others who were standing at the side of the pavilionWell Your Highnesses said Pig throwing down his bowl what are you carrying those weapons forDo you want a fight with us The second prince strode forward wielding his rake in both hands to strike at Pig which made him say with a chuckle That rake of yours is only fit to be the grandson of my one With that he stripped down pulled his own rake out from his belt and swung it making ten thousand beams of golden light then went through some movements leaving a thousand strands of auspicious vaporThe second prince was so terrified that his hands went weak and his muscles turned numb and he lost the nerve for any more showing offWhen Monkey saw that the oldest of the young princes was leaping about with a browhigh rod he brought his own goldbanded cudgel out from his ear and shook it to make it as thick as a bowl and twelve or thirteen feet longRamming it into the ground he made a hole about three feet deep in which it stood upright then said with a smile Im giving you this cudgel As soon as the prince heard this he threw his own rod down and went to take the cudgel but though he pulled at it with all his strength he couldnt move it by as much as a hairs breathThen he straightened himself up and shook it but it was as if it had taken rootAt this the third prince started acting wild moving into the attack with his blackpainted cudgelFriar Sand dodged the blow then brought out his own demonquelling staff and as he fingered it brilliant light and glowing coloured clouds came from it leaving the superintendent of the kitchens and the rest of them wideeyed and speechlessThe three young princes then kowtowed saying Divine teachers divine teachers we mere mortals failed to recognize youWe beg you to give us a display of your powers Monkey went up to them effortlessly picked up his cudgel and said Its too cramped here for me to do my stuffIm jumping up into the auto play around and give you something to see Journey to the West The splendid Great Sage went whistling up by somersault and stood on an auspicious cloud of many colours up in midair about three hundred feet above the groundThen he moved up and down and spun to left and right as he performed a Canopy from Which Flowers Are Scattered and a Twisting Dragon with his goldbanded club At first both he and the cudgel moved like flowers being added to brocade but later he could no longer be seen as the whole sky was filled with the whirling cudgelAs he roared his approval from down below Pig could not keep still and with a great shout of Im going to have a bit of fun too the splendid idiot rode a breeze up into the air and started swinging his rakeHe went three times up four times down five times to the left six times to the right seven times forwards and eight times backwards as he ran through all the movements he knew filling the air with a noise like a howling galeJust when he had warmed up Friar Sand said to Sanzang Master let me go up and give a show too Springing up into the air with both feet the splendid monk whirled his club through the air which glittered with golden lightWielding his demonsubduing cudgel he performed a Red Phoenix Facing the Sun and a Hungry Tiger Seizing Its Prey attacking hard and defending with time to spare as he turned for a sudden forward thrustThe three brother disciples all gave a most imposing display of their magical powersThis was indeed An image of the dhyana no common sight The causation of the Great Way filling all of spaceMetal and wood fill the dharmaworld with their might A pinch of elixir produces perfect unityThe quality of these magic warriors is often displayed The splendor of their weapons is widely reveredLofty though India is The princes of Yuhua now return to the central truthThis all so terrified the three young princes that they fell to their knees in the dust and all the staff in the Gauze Pavilion high and low together with the senior prince in his palace all the soldiers civilians men and women Buddhist monks and nuns Taoist clergy lay peopleeveryone in factall invoked the Buddha kowtowed held sticks of incense and worshippedIndeed All the monks were converted at the sight of the true images Bringing blessings to mankind and the joys of peaceFrom here the achievement was won on the road to enlightenment Journey to the West All joined in meditation and worshipped the BuddhaWhen the three of them had given a display of their heroic powers they brought their auspicious clouds down to land put their weapons away joined their hands together in homage to the Tang Priest thanked him and took their seats againThe three young princes hurried back into the palace to report to their father A most wonderful thing has happened Father Today has been a tremendous successDid you see the performance in the sky just now When I saw the coloured clouds glowing in the sky a little while back I your mother and everyone else in the inner palace burned incense and worshipped the prince their father repliedI dont know where the gods or immortals who had gathered there were from They werent gods and immortals from somewhere else the young princes said They were the three hideous disciples of the monk whos going to fetch the scripturesOne of them uses a goldbanded iron cudgel one a ninetoothed take and one a demonquelling staff all exactly the same as our three weaponsWhen we asked them to give us a display they said it was too cramped down here to be able to manage so theyd go up into the sky to give us a showThen they all went up on clouds filling the sky with auspicious clouds and vaporsThey only came down a moment ago and theyre now sitting in the Gauze PavilionWe are all very taken with them and wed like to make them our teachers and learn their skills to protect the country with This really will be an enormous achievementI wonder what Your Majesty thinks When the prince their father heard this he was convinced and agreedFather and sons then went straight to the Gauze Pavilion going on foot instead of by carriage and without any parasolsThe four travelers had by now packed up their luggage and were just about to go to the palace to thank the prince for the meal and start out on their journey again when they saw the prince of Yuhua and his sons come into the pavilion and prostrate themselves before themThe venerable elder hurriedly rose and prostrated himself to return the courtesy while Monkey and the rest of them moved aside with a hint of a mocking grinWhen the kowtowing was over the four travelers were happy to go into the palace on being invited to do so and take seats of honourThen the senior prince got up and said Tang Master there is one thing I would like to ask of you but I do not know whether your three illustrious disciples will grant it My disciples will obey any instruction that Your Royal Highness gives them Sanzang repliedWhen I first saw you gentlemen said the prince I took you for pilgrim monks from distant Tang and because I am a mere mortal with fleshly eyes I treated you in a most offhand wayIt was only when I saw Teacher Sun Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand whirling around in the sky that I realized you are immortals and BuddhasMy three wretched sons have been fond of the martial arts all their lives and they now wish most sincerely to be accepted as your disciples and learn some of your skillsI beg that in the greatness of your hearts you will agree to be the salvation of my boysI will certainly reward you with all the wealth of the city When Brother Monkey heard this he could not restrain himself from replying with a chuckle You really dont understand Your Royal HighnessAs monks wed love to have disciples and your fine sons have their hearts set on goodness But you mustnt talk about material benefitsAs long as they can get on with us well Journey to the West look after them This delighted the prince who ordered a great banquet in the main hall of the palaceIt was amazingno sooner had he issued his order than everything was thereThis is what could be seen Fluttering silken decorations Darkly fragrant incense smokeGoldinlaid tables hung with knotted silks Dazzling the eyes Lacquered chairs with cushions of brocade Making them even more splendidFresh fruit Fragrant teaThree or four courses of pure confectioneries One or two servings of rich and pure breadrollsThe crisp steamed honeycakes were even finer The deepfried sweets were truly deliciousThere were jugs of mild ricewine Better than nectar when poured Servings of Yangxian tea that is fit for immortals More fragrant than cassia when held in the handsEvery possible dish is provided All that is offered is outstandingMeanwhile there was singing dancing instrumental music acrobatics and opera to entertain themMaster disciples the prince and his sons all had a day of delight and after night fell unnoticed they dispersedThe princes then had beds and curtains set up in the pavilion and invited their teachers to turn in for the night early the next morning they would piously burn incense and call on them again to ask them to teach their martial skillsThese orders were obeyed and hot scented water was brought in for the travelers to bath in after which everyone went to bedAt that time Journey to the West The birds perched high in the trees and all was silent The poet came down from his couch to end his chantingThe light of the Milky Way now filled the sky And the grass grew thicker along the overgrown pathThe bang of a washing stick came from another courtyard The distant mountains and passes made one long for homeThe chirp of crickets expressed peoples feelings Chirruping at the bedside interrupted ones dreamsThat describes the nightEarly the next morning the prince and his three sons came to call on the venerable elder againThe previous day they had greeted each other with the etiquette appropriate to a prince but todays greetings were those appropriate to teachersThe three young princes kowtowed to Monkey Pig and Friar Sand then asked with bows Will you let your disciples have a look at your weapons honoured teachers As soon as Pig heard this request he happily brought out his iron rake and threw it on the ground while Friar Sand tossed his staff against the wallThe second and third young princes sprang to their feet to pick them up but they might just as well have been dragonflies trying to shake a stone pillar they both strained themselves till they were red in the face without moving the weapons in the slightestWhen their elder brother saw this he said Dont waste your efforts brothersOur teachers weapons are all magical onesGoodness only knows how heavy they are My rakes not all that heavy said Pig with a smileIt only weighs a couple of tons pounds including the handle The third prince then asked Friar Sand how heavy his staff wasIts  pounds too replied Friar Sand with a smileThe oldest of the young princes then asked Brother Monkey to let him see the goldbanded cudgelMonkey produced the needle from his ear shook it in the wind to make it as thick as a rice bowl and stood it upright in the ground in front of him to the consternation and alarm of all the princes and officialsThe three young princes then kowtowed again and said Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand carry their weapons under their clothes where they can get them outWhy do you take yours out of your ear Teacher SunHow do you make it grow in the wind You wouldnt realize that this isnt some mere mortal object Monkey repliedWhen chaos was first parted the iron was cast Yu the Great had the work done himselfJourney to the West When he unified the depths of rivers lakes and seas This cudgel served as a measuring rodIn the prosperity after mountains and seas had been ordered It floated to the gates of the Eastern OceanOver the years it gave off a coloured glow Learned to shrink and to grow and shine with pure lightIt was my destiny to recover this rod Which endlessly changes when I say the spellWhen I tell it to grow it fills the universe But it can be as tiny as a needles eyeIts known as AsYouWill and called goldbanded In Heaven and on Earth it is quite uniqueIts weight is thirteen thousand and five hundred pounds Whether thick or fine it can bring life or deathOnce it helped me make havoc in Heaven And took part when I attacked the UnderworldIt always succeeds in subduing dragons and tigers Everywhere wipes out monsters and ogresIf it points up the sun goes dark Heaven earth gods devils all are afraidPassed on by magic since the birth of time This is no ordinary piece of iron When the young princes had heard this they all started kowtowing endlessly bowing over and over again as they earnestly begged for instructionWhich fighting skills do the three of you want to learn Monkey askedJourney to the West The one of us who uses a rod wants to learn that the young princes replied the one who fights with a rake wants to learn the rake and the staff man wants to learn the staff Teaching would be easy enough replied Monkey with a smile except that youre all too weak to be able to use our weapons so you wont be able to master themA badlydrawn tiger only looks like a dog As they used to say in the old days If the teaching isnt strict it shows the teacher is idle if the student doesnt learn its his own fault If youre really sincere youd better burn incense and bow to Heaven and EarthIll give you some magic strength before teaching you how to fight The three young princes were very pleased to hear him say this and they at once carried in an incense table themselves washed their hands lit incense sticks and bowed to HeavenThis done they asked their teachers to instruct themMonkey stepped down and said to the Tang Priest with a bow Please forgive your disciple honoured MasterEver since in your goodness you rescued me at the Double Boundary Mountain and I became a Buddhist all those years ago weve been travelling West Although Ive never done very much to repay your kindness I have crossed plenty of rivers and mountains and done everything I possibly couldNow that weve come to this land of the Buddha and had the good fortune of meeting these three young princes theyve taken us as their teachers of martial artsAs our pupils theyd be your pupils pupils so I ask you respectfully Master to allow us to instruct them Sanzang was delighted and when Pig and Friar Sand saw Monkey bowing to him they kowtowed too and said Master were stupid and too awkward with words to be able to explain things properlyPlease take your dharma seat and let each of us take a pupil Itll be fun and something to remind us of our journey West Sanzang was happy to agreeMonkey then took the three young princes into a quiet room behind the pavilion where he drew a starchart of the Dipper and told them to prostrate themselves inside it while they shut their eyes and settled their spiritsMeanwhile he silently said the words of the spell recited a mantra and blew magic breath into the hearts of the three of themHe put their primal spirits back into their original home taught them magical spells gave each of them immense strength applied the right heat and performed a magic that replaced their old bodies and bones with new onesAfter the heat circulated in a roundabout way through their bodies the three young princes came to stood up rubbed their faces summoned up their spirits and all found that they were much stronger The eldest of them could pick up the goldbanded cudgel the second could swing the ninetoothed rake and the third could raise the demonquelling staffWhen the king saw this he was beside himself with delight and arranged another vegetarian feast for the Tang Priest and his three disciples In front of the banquet each of the princes was taught his own skillthe one who was learning the rod practised with the rod the one who was learning the rake practised with the rake and the one who was learning the staff practised with the staffThough the young princes did manage a few turns and movements it took a lot of effort and going through a series of movements left them gasping for breath so that they could not go onBesides this the weapons they were using had the power of transformation so that as the princes advanced retreated attacked and lifted the weapons shrunk grew and went through amazing changes by themselves But the princes were after all only mortals and were unable to keep up with the speed of their weaponsLater that day the banquet came to an endThe next day the three princes came back once more to express their thanks and say We are very grateful to you divine teachers for giving us this strength but when we try to spin your divine weapons around we can only move them with great difficultyWe would like to get smiths to make lighter copies of them but we dont know whether you would agree to that Teachers Journey to the West Great great said PigThats the way to talkYou ought to have your own made because you cant use our weapons and anyhow we need them to protect the Dharma and beat monsters The princes then sent for smiths who bought ten thousand pounds of iron and steel set up a workshop with a furnace in the front courtyard of the princes palace and began to cast the weaponsOn the first day the steel was made and on the second Monkey and the other two were asked to bring out their goldbanded cudgel ninetoothed rake and demonquelling staff and put them under the matting shelter to be copiedThe work went on by night and day without stoppingThese weapons were the treasures they always carried with them that they could not be parted from for a moment Normally they hid them about their personsNow the weapons were protected by coloured light so that when they were put in the yard of the workshop for several days many beams of radiance reached up to the heavens while every kind of auspicious vapor blanketed the earthThat night an evil spirit who was sitting out on a night watch in a cave called Tigermouth Cave on a mountain called Mount Leopard Head that was only some twentyfive miles from the city noticed the glow and the auspicious vapors Going up on his cloud to investigate he saw that the light came from the city whereupon he brought his cloud down and went closer for a better look Discovering that the light was coming from the weapons he thought with delight and desire What wonderful weapons what splendid treasuresI wonder whose they are and why theyve been left hereThis must be my lucky chanceIll take them Ill take them His covetousness now moved he created a mighty wind scooped up all three weapons and took them back to his caveIndeed Not for one moment must the Way be left What can be left is not the true WayCultivation and trance will both be in vain When divine arms have been taken awayIf you do not know how these weapons were found listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Tawny Lion Spirit Arranges a Rake Feast in Vain Metal Wood and Earth Make Havoc on Mount Leopard Head The story tells how after days on end of hard work the smiths all went to sleep that night only to get up at dawn to start again and find that the three weapons had disappeared from under the matting shelterDumbfounded with horror they started looking for them everywhere and when the three young princes came out of the inner quarters to watch the smiths all kowtowed to them and said Young masters we dont know where the divine teachers three weapons have all gone When the young princes heard this news they trembled and said We expect our masters put them away last night Rushing to the Gauze Pavilion they found the white horse still tethered in the walkway and could not help shouting Teachers are you still asleep Journey to the West Were up Friar Sand replied and opened the door of their room to let the young princes inWhen they saw that the weapons were not there they asked with alarm Masters have you put your weapons away No replied Monkey springing upThe three weapons disappeared during the night the princes explainedIs my rake still there Pig asked as he scrambled to his feetWhen we came out a moment ago we saw everyone searching for them the princes replied When they couldnt find them we wondered if you had put them away which is why we came to askAs your treasures can shrink or grow we wonder if youve hidden them about yourselves to play a trick on us Honestly we havent said MonkeyLets all join the search When they went to the matting shelter in the yard and could see that there really was no sign of the weapons Pig said You smiths must have stolen themBringem out at once Do it right now or Ill kill youIll kill you I say The smiths kowtowed desperately and said with tears pouring down their faces Your Lordships we went to sleep last night because wed been working so hard for days on end When we got up this morning theyd gone Were only ordinary mortals We could never have moved themSpare our lives Your Lordships spare our lives Monkey said with bitter regret Its our faultAfter wed shown them what they look like to copy we should have kept them on us instead of leaving them lying thereI suppose our treasures glowing clouds and light must have alerted some monster who came and stole them during the night Nonsense brother Pig repliedThis is a peaceful orderly sort of place not somewhere in the wilds or the mountains No monsters could possibly have come hereIm sure it was those evil smiths who stole our weapons They could tell they were treasures from the light shining from them They must have left the palace last night and got a whole gang together to carry or drag them outBringem hereIm going to hit them The smiths kowtowed and swore to their innocence for all they were worthAmid all this commotion the senior prince came out and when he asked what had happened the color drained from his face too After muttering to himself in a low voice for a while he said Divine teachers your weapons were not mere mortals ones Even if there had been a hundred or more people they would never have been able to move themBesides my family has been ruling this city for five generations Im not boasting but I do have a certain reputation for being a good manThe soldiers civilians and artisans who live here fear my laws and I am certain that they could never have had so wicked an ideaI hope that you divine teachers will think again No need for any more thinking about it replied Brother Monkey with a smile and no need to make the smiths suffer for whats not their faultI would like to ask Your Royal Highness if there are any evil monsters in the mountains and forests around the city Thats a very good question the prince repliedThere is a mountain North of the city called Mount Leopard Head with a Tigermouth Cave in itPeople often say that immortals or tigers and wolves or evil spirits live thereAs Ive never been there to find out the truth I am not sure what kind of creatures there are Journey to the West No need to say any more replied Monkey with a laugh It must be someone wicked from there who knew they were treasures and came during the night to steal themPig Friar Sand he ordered stay here to guard the master and the city while I go for a look round He then told the smiths to keep the furnace burning and carry on forging the new weaponsThe splendid Monkey King took his leave of Sanzang and whistled out of sightSoon he was on Mount Leopard Head which took him but an instant as it was only ten miles from the cityAs he climbed to the summit to look around he saw that there was quite an air of evil about itIndeed it was A long dragon chain of hills A mighty formationSharp peaks thrusting into the sky Streams flowing fast along chasms deepIn front of the mountain grow cushions of rare plants Behind the mountain strange flowers form brocade Tall pine and ancient cypress Old trees and find bambooCrows and magpies sing as they fly Cranes call and gibbons screamBelow the beetling scar Davids deer go in twos In front of the sheer rockface Are pairs of badgers and foxesDragons from afar emerge briefly from the waters Of the twisting winding stream that runs deep under the groundThis ridge runs right to the edge of Yuhua A place of beauty for a thousand agesJust as he was surveying the scene Monkey heard voices on the other side of the mountain turned quickly round to look and saw a couple of wolfheaded ogres climbing towards the Northwest and talking loudly as Journey to the West they wentThey must be monsters patrolling the mountain Monkey guessedIm going to listen to what they have to say Making magic with his hands and saying the words of a spell Monkey shook himself turned into a butterfly spread his wings and fluttered after themIt was a very lifelike transformation A pair of powdery wings Two silver antennaeIn the wind it files very fast In the sun its a leisurely dancerIt crosses rivers and walls in a flash Enjoys stealing fragrance and playing with catkinsThis delicate creature loves the taste of fresh flowers It shows its beauty and elegance as it pleasesHe flew to a spot right above the evil spirits heads where he floated and listened to what they had to sayBrother one of them shouted suddenly our chief keeps on striking it lucky The other month he caught himself a real beauty to live with him in the cave and he was as pleased as anything about thatThen last night he got the three weapons which really are priceless treasuresTomorrow theres going to be a Rake Banquet to celebrate so were all going to benefit Weve been quite lucky too the other replied being given these twenty ounces of silver to buy pigs and sleepWhen we get to Qianfang Market we can have a few jugs of wine to start with and then fiddle the accounts to make ourselves two or three ounces of silver to buy ourselves padded jackets for the winterIts great isnt it As they laughed and talked the two monsters hurried along the main path at a great speedWhen Monkey heard about the banquet to celebrate the rake he was quietly delightedHe would have liked to kill the devils but it was not their fault and besides he had no weaponSo he flew round till he was in front of them turned back into himself and stood at a junction along the pathAs the devils gradually came closer he blew a mouthful of magic saliva at them recited the words Om Humkara and made a fixing spell that held the two wolfheaded spirits where they wereTheir eyes were fixed in a stare they could not open their mouths and they stood upright both legs rigidMonkey then knocked them over undid their clothes and searched them finding the twenty ounces of silver in a purse carried by one of them in the belt of his kilt Each of them was also carrying a white lacquered passOne of these read Wily Freak and the other read Freaky Wile Having taken their silver and undone their passes the splendid Great Sage went straight back to the city where he told the princes the Tang Priest the officials high and low and the smiths what had happenedJourney to the West I reckon my treasures the one that shone the brightest said Pig with a grin Thats why theyre buying pigs and sheep for a slapup meal to celebrate But how are we going to get it back Well all three of us go said MonkeyThis silver was for buying pigs and sheep Well give it to the smiths His Royal Highness can provide us with some animalsPig you turn yourself into Wily Freak Ill turn into Freaky Wile and Friar Sand can be a trader selling pigs and sheep Well go into Tigermouth Cave and when it suits us well grab our weapons kill all the monsters come back here to pack up and be on our way again Terrific said Friar SandNo time to lose Lets go The senior prince agreed with the plan and told his steward to buy seven or eight pigs and four or five sheepThe three of them left their master and gave a great display of their magic powers once outside the cityBrother said Pig Ive never seen that Wily Freak so how can I possibly turn myself into his double I did fixing magic on him to keep him over there somewhere Monkey said and he wont come round till tomorrowI can remember what he looks like so you stand still while I tell you how to changeYes like thisno a bit more like thatThats itThats him While the idiot said an incantation Brother Monkey blew on him with magic breath turned him into Wily Freaks double and gave him a white pass to tuck in at his waistMonkey then turned himself into Freaky Wile with a pass at his waist too and Friar Sand made himself look like a travelling dealer in pigs and sheepThen they drove the pigs and sheep together along the path West towards the mountainBefore long they were in a mountain gully where they met another junior devil He had the most horrible faceJust look A pair of round and bulging eyes Shining like lanterns A head of red and bristly hair Blazing like fireA red nose A twisted mouth Sharp and pointy fangs Protruding ears A brow that seemed hacked into shape And a green and bloated faceHe was wearing a pale yellow tunic And sandals made of sedgeJourney to the West He looked most imposing like some evil god As he hurried along like a vicious demonThis devil was carrying a coloured lacquer invitation box under his left arm as he greeted Monkey and the other two with a call of Freaky Wile good to see you bothDid you buy us some pigs and sheep Cant you see were driving them along Monkey repliedWhos this gentleman the devil asked looking at Friar SandHes the dealer in pigs and sheep Monkey repliedWe still owe him a couple of ounces of silver so were taking him home with us to fetch itWhere are you going To Bamboo Mountain to invite His Senior Majesty to the feast tomorrow morning the devil saidTaking his cue from the devils tone of voice Monkey then asked How many guests will there be altogether His Senior Majesty will take the place of honour the devil replied and with our own king chiefs and the rest of them therell be over forty As they were talking Pig called Get a move onThe pigs and sheep are going everywhere You go and invite them while I get a look at that invitation Monkey said and as the devil regarded him as one of their own kind he opened the box took out the invitation and handed it to Monkey This is what Monkey read when he unfolded itA banquet is being given tomorrow morning to celebrate the capture of the rake and if you will condescend to cross the mountain honoured ancestor Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity I will be deeply gratefulWith a hundred kowtows Your grandson Tawny Lion When Monkey had read it he handed it back to the devil who returned it to its case and carried on towards the SoutheastBrother Friar Sand asked what did it say on the invitation It was an invitation to the Rake Banquet Monkey repliedIt was signed with a hundred kowtows your grandson Tawny Lion and the invitation was being sent to the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity Journey to the West Tawny Lion must be a goldenhaired lion whos become a spirit said Friar Sand with a smile but I wonder who the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity is Pigs reaction was to laugh and say Hes mine Why should he necessarily be yours Monkey askedTheres an old saying that goes a mangy old sow can put a golden lion to flight Pig repliedThats why I know hes mine As they talked and laughed the three of them drove the pigs and sheep along till they could see the gates of Tigermouth CaveOutside the gates there were Green mountains all around Ranges forming a mighty wallCreepers clung to the sheer rock faces Thorns hung down from the towering cliffsBird song came from all around the woods While flowers gave a welcome by the entranceThis cave was a match for the Peach Blossom Spring A place to avoid the troubles of the worldAs they came closer to the mouth of the cave they saw a crowd of evil spirits of every age and kind playing under the blossoming trees and when they heard Pigs shouts of HeyHey as he drove the pigs and sheep they all came out to meet themThe pigs and sheep were caught and trussed upThe noise had by now disturbed the demon king inside who came out with ten or more junior demons to ask Are you two backHow many animals did you buy Eight pigs and seven sheepfifteen altogether Monkey repliedThe pigs cost sixteen ounces of silver and the sheep nineWe were only given twenty ounces so we still owe fiveThis is the dealer whos come with us for the silver Fetch five ounces of silver little ones the demon king ordered on hearing this and send him on his way But the dealer hasnt only come to get his silver Monkey repliedHes come to see the banquet too What nerve Freaky Wile said the furious demon abusivelyYou were sent off to buy things not to talk about banquets As youve got those amazingly fine treasures my lord Pig said stepping forward whats the harm in letting him have a look Journey to the West Damn you too Wily Freak said the demon with an angry snortI got these treasures from inside the city of Yuhua If this stranger sees them and talks about them in the city the word will get around and the prince will come to demand themWhatll we do then My lord Monkey replied this dealer comes from the other side of Qianfang Market Thats a long way from the city and hes not a city man either so where would he go telling talesBesides hes hungry and the two of us havent eatenIf theres any food and liquor in the place why dont we give him some before sending him on his way Before he could finish speaking a junior devil came out with five ounces of silver that he gave to Monkey who in turn handed it to Friar Sand with the words Take your silver stranger then come round to the back for something to eat with us Taking his courage in his hands Friar Sand went into the cave with Pig and MonkeyWhen they reached the second hall inside they saw on a table in the middle of it the ninetoothed iron rake set up in all its dazzling brightness to receive offeringsAt the Eastern end of the table was leant the goldbanded cudgel and at the Western end the demonquelling staffStranger said the demon king who was following them in thats the rake shining so brightly in the middle Youre welcome to look but dont tell anyone about it whatever you do Friar Sand nodded in admirationOh dearThis was a case of when the owner sees whats his hes bound to pick it up Pig had always been a rough customer and once he saw his rake he was not going to talk about the facts of the case but charged over pulled it down and swung it around as he turned back into himself He struck straight at the evil spirits face not caring now about the proper ways of using his weaponMonkey and Friar Sand each rushed to one end of the table to grab his own weapon and turn back into himselfAs the three brothers started lashing out wildly the demon king had to get out of their way in a hurry go round to the back and fetch his fourbright halberd with its long handle and sharp pointed butt Rushing into the courtyard he used this to hold off the three weapons and shout at the top of his voice Who do you think you are tricking me out of my treasures by impersonation Ill get you you hairy beast Monkey cursed backYou dont know who I amIm a disciple of Tang Sanzang the holy monk from the EastWhen we came to Yuhua to present our passport the prince told his three sons to take us as their teachers of fighting skills They were having weapons copied from oursThat was why ours were left in the courtyard for you to sneak into the city and steal in the middle of the night And you accuse us of tricking them out of you by impersonationStay right there and try a taste of our three weapons The evil spirit at once raised his halberd to fight backThey fought from the courtyard out through the front gate three monks chasing a single demon It was a splendid battle The cudgel whistled like the wind The rakes blows came raining downThe demonquelling staff filled the sky with glowing mist The fourbright halberd gave off cloudsJourney to the West They were like the three immortals refining elixir Making dazzling light that frightened gods and ghostsMonkey was brilliant at displaying his might The evil spirit was wrong to have stolen the treasuresMarshal Tian Peng showed off his divine powers While the great general Sand was heroic and splendidAs the three brothers fought with skill and one mind A great battle took place in Tigermouth CaveThe ogre was full of power and cunning A fit match for the four heroesThey fought until the sun set in the West When the demon weakened and could hold out no longerAfter their long fight on Mount Leopard Head the evil spirit shouted at Friar Sand Watch this halberd As Friar Sand fell back to dodge the blow the evil spirit escaped through the opening he left and fled by wind to the Xun quarter to the SoutheastPig started rushing after him to catch him but Monkey said Let him goAs the old saying goes never chase a desperate robber Lets leave him nothing to come back to Pig agreed and the three of them went back to the entrance of the cave where they killed all the hundred and more evil spirits great and smallIt turned out that they were all really tigers wolves tiger cats leopards red deer and goatsMonkey used one of his powers to bring all the valuables and fabrics as well as the bodies of all the animals they had killed the pigs and the sheep out of the caveFriar Sand used some dry wood he found to start a fire that Pig fanned with both his earsThe cave was soon burnt out and they took what they had brought with them back to the cityThe city gates were wide open people had not yet gone to bed The senior prince and his sons were still waiting in the Gauze PavilionThe three disciples dropped all the dead wild animals and sheep as well as the valuables with loud thumps into the courtyard filling it up as they called out Master were backWeve won The senior prince then expressed his thanks to them the Tang priest was delighted and the three young princes fell to their knees to bow Dont thank us Friar Sand said helping them to their feetCome and see what weve got Where are they from the senior prince askedJourney to the West The tigers wolves tiger cats leopards red deer and goats were all monsters that made themselves into spiritsWhen wed got our weapons back we fought our way out through the gatesTheir demon king is a goldenhaired lion who fights with a fourbright halberd He battled it out with us till nightfall then ran away to the SoutheastInstead of chasing him we made sure hed have nowhere to come back to by killing all these devils and bringing back all his things This news both delighted and alarmed the senior princehe was delighted at their triumphant return worried that the demon would seek his revenge laterDont worry Your Royal Highness said Monkey Ive thought about it very carefully and Ill deal with it properlyI promise to exterminate the demons completely before we go Well definitely not leave you with trouble thatll come back laterWhen we went there at noon we ran into a little greenfaced redhaired devil who was carrying an invitation What it said on it wasA banquet is being given tomorrow morning to celebrate the capture of the rake and if you will condescend to cross the mountain honoured ancestor Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity I will be deeply grateful It was signedwith a hundred kowtows your grandson Tawny LionWhen the evil spirit was defeated just now he must have gone to have a word with his grandfather Theyre bound to come looking for us to get their revenge tomorrow morning and when that happens Ill wipe them all out for you The senior prince thanked him and had supper arrangedWhen master and disciples had eaten everybody went to bedThe story now tells of how the evil spirit really did head Southeast to Bamboo Mountain in which there was a cave called the Ninebend Twisty Cave where the evil spirits grandfather the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity livedThat night the demon did not stop treading the wind until he reached the caves entrance in the last watchWhen he knocked on the gates and went in a junior devil greeted him with the words Your Majesty Greenface brought the invitation last night and the old gentleman invited him to say till this morning to go to your Rake Banquet with himWhy have you come here so very early to invite him yourself I hate to have to say it the evil spirit replied but the banquet is off As they were talking Greenface came out from the inner part of the cave to say What are you doing here Your MajestyAs soon as His Senior Majestys up hes coming to the celebration with me The evil spirit was so distraught that he could say nothing but only wave his handsA little later the old demon got up and called for the evil spirit who dropped his weapon and prostrated himself on the ground to kowtow tears streaming down his cheeksWorthy grandson the old demon said you sent me an invitation yesterday and this morning Im on my way to the celebrationSo why have you come yourself looking so miserable and upset I was taking a stroll in the moonlight the night before last the evil spirit replied still kowtowing when I saw a dazzling light rising up to the sky from the city of YuhuaI hurried there to take a look and saw that it came from three weapons in the princes palace a ninetoothed rake with gold in it a staff and a goldbanded cudgelI used my magic to take them away and decided to have a Rake Banquet to celebrate I sent some of my underlings to buy pigs sheep and fruit for the feast that I invited you to come and enjoy GrandfatherBut after I sent Greenface over with the invitation yesterday Wily Freak and the other one whod been told to buy pigs and sheep came back with a dealer a stranger for some silverThe stranger was all set on seeing the banquet I refused as I was afraid hed spread the news aroundThen they said they were hungry and asked for some food to eat so I told them to go round the back to eatWhen they got inside and saw the weapons they Journey to the West said they were theirsThey each snatched one and turned back into their real selves One was a monk with a hairy face and a mouth like a thunder gods one was a monk with a long snout and big ears and one was a monk with a really sinister face The three of them yelled at me and started lashing out they didnt care at allI just managed to fetch my fourbright halberd and come out to hold them at bayWhen I asked them who they were and how they dared go in for impersonation they told me they were disciples of the Tang Priest whos been sent to the Western Heaven by Great Tang in the East When they went to present their passport on their way through the city the princes pressed them to stay and teach them martial arts They said their three weapons had been left in the palace yard for copies of them to be made and that Id stolen them Then they went for me with great furyI didnt know what those three monks are called but theyre all very good fighters As I was no match for them by myself I had to run away and come hereIf you have any love for your grandson I beg you to lend me your arms in order to get my revenge on those monks After a moments silent thought the old demon replied with a smile So its themWorthy grandson you made a big mistake provoking him Do you know who they are grandfather the other askedThe one with a long snout and big ears is Zhu Bajie the old demon said and the one with a horrible face is Friar SandTheyre not too bad But the one with a hairy face and a mouth like a thunder god is called Sun the NoviceHes got really tremendous magical powers When he made great havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago a hundred thousand heavenly troops couldnt catch him And hes a most determined hunterHes like a policeman wholl search mountains and seas smash caves storm cities and cause all sorts of trouble Why did you have to provoke him Never mindIll go with you and capture those soandsos and the prince of Yuhua to avenge you On hearing this the evil spirit kowtowed again in thanksThe senior demon immediately mustered his grandsons Monkey Lion Snowy Lion Leo Gryphon Raccoondog Lion and Elephantfighter each of whom carried a sharp weapon With Tawny Lion leading the way each of them set off a powerful gale that carried them straight to Mount Leopard Head where there was an allpervasive smell of smoke and fire and all that could be heard was sobbingWhen they looked more closely they saw Wily Freak and Freaky Wile weeping for their lordAre you the real Freak and Wile or impostors the evil spirit shouted as he went up to themFalling to their knees and kowtowing with tears in their eyes the two devils replied Were no impostorsAfter we were given the silver to buy pigs and sheep yesterday we met a monk with a hairy face and a mouth like a thunder god in the wide valley to the West of the mountain When he spat on us our legs went all weak our mouths went stiff we couldnt speak and we couldnt moveHe knocked us over found and stole our silver and took our passes off usWe were left in a daze till we came round just nowWhen we got home we found the place still on fire and all the buildings burnt downWe were crying so bitterly because you my lord and all the chiefs had disappearedWe dont know how the fire was started When the evil spirit heard this he could not stop his tears from gushing forth as he stamped his feet in fury let loose heavenshaking roars and exclaimed in hatred and fury Damned baldiesVicious beasts How could you be so evilYouve destroyed my cave palace and burnt my beauty to death Youve killed everyone young and old in the householdIm so angry I could die The old demon then told Monkey Lion to take hold of Tawny Lion saying Grandson whats done is done Upsetting yourself wont do you any goodWhat you must do now is summon up all your energy to catch those monks in the city Journey to the West The evil spirit was still crying as he replied Grandfather this mountain palace of mine wasnt built in a day Now those damned baldies have destroyed everythingMy lifes not worth living With that he broke free and flung himself forward to smash his head against the rockface only stopping after Snowy Lion and Monkey Lion had made great efforts to calm himThey then left the cave and all headed for the cityWith a roaring wind and in a thick fog they approached the city so frightening all the people living outside the city wall that they abandoned their belongings and dragged or carried their children with them as they fled into the city Once the people were all inside the gates were shutA report was then made to the palace that a disaster was upon themWhen the prince who was taking a vegetarian breakfast in the Gauze Pavilion with the Tang Priest and the others heard this report he went out to ask about itA whole crowd of evil spirits are heading for the city with sandstorms flying stones fogs and wind Whatever shall we do asked the prince deeply alarmedAll stop worrying said Brother Monkey all stop worryingIts the evil spirit from Tigermouth Cave who ran away when he was beaten yesterday He went to the Southeast to gang up with the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity or whatever hes called and now hes hereWe brothers are going outTell them to shut all the city gates and send men to hold the city wall The prince ordered that the city gates be shut sent men to the wall and went with his sons and the Tang Priest to inspectThe armys banners blotted out the sun and the cannon fire reached the sky as Monkey Pig and Friar Sand left the city amid wind and clouds to give battleIndeed Because they were careless the weapons were lost Which led to attacks by the devilish hostIf you do not know the outcome of the battle listen to the explanation in the next installmentBy Giving and Receiving the Master and the Lion Turn into One After Stealing the Way and Obstructing Dhyana Ninefold Numinosity Is Pacified The story tells how the Great Sage Sun left the city with Pig and Friar Sand and looked the monsters in the face to see that they were all lions of various kinds The Tawny Lion Spirit was leading with Leo and Elephantfighter Lion on his left Gryphon and Raccoondog Lion on his right and Monkey Lion with Snowy Lion behind him In the middle of them all was a nineheaded lionThe ogre Greenface was holding a canopy of brocade embroidered with flowers just behind the nineheaded lion while Wily Freak and Freaky Wile carried a pair of red flagsThey were all drawn up at a hollow placeIn his rough way Pig went up to them to shout abusively Ogres Thieves Treasurestealers What did you go there and gang up with that hairy lot for To this the Tawny Lion Spirit retorted gnashing his teeth in fury Vicious baldiesWhen I was alone Journey to the West yesterday the three of you beat me and I had to run away You should have done right instead of burning my cave palace destroying my mountain home and murdering my familyMy hatred for you is as great as the oceanStay where you are and take this from my halberd The splendid Pig raised his rake to parry the blowWhen the two of them had just started fighting and neither was yet coming out on top Monkey Lion joined in swinging his spiked iron club as did Snowy Lion with his threeedged mace Welcome shouted PigWatch him as he charges straight forward to meet their onslaught and fight with them allFriar Sand quickly pulled his demonquelling staff out from where he was at the side and hurried forward to help Pig at which Leo Spirit Gryphon Spirit Elephantfighter Spirit and Raccoondog Spirit all piled inThe Great Sage Monkey held the evil spirits at bay with his goldbanded cudgelLeo fought with a club Snowy with a bronze hammer Elephantfighter with a steel spear and Raccoondog with a battleaxe The fight between the seven lion spirits and the three ferocious monks was a splendid oneClub hammer spear axe and threeedged mace Spiked club ballstaff and fourbright halberdSeven lions with seven deadly weapons Shouting their war cries as they surround three monksPowerful was the Great Sages goldbanded cudgel Friar Sands staff was almost matchless in the worldPig moved around with the power of a whirlwind As his flashing rake gave off baleful lightAll displaying their might blocked before and behind Held off the onslaughts with daring and courageFrom the walls of the city the prince lent support Where his soldiers felt braver as they beat drums and gongsThrowing and thrusting all showed off their magic Turning heaven and earth both dark and upsidedownAfter the evil spirits had been fighting the Great Sage and the two others for half a day night fellPig by now was dribbling and his legs were going weak so he feinted with his rake and fled in defeatJourney to the West Where do you think youre going Snowy Lion and Monkey Lion shoutedTake this The idiot could not dodge them and he took a heavy blow from the mace on his spine that laid him flat on the ground crying out Im done for Im done for The two lion spirits grabbed Pig by the bristles on his neck and by his tail and carried him over to see the nineheaded lion Grandfather they reported weve caught one of them Before the words were out of their mouths Friar Sand and Monkey also had to fall back beatenWhen the evil spirits all came after them Monkey pulled out a handful of hairs chewed them to pieces spat them out shouted Change and turned them into more than one hundred little Monkeys who went round and round surrounding Snowy Leo Elephantfighter Raccoondog and Tawny LionFriar Sand and Monkey then came forward to join in the fight againLater that night they caught Leo and Gryphon and put Raccoondog and Elephantfighter to flightWhen Tawny Lion reported to the old demon that two of the lions had been lost the demon ordered Tie Pig up but dont kill himWhen they give our lions back well return Pig to themIf theyre stupid enough to kill them well make Pig pay with his life That evening all the fiends slept outside the cityThe story now turns to the Great Sage Sun who carried the two lion spirits to beside the city wall from where the senior prince saw him and ordered that the gates be opened Twenty or thirty officers were sent out with rope to tie the lion spirits up and carry them into the cityThe Great Sage then put his magic hairs away and went straight with Friar Sand to the wall tower where he saw the Tang PriestThis is a terrible business the Tang Priest said Is Wuneng still alive No problem Brother Monkey repliedAs weve captured a couple of the evil spirits they wont possibly dare harm himHave them tied up tightIll swap them for Pig tomorrow morning The three young princes then kowtowed to Monkey and said When you were fighting them at first you were by yourself TeacherThen when you pretended to run away and came back again there were over a hundred of you How was that doneWhen you came back to the city wall after capturing the evil spirits there was only one of you again What magical powers did you use to do that I have  hairs on my body Monkey repliedEach of them can become ten and the ten become a hundred so I can do millions and millions of transformationsIts extra body magic The princes all kowtowed as a vegetarian feast was brought to the tower for themAll along the battlements lanterns and banners were displayed There was the sound of clappers bells gongs and drums as the watches were changed arrows passed on cannons fired and warcries shoutedSoon it was dawn and the old demon sent for Tawny Lion Spirit to make a plan of actionYou must all use your wits to capture Sun the Novice and Friar Sand while I make a secret flight up onto the wall to capture their master the old prince and his sonsIll take them back to the Ninebend Twisty Cave and wait for you to come back in triumph Accepting this plan Tawny Lion took Monkey Lion Snowy Lion Elephantfighter and Raccoondog back to beside the city wall all carrying their weapons and demanding battle amid winds and fogJourney to the West On the other side Monkey and Friar Sand jumped on the wall where Monkey yelled abusively at the top of his voice Thieving damned ogresGive me my brother Pig back this moment and Ill spare your livesIf you dont Ill smash your bones to powder and chop you all into little pieces With no further argument the evil spirits all charged into the attackThe Great Sage and Friar Sand had to use skill and cunning to hold the five lions at bayThis fight was very different from the one on the previous day As an evil wind howled across the land Black fog blotted out the skyMoving stones and flying sands alarmed both gods and demons As the trees in the forest fell the tigers and wolves were afraidFierce was the spear of steel and bright the axe Merciless the rod the halberd and the brazen hammerThey wished they could swallow Monkey up whole And capture Friar Sand live and kickingThe Great Sages AsYouWill cudgel Could attack and defend with miraculous effectFriar Sands demonquelling staff Had won its fame outside the Hall of Miraculous MistNow that it moved with its magical powers It would achieve glory in the West by wiping out demonsWhile the five lion spirits with coats of different colours were fighting really well with Monkey and Friar Sand the old demon flew on a black cloud straight to the wall tower where he shook his heads which gave the military and civil officials Sanzang the senior prince and the soldiers guarding the wall such a fright that they all fell offThe demon then charged into the tower opened his mouths took Sanzang the senior prince and his sons in them one by one and went back to the hollow ground where he took Pig in another mouth one of the nine he had in his nine headsOne mouth held the Tang Priest one Pig one the senior prince one his eldest son one the second son and one the third son With six mouths full of six people he still had three mouths empty and wide open as he roared Im going back ahead The five junior lion spirits all fought more bravely than ever now that they had seen their grandfathers triumphJourney to the West As soon as Monkey heard the yells from the wall and realized he had fallen for a trick he gave Friar Sand a quick shout to be careful then pulled all the hairs off his arms put them in his mouth chewed them up and spat them out as well over a thousand little Monkeys who swarmed into the attackThey knocked Monkey Lion over took Snowy alive captured Elephantfighter laid Raccoondog Lion low and killed Tawny Lion but as they returned to the city wall with a great hubbub they let Greenface Wily Freak and Freaky Wile escapeWhen the officers on the wall saw what had happened they opened the gates tied up the five lion spirits with ropes and carried them into the cityBut before they could deal with them the princess appeared sobbing and weeping to say Holy teachers His Royal Highness the prince our sons and your master are all deadHow ever is this isolated city to survive Putting his magic hairs away Monkey bowed to her and said Dont upset yourself PrincessIt was only because Id captured seven of his lion spirits that the old demon carried off my master His Royal Highness and your sons with catching magic Im certain theyll come to no harmMy brotherdisciple and I will go to his mountain first thing tomorrow morning and I can guarantee that well catch the old demon and bring your four princes back to you When the princess and her womenfolk heard this they all bowed to Monkey and said We pray that His Royal Highness and his sons will all be safe and that our dynasty will be secure When their bowing was done the womenfolk all returned to the palace in tearsSkin the Tawny Lion spirit we killed Brother Monkey instructed the officials and have the five who are still alive securely tied up and put under lock and keyBring us some vegetarian food to eat before we go to sleep Stop worryingI promise nothing will go wrong The next morning the Great Sage took Friar Sand up on an auspicious cloudBefore long they were at the top of Bamboo Mountain and as they brought their cloud down to look they saw that it was magnificentRows of jutting peaks Sheer and craggy ridgesIn the deep gill waters gently flow Flowers weave a fragrant brocade before the beetling cliff Where the ridges twist and double back Encircled by the ancient winding pathsWhen the crane comes the pine has a companion And the rock is left alone as the cloud drifts awayThe black ape heads for brightness when looking for fruit The deer rejoice in the warming sun as they search for flowersThe green phoenix sings sweetly Journey to the West And the golden birds melodies never stopIn spring the peach blossom contends with the plum In summer the willow and locust trees are rivalsIn autumn are carpets of chrysanthemums And in winter the snow flies all aroundHere there is beauty throughout the year Where the scenery can compare with Yingzhous magic landAs the two of them were standing on the mountain admiring the view Greenface suddenly appeared in a ravine between cliffs He was holding a short cudgelWhere do you think youre going Monkey shoutedIm here This gave the young devil such a fright that he went running and tumbling down the ravine Monkey and Friar Sand went straight after him but could find no sign of where he had goneWhen they went further and searched around they found a cave palace with double gates of mottled stone that were firmly closedAbove the gates a stone tablet was set on which was written in large block lettersNINEBEND TWISTY CAVE MIGHTY BAMBOO MOUNTAIN Now when the junior devil ran inside the cave he had shut the gates firmly behind himOnce inside he reported to the old demon My lord those two monks are outside Have your lord Monkey Lion Snowy Lion Elephantfighter and Raccoondog come back yet the old demon askedI havent seen them the junior demon repliedThere were just the two monks looking around from high up on the peakAs soon as I saw them I turned and ran As they came after me I shut the gates The old demon bowed his head in silence at this newsAfter a while his tears began to flow as he called out This is terribleMy grandson Tawny Lion is dead My grandsons Monkey Lion and the rest of them have all been captured by those monks and taken into the cityHow am I to get my revenge Pig was tied up nearby crammed in together with the Tang Priest and the princes terrified and miserable until he heard the old demon saying that his grandsons had been captured and taken into the city At this he said with quiet delight Dont be afraid Master Cheer up Your Royal Highness My elder brother has wonHes Journey to the West captured the whole lot of the devils and hes found his way here to rescue us When he had said this the old demon could be heard shouting Little ones guard the place well while I go out to catch those other two monksThen we can punish them all together Watch him as he strides off without armor or weaponsWhen he heard Monkey shouting he threw the gates of the cave wide open and went straight for him not deigning to answerMonkey raised his iron cudgel to stop him with a blow to the head while Friar Sand swung his staff at himAs the demon shook his principal head the eight other heads to left and right of it all opened their mouths with which they gently picked Monkey and Friar Sand up and carried them into the caveFetch rope he ordered and Wily Freak Freaky Wile and Greenface who had come back after their escape the previous night brought two ropes with which they tied the two of them up very securelyImpudent ape said the old demon you captured my seven grandsonsBut now Ive caught you four monks and the four princes Ive got enough to ransom them withLittle ones get some thorns and willow rods and beat this ape for me to avenge my grandson Tawny Lion The three junior devils then beat Monkey with willow rods but Monkeys body had been so toughened that all the rods could do was to scratch his itchesHe made no sound and was not in the least bothered no matter how hard they hit himThe sight of it however made Pig the Tang Priest and the princes all feel their hair standing on endBefore long the rods started to break up but the demons kept on till evening keeping no count of the number of strokesFriar Sand was most upset to see Monkey being given so long a flogging so he said Let me take a hundred or so for him Dont be so impatient the old demon replied youll get your beating tomorrowYoull all be done in turn That means itll be me the day after tomorrow said Pig with alarmThe beating continued for a while as night slowly fellLittle ones the old demon called stop for now Light the lamp and go for something to eat and drink Im off to my Brocade Cloud Den for a little shuteyeYou three have all had a hard time so keep a close watch on themWell carry on with the beatings tomorrow The three junior devils moved a lamp over and hit Monkey some more on the top of his head with their willow rods tictictoc toctoctic like the rhythm of a wooden clapper sometimes fast and sometimes slowBy then it was very late and they all fell asleepMonkey now used escaping magic to shrink himself wriggled out of his bonds shook his fur straightened up his clothes took the cudgel out of his ear and shook it till it was as thick as a wellbucket and about twenty feet long Then he said to the three junior devils You animals you hit me an awful lot of times and now Im going to return the complimentIll just shove this at you and see how you like it One gentle push from the cudgels turned the three devils into three lumps of minced porkMonkey then turned up the lamp and released Friar SandPig who was feeling desperate about being tied up could not stop himself from yelling at the top of his voice My hands and feet are tied up so tight theyre swollenWhy dont you come and free me The idiots shout at once woke up the old demon who rolled straight out of bed and called out Whos setting them free The moment Monkey heard this he blew out the lamp smashed his way through several sets of Journey to the West doors with his cudgel and fled not bothering about Friar Sand and the rest of them while the old demon went into the main hall shouting Little ones whys there no lightDont let them get away He shouted once without getting an answer then again and still no answerWhen he fetched a lantern and looked all he could see were three gory lumps of minced meat on the floor The prince his sons the Tang Priest and Pig were still there but Monkey and Friar Sand had disappearedHe lit a torch searched the front and the back and could find only Friar Sand who was still standing pressed against the wall of a corridorThe demon knocked him down tied him up as before and carried on looking for MonkeySeeing that pair after pair of his doors had been smashed down he realized that Monkey had destroyed them in his flightInstead of giving chase he patched up and blockaded the doors and guarded his homeThe story now tells how Monkey left the Ninebend Twisty Cave and rode by auspicious cloud straight back to the city of Yuhua where all the local deities and spirits as well as the god of the city could be seen bowing in midair to greet himWhy have you only come to see me today Monkey askedWhen we knew that the worthy prince was entertaining you in Yuhua Great Sage they replied we did not venture to greet youBut now that the princes have been captured by ogres and you have subdued those monsters we have come to welcome you with kowtows While Monkey was abusing them the Goldheaded Protector and the Six Ding and Six Jia generals escorted a local deity in and made him kneel on the groundGreat Sage they said weve arrested this ground devil What are you making a noise here for instead of guarding my master on Bamboo Mountain Monkey yelledGreat Sage the Ding and Jia gods replied the evil spirit caught the Curtainraising General and tied him up again after you escapedAs we could see how great his magic powers are weve brought the local deity of Bamboo Mountain hereHe knows all about that evil spirits background so we beg you to question him Great Sage and find out how best to deal with him and deliver the holy monks and worthy princes from their suffering When Monkey heard this he was delightedThe old demon came down to Bamboo Mountain the year before last the local deity said shivering and shaking as he kowtowedThe Ninebend Twisty Cave used to be the den of six lions Once the old demon came the six lions all took him as their grandfatherHe is a nineheaded lion called the Primal Sage of Ninefold NuminosityIf you want to deal with him you must go to the Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East and fetch his master here to subdue himNobody else can possibly do it When Monkey heard this he thought for a long time before saying The Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East is where the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad lives Yes he does have just such a nineheaded lion under his throneProtector Jias he ordered go back with the local deity and keep a secret watch on the master my brother disciple the prince of the city and his sonsThe city god must guard the wall and moatOff you go The gods all took up guard as instructedThe Great Sage set off his somersault cloud and traveled through the night till it was about the last watch when he reached the Eastern Gate of Heaven where he ran into the Heavenly King Virupaksa with his retinue of heavenly soldiers and warriors who stopped put their hands together in greeting and asked Where are you going Great Sage Journey to the West Im off to the Wonderful Crag Palace Monkey replied when he had returned their greetingsWhy have you come to the Eastern Heaven instead of following your road to the Western Heaven Virupaksa askedWhen we reached the city of Yuhua Monkey replied the prince of the city entertained us and told his three sons to take us as their teachers of martial arts We had a most unpleasant surprise coming up against a gang of lion monstersNow Im going to ask the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad the chief monsters owner to subdue him and save my master It was because you wanted to be a teacher that you provoked that trouble with the lions said the heavenly kingHow true replied Monkey with a smile how true The heavenly soldiers and warriors all raised joined hands in greeting then stood aside to let him passMonkey went in through the Eastern Gate of Heaven and was soon at the Wonderful Crag PalaceThis is what could be seen Coloured clouds behind coloured clouds Purple mists and rich green vegetationThe rooftiles are a surge of golden flame And at the gates are imposing beasts of jadeFlowers grow between gate towers round which red mists drift The sun shines on turquoise vapors rising from the woodsAll the immortals pay their respects And a thousand sages make everything flourishThe halls of the palace are like layers of brocade Windows and pavilions open on all sidesAzure dragons glow with sacred clouds Golden beams of brilliant light come from the magic mistsThis is a land of splendor and eternal joy The Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost EastThere was an immortal boy wearing a rainbow mantle standing at the palace gates and as soon as he noticed the Great Sage he went in to report My lord the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven is here When the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad heard this he ordered all the immortals in attendance on him to go out to welcome Monkey and bring him into the palaceHere the Heavenly Honoured One was sitting on a ninecoloured lotus throne amid countless rays of auspicious light and when he saw Monkey he came down from his throne to greet him while Monkey bowed to him from belowJourney to the West Great Sage the Heavenly Honoured One said returning his bow I havent seen you for years but I did hear that you have abandoned the Way for Buddhism and are escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven I presume that you have now succeeded Not yet Monkey replied but near enoughI have escorted the Tang Priest as far as Yuhua where the prince told his three sons to take me and the other two as their teachers of martial arts and had copies of our three magic weapons made The weapons were to our surprise stolen one nightWhen I searched for them the next day I found that they had been stolen by a spirit turned by a goldenhaired lion from Tigermouth Cave on Mount Leopard HeadI tricked them back from him by cunning whereupon the spirit ganged up with some other lion spirits to give me a tremendous fightOne of them is a nineheaded lion with enormous magic powers who carried my master Pig the prince and his three sons to the Ninebend Twisty Cave on Mount BambooWhen Friar Sand and I went to look for them the next day we were carried off too He had me tied up and hit so often I lost countLuckily I was able to make my getaway by magic but theyre still suffering thereWhen I questioned the local deity I found out that you were his master Heavenly Honoured One which is why Im here to ask you to subdue the lion and rescue them As soon as the Heavenly Honoured One heard this he sent his immortal officers to the lion house to call out his lionkeeper slave and question himThe lionkeeper slave was sleeping so deeply that the officers had to push and shake him before they could wake him up and drag him into the main hallHere the Heavenly Honoured One asked him Where is the lion All the slave could do was to kowtow with tears streaming down his face pleading Spare me spare me The Great Sage Sun is here the Heavenly Honoured One replied so I wont have you beaten just yetYou must explain this instant your carelessness in letting the nineheaded lion escape My lord the lionkeeper replied I stole and drank a jug of wine I saw in the Sweet Dew Palace of the Great Chiliocosm Before I realized what had happened I was dead drunkIt must have slipped its chains and got away That wine was given me by Lord Lao Zi of the Supreme Ultimate the Heavenly Honoured One replied Its called Cyclical Nectar and after drinking that you would have slept for three daysHow many days has the lion been gone What the local deity said was that he went down there the year before last which would mean two years or more the Great Sage saidThats right the Heavenly Honoured One said with a smile A day in the palaces of Heaven is a year in the mortal worldGet up he said to the liontamer Ill spare your life Come down to the lower world with the Great Sage and me to recapture himYou immortals can all go backNone of you need come with us The Heavenly Honoured One the lionkeeper slave and the Great Sage all went by cloud straight to Bamboo Mountain where the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre the Six Dings the Six Jias and the local deity of the mountain all knelt to greet themHas my master been harmed while you people have been protecting him Brother Monkey askedThe evil spirit was so angry that he went to sleep the gods repliedHe didnt torture them any more That Primal Sage of mine is a true soul who has long cultivated the Way the Heavenly Honoured One remarked A single call from him will go up to the Three Sages and down to the Underworld He wouldnt Journey to the West kill anyone lightlyGreat Sage Sun go to his gates challenge him to battle and draw him outside for us to catch As soon as Monkey heard this he sprang towards the mouth of the cave brandishing his cudgel and shouting loudly and abusively Damned evil spirit give me my people backDamned evil spirit give me my people back He shouted several times but the old demon was fast asleep and nobody answeredMonkey lost his patience swung his cudgel and smashed his way inside still cursingOnly then did the old demon wake up rise to his feet and yell with great fury Im coming for you He shook his heads and opened his jaws to pick Monkey upAs Monkey turned and fled the evil spirit chased after him till they were outside the cave shouting Where do you think youre going you thieving ape How dare you go on behaving so dreadfully said Monkey with a grin from where he was standing on the top of a high cliff You havent even got the sense to realize that your lifes at stakeDont you see your masters here By the time the evil spirit reached the cliff in pursuit of Monkey the Heavenly Honoured One had said a spell and shouted Im here my little Primal Sage Recognizing his master the monster gave up the struggle and lay down with all four feet on the ground kowtowingThe lionkeeper then ran over to him took hold of his mane and punched him hundreds of times on the neck saying abusively Why did you run away animalYou got me into terrible trouble The lion kept his mouths shut and said nothing not daring to move and the lionkeeper only stopped hitting him when his fist was tired outWhen a brocade saddlecloth had been put on the animals back the Heavenly Honoured One mounted and shouted to it to goThey then rose up on coloured clouds and went straight back to the Wonderful Crag PalaceAfter addressing his thanks skywards the Great Sage went into the cave and freed first the prince of Yuhua then Sanzang then Pig Friar Sand and the three young princesAfter this they made a leisurely search of the cave and led everyone outsidePig then fetched some dry brushwood piled it at the front and the back and started a fire that left the Ninebend Twisty Cave looking like a ruined burntout kilnMonkey released all the gods ordered the local deity to keep guard on it and told Pig and Friar Sand to use their magic to carry the four princes back to the city while he helped the Tang Priest alongThey were soon back at the city where the princess and the officials all came out to greet them It was now getting dark and a vegetarian feast was provided for everyone to enjoyThe venerable elder and his disciples slept in the Gauze Pavilion once more and the princes in the living quarters of the palaceOf that night no more need be saidThe next day the prince issued an order for another great vegetarian banquet to be laid onEach of the officials high and low in the palace expressed his gratitude and Monkey asked for butchers to slaughter the six lions who were still alive skin them like the tawny lion and prepare their meat to be eatenThe prince who was delighted with this proposal gave the order for them to be killedOne animal was kept for the inside and outside palace staff one was given to the chief administrator and the other officials in the palace and the flesh of the other five was cut into lumps weighing one or two ounces that officers distributed among the soldiers and civilians inside and outside the city wall so that they could all eat a little Thus the people could both try the taste and overcome their fearEvery single household was most impressedJourney to the West By now the smiths had made the three weapons and were kowtowing to Monkey saying My lord we have finished our work How heavy are they Monkey askedThe goldbanded cudgel weighs a thousand pounds the smiths replied and the ninetoothed rake and the demonquelling staff each eight hundred pounds Thatll do said Monkey who then had the three princes asked to come outAs each took his weapon they said to the senior prince Your Royal Highness our weapons have now been finished They almost cost both your father and yourselves their lives the senior prince repliedThanks to our divine teachers powers the young princes said we were all saved and the evil spirits have been wiped out Well have no trouble from them in futureNow this really is a world at peace with calm seas and rivers running clear The four princes then rewarded the smiths and went to the Gauze Pavilion to thank the teachersSanzang told the Great Sage and the other two to pass on some more martial skills quickly so as not to delay their journeyThe three of them all swung their weapons in the palace yard as they taught the secrets one by oneWithin a few days the three young princes were all skilled performers They also mastered all the seventytwo routines of attack retreat and fast and slow fightingThis was firstly because the princes were all thoroughly determined and secondly because the Great Sage Sun had given them the divine strength beforehand that enabled them to lift and move the thousandpound cudgel and the eighthundredpound rake and staffThere was all the difference in the world between their present skills and those they had had before and there is a poem that goesWhen they celebrated their fortune in finding divine teachers They never expected their studies to alert a lion spiritWith evil destroyed the country was at peace The frontier was settled as all were devoted to the one EntityNinefold Numinositys powers lasted through their many clashes Till the Way was achieved with allround expertiseThe brilliant teaching would be passed on for ever And Yuhua know eternal peace and joyThe prince then gave another great banquet to thank the three teachers and a huge dish of gold and silver was brought out as a rewardTake it straight back inside Monkey said with a smile take it straight backWere monks and thats no use to us We really cant take gold or silver put in Pig who was standing beside him but the lion spirits tore our clothes to ribbonsIf you could give us a change of clothing that would be very kind of you The prince Journey to the West ordered his tailors to fetch some bolts of blue red and brown brocade and make each of them a garment after the style and colours of their old onesThe three of them were delighted to accept and put on their new brocade tunics after which they packed up the luggage and set off on their way againEveryone inside and outside the city whether young or old exclaimed that they were arhats and living Buddhas come down to earthCrowds packed the streets to the sound of drums and music and banners flew overheadIndeed From the gate of every family the incense smoke arose At every households door coloured lanterns hung in rowsThe people only went back after seeing them for a long way along their journey Only then did the four travelers manage to leave the city and head WestBy leaving they shook off all thought and immersed their hearts in the True AchievementIndeed Free from thought and worry the Buddhas land they seek Going faithfully sincerely towards the Vulture PeakIf you do not know how much further the journey was to be or when it was to end listen to the explanation in the next installmentAdmiring the Moon Festival Lanterns in Jinping The Tang Priest Confesses in Dark Essence Cave Where should one strive to practice dhyana Swiftly to extirpate the misdeeds of the thoughthorse and the mindapeWhen they are firmly tethered they give off radiance But whoever halts falls to the three paths of sufferingIf one allows the divine elixir to leak away The jadepure nature will wither as one slackensAnger joy and worry must all be swept away When the wonderful mystery is gained it seems like nothingJourney to the West The story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples left the city of Yuhua and had a very easy journey in what really was a land of paradiseWhen they had been travelling for five or six days another city appearedWhere is this the Tang Priest asked Brother MonkeyIts a city Monkey replied but there are no flags on the poles above the city wall and I dont know this area so Ill ask when we get closer When they reached the Eastern suburb they found it noisy with bars and teahouses and bustling with a rice market and oil shopsSome idlers who were wandering in the streets with nothing better to do crowded round for a better look when they saw Pigs long snout Friar Sands black face and Monkeys red eyes but they dared not come any closer to question the travelersThe Tang Priest was sweating with the worry that they would provoke trouble as they crossed several more streets and had still not yet reached the city wallThen they saw a monastery gate over which were the words CLOUDS OF COMPASSION MONASTERYWhat about going in here to give the horse a rest and take a meal the Tang Priest suggested to which Monkey replied Splendid splendid The four of them then went inside and this is what they sawSplendid towering buildings Gleaming bases for statuesThe Buddha hall rise above the clouds The monks cells lie in the moonlit silenceRed mists circle the stupas In the shade of jadegreen trees the scripturewheel is coolThis is a true Pure Land Another Naga Palace Where purple mists surround the Mahavira HallThe cloisters are never empty of people enjoying the sights And visitors climb the pagoda that is always openIncense burns in the stand at every moment And lamps shine on the altar through the nightA golden bell rings rhythmically in the abbots lodgings As monks worship the Buddha by reciting sutrasJourney to the West As the four of them looked around a monk came along the cloister and said to the Tang Priest with polite gestures of greeting Where have you come from Teacher From the Tang Court in China the Tang Priest replied at which the monk went down on his knees to kowtow only to be quickly helped up by the Tang Priest who asked Why do you perform this great courtesy reverend abbot All the lovers of goodness here who read the sutras and recite the name of the Buddha hope to achieve rebirth in your land of China so that when I saw you coming in your magnificent mitre and robes I was certain that your present splendor must be the result of your successful cultivation in earlier livesThats why it is right to kowtow to you It alarmed me said the Tang Priest with a smile it alarmed me I am only an itinerant monk and know no splendor at allTo be able to live at your leisure and ease as you do abbot is real bliss The monk then led the Tang Priest to worship the Buddha statues in the main hall It was only now that Sanzang called for his disciplesAfter seeing their master start talking to the monk Monkey and the other two had been standing in a group with their faces averted holding the horses bridle and looking after the luggage so that the monk had not noticed themBut when they turned round on hearing the Tang Priests call the sight of them so frightened the monk that he called out My lord why are your distinguished disciples so hideously ugly Ugly they may be the Tang Priest replied but they do have some magical powersI have been very grateful for their protection all the way along the journey As they were speaking more monks came out to greet themThe monk who had been the first to welcome the visitors explained to the others This teacher has come from Great Tang in China and these three gentlemen are his distinguished disciples Teacher said the others with mixed pleasure and apprehension why have you come here from Great China I have been commanded by the Tang emperor to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Western Heaven Sanzang repliedAs I was passing this way I have come to your monastery to ask where we are and take a vegetarian meal before setting out again The monks were all delighted and they invited the visitors into the abbots lodgings where there were some more monks who were performing ceremonies on behalf of benefactorsThe monk who had met them first went on to explain to the others Come and have a look at what people from China are likesome are handsome and some are uglyThe beauty of the handsome ones could never be caught in a painting or drawing and the ugly ones look really weird Both the monks and the benefactors all came to greet them after which everyone sat downWhen tea had been drunk the Tang Priest inquired What is this fine country called This is Jinping one of the outer prefectures of India the monks repliedHow far is it from this prefecture to Vulture Peak the Tang Priest askedIt is about seven hundred miles from here to the capital the monks replied and we have walked that distanceAs we havent gone further Journey to the West West to Vulture Peak we dont know how far that is and would not like to make a wild guess The Tang Priest thanked themA little later a vegetarian meal was provided after which the Tang Priest wanted to be on his way only to be pressed to stay by the monks and the benefactors who said Teacher you must stay for a couple of days or soEnjoy the Full Moon Festival before you go on your way On my journey I have only been aware of mountains and rivers and the danger of running into ogres or monsters the Tang Priest replied and I have lost my sense of time I dont know when Full Moon is Its because your heart is so set on worshipping the Buddha and on enlightenment that you have not thought about it Teacher the monks repliedToday is the thirteenth of the first month and the lanterns will be tried out tonightThe day after tomorrow is the fifteenth when the festival begins and it goes on till the lanterns are put away on the eighteenth or nineteenthWe enjoy celebrations here and our prefect who cares for the people has lanterns set out everywhere and music played all nightWe also have a Bridge of Golden Lampsits an ancient tradition that still flourishesIf you will stay for a few days my lords our monastery can certainly afford to entertain you The Tang Priest had no choice but to stayAs the bell and drum in the Buddha hall resounded to the skies the faithful came in from the streets bringing lanterns to present to the BuddhaThe Tang Priest and the rest of them came out of the abbots lodgings to look at the lanterns after which everyone turned inThe next day when they had eaten the vegetarian breakfast the monks of the monastery brought them they strolled in the garden at the backIt really was a lovely place It is the first month of the year The beginning of the springThe wooded garden is quiet and elegant The beauty of the scene subduedThroughout the four seasons flowers and trees contend Turquoise peaks rise behind each otherFragrant flowers are growing before the steps And scent comes from the plumtrees branchesWhere there is red it joins the tender peach blossom Where there is green it mingles with the willows fresh greenForget about the splendor of the Gold Valley Garden Say nothing of the Wang River landscapes painted by Wang WeiIn the flowing stream Journey to the West The wild ducks bob and rise Among bamboos by the thousand Poets ponder their choice of wordsTree and herbaceous peonies myrtle fleetingsmile flowers That waken when their time is due Camellias red plum blossom winter jasmine and daphne All early to open out their beautyThe snow piled by the hidden cliff seems frozen solid still The clouds that drift by the distant trees already bring early traces of springThe deer sees its reflection beside the pool Cranes come to hear the lute beneath the pinesA few halls and pavilions to East and West Where travelers may stay Buildings and pagodas to North and South Where monks may meditate in peaceAmong the flowers Are one or two houses to nourish ones nature Where double eaves rise above each otherAmid the hills and streams Are three or four cells in which to reline magic Peaceful and lightThis is indeed a natural spot for a recluse Why look elsewhere for the earthly paradiseAfter a day enjoying the garden they inspected the lanterns in the Buddha hall before going to look at the lantern festivalThis is what they saw Journey to the West A splendid city of agate A fairyland of glass Palaces of crystal and mica Like layer upon layer of brocade Openwork carving behind openwork carvingThe dazzling bridge of stars moved heaven and earth While trees of fire made waves of red Flutes and drums played in the streetsA moon like a ring of jade hung over a thousand gates Fragrant breezes blew through ten thousand homesThere were giant turtle peaks soaring on high Fishes and dragons emerging from the sea Phoenixes sporting in the skyAs all admired the moon and the lanterns The atmosphere was full of harmonyAmong the crowds dressed in fine silks All enjoyed the songs and panpipesCarriages rumbled along There was no end of beautiful faces Dashing gallants And marvellous sightsWhen Sanzang and the others had looked at the lanterns in the monastery they wandered around the streets of the Eastern suburb not going back to bed till the second watch in the middle of the nightThe next day Sanzang said to the monks I made a vow to sweep pagodas and on the occasion of tonights Moon Festival I would like to ask the reverend abbot to open the doors of the pagoda to allow me to fulfil this vow The monks opened the doors and when Friar Sand fetched his cassock and brought it to him on the ground floor he put it over his shoulders and prayed to the BuddhaThen he swept the ground floor with a broom took the cassock off and gave it back to Friar SandHe swept the second story next and so on story by story till he reached the topIn every story there was a Buddha and in each one he opened all the windows Journey to the West swept the floor and enjoyed the splendid viewsBy the time he had finished sweeping and come down again it was late and all the lamps had been litIt was now the night of the full moonVenerable teacher the monks said last night you only saw the lamps in our humble monastery and the outskirts of the cityAs tonight is the main festival why dont we go into the city to see the golden lamps there The Tang Priest was glad to follow this suggestion and he went with his three disciples and the monks of the monastery into the city to see the lanternsIndeed On the festive fifteenth night The harmony of spring begins with the first full moonDecorated lanterns hang in the busy markets As all sing the songs of a world at peaceOver the lantern light in streets and markets The moons round mirror rises in the sky Like a silver dish driven by the charioteer Ping YiThe lanterns were like a brocade carpet woven by fairies The lanterns were reflected by the moon Doubling its brilliance The moon shone on the lanterns Making them resplendentThere was no end of ironchain star bridges Lantern flowers and trees of fireSnowflake lanterns Plumblossom lanterns Like fragments of ice in spring Embroidered screen lanterns Painted screen lanterns Made up from every colorWalnut lanterns Journey to the West Lotus lanterns Hung high on lantern towers Blue lion lanterns White elephant lanterns Fixed on lofty framesShrimp lanterns Terrapin lanterns Placed in front of awnings Goat lanterns Hare lanterns Bringing the eaves to lifeEagle lanterns Phoenix lanterns Lined up next to each other Tiger lanterns Horse lanterns Being carried along togetherRedcrowned crane lanterns White deer lanterns Carrying the Star of Longevity Goldfish lanterns Whale lanterns On which rode the poet Li BaiGiant turtle mountain lanterns Where gods and immortals gathered Revolving horse lanterns Journey to the West On which warriors joined combatThe towers of lanterns on thousands of houses Made a world of clouds and smoke for several milesOn one side shining reins and flying jade saddles On the other rumbling carriages leave fragrance behindOn the red balcony Leaning against the railings Behind the curtains Shoulder to shoulder Hand in hand Pairs of beauties were eager for the funBy the bridge over green waters Noisy Manycoloured Drunken Laughing Couples enjoyed the brilliant sightsAll of the citys flutes and drums were playing Panpipes and songs went on all nightThere is also this poem as evidenceAmid the fine brocades of lotus were the songs This blessed land at peace was full of many throngsThe lanterns and the moon upon this festive night Foretold rich harvests after rain and wind just right Journey to the West This was a night when the curfew was relaxed so that there were huge crowds and a great commotionPeople were dancing walking on stilts wearing masks and riding elephants pushing and crowding to East and to West as they looked all aroundWhen they reached the bridge of golden lamps the Tang Priest and the monks pushed forward for a look and saw that it consisted of three golden lamps each the size of a water vat and shaped like a twostoried pavilion with a light shining out through intricate gold and silver filigree openworkGlazed ceramic tiles inside the lamps reflected their light They were so bright they outshone the moon and their oil was very fragrantWhat sort of oil do those lamps burn the Tang Priest asked the monks and why does it smell so remarkably good You wouldnt know that Teacher the monks repliedThere is a county near this prefecture called Mintian In the whole county there are  wards and when we have our annual assignment of jobs to be done for the state  households have to provide oilAll the other jobs assigned by the prefecture or county are reasonable enough but these oil households have a very hard time Every household has to take it on for a year and it costs them over two hundred ounces of silverThe oil isnt ordinary oil but perfumed refined butter oilOne ounce costs two ounces of silver and a pound costs thirtytwo ouncesEach of the lamps holds five hundred pounds of oil making  pounds for the three of them costing  ounces of silverWith other miscellaneous expenses it comes to over  ounces And that only lasts three nights How can so much oil be used up in only three nights Monkey askedIn each lamp there are fortynine big wicks about the size of an egg made of rushes wrapped in silk floss the monks explainedWhen they have burned for one night the Lord Buddhas appear the oil all vanishes and the lamp goes out I suppose the Lord Buddhas take all the oil said Pig with a grin as he stood at one sideThats right the monks replied thats what everyone in the city has always said ever since ancient timesIf the oil runs dry they say that the Buddhas have taken the oil and the crops will certainly be bountiful but if it doesnt dry up on one occasion there will be famine drought and the wrong weather at the wrong time in that yearThats why everyone makes this offering As they were talking there was the howling of a wind up in the air sending everyone who was admiring the lanterns fleeing in terrorThe monks could not hold their ground either Lets go back venerable teacher they said the winds hereIts the Lord Buddhas bringing blessings Theyre here to see the lanterns How can you tell that the Tang Priest askedIts the same every year the monks replied The wind blows up before the third watchEverybody gets out of the way as they know that it is the Lord Buddhas bringing down blessings I am one who thinks of invokes and worships Buddhas the Tang Priest saidIf the Buddhas are honoring us with their presence on this festive occasion it would be wonderful to be able to worship them He rejected the monks repeated urgings to go back and a little later the forms of three Buddhas appeared in the wind and approached the lampsThe Tang Priest was so excited that he ran to the top of the lamp bridge and threw himself down worshipJourney to the West Brother Monkey rushed forward in alarm to drag him to his feet and say Theyre no good MasterIm sure theyre evil Before the words were even out of his mouth the lamps all went out as with a great whoosh the Tang Priest was swept up by the windIt was terrible Who knew what evil monsters from what cave in what mountain had been posing as Buddhas to watch the golden lampsPig and Friar Sand were thrown into such panic that they rushed all about searching and calling for their masterBrothers called Monkey no use shouting hereThe masters bliss has turned to disasterHes been carried off by evil spirits How can you tell that my lord the appalled monks askedYoure just a bunch of mortals Monkey replied with a grin so you havent realized whats been happening all these years The evil spirits have fooled you into thinking theyre true Buddhas coming down to accept the offerings of lampsThe Buddhas that appeared when the wind blew just now were three evil spiritsMy master didnt realize who they were so he went up on the top of the bridge to worship them They covered up all the lights and carried him off together with the oil in the lampsAs I was a bit too late the three of them got away by wind Brother said Friar Sand Whatever are we to do Not a moment to lose said MonkeyYou two go back the monastery with the monks and look after the horse and the luggageIm going after them while this winds still blowing The splendid Great Sage then shot up by his somersault cloud into mid air picked up the stench of the wind and headed Northeast in pursuit carrying on till all of a sudden the wind dropped at dawnA great mountain could be seen a most steep towering and splendid mountain Many a foothill and ravine Twisting and bending streamsCreepers hang from the beetling precipice Pine and cypress rise from the lonely rockCranes cry in the morning mists Wild geese call among the clouds at dawnJutting peaks like a row of halberds Jagged crags of interlocking rocksThe summits rise to eighty thousand feet And sheerwalled ridges make a thousand anglesWild flowers and noble trees all flourish with the spring Journey to the West Cuckoo and oriole respond to the scenery with songMajestic beauty Towering grandeur Steep grotesque crags hard to climbOne will stay there long in silence All that can be heard are tigers and leopards breathingRiver deer and white deer wander around Jadecoloured hares and gray wolves come and goThe stream in the deep ravine will flow for a million miles Twisting torrents splash loud against the rocksWhile the Great Sage was on the top of a scar looking for his way he saw four people coming from the Western slopes driving three goats and all shouting New Year Monkeys fiery eyes with their golden pupils flashed as he took a closer look to see that they were the four Duty Gods of the year the month the day and the hour in disguiseThe Great Sage then pulled out his iron cudgel shook it till it was as thick as a ricebowl and about twelve feet long and sprang down from the cliff with a shout of Where are you skulking off to like that trying to hide your faces When the four Duty Gods realized that he had rumbled them they at once turned back into their normal selves kowtowed beside the path and said Forgive us Great Sage forgive us Just because I havent had any jobs for you recently you thought I was getting lax and so youve all become very casual Monkey said You didnt even greet me Its outrageousWhy arent you giving my master your secret protectionWhere are you going Because your master somewhat forgot his dhyana nature and was so eager to enjoy himself in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in Jinping Prefecture the Duty Gods said he met with evil at the height of splendor his joy turned to disaster and he was captured by the evil spiritsThe Defenders of the Faith are looking after him at the momentWe realized that you would be coming after him this very night Great Sage and we came here to report to you in case you did not know the mountains and forests here If you were here to report said Brother Monkey why did you disguise your identities why were you driving three goats and what were you shouting and yelling for The three goats were for luck at the beginning of the yearThey are to drive away the evil thats obstructing your master Journey to the West Monkey had been absolutely determined to beat them but on hearing this explanation he let them off and put his cudgel away as his fury turned to delight Are there evil spirits on this mountain he askedYes they replied yesThis mountain is called Green Dragon Mountain and theres a cave in it called the Dark Essence Cave where three evil spirits live The oldest is called King Coldavoider the second is called King Heatavoider and the third is called King DustavoiderTheyve lived here for a thousand years and have been fond of refined butter oil since they were children Ever since they became spirits some years ago theyve been pretending to be Buddhas to trick the officials and people of Jinping into setting out those golden lamps full of the refined butter oil that they take in their Buddha guises in the middle of every first monthWhen they saw your master this time they realized that he was a holy monk and carried him off to the cave too Any day now theyll slice off his flesh to fry in the refined butterYou must use your skills to save him as soon as possible On hearing this Monkey dismissed the four Duty Gods with a shout and went round the mountain looking for the caveWithin a mile or two he saw a rock face by a gill at the foot of which was a stone building with a pair of stone doors that stood ajarBeside the doors was a stone tablet on which was inscribed GREEN DRAGON MOUNTAIN DARK ESSENCE CAVE Not daring to go in uninvited Monkey stopped and called Give me my master back at once monster With a great noise the doors burst wide open and out rushed a crowd of bullheaded demons who glared as they asked Who are you yelling here like that Im the senior disciple of the holy monk Tang Sanzang whos come from Great Tang in the East to fetch scriptures Monkey repliedHe was looking at the lanterns in Jinping along our way when your chief demons carried him off hereGive him back at once if you want me to spare your livesIf you dont Ill turn our den upsidedown and turn all you demons into just pus and blood As soon as the junior demons heard this they rushed inside to report Disaster Your Majesties disaster The three old evil spirits had taken Sanzang into the depths of the cave and with no further ado were telling their underlings to strip him and wash him with water from the torrent They were just about to have him sliced and diced into tiny pieces to fry in the refined butter when they heard the report of disaster from outsideThe oldest demon king asked with some alarm what had happenedTheres a hairyfaced monk who looks like a thunder god outside the junior devils replied Hes shouting that Your Majesties carried his master here and wants him given back straight away if our lives are to be sparedOtherwise hell turn our den upsidedown and turn us all into pus and blood This news shocked the demon kings who all said Weve only just caught the wretch and havent even asked him his name and his backgroundLittle ones dress him again and bring him here to be questionedWe must find out who he is and where hes from A crowd of devils untied the Tang Priest put his clothes back on and pushed him to before the thrones where he fell to his knees trembling with fear and pleaded Spare my life Your Majesties spare my life Journey to the West Where are you from monk the three evil spirits said all talking at once and why did you rush into the way of our clouds instead of avoiding the Buddha images I have been sent by the Great Tang Emperor in the East to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Great Thunder Monastery in India Sanzang replied with kowtowsWhen I went into the Clouds of Compassion Monastery for a vegetarian meal the monks there pressed me to stay to see the lanterns at the Moon FestivalSeeing Your Majesties appearing as Buddhas from the bridge of golden lamps I kowtowed to you because my mortal eyes took you for real BuddhasThats why I got in the way of your clouds Your Majesties How long was the journey from your country in the East to here the evil spirits askedHow many people have you got with youWhat are they calledTell us the truth straight away and well spare your life My secular name was Chen Xuanzang the Tang Priest replied and I was a monk in the Jinshan Monastery from boyhoodLater I was given official rank as a monk in the Hongfu Monastery in ChanganWhen the minister Wei Zheng beheaded the Dragon King of the River Jing in his dream and the Tang emperor came back to life after his travels in the underworld a Great Land and Water Mass was held for the rebirth of souls The Tang emperor chose me to officiate at this ceremony and expound the great principlesThe Bodhisattva Guanyin appeared during the mass and informed me that in the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven there are three stores of true scriptures that can carry the dead up to Heaven I was sent to fetch them and given the title Sanzang or Three Stores As I use Tang as my surname people call me Tang SanzangI have three disciplesThe first one is called Sun Wukong the Novice and he is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who has been converted to the truth This news came as a shock to the evil spirits who asked Did this Great Sage Equaling Heaven make great havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago Yes yes the Tang Priest saidThe second one is called Zhu Wuneng or Zhu Bajie He is Marshal Tian Peng come down to earthThe third is Sha Wujing or Friar Sand the Curtainlifting General in mortal reincarnation Its as well we havent eaten him yet the evil spirits all exclaimed in horrorLittle ones lock the Tang Priest in iron chains at the back When weve caught his three disciples well eat them together They then mustered a force of armed yak waterbuffalo and ox spirits to go outside carrying bugles waving banners and beating drumsOnce the three evil spirits were fully clad in their armor they went out and shouted Whos that who dares come here shouting like that Monkey slipped round behind the scar to have a good look and this is what the evil spirits were likeMulticoloured faces round eyes Towering hornsFour sharppointed ears Neat and shining brightBodies patterned like a painting Journey to the West Covered with brocades that shine like firefliesThe first one wore a hat of foxes fur And hot steam rose from the long hairs of his faceThe second wore a flaming cloak of lightest gauze And had four gleaming jadelike hoovesThe third had a mighty roar like thunder His sharp and pointed fangs were just like silver needlesEach was brave and fierce As they carried their three weapons One used a battleaxe One was an expert in the cutlass And the third had a knotted flail resting on his shouldersThe other evil spirits tall and short fat and thin senior and junior were all cattleheaded monsters carrying spears or clubsThere were three big banners clearly inscribed with the words King Coldavoider King Heatavoider and King Dustavoider After looking at all this for a while Monkey lost his patience and went up to them with a shout of Can you recognize Monkey thieving damned ogres Are you the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven the evil spirits shouted backIt really is a case of I heard your name before I saw your face The sight of that would bring the gods disgraceSo all you are is a macaque Ill get you you lampoil thieves Monkey retorted in high dudgeon Dont talk such rubbish you smoothtongued monstersGive my master back at once With that he advanced and swung his iron cudgel to be parried by the old demons who raised their weapons to meet the blowA splendid fight ensued in the mountain hollow Battleaxe cutlass and flail Journey to the West Met by the Monkey Kings lone cudgelColdavoider Heatavoider and Dustavoider Had heard of the Great Sage Equaling HeavenWhen the cudgel rose it scared demons and gods Axe and cutlass hacked and flewA primal dharma image of true emptiness Holding off three demons masquerading as BuddhasTheir noses all greasy with this years stolen oil They tried to snatch the monk sent by the emperorOne for his masters sake feared not the lengthy road The others in their greed had lamps offered every yearAll that could be beard was clash of axe and cutlass And the noisy clatter of the cudgelWith clashes and lunges three fought against one As each showed his skill with blocks and parriesThey fought from dawn till almost nightfall And a victor had yet to emerge in the struggleBy the time Monkeys cudgel had gone  rounds with the three demons it was nearly evening and the outcome was still in doubtThen Dustavoider sprang forward from the ranks with a swing of his flail and waved a flag whereupon the crowd of cattleheaded demons swarmed round Monkey encircling him and swinging wildly at him with their weaponsSeeing that things were going badly Monkey set off his somersault cloud and fled in a whooshThe demons did not go after him but called their devils back so that everyone could have an evening mealThey told the junior devils to take a bowl of food to Sanzang as well he was not to be dealt with until Monkey had been caughtAs the master was a lifelong vegetarian and was besides feeling miserable he sobbed and let none of the food touch his lipsThe story tells how Monkey rode his cloud back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery and called Brothers Journey to the West On hearing this Pig and Friar Sand who were waiting for him and discussing what to do came out together to greet him with the words Brother why are you only back now after being away all dayWhats happened to the master I followed the smell of the wind right through the night till we got to a mountain and it disappeared Monkey replied with a smileLuckily the four Duty Gods told me that the mountains called Green Dragon Mountain and that theres a Dark Essence Cave on it where three evil spirits live King Coldavoider King Heatavoider and King DustavoiderTheyve been stealing the oil here for years on end by disguising themselves as Buddhas to trick the officials of Jinping PrefectureWhen they came across us this year they wickedly carried our master off with themI told the Duty Gods and the rest of them to give the master some secret protection while I shouted insults at them from outside their doorsWhen the three demons came out they all looked like bullheaded demonsThe first of them fought with a battleaxe the second with a cutlass and the third with a flailThey had a whole gang of cattleheaded monsters with them waving banners and beating drumsThe fight went on all day and was still in the balance when one of the demon kings waved a flag to bring all the junior devils forwardAs it was late and I was worried that I couldnt beat them I came back by somersault cloud I reckon it must be the Demon King of Fengdu whos making trouble for you said PigWhat makes you guess that Friar Sand askedI can tell because our big brother said they were all cattleheaded monsters replied Pig with a laughNo no said MonkeyI saw them and they were all rhinoceros spirits If theyre rhinos weve just got to catch them and saw their horns off said PigTheyll be worth quite a bit of silver As they were talking the monks all asked Monkey if he had eaten any supperIll have something if its no trouble Brother Monkey replied but I can do without just as well Surely youre hungry after fighting all day my lord the monks saidYou cant get hungry in a mere day Monkey laughedI once went without food for five hundred years The monks did not know whether he was telling the truth or joking and a little later food was brought in that Monkey ate after which he said Tidy up and go to sleepWell go and fight them again tomorrow and capture the demon kings so as to rescue the master What nonsense brother said Friar Sand who was standing to one sideAs the saying goes Delay brings wisdom Itll be terrible if that monster stays awake tonight and murders the masterWed better go there right now and make such a row that he cant do anythingIt may go badly wrong if we lose a single moment When Pig heard this he braced himself and said Friar Sands right Lets go and put down those demonsThe moons bright enough Accepting their advice Monkey left his instructions with the monks of the monastery Look after the luggage and the horse When weve captured the evil spirits well bring them back here to prove to the prefect that theyre imposters Then he can end the oil levy and relieve the common people of this hardshipThatll be a good thing wont it The monks all accepted their orders while the three of them left the city by auspicious cloudIndeed Journey to the West Idleness and unrestraint Threw the dhyana into confusion Danger and catastrophe Led the Wayheart into delusionIf you dont know who was to win this encounter listen to the explanation in the next installmentThree Monks Wage a Great Fight on Green Dragon Mountain Four Stars Seize the Rhinoceros Monsters The story tells how after the Great Sage Monkey took his two brother disciples by gale and cloud to the Northeast they were soon bringing their cloud down at the entrance to the Dark Essence Cave on Green Dragon Mountain Pig was just about to smash the doors in when Monkey said Wait a momentIll go in and find out whether the masters still alive before we have it out with him But the doors are shut very tightly said Friar SandHow will you get in Ive got my methods Monkey repliedThe splendid Great Sage then put his cudgel away made a spell with his fingers while saying the magic words called Change and turned into a firefly He was really nimbleJust look at him Wings that shine like shooting stars The ancients say fireflies grow from rotting plantsHis powers of transformation are truly great And he loves to wander all aroundWhen he flies to the stone doors to look within A draft blows through the crack beside himA single jump and he is in the dark courtyard Watching the movements of the evil spiritsJourney to the West As he flew in he saw some cattle sprawled around on the ground fast asleep and snoring like thunderIn the main hall nothing was moving and all the doors were closedNot knowing where the three evil spirits were sleeping he went through the hall and shone with his light into the back where he heard sobsThe Tang Priest was chained to a pillar under the eaves at the back and weepingMonkey kept out of sight as he listened to what he was crying about and this is what he heard Since I left Changan in China some ten years back and more I have had to suffer much crossing all those rivers and mountainsI came out to the West at a very happy season Arriving in the city for the festival of lanternsI failed to understand that the Buddhas were impostors All because my fate seems to doom me to distressMy disciples gave pursuit and will use their mighty powersI pray they will be able to achieve a great success Delighted to hear this Monkey spread his wings and flew closer to his master who wiped away his tears and observed Goodness the West really is differentThis is only the first month of the year when dormant insects are just beginning to wake upFancy seeing a firefly now Master said Brother Monkey unable to keep quiet any longer Im here I was just wondering how there could be a firefly at this time of year and its you the Tang Priest replied with delightMaster said Monkey turning back into himself the journeys been held up so long and so much effort has been wasted because you cant tell true from falseAll the way along Ive told you demons are no good but you will kowtow to them When those devils covered up the lamps to steal the refined butter oil they carried you off tooI told Pig and Friar Sand to go back to the monastery and keep an eye on our things while I followed the smell of the wind hereI didnt know what the place was called but luckily the four Duty Gods told me that this is Dark Essence Cave on Green Dragon MountainI fought the monsters all day long till I went back at evening told my brotherdisciples the full story and came back here with them instead of going to badAs I thought it was too late at night to fight and didnt know where you were I transformed myself to come in and find out whats going on Are Pig and Friar Sand outside the happy Tang Priest askedYes Monkey repliedIve just had a look around and seen that the evil spirits are all asleepIll unlock you smash the doors down and get you out The Tang Priest nodded his head in gratitudeJourney to the West Using his unlocking magic Monkey made the lock open at a touchHe was just leading his master to the front of the cave when the demon kings could be heard shouting from their bedrooms Shut the doors tight little ones and be careful of fireWhy cant we hear the watchmen calling the watchesWhere are the clappers and bells After a days hard fighting the junior demons were all asleep exhausted and they only woke up when they heard the shout To the sound of clappers and bells several of them came out from the back holding weapons and beating gongs and they just happened to bump into Monkey and his masterWhere do you think youre going my fine monks now youve broken the locks the junior devils all shouted together and with no further argument Monkey pulled out his cudgel shook it to make it as thick as a rice bowl and struck killing two of them at a blowThe rest of them dropped their weapons went to the central hall beat on the doors and shouted Disaster Your Majesties disasterThe hairyfaced monks got inside and hes killing people The moment the three demons heard this they tumbled out of their beds and ordered Catch themCatch them This gave the Tang Priest such a fright that his hands and legs turned weakMonkey abandoned him and stormed his way forward swinging his cudgelThe junior devils could not stop him as pushing two or three aside here and knocking two or three over there he smashed several pairs of doors open and rushed straight out shouting Where are you brothers Pig and Friar Sand greeted him rake and staff raised for action with the question Whats up brother Monkey told them all about how he had transformed himself to rescue the master been found by the spirits when they woke up and been forced to abandon him and fight his way outNow that they had recaptured the Tang Priest the demon kings had him locked up in chains again and questioned him in the glare of lamplight as they brandished cutlass and axeHow did you open the lock damn you they asked and how did that ape get insideConfess this moment and well spare your life or else well cut you in half This so terrified the Tang Priest that he fell to his knees shivering and shaking and said Your Majesties my disciple Sun Wukong can do seventytwo kinds of transformationsJust now he turned into a firefly and flew in to rescue meWe never realized that Your Majesties would wake up or that we would bump into Their Junior MajestiesMy wicked disciple wounded a couple of them and when they all started shouting and going for us with weapons and torches he abandoned me and escaped If wed woken up earlier hed never have got away the three demon kings said with loud guffawsThey then told their underlings to fasten the doors firmly at front and back and stop shoutingAs theyve shut the doors and stopped shouting I think they must be going to murder the master said Friar SandWe must act Youre right said PigLets smash the doors The idiot showed off his magical powers by smashing the stone doors to smithereens with a blow from his rake then shouted at the top of his voice Thieving oilstealing monstersSend my master out right now This gave the junior devils inside the doors such a fright that they tumbled and ran inside to report Disaster Your Majesties disasterThe monks have smashed the front doors Journey to the West Theyre outrageous damn them the three demon kings said in a great fury and when they had sent for their armor and fastened it on they took their weapons and led their underlings into battleIt was now about the third watch of the night and the moon in the middle of the sky made all as bright as dayAs they led their forces out they wasted no more words and started fightingMonkey held off the battleaxe Pig blocked the cutlass and Friar Sand took on the flailThree monks with cudgel staff and rake Three evil monsters both brave and angryThe battleaxe the cutlass and the flail Made howling winds and set the sand flyingIn their first clashes they breathed out baleful mists Then as they flew around they scattered coloured cloudsThe nailed rake went through its routines round the body The iron cudgel was even more splendidly heroic And the demonquelling staff was something rarely seen on earth But the unrepentant ogres would not yield a foot of groundThe brightbladed axe had a sharppointed butt The whirling flail made a pattern of flowers And the flashing cutlass swung like a painted door But the monks were their matchOne side was fighting with fury for their masters life The other hit at their faces so as not to release the Tang PriestThe axe hacked and the cudgel blocked in the struggle for mastery The rake swung and the cutlass struck as they fought The knotted flail and the demonquelling staff Coming and going in a splendid displayJourney to the West When the three monks and the three monsters had been fighting for a long time without either side coming out on top King Coldavoider shouted Come on little ones The monsters all charged at Pig quickly tripping him up and bringing him to the groundSeveral waterbuffalo spirits dragged and pulled him inside the cave where they tied him upWhen Friar Sand saw that Pig had disappeared and heard the mooing of all the cattle he then raised his staff feinted at King Dustavoider and tried to flee only to be rushed by another crowd of spirits who pulled at him sending him staggeringHowever hard he struggled he could not get up and he too was carried off to be tied up Realizing that he was in an impossible situation Monkey escaped by somersault cloudWhen Pig and Friar Sand were dragged to him the Tang Priest said with tears welling up in his eyes at the sight of them Poor things You two have been caught tooWheres Wukong When he saw wed been caught he ran away Friar Sand repliedWherever he has gone he will certainly have gone to fetch help said the Tang Priest But who knows when we will be delivered Master and disciples felt thoroughly miserableThe story tells how Brother Monkey rode his somersault cloud back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery where the monks met him with the question Have you been able to rescue Lord Tang Its difficult said Monkey very difficultThose three evil spirits have tremendous magical powers and when we three had fought them for a long time they called up their underlings to capture Pig and Friar SandI was lucky to get away My lord said the monks with horror if someone who can ride mists and clouds as you can couldnt catch them your master is bound to be killed No problem Monkey replied no problemMy masters under the secret protection of the Protectors the Guardians the Dings and the Jias He has besides eaten Grassreturning Cinnabar Im sure his life will be safe The only trouble is that those demons really know their stuffYou people look after the horse and the luggage while I go up to Heaven to get some troops Can you go up to Heaven my lord asked the terrified monksI used to live there replied Monkey with a smileBecause I wrecked the Peach Banquet when I was Great Sage Equaling Heaven our Buddha subdued me so that now Ive no option but to redeem my crimes by guarding the Tang Priest while he fetches the scriptures All along the journey Ive been helping the good and fighting against the evilWhat you dont realize is that the master is fated to have these troubles When the monks heard this they kowtowed in worship while Monkey went outside and disappeared with a whistleThe splendid Great Sage was soon outside the Western Gate of Heaven where the Metal Planet Heavenly King Virudhaka and the four spirit officers Yin Zhu Tao and Xu were talking to each otherAs soon as they saw Monkey coming they hastily bowed to him and said Where are you going Great Sage After we reached Mintian County in Jinping Prefecture on the Eastern borders of India Monkey replied my master the Tang Priest who Im escorting was being entertained by the monks of the Clouds of Compassion Monastery for the Full Moon FestivalWhen we went to the Bridge of Golden Lamps there were three golden lamps full of over fifty thousand ounces of silvers worth of scented refined butter oil that the Buddhas came down to take every yearWhile we were admiring the lamps three Buddha images did come Journey to the West down to earth and my master was gullible enough to go on the bridge to worship themI told him they were a bad lot but by then the lamps had been covered up and the master carried off with the oil by a windWhen Id followed the wind till dawn I reached a mountain where the four Duty Gods fortunately told me that it was called Green Dragon Mountain with a Dark Essence Cave in it where three monsters livedKing Coldavoider King Heatavoider and King DustavoiderI hurried to their doors to demand the master and fought them for a while without success so I got in by transforming myself to find the master locked up but unharmedI released him and was just taking him out when they woke up and I had to flee againLater I fought hard against them with Pig and Friar Sand but the two of them were both captured and tied upThats why Ive come up to inform the Jade Emperor find out about the monsters background and ask him to give orders to have them suppressed At this the Metal Planet burst out laughing and said If youve been fighting the monsters why cant you tell where theyre from I can see that Monkey replied Theyre a bunch of rhino spiritsBut they have such enormous magical powers that I cant beat them and Im desperate They are three rhinoceros spirits the Metal Planet explainedBecause their form is seen in heaven they cultivated their awareness for many years and became true spirits able to fly on clouds and walk in mistsThose monsters are fanatical about cleanliness and dont like the look of their own bodies and are always going into the water to batheThey have lots of different names there are sherhinos herhinos gelded rhinos spotted rhinos humao rhinos duoluo rhinos and heavenconnected brindled rhinosThey all have a single nostril three types of hair and two horns They roam the rivers and seas and can travel through waterIt looks as though Coldavoider Heatavoider and Dustavoider have nobility in their horns which is why they call themselves kingsIf you want to catch them they will submit to the four beast stars belonging to the element wood Which four wood stars Monkey askedCould I trouble you venerable sir to spell it out for me Those stars are spread out in space outside the Dipper and Bull Palace the planet replied with a smileIf you submit a memorial to the Jade Emperor he will give you detailed instructions Raising his clasped hands as he expressed his thanks Monkey went straight in through the heavenly gatesHe was soon outside the Hall of Universal Brightness where he saw the heavenly teachers Ge Qiu Zhang and Xu who asked Where are you going Weve just reached Jinping Prefecture Monkey replied where my master relaxed his dhyana nature by going to enjoy the Moon Festival lanterns and was carried off by evil monstersAs I cant subdue them myself Ive come to ask the Jade Emperor to save him The four heavenly teachers then took Monkey to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to submit his memorial and when all the ceremonials had been performed he explained his businessThe Jade Emperor then asked which units of heavenly soldiers he wanted to help himWhen I arrived at the Western Gate of Heaven just now Monkey replied the Metal Planet told me they were rhinoceros spirits that could only be subdued by the four beast stars belonging to the element wood The Jade Emperor then told Heavenly Teacher Xu to go to the Dipper and Bull Palace with Monkey to fetch the four beast stars and take them down to the lower world to make the captureBy the time they arrived outside the Dipper and Bull Palace the Twentyeight Constellations were there to greet themWe are here by imperial command to order four beast stars belonging to the element wood to go down to the lower world with the Great Sage Sun the heavenly teacher explainedThe Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Constellation Horn the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper the Wooden Wolf of the Strider and Journey to the West the Wooden Hyena of the Well all stepped forward from the side to ask Where are you sending us to subdue demons Great Sage So youre the ones said Brother Monkey with a smileThat old man Metal Planet kept your names secret and I didnt realize what he was driving atIf hed told me before that it was you four wooden animals from the Twentyeight Constellations Id have come here to invite you myselfthered have been no need to trouble His Majesty for an edict What a thing to say Great Sage the four wooden animals replied Wed never have dared to leave on our own authority in the absence of an imperial decreeWhere are theyLets go right away They are rhinoceros spirits in the Dark Essence Cave in Green Dragon Mountain to the Northeast of Jinping Prefecture If theyre really rhinoceros spirits said the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper the Wooden Wolf of the Strider and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn youll only need Wooden Hyena from the Well ConstellationHe can eat tigers on mountains and capture rhinos in the sea But these arent ordinary rhinos who gaze at the moon replied MonkeyThey have cultivated their conduct and found the Way and are a thousand years oldAll four of you gentlemen must come no excusesIf one of you cant capture them singlehanded itll be wasted effort You people are talking nonsense the heavenly teacher addedThe imperial command is that all four of you go so go you mustFly there at once while I report back The heavenly teacher then took his leave of Monkey and wentDelay no more Great Sage the four wooden ones said You challenge them to battle and lure them out so we can come from behind you and get them Monkey then went up to the cave and shouted abusively Oilthieving ogresGive my master back The doors which Pig had smashed open had been barricaded with a few planks by a number of junior devils and when they heard his insults they rushed inside to report Your Majesties the monk Sun is outside insulting us again We beat him and he ran away said Dustavoider so whys he back again todayI think he must have got some reinforcements from somewhere Were not scared of any reinforcements he could get said Coldavoider and Heatavoider scornfullyLets get into our armor at onceLittle ones surround him carefully and dont let him get away Not caring about their lives the evil spirits came out of the cave holding spears and swords with banners waving and drums beating Back again are you macaque they shouted at Brother MonkeyNot afraid of another beating Nothing infuriated Monkey so much as the word macaque and he was grinding his teeth in rage as he lifted his cudgel to hit themThe three demon kings brought their junior devils up to surround him at which the four wooden beasts who were waiting to one side swung their weapons with shouts of Dont move animals The three demon kings were of course most alarmed at the sight of the four stars and they all said This is terrible terrible Hes found the people who can beat usRun for your lives little ones With that there was much roaring lowing panting and sighing as the junior devils all resumed their original appearances as yak waterbuffalo and ox spirits running all over the mountainThe three demon kings also turned back into their true selves put their hands down to become fourhoofed creatures like iron cannons and galloped off to the Northeast to be followed hard by the Great Sage leading the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Journey to the West Lesser Dragon of the HornWhile they were not going to relax for a moment the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper and the Wooden Wolf of the Strider were mopping up all the cattle spirits among the hollows summits ravines and valleys of the Eastern mountain Some were killed and others taken aliveThey then went into the Dark Essence Cave to free the Tang Priest Pig and Friar SandRecognizing the two stars Friar Sand bowed to them in thanks and asked What brought you two gentlemen here to rescue us We came to rescue you because the Great Sage Monkey submitted a request to the Jade Emperor that we be sent the two stars repliedWhy has my disciple Wukong not come in the Tang Priest asked with tears in his eyesThe three old demons are rhinoceroses the stars explained and when they saw us they fled for their lives to the Northeast The Great Sage Sun has gone after them with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the HornWe two wiped out the oxen then came here to rescue you holy monk The Tang Priest once again kowtowed in thanks then kowtowed to heavenMaster said Pig overdone courtesy is hypocrisy Stop kowtowing all the timeThe four star officers came at the Jade Emperors command and as a favour to big brotherThe ordinary demons have all been wiped out but we still dont know how the senior demons are to be put downLets clear all the valuables out of the cave wreck the place so as to dig out their roots then go back to the monastery to wait for Monkey Marshal Tian Peng your suggestion is right said the Wooden Wolf of the StriderYou and the Curtainlifting General escort your master back to the monastery to sleep while we head Northeast to fight the enemy Yes yes said PigWith you two to help youre bound to wipe them all outThen youll be able to report back on your mission The two star officers immediately joined the chaseAfter Pig and Friar Sand had found a bushel of valuables in the cavethere was much coral agate pearls amber precious shells jade and goldthey carried them outside and invited the master to sit on the top of a crag while they started a fire that burned the whole cave to ashesOnly then did they take the master back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in Jinping PrefectureIndeed The classic says Disaster comes at the height of success Indeed one can meet with evil in happinessFor love of the lanterns the dhyana nature was disturbed The heart set on the Way was weakened by a beautiful sightThe great elixir has always had to be permanently guarded Once it is lost one always comes to griefShut it up tight bind it fast never idle A moments lack of care can lead one astrayJourney to the West We will tell not of how the three of them went back to the monastery their lives saved but of how the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper and the Wooden Wolf of the Strider were riding their clouds Northeast in pursuit of the demons when they lost sight of them in mid airOn reaching the Western Ocean they saw the Great Sage Monkey down by the sea a long way away shoutingWhere have the monsters gone Great Sage they asked bringing their clouds downWhy didnt you two come after them and help put them down Monkey repliedHow can you have the nerve to ask that question When we saw that you and the stars from the Well and the Horn had routed the demons and were going after them Great Sage the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper replied we were sure youd capture them so we two wiped out the rest of the devils rescued your master and fellowdisciples from the cave searched the mountain burned the cave out and entrusted your master to your two fellowdisciples to take back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in the cityWe only came after you this way when you had been gone for such a long time In that case you did very well said Brother Monkey his wrath now turned to pleasure Thank you for going to so much troubleThe only thing is that when wed chased the three ogres this far they plunged into the seaThe two stars from the Well and the Horn followed close behind them while I stayed on the shore to cut off their escapeNow youre here you can block them on the shore while I go there The splendid Great Sage then swung his cudgel and made a spell with his fingers as he cleared a way through the waters plunging deep into the waves where the three monsters were locked in a lifeanddeath struggle with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the HornMonkeys here he shouted springing forward The evil spirits could barely hold off the two star officers so when they heard Monkeys great yell at this moment of crisis they turned and fled for their lives into the middle of the seaTheir horns were very good at parting the waters and they cleared their way through the sea with a whooshing noise the two star officers and the Great Sage Monkey chasing after themA yaksha who was patrolling the Western Ocean with a shelled warrior saw from a distance the way the rhinoceroses were parting the waters recognized Monkey and the two stars and rushed back to the crystal palace to report to the dragon king in alarm Your Majesty the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and two stars from the sky are chasing three rhinoceroses this way When the old dragon king Ao Shun heard this he said to his heir Prince Moang Muster our water forces at once Im sure it must be the three rhinoceros spirits Coldavoider Heatavoider and Dustavoider whove provoked Sun the Novice As theyre in the sea now wed better lend a hand Having been given his orders Ao Moang hastened to muster his troopsA moment later a fullyarmed force of tortoises softshelled turtles alligators bream mackerel mandarin fish carp and prawn and crab soldiers charged out of the crystal palace shouting their battlecries together to stop the rhinoceros spiritsUnable to go any further forward the rhinoceroses made a hasty retreat only to find their escape blocked by the stars from the Well and the Horn as well as the Great SageIn their panic they failed to stay in a group but scattered as they fled for their lives Dustavoider was soon surrounded by the old dragon kings men A delighted Monkey called out Stop Take him aliveDont kill him When Moang heard this order he rushed forward knocked Dustavoider to the ground put an iron hook through his snout and tied all his hoofs togetherJourney to the West The old dragon king then divided his forces into two to help the star officers capture the other two monstersAs the young dragon prince led his men forward the Wooden Hyena of the Well reverted to his real form to hold Coldavoider down and start eating him in big and little bitesWell Star Moang shouted Dont kill himThe Great Sage Monkey wants him alive not dead Moang shouted several times but by then the Hyena had already gnawed right through the monsters throatMoang ordered his prawn and crab soldiers to carry the dead rhinoceros back to the palace of crystal then joined the Wooden Hyena of the Well in the pursuitHeatavoider who was being driven back towards them by the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn ran straight into the star from the Well at which Moang ordered his tortoises softshelled turtles and alligators to spread out in the winnowingfan formation to encircle the monsterSpare me spare me the monster pleadedThe wooden Hyena of the Well sprang forward grabbed the monster by the ear seized his sword and shouted I wont kill you I wont kill youIll take you to the Great Sage Monkey for him to deal with you The troops then went back to the crystal palace where they reported Weve got them both Monkey saw that one was lying headless and gory on the ground while the other was being forced to kneel by the Wooden Hyena of the Well twisting his earThat head wasnt cut off with a weapon Monkey said on going up for a closer lookIf I hadnt shouted so hard the star officer of the Well would have eaten the whole of him up replied Moang with a smile Very well then said MonkeyIn that case youd better get a saw to cut off his horns and have his hide removed for us to takeWell leave the flesh for your worthy father the dragon king and yourself to enjoy A chain was then run through Dustavoiders nose for the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn to lead him by and the same was done to Heatavoider for the Wooden Hyena of the WellTake them to the prefect of Jinping said MonkeyInvestigate them question them about all the years they masqueraded as Buddhas to harm the people then off with their heads They all then did as Monkey told them taking their leave of the dragon king and his son and emerging from the Western Ocean leading the rhinoceroses with themWhen they met the other two stars from the Strider and the Dipper they went by cloud straight back to Jinping PrefectureHere Monkey called out as he stood in mid air on a beam of auspicious light Mr Prefect subordinate officials soldiers and civilians of Jinping listen to what I say We are holy monks sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western HeavenIn this prefecture and its counties you have had to make offerings in golden lamps every year to these rhinoceros monsters pretending to be Buddhas coming down to earthWhen we came here and were admiring the lamps at the Moon Festival these monsters carried the oil and our master off together I asked for some gods from heaven to capture themWeve cleaned out their cave and wiped out the monsters They wont be able to give you any more troubleYou neednt waste the peoples money making offerings in golden lamps here any more When Pig and Friar Sand who were just escorting the master back into the Clouds of Compassion Monastery heard Monkey talking from up in the sky they abandoned their master dropped the luggage and shot up into the air by cloud to ask Monkey about how the demons had been beatenJourney to the West One of them was chewed to death by the star from the Well Monkey replied and weve got his sawnoff horns and his hide with usThe other two weve brought back alive Throw the pair of them down into the city said Pig for the officials and everyone else to see Then theyll know were gods and sagesIll trouble you four star officers to put your clouds away land and come into the prefectural court with us to execute the monstersThe facts are clear and the penaltys the right oneTheres nothing else to be said Marshal Tian Peng is right and he knows the laws too the four stars saidI have learned a bit during my years as a monk Pig repliedThe gods then pushed the rhinoceroses which fell wreathed in coloured clouds into the prefectural court to the astonishment of the prefectutal officials and everyone else inside and outside the walled city who all set up incense tables outside their houses and bowed their heads to worship the gods from heavenA little later the monks of the Clouds of Compassion Monastery carried the venerable elder into the court in a sedan chair When Sanzang met Monkey he kept thanking him adding I am very grateful for the trouble I have put the star officers to in rescuing usI had been very anxious when I did not see you worthy disciple but now you have returned in triumphI wonder where you had to chase the monsters to before you caught them After I left you the day before yesterday Monkey replied I went up to heaven to make some enquiries The Metal Planet knew that the monsters were rhinoceroses so he told me to ask for the four beast stars that belong to the element woodSo I submitted a memorial to the Jade Emperor and he sent them straight to the mouth of the cave where they gave battleWhen the demon kings fled the stars from the Dipper and the Strider rescued you Master I chased the demons with the Well and the Horn stars straight to the Western Ocean where the dragon king sent his son out with their troops to help usThats how the monsters were captured and brought here for questioning The venerable elder was full of endless praise and thanksThe prefectural and county officials and their subordinates all lit precious candles and whole containers of incense sticks as they kowtowed in respect A little later Pig lost his temper pulled out his monastic knife and beheaded first Dustavoider then Heatavoider each with a single strokeThen he removed their four horns with a sawThe Great Sage Monkey then had another suggestion to make You four star officers must take these four rhinoceros horns to the upper world to offer to the Jade Emperor as trophies when you report back on your mission As for the two horns he had brought back from the sea he said Well leave one here to guard the storehouses of the prefectural palace and as evidence that from now on no more lampoil will ever be leviedWell take the other to offer to the Lord Buddha on Vulture Peak The four stars were delighted and after bowing to take their leave of the Great Sage they rose by coloured cloud to report back to the Jade EmperorThe prefectural and county officials kept the master and his disciples for a great vegetarian banquet to which all the rural officials were also invitedNotices were issued to tell the military and civil population that golden lamps were not to be lit the next year and that the duty of serving as an oilpurchasing household was abolished for everButchers meanwhile were instructed to remove the rhinoceros skins to be steeped in saltpeter and smoked dry for making into armor while the flesh was to be distributed to the officialsAt the same time money and grain that had been raised by unjust fines on innocent people were spent to buy a plot of privatelyowned empty land On this a temple to the four stars who had put the demons down as well as a shrine to the Tang Priest and his three disciples were to be built Stone tablets with inscriptions were to be set up for each of them to record their deeds for ever as a mark of gratitudeJourney to the West Master and disciples relaxed and enjoyed the offeringsThey had hardly a moment to themselves as they had so many invitations from the  lampoil householdsPig was delighted to have so much to eat and he always kept in his sleeve some of the treasures he had collected in the cave to give to all his hosts to thank them for their banquetsWhen they had stayed there for a month and were still unable to get away the Tang Priest ordered MonkeyWukong give all the remaining valuables to the monks in the Clouds of Compassion MonasteryLets leave before dawn without letting the rich families here knowIf we are so eager to enjoy ourselves here that we delay in fetching the scriptures we may offend the Lord Buddha and cause some catastrophe That would be terrible Monkey then disposed of all the objectsWhen they got up early the next morning at the fifth watch Pig was woken up to get the horse readyThe idiot had eaten and drunk so well that he was still half asleep as he said Why get the horse ready so early The master says weve got to be going Monkey shoutedThat reverend gentleman doesnt do things right the idiot said rubbing his eyesWeve had invitations from all  of the big families but only had thirty or so good vegetarian meals so far How can he be making me go hungry again When the venerable elder heard this he retorted abusively Dregguzzling idiot Stop talking such nonsense Get up at onceIf you go on arguing back like that Ill tell Wukong to smash your teeth in with his goldbanded cudgel At the mention of a beating the idiot gesticulated frantically as he said The masters changed Usually he favours me and likes me and protects me because Im so stupid When you want to hit me brother he usually persuades you not toSo whys he dead set on telling you to hit me today The masters angry with you for being so greedy Monkey replied and holding us up on our journeyIf you dont want me to hit you pack the luggage and get the horse ready As the idiot really was scared of being hit he jumped out of bed got dressed and shouted to Friar Sand Get up right nowHes going to start hitting Friar Sand then jumped up too and they both got everything packedKeep quiet said the Tang Priest waving his hands about and dont disturb the monks He quickly mounted after which they opened the gate of the monastery and found their way outIndeed this departure was Letting the phoenix escape from the birdcage of jade Secretly opening locks so the dragon goes freeIf you dont know what the households who still wanted to thank them did at daybreak listen to the explanation in the next installmentJourney to the West In the Almsgivers Garden Antiquity and Causes Are Discussed In the Court of India the King Meets the Monks When thoughts arise there surely will be desire Longing is certain to lead one to disasterWhy should intelligence distinguish the three ranks of nobilityWhen conduct is complete it naturally returns to the primal seaWhether you become an immortal or a Buddha All must be arranged from withinIn absolute purity with all dust removed All will be achieved and one will rise to heavenThe story tells how when Sanzang and his disciples were nowhere to be seen at dawn the monks in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery all said We couldnt keep them we couldnt say goodbye to them and we werent able to ask them for anythingWeve let those living Bodhisattvas slip clean away As they were talking some of the great families from the Southern outskirts of the city came in with invitations at which the monks clapped their hands in regret and said We were caught off our guard last nightthey all rode off by cloud Everyone then kowtowed to heaven in gratitudeThe news was spread to all the officials in the city who told the great families to prepare the five kinds of sacrificial animal flowers and fruit to offer to the shrines in thanksgivingThe story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples fed on the wind and slept in the open travelling uneventfully for the best part of a monthOne day they suddenly saw a high mountainDisciples said the Tang Priest in fear the ridge in front of us is very steepYou must be very careful As our journey has brought us so close to the land of the Buddha there will definitely be nothing evil here said MonkeyDont worry Master Disciple the Tang Priest replied although we are not far from the Buddhas land the monks told us in the monastery the other and they didnt know how much further after that Have you forgotten the Heart Sutra that the Rooks Nest Hermit taught you again Master asked MonkeyThe Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra is constantly with me like my habit and begging bowl Sanzang replied There has not been a day ever since the Rooks Nest Hermit taught it to me that I have not recited itI have never forgotten it for a moment I can even recite it backwardsHow could I possibly forget it Journey to the West You can only recite it Master said MonkeyYou never asked the hermit to explain it Ape retorted Sanzang How can you say I dont understand itDo you understand it then Yes Monkey replied I do After that neither Sanzang nor Monkey made another sound This had Pig falling about with laughter while Friar Sand was hurting himself he was so amused Nonsense said Pig We all started out in life as monstersWere not Dhyana monks whove heard the sutras being explained or Buddhist priests whove been taught the dharmaHes pretending just putting on an act How can you say you understandWell then why arent you saying anythingWere listeningPlease explain Second brother said Friar Sand leave him beBig brothers only talking big like that to keep the master goingWhat he knows about is how to use a cudgel What does he know about explaining sutras Stop talking such nonsense Wuneng and Wujing said SanzangWukong understands the wordless language That is true explanation As master and disciples talked they did indeed cover a long distance leaving the ridge behind them They saw a big monastery beside the roadWukong said Sanzang Theres a monastery ahead Just look at itIts neither too big nor too small But has green glazed tiles Neither too new nor too old And with a red wallLeaning canopies of azure pines can just be seen Who knows how many thousand years old they areListen to the murmur of the waters in the channel Cut from the mountain untold dynasties agoAbove the gates is written Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery The tablet is inscribed Ancient relic Journey to the West Monkey saw that it was called the Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery and Pig said so tooSpread Gold Sanzang wondered as he sat on his horse Spread Gold Can we be in the country of Sravasti This is very remarkable Master said PigIn all the years Ive been with you youve never known the way before but you seem to know it now No Sanzang replied I have often read in the scriptures about the Buddha being in the Jetavana garden in the city of SravastiThe Venerable Almsgiver Sudatta tried to buy it from the prince as a place to ask the Buddha to preach inThe prince refused to sell the garden and said he would only part with it if it were covered with goldWhen the Venerable Almsgiver heard this he had gold bricks made with which he covered the whole garden to buy it Then he invited the Buddha to preach on the dharmaI am sure that the name Spread Gold Monastery must refer to that story Were in luck said Pig with a smile If that storys true we can find ourselves one of those bricks as a present to give people Everybody laughed after which Sanzang dismountedAs they went in through the monastery gates they saw people carrying loads with shoulderpoles or on their backs pushing carts or sitting in loaded carts Others were sleeping or talkingThe sight of the master who was so handsome and his three hideous disciples rather frightened them so they drew back to make wayWorried that his disciples would provoke trouble Sanzang kept saying Behave yourselvesBehave yourselves They were all very restrainedAs they went round the Vajra Hall a Dhyana monk of most unworldly appearance came out to meet themA face like a shining full moon A body like a bodhi treeThe wind blew through the sleeve round his staff As his sandals trod the stony pathWhen Sanzang extended a monastic greeting to him the monk returned his courtesy and asked Where are you from teacher I am Chen Xuanzang Sanzang replied sent to the Western Heaven at the command of the Great Tang emperor in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scripturesAs my journey brings me here I am paying you this hasty visit to request a nights shelter before continuing on my way tomorrow This monastery of ours is one that receives people from all quarters the monk repliedEveryone is welcome to visit and we would be especially happy to provide for so holy a monk from the East as your reverend self Sanzang thanked him and called to his three disciples to come with him as they crossed the cloister and refectory and went to the abbots lodgingsWhen they had exchanged courtesies they sat down as befits host and guestsMonkey and the other two sat down as well their hands at their sidesThe story tells how on learning that monks from Great Tang in the East who were going to fetch the scriptures had arrived all in the monastery young and old alike whether permanent inmates itinerant monks Journey to the West elders or novices came to see themAfter tea had been drunk a vegetarian meal was brought inWhile Sanzang was still saying the grace before the meal Pig in his impatience had already grabbed and wolfed down steamed buns vegetarian dishes and soup noodlesIn the crowded abbots lodgings those who knew better were admiring Sanzangs majestic bearing while those who enjoyed fun watched Pig eatWhen Friar Sand cast his eyes around and saw what was happening he gave Pig a discreet pinch and muttered Behave yourself At this Pig started a desperate howl of All this behave yourself behave yourself Im starving You dont understand brother Friar Sand replied with a smileWhen it comes to the belly all the wellbehaved people in the world are exactly the same as we two Only then did Pig stop eatingAfter Sanzang had said the grace for the end of the meal the attendants cleared the tables and Sanzang expressed his thanksWhen the monks asked about why they had come from the East Sanzangs conversation turned to ancient sites and he asked them about the name Spread Gold MonasteryThis used to be the Monastery of the Venerable Almsgiver in the country of Sravasti the monks answeredIt was also known as the Jetavana and its name was changed to its present one after the Venerable Almsgiver covered the ground with gold bricks in those days the Venerable Almsgiver used to live in the country of Sravasti and our monastery was his Jetavana which is why it was renamed the Almsgivers Spread Gold MonasteryThe site of the Jetavana is at the back of the monasteryWhenever there has been a torrential rainstorm in recent years small pieces of gold and silver have been washed out and some people are lucky enough to pick them up So the story is a true one said Sanzang going on to ask Why did I see so many travelling merchants with horses mules carts and carryingpoles resting here when I came in through the gates of your monastery This mountain is called Mount Hundredfoot the monks repliedWe used to live in peace and prosperity here but with the cyclic progression of the natural forces a number of centipede spirits have for some inexplicable reason appearedThey attack people on the roads and though nobody gets killed people dont dare to travelAt the foot of the mountain theres a Cockcrow Pass that people only dare to cross after cockcrowAs all these strangers arrived late they are worried that it would not be safe and are putting up here tonightTheyll set out at cockcrow As master and disciples were talking a vegetarian meal was brought in that they ateSanzang and Monkey were strolling in the light of the rising half moon when a lay brother came to announce Our ancient master would like to meet the gentlemen from China Sanzang at once turned to see an ancient monk holding a bamboo cane who came forward to greet him and ask Are you the teacher come from China You do me too great an honour Sanzang replied returning his greetingThe old monk was full of admiration for him asking how old he wasI have wasted fortyfive years Sanzang repliedMay I ask how old you are Just one sixtyyear cycle older than you teacher the other answeredThen youre a hundred and five this year Brother Monkey saidHow old do you think I am Journey to the West Teacher the old monk replied your appearance seems so ancient and your spirit so pure that I could not tell in a hurry especially by moonlight with my poor eyes After talking for a while they walked to the back cloister for a look roundWhere is the site of the Almsgivers Garden that you mentioned just now Sanzang askedOutside the back gate the other repliedOn the order being given for the back gate to be opened immediately all that could be seen was the ruined base of a stone wallPutting his hands together Sanzang sighed and said I think of the benefactor Sudatta Who gave his treasures to help the needy The fame of Jetavana long endures Where is he now with the enlightened arhat After a leisurely stroll enjoying the moonlight they sat down for a while on a terrace where they heard the sound of sobbingAs Sanzang listened with a still heart he could hear that the weeper was grieving because her parents did not know of her sufferingThis moved him to sorrow and he found himself in tears as he turned to the monks and asked Who is it being so sad and where On hearing this question the ancient monk sent all the others away to prepare tea and when nobody else was around he kowtowed to the Tang Priest and Brother MonkeyVenerable abbot said Sanzang helping him to his feet again why do you pay me this courtesy As I am over a hundred the ancient monk replied I do know a little of the ways of the world and in between periods of meditation and stillness I have seen some thingsI know a certain amount about you my lord and your disciples and you are not like other peopleThe only teachers here who would be able to analyze this most painful business are you Tell me what its all about said MonkeyA year ago today the ancient monk replied I was concentrating my mind on the nature of the moon when I suddenly heard a gust of wind and the sound of someone grievingI got out of bed went into the Jetavana and saw a beautiful girl thereWhose daughter are you I asked herWhy are you here I am a princess the daughter of the king of India the girl repliedThe wind blew me here when I was looking at the flowers by moonlight I locked her up in an empty room that I bricked up like a prison cell just leaving a gap in the door big enough to pass a bowl throughThat day I told the other monks that she was an evil spirit I had capturedBut as we monks are compassionate I couldnt kill her and every day she is given two meals of simple food and drink to keep her aliveThe girl is clever enough to understand what I mean and to prevent herself from being sullied by the other monks she has pretended to be deranged and slept in her own piss and shitDuring the day she talks nonsense or just sits there in silence but in the still of the night she cries because she misses her parentsIve been into the city several times to make enquiries about the princesses but not a single one is missingSo I have put her under stronger locks and I am even more determined not to let her goNow that you have come here teacher I beg you to go to the capital and use your dharma powers to find out the truthJourney to the West You will thus be able both to rescue the good and display your magical powers When Sanzang and Monkey heard this they noted it very carefullyAs they were talking two junior monks came in to invite them to take tea and go to bed so they went back insideBack in the abbots lodgings Pig and Friar Sand were grumbling Well have to be on our way at cockcrow tomorrow so why arent you in bed yet Whats that youre saying idiot Monkey askedGo to bed Pig repliedWhy are you admiring the blooming scenery this late At this the ancient monk left them and the Tang Priest went to bedSweet dreams of flowers in the moonlit silence Warm breezes coming through the window gauzeAs water drips in the clepsydra to fill three sections The Milky Way shines on the splendors of the palaceThey had not slept long that night when they heard the cocks crowingThe traders in front of the monastery all got up noisily and prepared their breakfast by lamplightThe venerable elder woke up Pig and Friar Sand to bridle the horse and pack up while Monkey called for lamps to be litThe monks of the monastery who were up already set out tea soup and snacks and waited on themPig ate a plate of steamed buns with delight then took the luggage and the horse outside while Sanzang and Brother Monkey took their leave of all the monksPlease dont forget about that very tragic business said the ancient monk Ill give it all my attention Monkey replied all my attentionOnce Im in the city Ill be able to find out the truth from what I hear and see They traders noisily set off togetherBy the last watch of the night they were through Cockcrow Pass and by ten in the morning the walls of the city were in sightIt was indeed a powerful city as strong as an iron cauldron the heavenly capital of a divine regionThe city Was a crouching tiger or a coiled dragon on high ground Colorful with its phoenix towers and unicorn hallsThe waters of the royal moat encircled it like a belt In his mountainside paradise were many a monumentThe morning sun lit up banners by the highway Journey to the West The spring wind carried the sound of pipes and drums across the bridgesThe wise king was dressed in robes and crown The crops were abundant and the splendor manifestThat day they reached the streets of the Eastern market where the traders all put up at innsAs Sanzang and his disciples were walking in the city they came to a government hostel and went insideThe hostel manager went to report to the hostel superintendent that there were four strangelooking monks outside who had arrived with a white horseOn being told about the horse the superintendent realized that they must be on an official mission so he went out to welcome themI have been sent by the Tang court in the East to the Great Thunder Monastery on Vulture Peak to see the Buddha and seek the scriptures Sanzang replied with a bow I have a passport to present at court for inspection I would be grateful if I could spend the night in Your Excellencys distinguished hostelI will be on my way when my business has been done This hostel has been established to entertain envoys and travelers the superintendent replied returning his bow so it is only right that we should entertain youPlease come in please come in A delighted Sanzang invited his disciples to come in to meet the superintendent who was quietly appalled by their hideous facesHe did not know whether they were men or demons so he trembled as he saw to tea and a vegetarian meal for themNoticing his fright Sanzang said Dont be afraid Your Excellency My three disciples look hideous but they are good at heart As the saying goes the faces are ugly but the men are kindTheres nothing to be afraid of about them The hostel superintendents worries were eased when he heard this Where is your Tang court Teacher of the Nation In the land of China in the continent of Jambu Sanzang repliedWhen did you leave home was the next questionIn the thirteenth year of Zhenguan fourteen years ago Sanzang replied I had to cross thousands of rivers and mountainsit was very hardto arrive here You are a holy monk the hostel superintendent saidHow old is your exalted dynasty Sanzang askedThis is the great land of India the superintendent replied and the dynasty has endured for over five hundred years since our High AncestorOur reigning sovereign who is a lover of landscapes and flowers is known as the Happy Emperor His reignperiod is called Jingyan and is now in its twentyeighth year I would like to have an audience with His Majesty today to have the passport inspected and returned said SanzangWhen does he hold court Splendid the superintendent said absolutely splendidToday is the twentieth birthday of Her Royal Highness the kings daughter A decorated tower has been built at the crossroads where the princess is going Journey to the West to throw down an embroidered ball to let heaven decide who her husband it to beToday is a very lively one and I believe that His Majesty will not yet have finished his morning audienceThis would be a good time to go if you wish to have your passport inspected and returned Sanzang was just about to set happily off when the meal was brought in so he ate it with the superintendent Monkey and the other twoBy now it was past midday and Sanzang said I had better be going Ill escort you Master said Brother MonkeyMe too said Pig No dont brother put in Friar Sand Your face is nothing much to look at so theres no point in your going to look impressive outside the palace gatesBest let our big brother go Wujing is right Sanzang commented The idiot is coarse and stupidWukong is more clever and subtle The idiot thrust his snout out and said Apart from you Master theres not much to choose between our three faces Sanzang then put on his cassockMonkey took the passport case had accompanied himIn the streets everyonegentleman peasant artisan trader scholar penpusher dimwit or common manwas exclaiming Lets go and see the embroidered ball being thrown Sanzang stood beside the road and said to Monkey People clothes buildings language and speech here are all the same as in our Great TangI remember that my late mother married after throwing an embroidered ball to make the match she was destined for and they have that custom here too What about us going to take a look too asked MonkeyNo no Sanzang replied We are not wearing the right clothes for the occasionWe might arouse suspicion Master said Monkey youve forgotten what the ancient monk in the Spread Gold Monastery told usWe could find out whether she is genuine or not while were taking a good look at the decorated towerWith all this bustle and activity the king is bound to be going to hear the princesss good news He wont bother with court businessLets go On hearing this Sanzang did indeed go with Monkey All kinds of people were there to watch the throwing of the embroidered ballOh dearLittle did they know that by going they were like a fisherman casting his hook and line and catching himself troubleThe story now explains that two years earlier the king of India had taken his queen consorts and daughter into the royal garden to enjoy a moonlit night because he so loved landscapes and flowers This had provoked an evil spirit who had carried the princess off and turned herself into the girls doubleWhen she learned that the Tang Priest was coming at this time day month and year the evil spirit had used the wealth of the kingdom to build the decorated tower in the hope of winning him as her mate and absorbing his true masculine primal essence to make herself a superior immortal of the Great MonadAt the third mark of the noonday hour when Sanzang and Monkey had joined in the crowd and were approaching the tower the princess lit some incense and prayed to heaven and earthShe was surrounded by five or six dozen exquisitely madeup beauties who were attending her and holding her embroidered ball for herThe tower had many windows on all sides As the princess looked around she saw the Tang Priest approaching so she took the embroidered ball and threw it with her own hands at the Tang Priests headIt knocked his Vairocana mitre askew giving him such a start that he immediately reached with both hands to Journey to the West steady the ball which rolled down his sleeveAt once there were great shouts from everyone on the tower of Shes hit a monk Shes hit a monk Oh dearAll the travelling merchants at the crossroads pushed and shouted as they rushed to grab the embroidered ball to be met by Monkey with a shout and bared teeth as he bent forward then grew to the majestic height of thirty feetThe hideous face he made gave them all such a fright that they collapsed and crawled about not daring to come closer A moment later they had all scattered and Monkey resumed his true formThe maids palace beauties and senior and junior eunuchs who had been in the tower all camp up to the Tang Priest kowtowed to him and said Your Highness we beg you to come to the palace to be congratulated Sanzang was quick to return their greetings and help them all back to their feetHe then turned back to grumble at Monkey ApeYouve been trying to make a fool of me again It was your head the embroidered ball landed on Monkey replied with a laugh and your sleeve it rolled into Nothing to do with me so what are you moaning at me for What are we going to do Sanzang askedStop worrying Master Monkey saidWhile you go to the palace to see the king Ill go back to the hostel to tell Pig and Friar Sand to waitIf the princess doesnt want you thatll be that You submit the passport and we can be on our wayIf the princess insists on marriage you must say to the king Please send for my disciples so that I can take my leave of them When we three are summoned to court Ill be able to tell whether the princess is real or an impostorThis is the trick called subduing a demon through marriage The Tang Priest had nothing to say as Monkey turned away and went back to the hostelThe venerable elder was hustled by the palace beauties and the rest of them to the foot of the tower from where the princess came down to support him with her jade hand as they both entered the royal carriage The retinue formed a procession to return to the palace gatesThe eunuch gateofficer at once reported to the king Your Majesty Her Royal Highness the princess is outside the Meridional Gate holding a monks arm and waiting to be summonedI expect she hit him with her embroidered ball The king was most displeased to hear this and wanted to have the monk driven away but as he did not know what the princess had in mind he restrained his feelings and summoned them inThe princess and the Tang Priest came in to stand beneath the throne hall Indeed Man and future wife both hailed the king aloud Good and ill together with deep respect kowtowedWhen this ceremonial had been performed they were called into the throne hall where the king began by asking Where are you from monkDid our daughter hit you with her ball Journey to the West The Tang Priest prostrated himself to reply I have been sent by the emperor of Great Tang in the continent of Jambu to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Great Thunder MonasteryAs I carry a passport for this long journey I was coming to present it for inspection at Your Majestys dawn audience when I passed a decorated tower at a crossroads never imagining that Her Royal Highness the princess would throw an embroidered ball that would hit me on the headAs I am a monk and belong to a different faith I could not possibly marry your exquisite daughter so I beg you to spare me the death penalty and return the passportThen I can be on my way and soon reach Vulture Peak see the Buddha ask for the scriptures and return to my own country where Your Majestys divine mercy will be for ever recorded So you are a holy monk from the East the king repliedIndeed a thread can draw together a fated match across a thousand miles Our princess has reached the age of nineteen and is still unmarried and as the hour day month and year are all now auspicious a decorated tower was set up for her to choose a good husband by throwing the ball from itYou just happened to be hit by it and although this does not please us we would like to know the princesss views Your Majesty my father the princess replied kowtowing as the saying goes Marry a cockerel and follow a cockerel marry a dog and follow a dog I swore a vow beforehand made the ball and told heaven earth and the gods that heaven would choose as my husband the man my ball hitAs the ball hit the holy monk today this must have been fated ever since an earlier incarnation which is why we met today I would never dare to change my mindI ask you to take him as your soninlaw Only then was the king happy and he commanded the chief royal astrologer to choose a dayWhile organizing the trousseau the king issued proclamations to the worldWhen Sanzang heard this so far from thanking the king for his kindness he pleaded Forgive me forgive me Youre most unreasonable monk the king repliedWe offer you a nations wealth to be our soninlaw Why wont you stay here and enjoy yourself All you can think about is fetching the scripturesIf you go on refusing we will have the palace guards take you out and behead you The venerable elder was so frightened by this that his soul left his body as he kowtowed trembling and submitted I am grateful for Your Majestys heavenly grace but there are four of us monks travelling WestI have three disciples outside If I am now to be taken as your soninlaw I beg you to summon them inside as I have not yet taken my leave of themThen you can return the passport and let them go at once so that they will not fail in the purpose of their journey to the West The king approved this request asking Where are your disciples In the government hostel for foreigners Sanzang replied and officers were at once sent to fetch the holy monks disciples to receive the passport and be on their way leaving the holy monk there to be the princesss husbandThe venerable elder could only rise to his feet and stand in attendanceFor the Great Elixir not to leak away the Triple Completeness is needed Blame an evil fate if the ascetic way is hardThe Way is in the sage traditions cultivation depends on the self Goodness is accumulated by people but blessings come from HeavenJourney to the West Do not give play to the six senseorgans and their many desires Open up the single nature original and primaryWhen there are no attachments or thoughts purity comes of itself Strive for liberation and achieve transcendenceWe will say no more of how officers were sent to the hostel to fetch Sanzangs three disciplesInstead the story tells how Monkey after taking his leave of Sanzang at the foot of the decorated tower went happily back to the hostel laughing aloud as he walkedWhy are you laughing so cheerfully brother Pig and Friar Sand asked as they greeted him and whys the master disappeared The master has found happiness Monkey replied What happiness Pig askedHe hasnt reached the end of the journey he hasnt seen the Buddha and he hasnt fetched the scriptures The master and I only got as far as the foot of a decorated tower at the crossroads Brother Monkey repliedJust then the kings daughter hit the master with an embroidered ball so he was hustled by palace beauties pretty girls and eunuchs to the front of the tower where he climbed into a carriage to go to the palace with the princess Hes been invited to become the kings soninlawIsnt that something to be cheerful about When Pig heard this he stamped beat his chest and said If Id known beforehand Id have gone too It was all Friar Sands fault for making troubleId have run straight to the foot of the decorated tower the embroidered ball would have hit me first time and the princess would have taken me for her husbandThat would have been marvellous terrific Im handsome and goodlooking Id have been just the man Wed all have been in luck and have had a good timeItd have been real fun Friar Sand went up to Pig rubbed his face and said Shameless youre shameless Thats a handsome mug I must sayYoure like the man who bought an old donkey for threetenths of an ounce of silver and boasted that hed be able to ride itIf shed hit you first time she wouldnt have wanted to wait till tonight before burning spells to get rid of youDo you think shed have let trouble like you into the palace Youre being very disagreeable you blacky Pig repliedUgly I may be but Ive got classAs the old saying goes When skin and flesh are coarse the bones may yet be strong everyone is good at something Stop talking nonsense idiot Monkey retorted and pack the baggageI expect the master will get anxious and send for us so we must be ready to go to protect him at court Youre wrong again brother said PigIf the masters become the kings soninlaw and gone to take his pleasure with the kings daughter he wont be climbing any more mountains or tramping along the road or running into demons and monsters So whatll he want you to protect him fromHes old enough to know what happens under the bedcoversHe wont need you to hold him up Monkey grabbed Pig by the ear swung his fist and said abusively Youre as dirtyminded as ever you cretinHow dare you talk such nonsense While they were in the middle of their quarrel the hostel superintendent came to report His Majesty has sent an official here with a request for you three holy monks to present yourselves Journey to the West Whats he really asking us to go for The senior holy monk had the good fortune to be hit by the princesss golden ball and be taken as her husband the superintendent replied which is why the official has come with invitations for you Where is the official Monkey askedSend him in The official then bowed in greeting to Monkey after which he did not dare look straight at Monkey as he muttered to himself Is it a ghost a monstera thunder goda yaksha Why are you mumbling instead of saying whatever you have to say official Monkey askedTrembling with terror the official raised the royal edict with both hands as his words came tumbling out in confusionHer Royal Highnessinvitationmeet her new relationsHer Royal Highnessmeet her relationsinvitation Weve got no torture equipment here and were not going to beat you Pig said so dont be frightened and take your time telling us Do you think hes scared youre going to beat him Monkey saidWhat hes scared of is your ugly mug Get the carryingpole load packed up at onceWere taking the horse and going to court to see the master and talk things over IndeedOne you meet on a narrow path is hard to avoid Determination can turn love to hatredIf you do not know what was said when they met the king listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Four Monks Dine to Music in the Palace Gardens One Demon Loves in Vain and Longs for Bliss The story tells how Brother Monkey and the other two disciples went with the official who had brought the invitation to outside the Meridional Gate of the palace where the eunuch gate officer immediately reported their arrival and brought back a summons for them to enterThe three of them stood in a row not bowingAre you three gentlemen the illustrious disciples of the holy monkWhat are your namesWhere do you liveWhy did you become monksWhat scriptures are you going to fetch Monkey then came closer intending to enter the throne hallDont move one of the kings bodyguards shouted If you have anything to say say it standing down there We monks like to step forward whenever were given an opening Monkey said with a smile at which Pig Journey to the West and Friar Sand too approached the kingWorried that their rough manners would alarm the king Sanzang stepped forward and called out Disciples His Majesty has asked you why you have come hereYou must submit your reply Seeing his master standing in attendance beside the king Monkey could not restrain himself from calling aloud Your Majesty is treating yourself with respect but others with contemptIf you are taking my master as your soninlaw why do you make him stand in attendance on youThe normal custom is for a king to call his soninlaw Your Excellency and an Excellency really ought to be sitting down This gave the king so bad a fright that he turned pale and wished he could leave the throne hallBut as this would have looked very bad he had to summon up his courage and tell his attendants of fetch an embroidered stool on which he invited the Tang Priest to sitOnly then did Brother Monkey submit the following spoken memorial My ancestral home is the Water Curtain Cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior BodyMy father was heaven my mother earth And I was born when a rock split open took as my master a Taoist adept And mastered the Great WayThen I returned to my land of immortals Where I gathered all of us to live in our cave heavenIn the oceans depths I subdued the dragons Then climbed the mountains to capture wild beastsI removed us from the registers of death Put us on the rolls of the living And was appointed Great Sage Equaling HeavenI enjoyed the heavenly palaces And roamed around the splendid buildingsI met the immortals of Heaven In daily carousals Lived in the holy regions Happy every dayJourney to the West But because I disrupted the Peach Banquet And raised a rebellion in the palaces of Heaven I was captured by the Lord Buddha And imprisoned under the Five Elements MountainWhen hungry I was fed on pellets of iron When thirsty I drank molten copper For five hundred years I tasted no food or teaFortunately my master came from the East To worship in the West Guanyin told him to deliver me from heavenly disaster I was rescued from my torment To be converted to the Yogacarin sectMy old name was Wukong Now I am known as the Novice When the king realized how important Monkey was he quickly came down from his dragon throne and walked over to steady the venerable elder with his hand and say Soninlaw it was divine providence that brought us one such as yourself to be our kinsman through marriage Sanzang thanked the king profoundly for his graciousness and urged him to return to his throneWhich gentleman has the distinction of being the second disciple the king askedPig thrust his snout out to make himself look more impressive as he replied In previous lives old Pig used to be Given to pleasure and indolenceI lived in confusion My nature disordered and my heart deluded did not know how high the sky was or how deep the earth I could not tell the oceans width or the mountains distanceThen in the middle of my idleness Journey to the West I suddenly met a true immortalIn half a sentence He undid the net of evil With two or three remarks He smashed the gate to disasterThen I became aware Took him as my master on the spot Diligently studied the arts of the Double Eight Respectfully refined the Triple Threes sequenceWhen training was complete I was able to fly And ascend to the heavenly palaceThe Jade Emperor in his benevolence Appointed me as Marshal Tian Peng To command the marines of the River of Heaven And wander at ease within the palace gatesThen when I was drunk at the Peach Banquet I misbehaved with the goddess of the moon Was stripped of my commission And exiled to the mortal worldBecause I came into the wrong womb  was born with the likeness of a pigLiving at the Mount of Blessing I committed unbounded evilWhen I met the Bodhisattva Guanyin She showed me the way of goodnessI came over to the Buddhist faith Journey to the West To escort the Tang Priest On his journey to the Western Heaven Seeking the marvellous scripturesMy Dharma name is Wuneng And people call me Bajie When the king heard this he trembled with fear not daring to look at himThis made the idiot more spirited than ever shaking his head pursing his lips thrusting his ears up and roaring with laughterSanzang worried that Pig was giving the king a fright shouted Control yourself Bajie Only then did Pig put his hands together and pretend to behave himselfAnd why was the third distinguished disciple converted the king then askedPutting his hands together Friar Sand said I was originally a mortal man Who turned to the Way out of fear of the Wheel of Reincarnation wandered like a cloud to the corners of the seas Roamed to the very ends of the skyI always wore the robe and held the beggingbowl And ever concentrated my mind within the bodyBecause of my sincerity I fell in with immortals Raised the Baby Boy To mate him with the Lovely GirlWhen the Three Thousand Tasks were achieved All was combined in the Four ImagesI rose above the boundary of the sky Bowed to the dark vault of heaven Journey to the West And was appointed Curtainlifting General  was in attendance on the Phoenix and Dragon Carriage And General was my rankBecause at the Peach Banquet  accidentally smashed a crystal bowl  was exiled to the Flowing Sands River My face was altered And I became an evil killerFortunately the Bodhisattva traveled to the East To persuade me to turn to the faith And await the Buddhas son from Tang Who would go to seek scriptures in the Western HeavenI became his follower and made a fresh start Refining once more my great awarenessI took my surname Sand from the river My Buddhist name is Wujing And my title Friar The king was both most alarmed and most delighted to hear this Delighted because his daughter had found herself a living Buddha and alarmed by three veritable evil godsJust as the king was being torn between alarm and delight the chief astrologer submitted this memorial The wedding has been set for the twelfth day of this month the day of waterrat a lucky time at which all will be auspicious for nuptials What day is it today the king askedToday is the eighth the day of earthmonkey the astrologer replied the day on which gibbons offer fruit and the right day on which to advance worthies and accept their suggestions This greatly pleased the king who sent his officials in attendance to have the halls and pavilions in the royal garden swept clear Here he invited his future soninlaw with his three distinguished disciples to stay while they waited for the nuptial feast at which the princess would marry himThe underlings all carried out their instructions the king ended the audience and the officials withdrewJourney to the West The story now tells how when Sanzang and his disciples reached the imperial garden night was falling A vegetarian meal was laid onWe really deserve a meal today said Pig with delightThe people in charge brought in plain rice and pasta by the carryingpole load Pig kept eating a bowlful then taking a refill over and over againHe only stopped eating when his stomach was completely fullA little later the lamps were lit and the bedding laid out after which everyone went to bedAs soon as the venerable elder saw that there was nobody around he started to shout angrily at Monkey berating him You macaque Wukong You keep ruining meI said we were just going to present the passport and told you not to go near the decorated tower Why did you keep demanding to take me there to have a look Well did you have a good enough lookWhatever are we to do about this trouble you have got us into Master replied Monkey putting on a smile it was you who said My late mother married after throwing an embroidered ball to make the match she was destined for I only took you there because you seemed to want to enjoy something of the pastBesides because I remembered what the ancient monk in the Almsgivers Spread Gold Monastery said I came here to find out whether shes an impostor or notWhen I saw the king just now there was something a bit sinister about the way he looked but I havent yet seen what the princess is like What will happen when you see the princess the venerable elder askedMy fiery eyes with their golden pupils can tell whether someones true or false good or evil rich or poor Monkey repliedIll know what to do and be able to sort out right and wrong So youve learned physiognomy in the last few days elder brother said Friar Sand and Pig with a smilePhysiognomists are just my grandson Brother Monkey repliedStop joking shouted SanzangHe definitely wants me nowWhat are we to do about it At that happy occasion on the twelfth the princess is bound to come out to pay her respects to her parents said Monkey Ill take a look at her from where Ill stand by the sideIf she really is a woman you can be her consort and enjoy the kingdoms glory and splendor This made Sanzang angrier than everYoure a fine ape he said abusively still trying to ruin meAs Wuneng said we have already done ninetyseven or ninetyeight hundredths of the journey Youre trying to destroy me with your crafty tongue againShut up Dont open that stinking mouth of yours any moreNext time theres any misbehavior from you I shall start reciting that spell again and that will be more than you can take The mention of the spell being recited had Monkey falling straight to his knees before Sanzang and pleading Dont say it dont say itIf shes really a woman well all raise a rumpus in the palace during the wedding ceremony and get you out While master and disciples were talking they had not noticed that it was now nightIndeed Slow dripped the clepsydras Heavy hung the fragrance of the flowersPearl curtains hung over splendid doorways Journey to the West No fire or light was seen in the still courtyardEmpty was the shadow of the deserted swing All was silence when the flutes notes died awayThe room was surrounded by flowers and bright in the moonbeams Lit by those spiky stars not blocked by any treesThe cuckoo rested from her song Long was the butterflys dreamThe River Way spanned the celestial vault While white clouds made their way homeJust when they were closest in feeling The willows swaying in the wind were more dispiriting than ever Its late Master said Pig Lets carry on arguing tomorrow morningGo to sleep now go to sleep Master and disciples did then get a nights sleepThe golden cockerel was soon greeting the dawn and the king entered the throne hall for his audienceThis is what could be seen A purple aura rising high above the opened palace As the winds carried royal music to the azure skyWhile clouds drifted the leopardtail banners moved The sun shone upon the demon figures on the roof and the jade pendants tinkledA scented mist delicately touched the palaces green willows While dewdrops lightly moistened the garden flowersA thousand officials in ranks shouted and danced in homage Seas and rivers were at peace and the state was unifiedJourney to the West When all the civil and military officials had paid their homage to him the king proclaimed The Department of Foreign Relations will arrange a nuptial banquet for the twelfthToday the spring wine shall be prepared and our future soninlaw shall be entertained in the royal gardens The Protocol Office were told to lead the three worthy future royal inlaws to sit in the state hostel while the Department of Foreign Relations laid on a vegetarian banquet for the three of themThe two departments arranged for the musicians of the court orchestra to play and look after them while they passed the days enjoying the beauty of springAs soon as Pig heard this he said Your Majesty we always stay with our master we never leave him for a momentAs hes going to be drinking and feasting in the palace gardens wed better go along for a couple of days fun too if our masters to be your soninlawOtherwise the deals off Seeing how ugly and coarsespoken Pig was twisting his head and neck thrusting his snout out and waving his earswhich all made him seem rather intimidatingthe king was so worried that Pig might ruin the wedding that he had to accede to the requestPrepare a banquet for two in the SinoBarbarian Hall of Eternal Pacification for our soninlaw and ourselfPrepare a meal for the other three gentlemen in the Pavilion of Lingering SpringWe are afraid that it might be inconvenient for master and disciples to sit together Only then did the idiot chant his respects to the king and thank himEveryone then withdrew after which the king ordered the officials of the inner palace to prepare a banquet and told the queens and consorts of the three palaces and six compounds to give the princess hair ornaments cakes and other things for the wedding on the twelfthIt was now about ten in the morning and the king had a carriage ready in which to take the Tang Priest and the others to go to see the palace gardens The gardens were a fine placeThe paths inlaid with coloured stones Have carved and chiseled balustradesBeside the paths inlaid with coloured stones Strange flowers spread over the rocks Outside the carved and chiseled balustrades And within them too flower blossoms rareEarly peach trees are a bewitching turquoise And golden orioles dart among the willowsThe walker finds the fragrance fill his sleeve And many pure scents imbue his clothingPhoenix terrace and dragon pool Bamboo lodge and pine pavilionOn the phoenix terrace Journey to the West Pipes are played to lure the phoenix to appear In the dragon pools Fish are reared to become dragons and leaveIn the bamboo lodge are poems Whose wellchosen words match the White Snow Melody The books in the pine pavilion Are pearls and jade in bluecovered volumesRocks and jade twist around the artificial hills Deep are the bluegreen waters of the winding streamPeony pavilions Rose bowers Make a natural brocadeTrellises of jasmine Beds of begonia Are like sunset clouds or jeweled mosaicsHerbaceous peonies are marvelously fragrant Rare is the beauty of the mallows from SichuanWhite pear and red apricot blossom vie in scent Purple orchid and golden daylily compete in splendorCorn poppy Lily magnolia buds Azalea flowers Are brilliantly colouredMagnolia flowers Garden balsam Plantain lilies Journey to the West TrembleEverywhere red shines through the richness of cosmetics While heavy scents drift from a brocade surrounding screenThe warmth returning with the East wind is greeted with joy All the gardens beauties display their brillianceThe king and his companions walked around enjoying the flowers for a long timeSoon the officials of the Protocol Office came to invite Monkey and the other two to the Pavilion of Lingering Spring while the king led the Tang Priest by the hand to the SinoBarbarian Hall so that they could all drink and feastThese were splendid occasions with singing dancing and instrumental music Indeed The sun shone from the majestic palace gates Good auras filled the royal buildingsThe spring spread out an embroidery of flowers And heavens light shone from afar on the court robesPipes and singers wafted their music as if in a banquet of immortals The goblets flew carrying jade liquorMaster and subjects enjoyed the same pleasure As Sinobarbarian peace brought prosperitySeeing with what great respect he was being treated by the king the venerable elder had nothing for it but to force himself to join in the celebrations In fact he gave only a show of happiness inside he was miserableAs he sat there he saw four golden screens hanging on the wall screens painted with scenes of the four seasons Each picture had a poem on it by a famous academician The poem on the spring scene read The vital forces of heaven turn creation around The world is happy and everything is renewedThe peach and the plum blossoms vie in splendor Swallows fly to the painted rafters shaking the incense dustJourney to the West The poem on the summer scene read In warm and sultry air all thoughts are slow The palace mallow and pomegranate reflect the suns brillianceThe jade flutes music disturbs the noonday dream The scent of caltrops is wafted through the curtainsThe poem on the autumn scene read One leaf on the parasol tree by the well is yellow The pearl curtain is not rolled up on the night of frostAfter the autumn sacrifice the swallows abandon their nest When the rush flowers snap the wild geese leave for another landThe poem on the winter scene read The clouds fly over the rainy sky all dark and cold The North wind blows the snow into thousands of billsDeep in the palace the stove glows warm They say the plum has blossomed by the jade balustradeWhen the king noticed the absorption with which the Tang Priest was gazing at the poems he said As you enjoy savoring the poems so much you must be a fine poet yourself soninlawIf you do not begrudge your pearls we would like to invite you to make up a matching poem for each of them ending three of the lines with the same wordWill you agree The venerable elder was the sort of person who could be so carried away by a scene that he forgot the circumstances someone who had an enlightened mind and thoroughly comprehended his own nature so when Journey to the West the king pressed him so earnestly to match the verses he found himself saying the line The suns warmth melts the ice the world around This greatly pleased the king who told the officials in attendance on him Fetch the four treasures of the study so that our soninlaw can write down the matching verses he composes for us to savor at our leisure The venerable elder was glad to comply Picking up a brush he produced matching linesThe matching poem on the spring scene read The suns warmth melts the ice the world around Within the palace garden flowers are renewedGentle winds and rain enrich the people Rivers and seas are calm gone is all worldly dustThe matching poem on the summer scene read The Dipper now points South the day goes slow Locust and pomegranate trees contend in brillianceGolden oriole and purple swallow sing in the willows Their melodious voices drifting through red curtainsThe matching poem on the autumn read Fragrant the green mandarin the orange turns to yellow Blue pine and cypress welcome frosts comingHalfopen chrysanthemums make a tapestry on the trellis Pipes and songs waft through the watery cloudcovered landThe matching poem on the winter scene read Journey to the West As skies clear after welcome snow the air is cold Grotesqueshaped crags and boulders mark jade hillsAs charcoal burns in the stove to warm the yogurt Singing with hands in their sleeves they lean on jade balustradesThe king was utterly delighted by the matching versesSinging with hands in their sleeves they lean on jade balustrades is really good he said with admiration and ordered the royal orchestra to set the new poems to music The banquet did not break up until the day was over Brother Monkey and the other two were also having a splendid meal in the Pavilion of Lingering SpringEach of them was feeling rather merry after downing a few cups and they decided to go to see their master who was in another building with the king This made Pig start acting like the idiot he wasThis is great he yelled at once Were doing very nicely here Today weve had a right good timeBut now were full we ought to go to sleep it off You really are illbred brother said Friar Sand with a grinHow could you possibly go to sleep when youre as full as that You wouldnt know said PigTheres a saying that goes Unless you stretch out for a nap when youve dined How can your belly with fat be well lined When the Tang Priest had taken his leave of the king he went back to the pavilion and scolded pig Cretin You acted coarser than everWhat sort of place do you think this is to shout and yell like thatIf you had made the king angry he would have had you killed Dont worry Pig replied dont worryWere being treated as his inlaws so it would be very awkward for him to get angry with usAs the proverb goes If youre related a beating cant rend it If you are neighbors a cursing wont end it We were only jokingHes nothing to be frightened of Journey to the West At this the venerable elder shouted Bring the idiot hereGive him twenty strokes of the dhyana staff Monkey then grabbed Pig and knocked him over while Sanzang raised the cudgel to beat himMaster Royal Soninlaw the idiot shouted Spare meSpare me One of the officials who was present at the banquet persuaded Sanzang not to hit Pig who clambered back on his feet grumbling Youre a fine excellency youre a fine royal soninlaw Applying the royal law before youre even married Stop that nonsense said Monkey making a face at him stop that nonsenseGo to bed at once They then spent another night in the Lingering Spring PavilionThe next morning they feasted as beforeBefore long they had been enjoying themselves for three or four days by when it was that splendid day the twelfthThe officials of the three sections of the Department of Foreign Relations all submitted a memorial that said Since we received the edicts on the eighth the palace for the Royal Soninlaw has been built and all that we are waiting for is for the trousseau to be installedThe nuptial banquet has been prepared with meat and vegetarian food for over five hundred guests This greatly pleased the king who was just going to invite his future soninlaw to come to the banquet when a eunuch from the inner quarters of the palace reported to him Your Majesty Her Majesty the Queen asks you to come The king then withdrew to the inner quarters of the palace where the queens of the three palaces and the consorts of the six compounds brought the princess to the Sunlight Palace to talk and joke togetherThe place was truly a mass of flowers or brocade The magnificence and beauty was more than a match for the halls of heaven or the moons pavilions nor was it inferior to the jade palaces of immortalsThere are four new lyrics on the Happy Gathering and Splendid Wedding about itThe lyric Happy goes Delight and blissThe wedding is celebrated With its love and beautyElegant court dresses That the Lady of the Moon could never rival Dragon and phoenix hairpins Sumptuous threads of flying goldCherry lips white teeth and rougered cheeks Sylphs with forms as delicate as flowers Brocades upon brocades Journey to the West An extravagance of color Full of fragrance A host of princessesThe lyric Gathering goes Gathering GatheringBewitching charms Rivaling the great beauties of the past Enough to topple a city or a state Like flowers or jadeDressed to make them lovelier still Even more dazzling in their finery And the splendor of their jewelsTheir orchid hearts and natures were pure and lofty Noble were their powderwhite faces and icesmooth skinThe lines of their painted eyebrows were like distant hills They formed a throng of willowy elegance The lyric Splendid goes Splendid SplendidJade girls fairy maidens Utterly adorable Truly to be admired Perfumed with fine fragrances Journey to the West Adorned with cosmeticsAlthough far from the Tiantai paradise This was no mere palace of a kingSweet were their smiling words As the sound of pipes and songs was wafted aroundA thousand beauties massed flowers a splendid brocade How could its match be found in the worldThe lyric Wedding goes Wedding WeddingOrchid Fragrance Ranks of fairy girls Crowds of beautiesThe royal concubines have put on new splendor The princesses are in fresh garmentsPiled clouds of raven hair Rainbow gowns over phoenix skirtsSoft music of immortals Two rows of purple and redIn the past they pledged to ride in one phoenix chariot This morning is the happy occasion and the splendid weddingWhen the king arrived his queens and consorts led the princess and the other palace ladies out to meet himThe delighted king took them into the Sunlight Palace to sit downWhen the queens consorts and others had made their obeisances the king said Princess my good daughter we think that your hearts desire was fulfilled when you had the good fortune to find the holy monk by throwing your ball from the decorated tower on the eighthThe officials of all the departments have been most understanding of our wishes so that Journey to the West everything is now readyAs today is a lucky one let us hurry to the nuptial banquet and not be late The princess stepped forward went down in a kowtow and submitted this petitionYour Majesty my father I beg you to forgive your daughter for her effrontery but I have a request to make In the last few days it has been reported in the inner quarters of the palace that the Tang Priest has three extremely hideous disciplesI couldnt bring myself to see them Im afraid the sight would terrify meSo I beg you Father to send them out of the city Otherwise the shock might be too much for my trail health and lead to disaster If you had not mentioned them child the king replied we would have very nearly forgotten about themThey are indeed rather ugly and for the last few days we have had them entertained in the Lingering Spring PavilionWhen we go into the throne hall this morning we will return their passport and tell them to leave the city so that we can hold our banquet The princess then kowtowed again in thanks after which the king left in his carriage to enter the throne hall and issue a decree inviting his soninlaw and the other three gentlemen to attendNow the Tang Priest had been following the dates by counting on his fingers so when he reached the twelfth he had a discussion with his three disciples before dawn It is the twelfth today he saidHow are we to cope Ive already noticed something of an illomened air about the king Brother Monkey replied but the evil hasnt actually infected him or done any great harmThe only thing is that Ive not yet had a look at the princess If she comes out and lets me take a peep at her Ill know whether shes an impostor or not then Ill do somethingDont worryHes bound to summon us now and send us three away from the cityAccept the invitation and dont be afraidIll slip back and stay close to you to protect you As master and disciples were talking a royal equerry did indeed come with officials from the protocol office to bring an invitationLets go said Monkey lets goIm sure theyre going to see us three on our way and keep you here Master for the wedding If theyre seeing us off theyre bound to give us hundreds and thousands of ounces of gold and silver said Pig Well be able to buy some presents to take home with usWhen I get back to my inlaws place Ill be able to have a bit of fun again Shut up second brother said Friar Sand and stop talking such nonsenseWell do what big brother says They then followed the officials to the foot of the throne hall steps taking baggage and horse with themWhen the king had greeted them he commanded Monkey and the other two to come forward Hand your passport up he said and we shall seal it sign it and return it to you You three gentlemen will be generously provided with funds for your journey and escorted on your way to see the Buddha on Vulture PeakIf you come back with the scriptures you will also receive generous rewardsWe shall keep our soninlaw herethere will be no need for you to worry about him Monkey thanked the king then told Friar Sand to take the passport out and hand it overThe king read it sealed and signed it then brought out ten ingots of gold and twenty of silver that he wanted to present to them as gifts for his inlawsPig who always had been very keen on money and sex stepped forward to accept themMonkey then gave a respectful chant and said Weve disturbed you As Monkey turned to go Sanzang hastily scrambled to his feet grabbed hold of him and said through clenched teeth You are all abandoning me Journey to the West Brother Monkey pinched the palm of Sanzangs hand gave him a meaningful look and said Unwind and take your pleasure here while we go to fetch the scripturesWell call on you on our way back Not knowing whether to believe this or not the venerable elder refused to let him goWhen all the officials saw this they took it for a real partingSoon the king invited his soninlaw back into the throne hall ordering the officials to escort the three gentlemen out of the city whereupon Sanzang had to let go of Monkey and enter the hallAs Brother Monkey and the other two went out through the palace gates they each took their leaveAre we really going asked PigMonkey said nothing and just walked back to the hostel where the superintendent received them and provided tea and a mealYou two stay here Monkey said to Pig and Friar Sand and whatever you do dont show your facesIf the hostel superintendent asks whats happening give him vague answers Dont say anythingIm going off to look after the master The splendid Great Sage pulled out one of his hairs blew on it with magic breath called Change and turned it into his own double to stay in the hostel with Pig and Friar Sand while he himself leapt up into mid air in a flash turning himself into a beeYellow wings sweet mouth and a sharp tail He dances wildly in the wind The brilliant thief of fragrance from the blossom Who sways his way through willows and flowersWith many a drenching for his troubles He flies to and fro but all in vainThe thick delight be makes he never tastes All he can do is leave his fame behindWatch him as he flies lightly into the palace where he saw the Tang Priest sitting on an embroidered stool at the kings left frowning and worried at heartFlying up to his masters Vairocana mitre Monkey crept stealthily to his ear and said Im here Master so dont fret These words were heard by the Tang Priest alonenone of the ordinary mortals had any hope of hearing themso he felt relief at lastBefore long a eunuch came with an invitation Your Majesty the nuptial banquet is set out in the Jay Palace Her Majesty and the princess are awaiting you in the inner quartersThey invite Your Majesty and His Excellency to go in for the wedding Overwhelmed with happiness the king went into the inner quarters with his soninlawIndeed Journey to the West The wicked kings love of flowers led to disaster When the dhyana mind starts thinking each thought brings sorrowIf you dont know how the Tang Priest escaped once in the inner quarters of the palace listen to the explanation in the next installmentFalse and True Form Combine When the Jade Hare is Captured The True Female Is Converted and Meets With Spiritual Origin The story tells how the Tang Priest was feeling thoroughly miserable as he accompanied the king into the inner quarters from where a great sound of drums and music arose and fine perfumes could be smeltHe kept his head bowed not daring to look upMonkey secretly very pleased had fixed himself to the Vairocana mitre from where he used his magic light to look around with his fiery eyes and golden pupilsThere were two ranks of court ladies making it seem like a palace of flowers or immortals and finer than a spring breeze blowing past a brocade screenIndeed they were Graceful and charming Jadelike and with icesmooth skinBewitching pairs more lovely than the girl of Chu Beauties two by two rivaling the lady Xi ShiTheir hair was coiled high like flying phoenixes Their eyebrows were just visible low lines of distant hillsElegantly played the pipe and shawm Fast sounded flute and drumAll the notes of the scale rang out Rising then falling again togetherDelightful were they as they danced and sang A carpet of flowers every one of them lovelyJourney to the West Seeing that his master was not in the least moved by this Monkey silently smacked his lips in admiration and said What a fine monk What a fine monkDwelling amid splendor his heart forms no attachment Walking through magnificence his mind is not confused A little later the princess came out of the Jay Palace surrounded by the queens and consorts so greet the king with cheers of Long live the kingLong live the king This so alarmed the venerable elder that he trembled not knowing what to doBy now Monkey had already noticed a touch of the demonicthough nothing very viciousthat could just be made out in the aura above the princesss headMonkey crawled quickly to Sanzangs ear and said The princess is a fake Master If she is a fake the venerable elder replied then how are we to make her turn back into her real form Ill give myself a magic body and catch her right here said MonkeyThat would terrify His Majesty said SanzangWait till he and his queens have withdrawn before using your magic Now Monkey had been impatient by nature all his life so he could not restrain himselfWith a great and angry roar he resumed his true from rushed up and grabbed the princess Youre a fine evil beast he said abusivelyYouve had no end of luxury here you impostor but it wasnt enough for youYoure so sexcrazed you had to try to trick my master and destroy his primal masculinity This struck the king speechless with fright and made the queens and consorts fall about The palace beauties all ran off to hide fleeing for their livesIt was just like A roaring wind in spring The howling autumn galeWhen the roaring wind in spring blows through the wood A thousand blossoms are shaken When the howling autumn gale hits the park Ten thousand leaves all swirl and flyThe tree peony beneath the balustrade is snapped Herbaceous peonies beside the balcony fall over Journey to the West Hibiscus on the ponds banks are shaken all aboutWhile chrysanthemums are flung in heaps at the foot of the terraceThe delicate begonia collapses in the dust The fragrant rose is now sleeping in the wildsThe spring wind smashes caltrop lotus and pear Winter snows weigh down the plum trees tender blossomsThe petals of the pomegranate Are scattered all around the inner courtyard The branches of the willow Are blown sideways within the royal palaceFine blooms and a night of raging wind and rain Countless red petals carpet the ground with brocadeSanzang hastily put his trembling arms round the king and said Dont be afraid Your MajestyIt is only my wicked disciple using his magical powers to find out whether she is an impostor or not Seeing that things were going badly for her the evil spirit broke free tore off her clothes flung down her jewelry and hair ornaments and ran to the shrine of the local deity in the palace gardenFrom here she brought out a short club shaped like the head of a triphammer with which she started hitting wildly at Monkey as she turned quickly towards himMonkey who had caught up with her at once struck back at her face with his iron cudgel Shouting and roaring at each other the two of them started fighting in the palace gardensThen each began a great display of magic powers riding clouds as they battled in mid airIn this fight Great was the fame of the goldbanded cudgel No one had heard of the hammerhead clubOne of them was there to fetch the true scriptures The other was lingering for love of rare flowersLong had the demon known of the holy Tang Priest And she longed to mate with his primal seedjuicesJourney to the West In a past year she had carried off the real princess And taken the form of the kings true daughterWhen she met the Great Sage who saw her evil aura He could tell true from false as he came to save a lifeThe murderous club was flung at the head The mighty iron cudgel struck back at the faceRanting and roaring they were locked in struggle Filling the skies and blotting out the sunAs the two of them battled in mid air they terrified the common people of the city and struck fear into all the officials at courtThe venerable elder kept saying as he supported the king Dont be alarmed and please tell Her Majesty and all the others not to be afraidYour princess is an impostor pretending to be herWhen my disciple has captured her you will be able to see whether she is good or evil Some of the bolder consorts brought clothes and jewelry to show the queen These are what the princess wore She tore them off and is fighting that monk up in the sky stark nakedShe must be an evil spirit Only then did the king queens and consorts come to their senses and look up into the skyWhen the evil spirit and the Great Sage had been fighting for half a day without either emerging as victor Monkey threw his cudgel up and called Change One turned into ten ten into a hundred and a hundred into a thousandHalf the sky was filled with writhing serpents and pythons striking wildly at the evil spirit With a flurry of her hands and feet she turned into a pure wind and fled into the azure skyMonkey said a spell took all the iron cudgels back into a single cudgel and went straight after her magic lightAs he approached the Western Gate of Heaven and saw the dazzling flags and banners Monkey shouted at the top of his voice Heavenly gatekeepers stop that evil spirit and dont let her get away The gate was being held by the Heavenly King Lokapala with the four great marshals Pang Liu Gou and Bi who did indeed use their weapons to block the wayAs she could not get further she turned straight back and started fighting Monkey with her short clubAs he wheeled his iron cudgel the Great Sage looked carefully at her and saw that one end of her club was thick and one end thin just like the lead of a triphammer used for hulling with a mortar so he gave a furious roar and shouted Beast Whats that implement youre holdingHow dare you fight me with itSurrender at once or Ill smash your skull with a single blow from my cudgel Grinding her teeth the evil spirit replied You dont know about this weapon of mine so listen while I tell you Its immortal root was a piece of muttonfat jade Journey to the West Which took countless years to be worked into shapeIt was already mine when chaos was separated When the primal disorder was sorted out I came firstIts origins cannot be compared with mere mortal things Its nature has always belonged to the highest heavenEmbodying the golden light and the four images With the auspicious vapors of the Five Elements and the Three PrimariesLong did it live with me in the Moon Palace Staying beside me in the Cassia HallFor love of flowers I descended to the mortal world Coming to India as a beautiful impostorThe only reason why I shared the Kings pleasures Was because I wanted my destined marriage with the Tang PriestHow could you be so cruel as to ruin this fine mating Pursuing me and giving rein to your vicious natureGreat is the fame of this implement of mine Which is older than your cudgel with gold bandsIt was a drugpounding pestle in the Moon Palace One blow from this and a life is ended When Monkey heard this he replied with a mocking laugh Evil beastIf you used to live in the Toad Palace you must have heard of my powers How dare you argue with meTurn back into your real self and surrender at once if Im to spare your life I know you the monster repliedYoure the Protector of the Horses who made great havoc in the palaces of Heaven five hundred years agoBy rights I ought to give way to you but because youve wrecked my marriage I hate you as much as if youd killed my mother and father Its more than I can stand forIm going to kill you you Protector of the Horses for breaking the laws of Heaven The words Protector of the Horses always infuriated the Great Sage so the moment he heard them he flew into a great rage lifted his iron cudgel and struck at her faceThe evil spirit swung her pestle in replyA ferocious battle then ensued in front of the Western Gate of HeavenIn this combat there were Journey to the West A goldbanded cudgel A drugpounding pestle Two immortals weapons a worthy matchOne had come down to earth for the sake of a marriage The other was there to protect the Tang PriestIt was because the king was not a righteous one And loved flowers that he attracted the evil spirit Causing todays bitter strife As two of them gave Ml play to their stubbornness of heartCharging and rushing each other they strove for triumph In cutting words they fought on with their tonguesRare was the martial prowess of the medicine pestle But finer still was the iron cudgels mightA powerful golden light flashed at the heavenly gates Brilliantly coloured mists went right down to the earthAfter a dozen rounds of fighting to and fro The evil spirit became too weak to resistWhen the evil spirit had fought another dozen or so rounds with Brother Monkey she could see how thick and fast his blows were coming and realized that she could not win Feinting with her pestle she shook herself and fled due South in ten thousand beams of golden light with the Great Sage in pursuitSuddenly they reached a great mountain where the evil spirit landed her golden light and disappeared into a caveMonkey who was worried that she might escape return to India and do some underhand harm to the Tang Priest made sure he could recognize the mountain then turned his cloud round and went straight back to the capitalIt was now about four in the afternoonThe king was clinging to Sanzang shivering and shaking as he kept saying Save me holy monk The consorts and queens were all in a panic as the Great Sage came down from the clouds with a cry of Here I am Master Journey to the West Stand still Wukong said Sanzang You must not alarm His MajestyNow I am asking you what in fact happened about the imitation princess Standing outside the Jay Palace Monkey put his hands together in front of his chest and said The imitation princess was an evil spiritFirst of all I fought her for half a day and she couldnt beat me so she turned into a pure wind and fled straight to the gates of heaven I shouted to the gods to block her wayShe turned back into her real self and fought another dozen or so rounds with me Then she turned herself into golden light and fled due South to a mountain beaten I chased her as fast as I could till I got to the mountain but I couldnt find her anywhereThen I came back because I was worried she might come here to harm you When the king heard this he grabbed hold of the Tang Priest and asked If the false princess was an evil spirit where is my real princess When Ive caught the false princess your real princess will turn up by herself Monkey replied straight awayWhen the queens and consorts heard this their fears vanished and each of them came forward to bow and say We beg you to rescue our real princess holy monk and sort out the light from the dark You will be richly rewarded This is no place for us to talk said MonkeyI beg Your Majesty to go from the inner quarters to the throne hall with my master Her Majesty and the rest of them should all go back to the inner palace and my fellowdisciples Pig and Friar Sand should be sent for to protect my master so that I can go and subdue the demonThat will keep a proper distinction between the inner and outer quarters of the palace and spare me from worryingI am going to sort this out to show my sincerity The king accepted the suggestion and was boundlessly gratefulHe led the Tang Priest out of the inner quarters and straight to the throne hallAll the queens and consorts returned to the inner palaceA vegetarian meal was ordered while Pig and Friar Sand were sent forThe two of them soon arrivedMonkey explained to them both about what had happened and told them to guard the master carefullyThe Great Sage set off by his cloud somersault and flew up into mid airAll the officials in front of the throne hall looked up into the sky and bowed lowThe Great Sage Monkey went straight to the mountain that lay due SouthWhen the evil spirit had fled in defeat to the mountain and gone into her den she blocked the entrance with boulders and lay hidden there terrifiedHaving looked around for a while and seen no sign of life Monkey felt very impatient so he made a spell with his hands and said the magic words calling out the local deity and mountain god to be questionedA moment later the two gods arrived kowtowed and said We didnt realize we didnt realize If we had known wed have gone a long way to meet you We beg you to forgive us I wont hit you just now Monkey saidTell me what this mountains calledHow many evil spirits are there hereTell me the truth and Ill forgive you your crimes Great Sage the two gods replied this mountain is called Mount HairtripThere are three have warrens in the mountain but from remote antiquity there have never been any evil spirits here This is a blessed land of five felicitiesGreat Sage if you want to find an evil spirit take the road to the Western Heaven Ive reached the kingdom of India in the Western Heaven where the king has a princess who was carried off by an evil spirit and abandoned in the wildsThe evil spirit turned herself into the princesss double to deceive the king into building a decorated tower from which she could throw an embroidered ball to find herself a husbandWhen I got to the foot of the tower while escorting the Tang Priest she deliberately hit the Tang Priest because she wanted to mate with him and lure his primal masculinity out of himWhen I saw through her I turned back into myself in the palace to catch herShe threw off her human clothes and jewels and fought with me for half a day with a short club that she called a medicinepounding pestle Then she turned Journey to the West herself into a pure wind and disappearedWhen I chased her as far as the Western Gate of Heaven and fought another dozen or more with her she realized she couldnt beat me turned herself into golden right and fled hereWhy didnt you see her When the two gods heard this they led Brother Monkey to search the three warrensWhen they first looked by the warren at the foot of the mountain a few frightened hares were startled and ran awayWhen their search reached the cave at the top of the mountain they saw that the entrance was blocked with two great bouldersThe evil spirit must have gone inside the local god said when you were chasing her so hard Monkey then pried the boulders apart with his iron cudgelThe evil spirit who was indeed hiding in there sprang out with a whoosh raising her medicine pestle to strike him withAs Monkey swung his cudgel to parry her blow the mountain deity fell back in terror and the local god fled From the demons mouth came abusive grumblesWho told you to bring him here to find me She continued to fend off the iron cudgel as she fled up into mid air in a fighting retreatJust at the moment of crisis when it was getting late in the day Monkey became more vicious than ever and his blows were even harder He wished he could finish her off with a single strokeJust then a call came from the ninefold azure sky of Dont strike Great Sage Dont strikeBe kind with your cudgel When Monkey turned round he saw that it was the Star Lord of the Moon leading his beauties and immortals down on multicolored clouds to stand in front of himA flustered Monkey at once put his iron cudgel away bowed and said Where are you going Old ManIm sorry I didnt keep out of your way The evil spirit fighting you is the Jade Hare who pounds the immortal elixir of mysterious dew in my palace the Moon repliedA year ago she secretly opened the golden locks on the jade gates and absconded from the palaceAs I reckoned that she would be in mortal peril I have come here to save her lifeI do beg you Great Sage to spare her life out of consideration for me Monkey assented saying only I wouldnt dare harm her I wouldnt dareNo wonder shes so good with a medicinepounding pestle Shes the Jade HareWhat you dont know Old Moon is that she has kidnapped the king of Indias daughter made herself into the princesss double and wants to ruin my masters primal masculinity although hes a holy monk This is the truthWe cant stand for crimes like that How can you possibly let her off so lightly There are things you dont know the Moon repliedThat kings daughter is no ordinary mortalShe was the White Beauty from the Moon Palace Eighteen years ago she slapped the Jade Hare after which she longed for the human world and came down to it in a beam of magic light to the womb of the kings senior queen She was born thenThe Jade Hare was getting her own back for that slap when she ran away from the palace last year and threw White Beauty into the wilds But she was wrong to want to marry the Tang PriestThats an offence she mustnt get away withIt was a good thing you were careful enough to see through her before she ruined your masterBut I plead with you to forgive her for my sake and let me take her back If thats why it happened Brother Monkey replied with a smile I wouldnt dare to make any objectionsBut if you take the Jade Hare back Im worried that the king might not believe it so Id like to trouble you and the immortal sisters to take the Jade Hare over there to prove it to the king Then Ill be able to show off my powers and explain how White Beauty came down to earth Ill make the king fetch Princess White Beauty to prove the truth of retributionJourney to the West The Moon was persuaded so he pointed at the evil spirit and shouted Repent and submit evil beast The Jade Hare rolled on the ground and turned back into her real formIndeed she was Gaplipped and sharptoothed Longeared and with few whiskersHer body was covered with jadecoloured fur When she stretched out her legs she flew over mountainsHer straight nose was like yogurt Glossier than facecream with powderTwo eyes glowed red Brighter than dots of rouge on the snowCrouching on the ground She was a heap of pure white silk When she stretched herself out She was a structure of dazzling silver wireOften did she Drink in the purest dew of the heavenly dawn Pounding the elixir with her pestle of jadeWhen the Great Sage saw this he was delighted and treading clouds and light he led the way as the Moon Lord brought all the beauties and immortals taking the Jade Hare with them as they headed straight for IndiaIt was now dusk and the moon was slowly risingWhen they reached the walls of the capital they heard the drums being beaten on the watchtowersThe king and the Tang Priest were still inside the throne hall while Pig Friar Sand and the officials were standing in front of the steps They were just discussing whether the king should withdraw when a sheet of coloured cloud as bright as day was seen due SouthWhen they all raised their heads to look they heard the Great Sage Monkey shouting at the top of his voice Your Majesty King of India ask your queens and consorts to come out and look Under this canopy is the Star Lord of the Moon Palace and the immortal sisters to either side of him are the beauties of the moonThis Jade Hare was the bogus princess of yours who has now turned back into her real form The king then quickly called his queen consorts palace beauties and maids out and they all kowtowed towards the sky The king the Tang Priest and the officials also bowed to the sky in thanksThere was nobody in any house throughout the whole city who did not set out an altar on which to burn incense kowtow and recite the name Journey to the West of the BuddhaJust when everyone was looking up Pig felt a surge of uncontrollable desire leapt up into the air and flung his arms round an immortal girl dressed in a rainbow Were old Mends darling he said Lets go and have a bit of fun Monkey went up to Pig grabbed hold of him gave him a couple of slaps and swore at him You village idiotWhat sort of place is this for getting randy I was just going to chat her up for a bit of fun said PigThe Moon Lord had his celestial canopy turned about as he took the Jade Hare straight back to the Moon Palace with all his beauties Brother Monkey threw Pig down into the dust then was thanked by the king in the throne hallWhen the king was told what had happened he said We are very grateful to you holy monk for using your great magical powers to capture the imitation princessBut where is our real daughter She is no ordinary human either Monkey replied but the immortal girl White Beauty from the Moon PalaceBecause she slapped the Jade Hare in the face eighteen years ago she yearned for the lower world came down to the womb of Your Majestys senior queen and was born hereIt was because the Jade Hare nursed her old grudge that she surreptitiously opened the golden lock on the jade gates came down here abandoned White Beauty in the wilds and made herself look like White Beauty to deceive youThe Moon Lord himself told me about this chain of eventsToday weve got rid of the imposter and tomorrow Ill invite Your Majesty to go in your royal carriage to fetch the real one This came as rather a shock to the king who said with the tears streaming down his cheeks DaughterIn all the time since we came to the throne as a child we have never even gone outside the city gatesWhere are we to go to look for you No need to upset yourself said Monkey with a smile Your daughter is now in the Almsgivers Spread Gold Monastery pretending to be mad Everyone can go home now Tomorrow morning Ill bring your real princess back to you Please stop worrying Your Majesty the officials all said kowtowingThese holy monks are all Buddhas who can ride clouds and mists they are sure to know all about causes and effects in the future and the past If we trouble the holy monks to come with us tomorrow to look for her we will learn the truth Accepting their suggestion the king invited the monks to the Lingering Spring Pavilion where a vegetarian meal was provided and they were to spend the nightBy now it was almost the second watchIndeed The copper waterclock drips in the moons bright glow The chimes of the golden bell are carried by the windWhen the cuckoo sings the spring is halfway gone The blossoms fall aimlessly as the third watch draws nearThe swing casts a shadow in deserted royal gardens Journey to the West The silver river spans the skys blue vaultNo travelers are to be seen in markets and streets The constellations make the night sky shineThat night they all went to bed and of that no more need be saidDuring the night the king lost his demonic aura and his spirit grew with great speed so that at three marks after the fifth watch he came out of the inner quarters to give audience once moreWhen the audience was over he ordered that the Tang Priest and his three disciples be fetched to discuss the search for the princessSanzang then came and did obeisance to the king while the Great Sage and the other two also paid their respectsThe king bowed to them and said Yesterday you spoke of our daughter the princessMay we trouble you divine monks to find and rescue her The day before yesterday we had been walking from the East till evening the venerable elder replied when we saw the Almsgivers Spread Gold Monastery We went inside to ask for accommodation and had the good fortune to be entertained by the monks thereAfter supper I took a moonlight stroll in the former Spread Gold Garden and as I was looking at the remains I heard wailingWhen I asked what it was all about an ancient monk over a hundred years old sent everyone else away before telling me Now about that wailing in the late spring of last year I was enjoying the moon when suddenly heard a gust of wind and the sound of someone grieving I got out of bed went into the Jetavana and saw a girl there When I questioned her the girl said I am a princess the daughter of the king of IndiaThe wind blew me here when I was looking at the flowers by moonlight The ancient monk knows a lot about correct behavior so he locked the princess up in a quiet outoftheway cellAs he was worried that the monks of the monastery might sully her he put it about that he had locked up an evil spiritThe princess who understood what he was doing ranted and raved during the day and demanded food and teaOnly late at night when there was nobody about did she think of her mother and father and cry for themThe ancient monk did come to the capital to make enquiries several times but when he found that the princess was well and in the palace he didnt dare say anything or submit a memorialWhen the ancient monk saw that my disciple had some magic powers he repeatedly insisted that we were to come here to investigateI never expected that she would turn out to be the Jade Hare from the Moon Palace who had put on an imitation of the real body and made herself look like the princess She was also set on ruining my primal masculinityFortunately my disciple showed his mighty magic and detected the fraudThe Jade Hare has now been recaptured by the Moon LordYour worthy princess is now pretending to be crazy in the Spread Gold Monastery After hearing the story in all this detail the king started to weep aloudThis soon alarmed the queens and consorts of the three palaces and six compounds who all came out to ask whyEverybody began to weep bitterly and it was a long time before the king asked How far is the Spread Gold Monastery from the city Only twenty miles Sanzang repliedThe king then issued these commands Let the Queens of the Eastern and Western Palaces look after the court while the High Minister takes charge of the nations businessWe are going to the monastery with our Senior Queen our officials and the four holy monks to fetch the princess Journey to the West Carriages were at once prepared and a line of them left the palaceWatch as Brother Monkey sprang up into the air and with a bend of his back was the first to reach the monasteryThe monks all hastily knelt to greet him When you left sir they said you walked with the others so why did you come down from the sky today To this Monkey replied with a smile Where is your ancient teacherAsk him to come out straight away and set out incense tables to welcome His Majesty The king and queen of India the officials and my master are all coming The monks could not understand what he meant so they asked the ancient monk to come outWhen the ancient monk saw Monkey he prostrated himself before him with the words What has happened about the princess sir Monkey told him all about how the imitation princess had thrown the embroidered ball wanted to mate with the Tang Priest been chased fought and been recaptured by the Moon Lord as the Jade HareThe ancient monk kowtowed to him again in thanksPlease stop kowtowing said Monkey helping him up please stopHurry up and get ready to receive His Majesty Only then did the monks realize that it was a girl locked up in the garden at the back Surprised and delighted they all set out a row of incense tables outside the monastery gates put on their cassocks and started striking the bell and the drumSoon after this the kings carriage arrived IndeedThe sky is filled with clouds of holy incense Sudden blessing comes to the monasteryThe rainbow flows for a thousand years rivers and seas are pure The eternal spring round which lightning flickers is finer than those of Yu and TangThanks to the royal grace the plants colours are finer than ever The wild flowers have extra fragrance because of this generosityMen of distinction have always left their mark behind them Today all rejoice at an enlightened kings arrivalWhen the king arrived outside the monastery gates the monks were all lined up on their knees in orderly ranks bowing low in greetingMonkey stood in the middleHow did you arrive first holy monk the king askedIt just took a little bend of my waist for me to get here Monkey repliedWhy were you such a long time coming After this the Tang Priest and the others all arrivedHe led the royal carriage to the building at the back where the princess was still raving and pretending to be crazyThe ancient monk knelt down pointed towards her and said This is Her Royal Highness the princess who was blown here by a wind the other year The king ordered the cell openedWhen the iron locks were Journey to the West undone and the door opened the king and queen saw and recognized the princess Not caring about the filth they went up to her and threw their arms round herOur poor child they said how did you come to suffer these torments and have so terrible a time here How true it is that the meeting of parents and child is not like that of other people The three of them sobbed aloud their arms round each others headsWhen they had cried for a while and told each other what had happened since they were parted scented hot water was sent for The princess bathed and changed her clothes before they all climbed into carriages to go back to the capitalMonkey then put his hands together in greeting to the king and said I have something else to put to you Your Majesty Say it whatever it is holy monk the king said returning his greeting and we will do as you ask This mountain of theirs Monkey replied is called Mount HundredfootThey tell me that centipedes have been turning into spirits here recently and injuring people by night This is very awkward for travelling merchantsAs I see it only chickens can deal with centipedes so a thousand extralarge cockerels should be chosen and then scattered across the mountainside to get rid of these venomous insectsThe mountain could be renamed and you could make a land grant to these monks to thank them for looking after the princess This suggestion pleased the king greatly and he accepted itOfficials were then sent back to the city to fetch cocks while the mountain was renamed Mount SplendorThe Department of Works was instructed to provide the materials for the monastery to be rebuilt a deed of enfeoffment was written describing the mountain as Mount Splendor granted to the Almsgivers Spread Gold Monastery and the ancient monk was given the title National Benefactor Hierarch a title that was to be handed on to his successors in perpetuity together with a stipend of thirtysix bushels of grainThe monks all thanked the king for his kindness and saw him off on his way back to the capitalHere the princess returned to the inner palace and was greeted by all the ladies in turnA banquet was then laid on to cheer the princess up and congratulate her on her deliveranceThe queen and her daughter were reunited king and ministers were together We will not describe the nights feastingEarly the next morning the king ordered that painters make portraits of the countenances of the four holy monks to be kept in the SinoBarbarian HallThe princess was also invited to come out from the throne hall in her new finery to thank the Tang Priest and the other three for saving her from her sufferingWhen she had thanked them the Tang Priest took his leave of the king to continue his journey WestThe king refused to let them go but ordered great banquets at which they feasted for five or six days The idiot really was given a good time and he enjoyed putting as much food in his stomach as he possibly couldWhen the king saw how determined they were to visit the Buddha he realized that no matter how hard he tried he would not be able to keep them He had two hundred ingots of gold and silver brought out as well as a tray of jewels for each of them as an expression of thanksMaster and disciples refused to accept anythingThe king then ordered the royal carriage prepared invited the master to enter it and instructed officials to escort them a long wayThe queens consorts officials and common people all kowtowed endlessly in thanksAs they went along the way their monks all came out to kowtow to them in farewell none of them could bear to be parted from the travelersSeeing that the people seeing them off were unwilling to turn back Monkey had no option but to make a spell with his hands and blow a magic breath in the direction of the trigram of the wind Xun so that a dark wind stopped all the escorts from seeing them Only then did the travelers get awayThis was indeed a case of Washing away the waves of gratitude their natures returned to the end Journey to the West Leaving the sea of gold they were aware of true emptinessIf you do not know what happened on the journey ahead listen to the explanation in the next chapterSquire Kou Entertains the Lofty Monk The Tang Priest Does Not Covet Wealth and Honour All kinds of matter are really without matter No emptiness is truly emptyStillness and clamour speech and silence all are the same Why bother to dreamtalk in ones dreamsThe useful includes the useless in its application Achievement lurks within failureWhen the fruit is ripe it reddens of itself Do not ask how the seed is to be grownThe story has told how the Tang Priest and his disciples used their magic powers to stop the monks of the Spread Gold MonasteryWhen the monks saw after the black wind had passed that the master and his disciples had disappeared they thought that their visitors must have been living Buddhas come down to earth so they kowtowed and went back Of them we tell no moreAs master and disciples traveled West spring was giving way to early summer The air was clear mild and refreshing Water chestnuts and lotuses were growing in the poolPlums were ripening after the rain The wheat was forming as the breezes blewFlowers were fragrant where blossoms fell from trees The oriole grew tired amid the willows light branchesJourney to the West Swallows over the river taught their young to fly The pheasants fed their chirping chicksSouth of the Dipper the sun was always seen All of creation shone with brightnessWe could never describe in full how they ate at dawn found shelter at dusk rounded ravines and climbed hills as they went along their way without incident for a fortnightThen another city wall appeared in front of themAs they came closer to it Sanzang asked What sort of place is this disciple I dont know Brother Monkey replied I dont know Youve been this way before put in Pig so how can you claim that you dont knowI suppose youre being crafty and just pretending you cant recognize the place to make fools of us Youre being completely unreasonable you idiot said MonkeyAlthough Ive been this way several times Ive always come and gone by cloud high up in the sky Ive never landed hereI had no interest in the place so why should I have looked it overThats why I didnt knowIm not being crafty and not trying to make a fool of you either While they were talking they came close to the city before they realized itSanzang dismounted crossed the drawbridge and went straight in through the gates As they went along the main street there were two old men to be seen sitting under a portico and talkingDisciples said Sanzang stand here in the middle of the road keep your heads bowed and dont run wildI am going under that portico to ask where we are Monkey and the others stood still as they had been told while the venerable elder went up to the two men put his hands together and called out Greetings benefactors The two old men were idly chatting about such things as prosperity and decay success and failure sages and good men their heroic deeds in ancient times and where such men were now Really they said it was enough to make you sighWhen they suddenly heard Sanzangs greeting they returned it and asked What do you have to say to us reverend sir I am a monk who has come from far away to worship the Lord Buddha Sanzang replied and I have just arrived hereI wonder what this place is called and where there are any pious folk from whom I might beg a meal This is the prefecture of Brazentower one of the old men said and this is the county of Diling near Brazentower cityIf you want vegetarian food reverend sir you wont need to beg Go past this archway to the street running Northsouth Theres a gatetower shaped like a sitting tiger facing the East and thats Squire Kous house In front of it is a sign that says All monks welcomeA monk from far away such as yourself will be given all you wantOff you go and stop interrupting our conversation Sanzang thanked them turned to Monkey and said This is Diling county in the prefecture of BrazentowerThe two old men said that on the street running Northsouth past this archway there is a gatetower shaped Journey to the West like a sitting tiger that is Squire Kous house In front of it is a sign that says All monks welcomeThey told me to go there for a vegetarian meal The West is a land of Buddhists said Friar Sand and they really do feed monksAs this is only a seat of local government we dont need to present our passportLets go and beg ourselves a meal thatll be all the better for travelling with The master and his three disciples walked slowly along the main street filling all the people in the market with alarm and suspicion as they crowded around struggling to see what the strangers looked likeSanzang told his disciples to keep their mouths shut saying Behave yourselvesBehave yourselves The three of them kept their heads bowed not daring to look upThen they turned a corner and did indeed see a main road running NorthsouthAs they were walking along it they saw a gatetower like a sitting tigerOn a screen wall inside the gateway hung a great sign on which were written the words All monks welcome The West is indeed the land of the Buddha said Sanzang Nobody however clever or stupid is dishonestI did not believe what the two old men told meNow I know it is just as they said Being the boor that he was Pig wanted to go straight in Just a moment idiot said MonkeyWait till someone comes out so we can ask what to do before we go in Big brothers right said Friar SandIf we dont show respect for his privacy we might irritate the benefactor They let the horse rest and put down the luggage outside the gatesA little later a slave came out with a steelyard and a basket in his hands that the sudden sight of the strangers made him drop in alarm Master he reported running inside here are four strangelooking monks outside At the time the gentleman was walking with a stick in the inner courtyard reciting the name of the BuddhaWhen he heard the report he dropped his stick and went out to welcome them Their ugliness did not frighten himCome in come in he saidBehaving with all courtesy Sanzang went inside with himThe gentleman led them along a passageway and into a house where he said The upper building includes a Buddha hall a surra library and a refectory for you gentlemenThe lower building is where your disciples family lives Sanzang expressed endless admirationHe brought out and put on his cassock to worship the Buddha then went up into the hall to have a look What he saw was Clouds of incense Dazzling candlesTheball was filled with a brocade of flowers All around was gold and many coloursFrom red frames Hung a bell of purple gold Journey to the West On a lacquered stand Was set a matching decorated drumSeveral pairs of banners Were embroidered with the eight treasures A thousand Buddha statues Were all covered in goldAncient bronze incenseburners Ancient bronze vases Carved lacquer tables Carved lacquer boxesIn the ancient bronze incenseburners Was always eaglewood incense In the ancient bronze vases Were the colours of lotus blossomsOn the carved lacquer tables Were fresh fruits In the carved lacquer boxes Fragrant petals were piledIn glass bowls Was pure clear water In crystal lamps The fragrant oil shone brightA metal chime Resounded long and slowThis was like a treasure house untouched by the world A family Buddha hall rivaling a monasteryJourney to the West The venerable elder washed his hands took a pinch of incense kowtowed and worshipped then turned back to greet the gentleman Wait a moment MrKou replied Let us make our introductions in the sutra library What they saw there was A square stand and upright cupboards Jade boxes and golden casketsOn the square stand and in the upright cupboards Were piled up countless scriptures In the jade boxes and golden caskets Were stored many a manuscriptOn lacquered tables Were paper ink brushes and inkstones All the finest treasures of the studyBefore the scented screen Were calligraphy paintings a lute and chess All for the most refined of interestsA magic chime of light jade covered with gold And a copper tripod in the wind and under the moonThe clear breeze freshens the spirit The purified heart is aware the mind set on the Way is at easeWhen the venerable elder had reached the library and was going to bow to him Mr Kou held on to prevent this and said Wont you take off your cassock Sanzang then took off his cassock after which he greeted Mr He then told Monkey and the other two to greet him tooOrders were given for the horse to be fed and the luggage put in a corridor The gentleman asked about their backgroundI have been sent by the emperor of Great Tang in the East Sanzang said to the Vulture Peak in your splendid country to see the Lord Buddha and ask for the true scripturesI am here to request a meal because I Journey to the West have heard that in your distinguished household you honour monksAfter that we will be on our way The gentlemans face was suffused with pleasure as he replied with a chuckle My name is Kou Hong my other name is Kou Dakuan and I have lived for sixtyfour wasted yearsWhen I was forty I made a vow to feed ten thousand monks and you will complete the numberIn the twentyfour years during which I have been feeding monks I have kept a record of their namesHaving nothing else to do in recent days I have counted the names of all the monks Ive fed and the score is now I was only short of four to make up the full number Then today heaven has you four teachers down to me to complete the ten thousandWill you be so good as to tell me your names I hope that you will stay for a month or more until I have celebrated the completion after which I will send you teachers up the mountain in carryingchairs or on horsesVulture Peak is only some  miles from here not at all far away Sanzang was thoroughly delighted to hear this and he agreed to it all at onceSeveral young and old servants fetched firewood drew water and brought rice flour and vegetables into the house with which to prepare them a mealAll this disturbed the gentlemans wife who said Where have these monks come from and why is everyone so busy Four eminent monks have just arrived the servants told her and when the master asked them where they were from they said theyd been sent by the emperor of the Great Tang in the East to go to worship the Lord Buddha on Vulture Peak Goodness only knows how far it is to here from thereThe master said that they had been sent down from heaven and told us to get them a vegetarian meal quickly The old woman was also very pleased to hear this so she told a maid to fetch her clothes so that she too could go to see themOnly one of them is handsome maam the servant said The other three dont bear looking atTheyre really hideous What you people dont realize the old woman replied is that if they look ugly strange and freakish they must be heavenly beings come down to earthHurry and tell your master straight away The servant ran straight to the surra hall where he said to the gentleman The old ladys here to pay her respects to the lords from the East On hearing this Sanzang rose from his seatBefore the words had all been spoken the old woman was already before the hall where she lifted her eyes to see the Tang Priests majestic countenance and his splendid bearingWhen she turned to see the extraordinary appearance of Monkey and the other two she was somewhat alarmed even though she knew they were heavenly beings come down to earth she fell to her knees and bowedSanzang quickly returned her courtesy saying Bodhisattva the honour you do me is undeserved The old woman then asked her husband why the four reverend gentlemen were not all sitting togetherWe three are disciples said Pig thrusting his snout forward GoodnessHis voice was like the roar of a tiger deep in the mountains The old woman was terrifiedAs they were talking another servant appeared to announce The two young masters are here too When Sanzang turned quickly round to look he saw that they were two young scholars who prostrated themselves to the venerable elder after walking into the sutra hallSanzang was quick to return their courtesyKou then came up to take hold of him and say These are my two sons Their names are Kou Liang and Kou Dong They have just come back from their school and have not yet had their lunch They are here to pay their respects because they have heard that you teachers have come down to earth What fine sons said Sanzang with delight what fine sons Indeed Journey to the West If you want to make a lofty match you must do goodThe success of your sons and grandsons depends on study The two scholars then asked their father Where have these lords come from From a long way away Mr Kou replied with a smileThe emperor of Great Tang in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu has sent them to Vulture Peak to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures We have read in the Compendious Forest of Facts that there are four continents in the world the scholars saidThis continent of ours is the Western Continent of Cattlegift There is also an Eastern Continent of Superior BodyHow many years did it take you to get here I have been a long time on the journey Sanzang replied with a smile met many vicious demons and monsters and suffered greatlyI have been greatly indebted to my three disciples for their protectionAltogether it has taken me fourteen winters and summers to reach your splendid country When the scholars heard this they said with unbounded admiration You really are holy monks you really are Before they had finished speaking a servant came in to invite them to eatThe vegetarian banquet has been set out so will you eat my lords The gentleman then sent his wife and sons back to the house while he went with the four monks into the refectory for the mealEverything was set out very neatly There were goldlacquered tables and blacklacquered chairsIn front were fine cakes of many colours that skilled chefs had made up in uptodate stylesThe second row contained five dishes of horsdoeuvres in the third row there were five dishes of fruit and in the fourth were five large dishes of snacksEverything tasted good looked good and smelt good Vegetable soup rice and steamed breadrolls were all spicy piping hot and most delicious There was plenty to fill ones stomachSeven or eight servants rushed around waiting on them while four of five cooks were kept constantly busyJust watch while some poured soup and others filled the rice bowls coming and going like shooting stars chasing the moonPig was finishing up bowls in single mouthfuls like a gale blowing the clouds awayThus master and disciples ate their fillSanzang then rose to thank Mr Kou for the meal before setting out againThe gentleman blocked his way saying Teacher wont you take things easy and spend a few days hereAs the saying goes its nothing to start a journey but its hard to end oneI will send you on your way when we have celebrated the completion of my vow Seeing how sincere and determined he was Sanzang had no option but to stayFive to seven days quickly passed before Mr Kou engaged twentyfour local Buddhist monks to perform a mass to celebrate the fulfillment of the vowThe monks spent three or four days writing texts out and chose a lucky day on which to begin the Buddhist serviceThe way they did it was like in the Great TangThere was A great display of banners Journey to the West Where the golden countenance was set out Rows of candles And incense burnt in offeringDrums and gongs were beaten Pipes and shawms were playedCloudcymbals Puretoned flutes Sounded in tune To the beat of the drum And the woodwinds notes The words of sutras were recited in unisonFirst the local god was put at ease Then spirit generals were invited to comeThe documents were sent out And they bowed low to the Buddha statues Reciting the Peacock Sutra Each word of which could sweep away disasters A stand of lamps was lit for Bhaisajyaguru To shine with flames of dazzling brightnessThey performed the Water Ceremony To end any sense of grievanceThen they intoned the Avatamsaka Sutra To do away with slanderThe Three Vehicles of the Wonderful Law are very fine Different monks are all the sameJourney to the West The mass lasted for three days and nights before it endedIn his longing to go to the Thunder Monastery the Tang Priest was determined to be on his way so he took his leave of them and thanked themTeacher you are very eager to say goodbye Mr Kou saidI suppose you must have taken offence because for days on end we have been so busy with our service that we have treated you very offhandedly We have put your noble house to a great deal of trouble Sanzang replied and I do not know how we will ever repay you How could we possibly have taken offenceBut when my wise monarch saw me off through the passes all those years ago he asked me when I would be back I wrongly told him that I would return in three years never imagining that the journey would be so badly delayed that it has already lasted fourteen yearsI do not even know whether I will succeed in fetching the scriptures and it will take me another twelve or thirteen years to get back How am I to face the penalty for breaking my monarchs sage commandI beg you sir to let me go to fetch the scriptures and return Next time I come to your mansion I will be able to stay much longer This was more than Pig could bearYou dont care at all about what we want Master he shouted at the top of his voice Youre showing no consideration at allThe old gentlemans very rich and now hes fulfilled his vow to feed monks Besides hes really sincere about wanting to keep us here Itd do no harm if we stayed here for a year or so Why be so set on goingWhy leave all this good food to go begging for meals elsewhereIs it your parents home ahead All you care about is food you cretin shouted Sanzang angrily You dont care at all about the transference of cause and effectReally youre such an animal youd eat from the trough to scratch the itch in your bellyIf you people are going to be so greedy and stupid Ill go by myself tomorrow Seeing that the masters attitude had changed Monkey grabbed hold of Pig and punched his head Youve got no sense you idiot he said abusivelyYouve made the master angry with us too He deserved that said Friar Sand with a grin he deserved thatHes disgusting enough even if he doesnt say a word but he would have to interrupt Breathing heavily the idiot stood to one side not daring to say another wordSeeing the anger of master and disciple Mr Kou said his face wreathed in smiles Do not be so shorttempered teacher Make yourself comfortable for the rest of the dayTomorrow I will have banners and drums brought here and ask some relations and neighbors to come to see you off As they were talking the old woman come out again to say Venerable teacher as you have come to our house you should not refuse too insistentlyHow many days have you spent here now It is already a fortnight Sanzang repliedThat fortnight is my gentlemans achievement the old woman saidI have a little pinmoney with which I would like to entertain you gentlemen for another fortnight Before she had finished speaking Kou Dong and his brother came out again to say Your four lordships in the twenty and more years during which our father has been feeding monks he has never met better ones than yourselvesNow that by your gracious condescension you have made up the total you really have brought glory to our thatched hovelWe two are too young to understand about cause and effect but we have often heard it said Journey to the West The husband gets what he has merited The wife gets what she has merited Nothing is got when nothing is meritedOur father and mother each want to make a humble offering in order that each of them may merit a reward so why must you refuse so insistentlyAnd as we two brothers have saved a little of our school fees we hope to be allowed to support you gentlemen for another fortnight before seeing you on your wayI dare not accept even the lavish hospitality of the venerable Bodhisattva your mother Sanzang replied so how could I accept you brothers generosityI could not possibly do soI really must set out today Please please do not take offenceIf I do not go now I will be unable to avoid execution for exceeding my emperors timelimit by so long When the old woman and her two sons realized that Sanzang was determined not to stay they started losing their patience We invite you very nicely to stay they said but youre obstinately set on goingIf youre going go and cut out this chatter Mother and sons then left to go back to the house Pig could hold his tongue no longerMaster he said to the Tang Priest dont overdo itAs the saying goes If you can stay dont go away Lets stay here for another month to let the mother and her sons fulfil their wishesWhy do you have to be in such a rush The Tang Priest made another angry noise at him and shouted again The idiot then slapped his own face twice saying Tut tut tut Dont talk out of turnYou spoke again Brother Monkey and Friar Sand who were standing to one side started spluttering with laughter The Tang Priest was angry with Monkey againWhat are you laughing at he asked and made the hand magic ready to recite the Bandtightening SpellThis so terrified Monkey that he fell to his knees at once and said I didnt laugh MasterWhatever you do dont say the spellDont say it Seeing that master and disciples were getting into a worse and worse temper with each other Mr Kou gave up his insistence on their stayingDont quarrel teachers he said Ill definitely see you on your way tomorrow morning He then left the sutra hall and told his secretary to write a hundred or so invitations to his neighbors and relations to see the Tang Priest off to the West early the next morningHe told the cooks to lay on a parting banquet while also instructing his steward to have twenty pairs of coloured flags made hire a band of musicians and engage a group of Buddhist monks from the Monastery from the South and another group of Taoist priests from the Eastern Peak Temple Everything was to be ready and in order by ten in the morningAll the gentlemans staff went off to carry out their ordersSoon it was evening again and after supper everyone went to bedIt was the time when Dots of homegoing rooks pass the lonely village Drum and bell can be heard from each others distant towersJourney to the West In streets and markets the bustle is stilled In all the houses the lamps shine dimlyFlowers in the breeze throw shadows under the moon The stars shine bright against the Milky WayWhere the cuckoo sings the night seems deeper All natural sounds are stilled across the earthDuring the third and fourth watches of the night all the household servants in charge of various matters got up early to attend to their tasksJust watch The cooks preparing the banquet were busy in the kitchenThe people who had to buy coloured flags were bustling in front of the hallThose engaging Buddhist and Taoist clergy were hurrying about as fast as their legs could carry themThose hiring musicians were in a great rushThe messengers delivering invitations ran all over the place while the servants preparing the carryingchairs and horses were calling to each otherThey were all shouting from the middle of the night until dawn and by around ten oclock everything was prepared This was all because the family was richThe story tells how the Tang Priest and his disciples got up early to be waited on once more by that crowd of servantsThe venerable elder told them to pack the baggage and saddle the horseWhen the idiot heard that they were about to go he pulled a face pouted and grumbled but he still had to pack the clothes and begging bowls then go to look for the carrying poleFriar Sand brushed the horse saddled and harnessed it and stood waitingBrother Monkey put the nineringed monastic staff in his masters hand and hung the passport in a bag in front of his chest They were now all ready to set outKou then invited them into the large hall at the back where a feast was set out that excelled even the one they had eaten in the refectoryCurtains hung from on high Screens stood all aroundIn the middle was a picture A mountain of long life and a sea of blessings On both walls were displayed Scrolls of spring summer autumn and winterFrom the dragonpatterned tripod came clouds of incense Above magpietailed burners rose auspicious vaporsIn bowls were bunches of color Fresh and brilliant flowers of splendid formJourney to the West The tables were piled with gold Lines of confections shaped like lions and immortalsMusic and dancing before the steps were in true harmony The dishes in the hall were like a brocadeExquisite soup and rice both free of meat The finest tea and the best of winesAlthough they were only commoners Their home was fine enough for a princeAll that could be heard were happy sounds So loud they surprised the sky and shook the earthThe venerable elder was just exchanging courtesies with MrKou when a servant came in to report The guests are all here These were the people who had been invitedneighbors relations by marriage and some of his pious friends who also fed monks and recited the name of the Buddhaand all of them bowed to the venerable elderAfter the greetings had been made everyone sat downOutside the hall zithers and panpipes were played while inside the hall pipas and songs accompanied the banquet Pig paid great attention to this rich banquetBrother he said to Friar Sand relax and eat as much as you canThere wont be anything as good as this to eat after we leave the Kou house Nonsense Friar Sand replied with a laugh As the saying goes No matter how splendid the banquet you eat For only a while can it keep you replete Your savings may meet the expense of the road But savings can never in bellies be stowed Youre hopeless said Pig hopelessIf I eat my fill today I wont feel hungry for the next three days Idiot said Monkey who had heard this Dont fill your belly till it burstsWeve got to start walking now They were still talking and it was almost noon when Sanzang raised his chopsticks and said gracePig grabbed a bowl filled it with desperate speed and ate five or six bowlfuls in succession gulping down a whole bowlful at a time Without any qualms at all he filled both his sleeves with steamed bread twists Journey to the West pancakes and cooked dishes before rising with his masterSanzang thanked the gentleman and everyone else then they all went outside togetherJust look at the coloured banners splendid canopies drummers and instrumentalists outside Only then did two groups of clergy one Buddhist and one Taoist arrive Gentlemen said Mr Kou you are lateOur teacher is in a hurry to leave so I will not be able to offer you a mealIll show you my gratitude when we come back Everyone then opened a way to let them through the carriers carrying their chairs the riders on their horses and the walkers on foot all let Sanzang and his three disciples go firstThe heavens rang with drumming and music the flags and banner blotted out the sun crowds pressed around and carriages and horses were all packed close together as everyone came to watch Mr Kou seeing the Tang Priest offThe splendor all around was more magnificent than pearls or jade and no less fine than brocade screens behind which spring lies hiddenThe Buddhist monks playing Buddhist tunes and the Taoist priests their Taoist airs all escorted the travelers out of the prefectureWhen they reached the threemile pavilion baskets of food and jars of drink were set out cups were raised and they all drank parting toastsKou loath to let them go said as he choked back his tears Teacher you must spend some more days with us on your way back with the scriptures to fulfil my longing Overcome with gratitude Sanzang thanked him at great lengthIf I reach Vulture Peak he said and see the Lord Buddha the first thing I will do will be to praise your great virtueWe will certainly come to kowtow to you in thanks on our return journey As they talked they covered another mile or so without noticing it Then the venerable elder insisted on taking his leave at which MrKou turned back sobbing aloudIndeed He who had vowed to feed the clergy found enlightenment He was not fated to see the Tathagata Buddha We will tell not of how MrKou went home with everyone after seeing the travelers off as far as the threemile pavilion but of how the master and his three disciples went on for some twelve or fifteen miles By now it was growing darkIts late Sanzang saidWhere are we to spend the night Pig who was carrying the pole pulled a face and said You would have to leave readycooked meals behind and refuse to stay in a nice cool brick house so as to go wherever it is were going Thats just asking for troubleIts very late now Whatll we do if it starts raining Evil insolent beast cursed Sanzang complaining againAs the saying goes The capital may be remarkably fine But we cant linger here for a very long timeJourney to the West If we are fated to visit the Lord Buddha fetch the true scriptures go back to Great Tang and report to the emperor I will let you eat in the imperial kitchens for years on end Then you evil beast you will swell up till you burstThat will teach you to be such a greedy devil The idiot chortled quietly to himself but did not dare say another wordWhen Brother Monkey raised his eyes to look around he saw some buildings beside the road and asked his master urgently Can we spend the night hereCan we Sanzang went over to the place where he saw a ruined memorial arch on which was inscribed THE VIHARA OF PADMAPRABHA The Bodhisattva Padmaprabha was a disciple of the Buddha Sikhin said Sanzang dismounting He was dismissed for eliminating the Demon King of Poison Fire and turned into the Spirit Officer of the Five ManifestsThere must be a shrine here They then all went in togetherThe cloisters had all collapsed the walls had fallen down and there was no trace of anybody around only of vegetation running wildThey would have gone out again but the sky had filled with dark clouds and it had started to pour with rainThere was nothing for it but to find a place in the ruins where they could shelter from the stormThey kept completely silent not daring to speak aloud for fear that some evil demon might hear themThus it was that they endured a sleepless night sitting or standing thereOh dearHow true it is that Disaster strikes at triumphs height In time of joy comes sorrows blightIf you dont know what happened when they carried on with their journey listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Monks and Their Supporters Meet With Demonic Attack The Sage Makes the Spirit Reappear to Save the Primal One We will tell not of how the Tang Priest and the others endured a hard night in the dilapidated palace of Padmaprabha but of a group of evil villains in Diling county in the prefecture of Brazentower who had squandered all their families fortunes in whoring drinking and gamblingHaving nothing else left to live on they had formed a criminal gang of a dozen and more members and were discussing which family was the richest in the city and which the second richest The idea was to rob them of their gold and silver and thus get some money to spend Journey to the West Theres no need to go round making enquiries one of them said or work it out in detail The MrKou who saw the Tang monk off today is rolling in moneyLets strike tonight in the rain Therell be nobody ready for us in the streets and the fire wardens wont be patrolling When weve stolen his property well be able to go with the girls gamble and have a good time againThat would be great wouldnt it The other robbers were all delighted with the suggestion and with one heart they all set out in the rain carrying daggers spiked clubs sticks coshes ropes and torchesFlinging open the main gates of the Kou house they charged inside shouting and sending everyone inside young and old male and female scurrying into hidingThe old woman hid under the bed and the old man slipped behind the gates while Kou Liang Kou Dong and their families fled for their lives in all directionsHolding their knives in their hands and lighting torches the bandits opened up all the chests in the house and grabbed as much of the gold silver jewelry hair ornaments clothing vessels and other household goods as they wantedKou could not bear to lose all this so taking his life in his hands he come out from behind the gate to plead with the robbers Take as much as you want great kings he said but please leave me a few clothes to be buried in The robbers were in no mood for argumentThey rushed up to him tripped and kicked him to the groundAlas His three souls vanished to the underworld His seven spirits left the world of menThe successful robbers left the Kou house put up a rope ladder from the foot of the city wall took it in turns to cross and fled Westwards in the rainOnly when they saw that the robbers had gone did the servants of the Kou family dare show their heads again When they looked for old MrKou and found him lying dead on the floor they started weeping aloud HeavensThe masters been murdered they all said as they wept embracing the body and sobbing in miseryWhen it was almost the fourth watch the resentful Mrs Kou who was angry with the Tang Priest and his followers for rejecting their hospitality and also because the extravagance of their sendoff had provoked this disaster decided to ruin the four of themHelping Kou Liang to his feet she said Dont cry my sonYour father fed monks day in and day outWho ever would have thought that he would complete the number by feeding a gang of monks whod murder him Mother the brothers asked how did those monks murder him Those bandits were so bold and vicious that when they charged in I hid under the bed she replied Although I was trembling I made sure to take a very good look at them by the light of the torchesDo you know who they wereThe Tang Priest was lighting torches Pig was holding a knife Friar Sand was taking the gold and silver and Monkey killed your father The two sons believed all thisIf you saw all that clearly mother they said you must be rightThey spent a fortnight in our house so they knew all the doors walls windows and passageways They must have been tempted by our wealth and come back here under cover of rain and darkness How evil Theyve stolen our property and murdered our fatherOnce its light well go to the local government and report them as wanted men What sort of wanted notice should we write Kou Dong askedJourney to the West Well write what our mother said Kou Liang replied and he wroteThe Tang Priest lit the torches Pig incited to murder Friar Sand stole the gold and silver and Sun the Novice murdered our fatherThe whole household was in such a hubbub that before they noticed it day had dawnedWhile invitations were sent out to their relatives and a coffin was ordered Kou Liang and his brother went to the local government offices to deposit their complaintNow the prefect of Brazentower Had always been upright Was good by natureAs a boy he had studied by the light of the snow When young he had taken the palace examinationsHis heart was always set on loyalty and justice And filled with thoughts of kindness and benevolenceHis name would be transmitted in annals for a thousand years Like a Gong Sui or Huang Ba come back to life His fame would resound for ten thousand ages in the balls of office Zhuo Mao and Lu Gong rebornWhen he had taken his seat in the hall and declared that all matters could be dealt with he ordered that the placard asking for plaints should be carried outsideKou Liang and his brother then came in holding the placard knelt down and called aloud Your Honour we have come to denounce some bandits as thieves and murderers The prefect accepted their complaint and read what it had to sayI was told yesterday that your family completed your vow of feeding monks the prefect said by feeding four distinguished ones arhats from the Tang Dynasty in the East You made a great display of sending them off with drums and musicSo how could such a thing as this have possibly happened Your Honour said Kou Liang kowtowing our father Kou Hong had been feeding monks for twentyfour yearsThese four monks who had come from afar just happened to make up the ten thousand which was why he held a service to mark the completion and kept them there for a fortnightThey got to know all the passageways doors and windowsThey were seen off during the day and came back yesterday evening During the dark and stormy night they charged into the house with torches and weapons to steal our gold Journey to the West silver jewelry clothes and hair ornaments They beat our father to death and left him lying on the groundWe beg you to be our protector On hearing this the prefect mustered infantry cavalry and ablebodied civilian conscripts  men in all who rushed straight out of the Western gate carrying sharp weapons in pursuit of the Tang Priest and his three disciplesThe story now tells how master and disciples stayed in the ruins of the minor palace of padmaprabha until dawn when they went out and started hurrying WestwardsThe bandits who had gone along the main road West all night till daybreak after robbing the Kou family and leaving the city had passed the palace of Padmaprabha and hidden in the mountains some six or seven miles to the West Here they were just dividing up the gold and silver when the Tang Priest and his three followers came into view also heading West along the roadThe bandits whose greed was not yet sated pointed at the Tang Priest and said LookArent they the monks who were seen off yesterday And a very welcome arrival too said the other bandits laughing Lets do a bit more of our dirty business Those monks coming along the road spent a long time in the Kou house Goodness only knows how much stuff theyre carrying Lets hold them up take their travel money and white horse and share it all outThatll suit us very nicely The robbers then rushed to the road brandishing their weapons and yelling their war cry as they formed a line Stay where you are monks they shouted Leave some toll money and well spare your livesIf so much as half a no comes out through your teeth youll all be cut down without mercy The Tang Priest was shaking with terror as he sat on his horse What are we to do Pig and Friar Sand asked Brother Monkey with alarmWhat are we to doWe had a miserable night in the rain and after starting out again this morning were being robbed by banditsHow true is it that troubles never come singly Dont be frightened Master said Monkey with a smile and stop worrying brothersWait while I go and ask them a few questions The splendid Great Sage put on his tigerskin kilt straightened up his brocade and cotton tunic went up to them put his hands together in front of his chest and asked What are you gentlemen doing Dont you care whether you live or die you swine the robbers yelled back at him How dare you question usHave you got no eyes in your head Dont you realize who we great kings areHand your toll money over at once and well let you go on your way When he heard this Monkey wreathed his face in smiles and replied So youre bandits who hold people up on the road Kill him the bandits yelled with furyYour Majesties said Monkey with feigned terror Your Majesties Im only a monk from the country I dont know the right things to say Please dont be angry if Ive offended you please dontIf what you want is toll money all you have to do is to ask me no need to ask the other threeIm the bookkeeper All the money we get for chanting sutras and as alms all we beg and all were given goes into the bundles and Im in charge of spending itThe man on the horse is my master All he can do is recite sutras He doesnt care about Journey to the West anything else Hes forgotten all about wealth and sex and hes got nothing at allThe blackfaced one is a junior I collected on our journey All he can do is look after the horseAnd the one with a long snout is a laborer I hired Hes only good for carrying a poleLet those three go while I fetch our travel money cassocks and begging bowlsIll give you all you want You seem to be an honest chap monk the robbers said so well spare your lifeTell the other three to leave their luggage and well let them go Monkey turned back and gave them a lookFriar Sand put down the carryingpole with the luggage and led the masters horse as they carried on WestwardsMonkey bowed down to undo the bundle took a pinch of dust from the ground and scattered it on the bundle as he said the words of a spellIt was bodyfixing magic so the moment he shouted Stop the thirty and more bandits all stood stock still grinding their teeth staring their hands apart None of them could speak or moveCome back Master shouted Monkey come back This is terrible said Pig in alarm this is terrible Big brothers informed on usHe isnt carrying any money on him and theres no gold or silver in the bundle He must be calling the master back to ask him to give up his horseHes going to get the clothes stripped off our backs Dont talk such rubbish brother said Friar Sand with a laughBig brother knows what hes doing Hes always been able to beat vicious monsters and demons up till now so what do we have to fear from a few petty thievesHe must be calling us back because hes got something to say to usLets go straight there and find out When the venerable elder heard this he cheerfully turned his horse round and went back Wukong he called why have you called us back Hear what these robbers have got to say for themselves Brother Monkey saidPig went up to them shoved them and asked Why dont you move bandits The bandits remained completely unconscious and said nothingTheyre thick and dumb too said PigI fixed them by magic said Monkey with a laughEven if you fixed them said Pig you didnt fix their mouths so why arent they making a sound Please dismount and sit down Master said Brother MonkeyAs the saying goes People only get arrested by mistake they never get released by mistake Knock all the robbers over brother and tie them up Then well force them to make statementsFind out if theyre beginners or old hands Havent got any rope said Friar SandMonkey then pulled out some of his hairs blew on them with magic breath and turned them into thirty lengths of ropeThey all set to knocked the robbers over and tied their hands and feet togetherThen Monkey said the words that ended the spell whereupon the bandits gradually revivedMonkey invited the Tang Priest to take the seat of honour while he and the other two shouted holding their weapons Hairy banditsHow many of you are there altogether and how many years have you been in this line of businessHow many things have you stolenHave you murdered anyoneIs this your first offence Journey to the West Or your second Or your third Spare our lives your lordships pleaded the robbersStop shouting said Monkey and come clean We arent hardened robbers your lordships they said Were all from good familiesBecause were a bad lot we squandered all the wealth wed inherited in drinking gambling whoring and living it up Weve never worked and now weve got no money eitherWe found out that Mr Kous family was one of the richest in the prefecture of Brazentower so last night we got together to rob it under cover of darkness and rainWe stole some gold silver clothing and jewelry and were just dividing it up in a mountain hollow to the North of the track when we noticed you gentlemen coming Some of us recognized you as the monks Mr Kou saw off so we were sure that you must have some goods on youThen we saw how heavy your luggage was and how fast the white horse was goingIt was our disgraceful greed that made us try to hold you upNever did we imagine that you would have such divine powers and be able to tie us upWe beg you to be merciful to us Take back what we stole and spare our lives Sanzang was violently shocked to hear that their booty had been stolen from the Kou householdHe stood up at once and said Mr Kou was a very good man Wukong so how did he bring such a disaster on himself It was all because the coloured hangings and fancy parasols and the huge numbers of drummers and musicians when we were seen off attracted too much attention replied Monkey with a smile Thats why this gang of desperadoes attacked his houseLuckily they ran into us and weve taken back all the gold silver clothing and jewelry We put MrKou out for a whole fortnight said Sanzang so we owe him a huge debt of gratitude that we have not yet been able to repayWould it not be a good deed to return this property to his house Monkey agreed and he went to the mountain hollow with Pig and Friar Sand to fetch the booty which they packed up and loaded on the horseHe told Pig to carry the load of gold and silver while friar Sand carried their own luggageMonkey was just on the point of killing all the bandits with his cudgel when he had the worrying thought that the Tang Priest might get angry with him for committing murder So he could only shake himself and take back all the hairsNow that their hands and feet had been untied the thieves all got up then fled for their lives into the undergrowthThe Tang Priest then turned back the way he had come to return the booty to MrIn making this journey he was like a moth flying into a flame and coming to disasterThere is a poem about it that goesKindness to others is rarely with kindness rewarded Kindness will often to hate and hostility leadPlunge in the water to rescue the drowning Youll suffer Think before acting and spare yourself grief you dont needSanzang and his disciples were just heading back with the gold silver clothing and jewelry when the crowd of men armed with spears and swords arrivedDisciples said Sanzang with alarm look at all those armed men coming hereWhat is happening Journey to the West Its a disaster said Pig a disaster Theyre the robbers we set free Theyve found weapons and ganged up with some more people Now theyve come back and theyre going to kill us They dont look like bandits brother said Friar SandBig brother take a closer look The masters in bad trouble again Monkey whispered to Friar SandThese must be soldiers here to capture the bandits Before he had finished saying this the soldiers were upon the master and his disciples surrounding themYoure a fine bunch of monks they said robbing a house then swaggering around here like this They then rushed them dragged the Tang Priest off his horse and tied him upNext they tied up Brother Monkey and the others and carried them off hanging from poles two men to each of them Driving the horse along and seizing the baggage they went back to the prefectural cityThis is what could be seen The Tang Priest Shivering and shaking Weeping and lost for wordsZhu Bajie Muttering and grumbling Full of complaintsFriar Sand Talking away While secretly feeling uncertainSun the Novice Chuckling merrily Ready to use his powersHustled and carried along by the soldiers they were soon back in the city where the soldiers escorted them straight to the prefects courtYour Honour they reported the constables have captured the robbers and brought them back The prefect sitting in his place in the court rewarded the constables inspected the booty and sent for the Kou family to collect itThen he had Sanzang and the others brought into court You monks maintain that you come from a place far away to the East and are going to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven he said interrogating themBut really youre housebreakers who used dirty tricks so Journey to the West that you could get to know your way around Your Honour Sanzang replied we are not robbers I would not dare to deceive you We carry a passport with us as proofIt was because we were so grateful to Mr Kous family for feeding us for a fortnight that when we ran into the robbers along our way we recovered the booty they had stolen from the Kou house We were taking it back to the Kou house to pay our debt of gratitude when to our astonishment we were arrested as robbers by the constablesWe really are not robbers and I beg Your Honour to investigate closely You only made up that fancy talk about paying a debt of gratitude because you were arrested by the soldiers the prefect repliedIf you really met other robbers why didnt you show your gratitude by capturing them and turning them inWhy are only the four of you hereLook at the wanted notice Kou Liang submittedHe accuses you by name How dare you still dispute it When Sanzang heard this he felt like a stormtossed boat on the ocean and all his souls flew awayWukong he said why dont you come forward and argue in our defense The booty proves it said MonkeyArguing would do no good Thats right the prefect said The booty is all here as proof Do you still dare to deny itFetch the headclamp he instructed his underlings and put it round the head of the bald robber Then beat him again Monkey was now very anxiousEven though my master is fated to suffer this he thought to himself I mustnt let it be too tough for him Seeing the yamen runners tightening the cord to fix the headclamp in place he opened his mouth to speakPlease dont squeeze that monks head Your HonourWhen we robbed the Kou house last night I was the one who lit the torches carried the sword stole the goods and killed the man I was the ringleader If you want to torture anyone torture me Its nothing to do with themThe only thing is that you mustnt let me go On hearing this the prefect ordered Put the clamp on him first The underlings then all fell on Monkey fixed the clamp on his head and tightened it so hard that the cord snapped with a twangThe clamp was fastened tightened and snapped with a twang againThey did this three or four times and the skin on his head was not even creasedWhen they changed the cord and were tightening it again someone was heard coming in to report Your Honour the Lord Assistant Protector Chen from the capital is comingWill you please come to greet him outside the city The prefect then ordered the head torturer Throw the bandits into gaol and keep a good eye on themThe torture and interrogation will continue after I have gone to greet my superior The head torturer then marched the Tang Priest and the other three into the gaolPig and Friar Sand carried their luggage in with themDisciple said Sanzang what are we to do In you go Master said Monkey with a grin in you go There arent any dogs barking in thereItll be a lark The four of them were then taken inside and each of them was pushed on a torture rack to which their bellies heads and chests were tightly fastenedThe warders then started beating them up againFinding the agony unbearable Sanzang called out Whatever shall I do WukongWhatever shall I do Journey to the West Theyre beating us because they want money Brother Monkey repliedAs the saying goes Stay put when things are going well Spend cash when things are going illTheyll stop if you give them some money But where am I to get money from Sanzang askedIf you havent any money Monkey replied clothes will doGive them the cassock These words cut Sanzang to the heart but realizing that the beating was more than he could take he could only say Do as you will Wukong Gentlemen Monkey called out theres no need to beat us any moreTheres a brocade cassock in one of the two bundles we brought in with us thats worth a fortuneOpen them up and take it When the warders heard this they all set to together opening the bundles up to search themThere were some cotton clothes and a document case but none of these were worth anythingSeeing something glowing brightly inside several layers of oiled paper the warders realized that it must be a treasureWhen they shook it open and looked at it this is what it looked like Exquisitely decorated with shining pearls Set with some wonderful Buddha treasuresEmbroidered dragons curled around Flying phoenixes adorned brocade edgesAs they all struggled to look they disturbed the head gaoler who came up to them and shouted What are you all making this row about Falling to their knees the warders replied His Honour has just started a case against four monks and sent them hereWhen we roughed them up a bit they gave us these two bundlesAfter we opened them we saw this and we dont know how to deal with it It would be a real pity to tear it up to divide between us but it would be hard on everyone else if just one of us had itIts a good thing youve come siryou can give us a ruling The head gaoler could see that it was a cassockThen he inspected the other clothes and the document case and on opening the case to read the passport he saw that it was covered with seals and signatures from many states Its a good thing I saw this in time he said If I hadnt you people would have caused bad troubleThese monks arent robbers On no account touch their thingsWhen His Honour questions them again tomorrow Journey to the West well find out the truth The warders then gave the wrapping cloths back to the prisoners who repacked them and handed them over to the head gaoler for safekeepingEvening was slowly drawing in The drum could be heard from its tower and the fire wardens began their patrolsBy the third mark of the fourth watch Monkey could see that the others had stopped groaning and were fast asleepThe master was fated to meet with the hardship of a night in gaol he thought That was why I said nothing in our defense and didnt use my magic powersBut now the fourth watch is nearly over and his sufferings almost doneId better start getting things sorted out if were to leave this gaol at dawn Just watch as he uses his powers to make himself smaller get off the rack shake himself and turn into a midge who flies out of the prison through a gap between the tiles over the eavesBy the light of the stars and the moon in the still silent night sky he could see where he was going and he flew quietly straight towards the gates of the Kou house On the West side of the road was a house where a lamp was shining brightly and as he flew closer for a better look he saw that it was a house of beancurdmakersAn old man could be seen looking after the fire while an old woman was squeezing out the bean juiceWife the old man suddenly called out Mr Kou had wealth and sons but he didnt live longWhen we were boys we were both at school together I was five years older than himHis father was called Kou Ming In those days he had less than  acres He couldnt even collect his overdue rentsOld Kou Ming died when his son was nineteen and once the young man took charge of the household things went really wellHe married the daughter of Zhang Wangshe used to be known as Threadneedle when she was a girl but she made her husband a rich man Once she came into his house his crops were good and the debts to him got paid Whatever he bought showed a profit and whatever he went in for made money His familys worth a hundred thousand nowWhen he reached forty he turned pious and he fed ten thousand monks Fancy him being kicked to death by robbers last night Poor manHe was only sixtyfourWho would have thought so good a man would meet with so evil a reward and be murdered just when everything was going well for him What a pityWhat a pity By the time Monkey had listened to all this it was now at the first mark of the fifth watchHe then flew into the Kou house where a coffin was placed in the main room A lamp was burning at the head and around the coffin was incense candles and fruitHis wife was weeping beside him and the two sons also came to kowtow and weep while their wives brought two bowls of rice as an offeringMonkey landed at the head of the coffin and coughedThis gave the two daughtersinlaw such a fright that they ran outside waving their arms aboutKou Liang and his brother lay on the floor too terrified to move and crying out Oh father oh Their mother being bolder hit the head of the coffin and said Have you come back to life old man No replied Monkey imitating MrKous voice to the great alarm of the two sons who kept kowtowing weeping and repeating Oh Father oh Their mother summoned up even more courage to ask Husband if you havent come back to life why are you talking King Yama has sent demons to bring me here to talk to you Monkey repliedHe told me that Threadneedle Zhang had been lying and trying to frame the innocent In her surprise at hearing him call her by the name she had been known as a child the old woman fell at once to her knees kowtowed and said Youre a fine old manFancy calling me by my childhood name at this ageWhat lies have I been tellingWhich innocent people have I framed Journey to the West Wasnt there something about The Tang Priest lit the torches Pig incited to murder Friar Sand stole the gold and silver and Sun the Novice murdered our father Monkey repliedYour lies have landed those good men in terrible troubleWhat really happened was that the Tang Priest and the other three teachers met some bandits and got our property back for us to show their thanks How good of themBut you had to concoct a wanted notice and send our sons to denounce them to the authoritiesThe court threw them in gaol without making a careful investigationThe gaol god the local deity and the city god were all so alarmed and uneasy that they reported it to King Yama and he ordered demons to escort me back home Im to tell you to have them released as soon as possibleIf you dont I will have to make havoc here for a month Nobody in the household young or oldnot even the dogs and the chickenswill be spared Kou Liang and his brother kowtowed again and begged Please go back Father and dont harm us allAt dawn well submit a petition to the court for their release and withdraw our charge against them We only want peace for both the living and the dead When Monkey heard this he called out Burn sacrificial paper moneyI am leaving All his family started burning paper moneyMonkey then rose up on his wings and flew straight to the prefects residence Bending low to look he saw that there was a light in the bedroom the prefect was already up When Monkey flew into the main room he saw a scrollpainting hanging on the back wallIt showed an official riding a piebald horse with several servants holding a blue umbrella and carrying a folding chairMonkey did not know what the picture was about but landed in the middle of itAll of a sudden the prefect came out of the bedroom and bent low to comb and wash himselfMonkey gave a sharp cough alarming the prefect and sending him hurrying back into his bedroomWhen he had combed his hair washed himself and put on his formal clothes the prefect came out to burn incense to the picture and pray to it Venerable uncle divine Jiang Qianyi your dutiful nephew Jiang Kunsan is now prefect of Brazentower thanks to the hereditary privilege won for me by your ancestral virtue and also to my success in the examinations Morning and evening I offer incense without interruption Why did you speak todayI beg you not to haunt us and terrify the household So this is a holy picture of his ancestor Brother Monkey thought with a hidden smile and making the most of this chance he called out Nephew Kunsan you have always been uncorrupt in the office you were given through ancestral privilege How could you have been so stupid yesterdayYou took four holy monks for thieves and threw them into prison without finding out why they had comeThe prison god the local deity and the city god were all so disturbed by this that they reported it to the king of Hell He told demon envoys to bring me here to speak to you and advise you to consider the circumstances and find out the truth and release them at onceOtherwise youll have to come back to the Underworld with me for the case to be sorted out When the prefect heard this he replied in terror Please go back now sitYour nephew will go straight into court and release them at once Very well then Monkey said Burn some sacrificial paper moneyI am going to report back to King Yama The prefect lit incense burned paper money and bowed in thanksWhen Monkey flew out again and looked around he saw that the East was already turning whiteHe then flew to the Diling county office where all the county officials could be seen in the courtroomIf I talk when Im a midge he thought and someone spots me itll give the game awayThat wouldnt do So he gave himself a giant magical body where he was in mid air and stretched down one foot that filled the whole courtroomListen to me you officials he shouted I am the Roving God Rambler sent here by the Jade Emperor He says that sons of the Buddha on their way to fetch the scriptures have been beaten up in the prefectural gaol here which has disturbed the gods of the three worlds He has asked me to tell you to release them at onceIf anything goes wrong Im to use my other foot to kick all you county and prefecture officials Journey to the West to death then crush all the people around here and trample the whole city to dust and ashes At this the county magistrate and the other officials all fell to their knees and kowtowed in worshipPlease go back now superior sage they pleadedWe are now going to the prefectural offices to request His Honour to release them immediatelyWe implore you not to move your feet and terrify us to death Only then did Monkey put away that magical body turn into a midge again and fly back into the gaol through a gap between the tiles at the eaves climb into his rack and go to sleepThe story now tells that no sooner had the prefect entered his courtroom and ordered the notice inviting people to submit written requests to be carried outside than Kou Liang and his brother fell to their knees at the entrance holding the notice in their armsThe prefect ordered them to come in and when the prefect read the document that the two of them submitted he said in fury Yesterday you handed me a wanted notice The thieves were arrested and you had the booty backSo why are you asking for them to be released today Your Honour the two brothers replied tears streaming down last night our fathers spirit appeared to us and said the holy monks from Tang captured the bandits took our property back from them released them and were kindly bringing the goods back to us to show their gratitude How could you have treated them as robbers captured them and made them suffer in gaolThe local god in the gaol and the city god were so alarmed and uneasy that they reported it to King Yama King Yama ordered demons to escort me back to tell you to go to the prefectural court and submit another plea for the Tang Priests release and thus avoid disasterOtherwise everybody in the household would be killed This is why we have come with this request for their releaseWe beg you to help us Your Honour On hearing this the prefect thought Their father is a new ghost whose body is still warm so its not surprising that he should have appeared to them after what happenedBut my uncle has been dead for five or six years Why did he appear to me early this morning and tell me to investigate and release themIt really does look as though an injustice has been done As the prefect was thinking things over the magistrate and other officials of Diling county came rushing into the courtroom to say in a wild panic Disaster Your Honour disaster The Jade Emperor has just sent the Roving God Rambler down to earth to tell you to release those good men from gaol this very momentThe monks captured yesterday werent robbers they are disciples of the Buddha going to fetch the scripturesIf theres any delay hes going to kick all us officials to death then trample the whole city and all the people in it to dust and ashes The prefect turned pale at this new shock then told the head gaoler to write a release order and deliver them to the courtThe prison doors were immediately opened and they were led outGoodness knows what sort of beating were in for today said Pig gloomilyI can guarantee that they wont dare give you a single clout said Monkey with a grin Ive fixed everything upWhen you go into the courtroom you absolutely mustnt kneel Hell come down into the court to invite us to take the best seatsThen well ask for our luggage and the horse back from himIf anythings missing Ill give him a beating for your entertainment Before he had finished speaking they reached the entrance to the courtroom where the prefect the county magistrate and all the other officials came out to welcome them with the words When you holy monks arrived yesterday we were under urgent pressure to meet our superiors In addition we did see the stolen goodsThat is why we did not find out the truth The Tang Priest put his hands together in front of his chest bowed and recounted in detail everything that had happenedJourney to the West The officials were all voluble in admitting We were wrong we were wrongPlease please dont be angry with us They then asked if the monks had lost anything in the prisonMonkey stepped forward opened his eyes wide in a glare and yelled at the top of his voice Our white horse was taken by the court officers and the gaolers took our luggage Give it back right now Its our turn to torture and question you lot howWhat should the punishment for wrongfully arresting innocent people as bandits be Seeing how ugly he was acting the prefectural and county officials were all terrified They told the people who had taken the horse to return the horse and the men who had taken the luggage to return every single piece of itJust look at how viciously the three disciples start acting while the officials could only blame the Kou family to cover up their own blunderDisciples said Sanzang trying to calm them downLet us go to the Kou house to question them and argue it out with them in order to make everything clear Then we can find out who it was who took us for robbers Good idea said Brother MonkeyIll call the dead man back and ask him who killed him Friar Sand hoisted the Tang Priest up on the horse right there in the courtroom then escorted him outside with much shoutingAll the prefectural and county officials accompanied them to the Kou house so alarming Kou Liang and his brother that they kowtowed repeatedly in front of the gateway then led them into the hall This was where old MrKous coffin lay and the whole family was to be seen weeping inside the mourning drapes around itStop howling you lying old woman Monkey shouted You tried to get innocent men killed Wait till I call your husband back Well see what he has to say about who murdered himThatll shame her The officials all thought that Monkey was joking but then he said Please keep my master company for a moment Your Honors Pig Friar Sand protect him wellIm offIll soon be back The splendid Great Sage bounded outside and rose up into the skyColoured clouds were all around to cover up the house Auspicious auras filled the sky to protect the primal deityOnly then did everyone recognize that Monkey was an immortal who could ride clouds and mists and a sage who could bring the dead back to life We will not tell of how they all burned incense and worshippedThe Great Sage went straight to the Underworld by somersault cloud and charged into the Senluo Palace causing such alarm thatThe Ten Kings of the Underworld came out to raise their bands in greeting The demon judges of the five regions kowtowed in welcomeJourney to the West A thousand trees of knives all leaned away Ten thousand hills of swords all leveled themselvesIn the City of the Unjustly Slain the fiends were converted Under the bridge over Punishment River the dead return to lifeThe divine light was like the grace of Heaven And everywhere shone bright in the palaces of darknessThe Ten Kings received the Great Sage greeted him and asked him why he had comeWhos got the ghost of Kou Hong who used to feed monks in Diling County in the prefecture of Brazentower said MonkeyFind him and give him to me at once Kou Hong is a very good man the Ten King replied He came here himself No demon had to envoys drag him here with their hooksHe met King Ksitigarbhas Goldenclad Boy who took him to see Ksitigarbha Monkey then took his leave of them and went straight to the Turquoise Cloud Palace where he saw the Bodhisattva King KsitigarbhaWhen the Bodhisattva had greeted him Monkey explained what had happenedLiang Hongs allotted span had been completed the Bodhisattva said with delight and his life was over That is why he left the world behind and came here without touching his bedAs he was such a good man who had fed monks I have made him a chief recorder in charge of the register of good deedsBut since you have come here to fetch him Great Sage I shall grant him a twelveyear extension of his life on earthLet him leave with the Great Sage The Goldenclad Boy then led out Kou Hong who on seeing Monkey kept saying Teacher save meTeacher You were kicked to death by robbers said Monkey and now youre in the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbhas place in the Under worldIve come to fetch you and take you to the world of the living to sort this matter outThe Bodhisattva will let you go back and has given you another twelve years of life after which youll come back here The old gentleman kowtowed to him endlesslyHaving thanked and taken his leave of the Bodhisattva Monkey blew on Kou Hong turned him into vapor tucked him into his sleeve and left the Underworld to go back to the world of the livingHe rode his cloud back to the Kou house told Pig to lever the lid off the coffin and pushed Kou Hongs spirit back into the bodyA moment later Kou Hong started breathing as he came back to lifeClimbing out of his coffin he kowtowed to the Tang Priest and his three disciples with the words Teachers teachers I was wrongly killed but my master went to the Underworld to bring me back to lifeI owe him my recovery His thanks were unendingWhen he turned round and saw all the officials drawn up in line he kowtowed again and asked Why are all your lordships in my house Your sons first submitted a wanted notice the prefect replied and accused the holy monks by nameI sent men to arrest them not realizing that the holy monks had met the robbers who raided your house taken the booty off them and were returning it to your houseI was wrong to have them arrested and I had them thrown Journey to the West into gaol without making a detailed investigationLast night your spirit appeared my late uncle came to lodge a complaint with me and the Roving God Rambler came down to earth in the county offices After so many manifestations I released the holy monks and they have brought you back to life Your Honour said MrKou on his knees these four holy monks really have been wrongedThat night over thirty bandits with torches and weapons robbed my houseBecause I could not bear to lose all those things I tried to reason with the robbers but to my horror they kicked me to deathWhats it got to do with these four gentlemen He then called for his wife Why did you people make that lying report about who had killed meWill you please determine their punishments Your Honour Everyone in the family young and old alike kowtowedIn his magnanimity the prefect spared them from punishmentKou Hong then ordered a banquet to thank the prefectural and county officials for their generosityThe officials all returned to their offices without sitting down at the banquetThe next day the sign announcing that monks would be fed was hung out again and another attempt was made to keep Sanzang thereSanzang refused absolutely to stay any longer Once again MrKou invited his friends and relations arranged for flags and canopies and saw them off as beforeIndeed However remote the place evil deeds can be done Heaven may be high but it does not desert the goodSteadily they plod along towards the Tathagata Until they reach the gate of bliss on Vulture PeakIf you do not know what happened when they met the Buddha listen to the explanation in the next installmentWhen the Ape and the Horse Are Tamed They Cast Off Their Husks When All the Deeds Have Been Done Reality Is Seen The story told how after coming back to life Mr Kou once more arranged for parasols banners drummers musicians Buddhist monks Taoist priests his friends and his relations to see Sanzang off againBut instead of describing this we will tell of the Tang Priest and his three disciples taking the main road The West was indeed a land of the Buddha unlike anywhere else They saw precious flowers rare grasses ancient cypresses and hoary pinesIn all the places they passed through every family was pious and fed monksUnder every mountain people cultivated their conduct in all the forests travelers recited sutras Master and disciples took shelter each night and set out at dawn till six or seven days later a mass of high buildings and splendid halls suddenly came into viewTruly they were Thrusting a hundred feet into the heavens Journey to the West Touching the Milky Way in the skyLower your head and see the setting sun Put out your hand and pluck a shooting starThe spacious windows enclose the cosmos The towering roofbeams join up with the cloudsYellow cranes bring letters as the autumn trees grow old Coloured phoenix epistles come in the fresh evening breezeThese are sacred and precious palaces and gates Jeweled intricate buildings and courtyardsIn the holy halls the Way is discussed Sutras are transmitted throughout the universeThe flowers are beautiful as they turn towards the spring Green are the pine trees in the rainPurple fungus and immortals fruits ever flourish All beings respond as red phoenixes soarSanzang raised his whip and pointed with it as he said What a fine place Wukong Master said Monkey when you were in those delusive places where you saw false images of Buddhas you insisted on prostrating yourself in front of themBut today when youve reached the real place where there is the true image of the Buddha you wont even dismountWhat do you mean by it No sooner did he hear this than Sanzang sprang straight out of the saddle and went to the gatewayA young lay brother who stood to one side of the monastery gateway called out You must be the people from the East who have come to fetch the scriptures The venerable elder quickly straightened his clothes and raised his head to look aroundHe saw that the boy was Wearing clothes of golden brocade Waving a jadehandled whiskWearing clothes of golden brocade Journey to the West He feasted in pavilions by the Jasper Pool Waving a jadehandled whisk He dusted the steps of the purple palacesAt his side hung an immortals tablet And on his feet were sandalsHe was a true winged adept Elegant and remarkableHaving won immortality he lived in a wonderful land Cultivating eternal life and escaping from worldly dustThe holy priest did not recognize the stranger on Vulture Peak The Goldcrested Immortal of yesteryear The Great Sage Monkey did however recognize himMaster said Monkey this is the Great Goldcrested Immortal who lives at the Jade Truth Temple at the foot of Vulture PeakHe is here to greet us Only then did Sanzang realize who he was and step forward to salute himYou have finally arrived here this year replied the Great Immortal with a smile I was fooled by the Bodhisattva GuanyinTen years ago she went to the East at the Buddhas command to find the Pilgrim who would fetch the scriptures She told me then he would be here within two or three yearsI have been waiting for years on end with no news of you at allI never thought that it would be this year before we met Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang replied I am very grateful to you for your kindness Great Immortal very grateful Sanzang and his three disciples led the horse and carried the baggage with them into the Taoist temple where they were introduced to all the Great Immortals thereTea and a vegetarian meal were then ordered and the Taoist boys were told to heat scented water for the holy monks to bathe in before climbing to the Buddha landIndeed When achievements are complete it is right to bathe The fundamental nature has been trained into innate truthMany thousand troubles and today The nine prohibitions and triple surrender lead to renewalThe monsters all done with they climb to the Buddha land Journey to the West With disasters ended they see the SramanaDirt and filth now washed away they are wholly pure Returning to the fundamental their bodies are imperishableBy the time master and disciples had bathed the day was drawing to a close They spent the night in the Jade Truth TempleThe next morning the Tang Priest changed into his brocade cassock put on his Vairocana mitre and grasped his monastic staff in his hand to climb the steps of the main hall and take his leave of the Great ImmortalYesterday you were in rags the Great Immortal said with a smile but today you are dressed in splendor I can see from your appearance that you are indeed a son of the Buddha Sanzang then bowed in farewellWait a moment the Great Immortal saidI will see you off Theres no need for you to see us off Monkey repliedI know the way What you know said the Great Immortal is the way by cloud The holy monk has never gone by cloud He must go by the overland way Youre right replied MonkeyAlthough Ive been here several times Ive always come and gone by cloud Ive never come here on footIf theres an overland route Ill trouble you to see us along itMy master is very serious about worshipping the Buddha so Id be very grateful if you could hurry up about it The Great Immortal chuckled as he took the Tang Priest by hand and led the Incense to the gate of the DharmaThe way led not out by the temples front entrance but through the main hall and out through the back gatePointing towards Vulture Peak the Great Immortal said Holy monk do you see the auspicious light of many colours and the richly textured aura in the sky That is the summit of Vulture Peak the holy territory of the Lord Buddha As soon as he saw it the Tang Priest bowed lowMaster said Brother Monkey with a smile we havent got to the place for bowing yetAs the saying goes The mountain may be in view but your horse will collapse before you get there Were still quite a long way from the place so why start bowing nowIf you bow all the way from here to the top however many times will you have to hit your head on the ground Holy monk said the Great Immortal You the Great Sage Marshal Tian Peng and the Curtainraising General have now reached the blessed land and seen Vulture PeakI am going back now Sanzang took his leave of the Great Immortal and continued on his wayThe Great Sage led the Tang Priest and the others slowly up Vulture PeakWithin a couple of miles they reached a river of mighty rolling waves some three miles wide There was no sign of anyone anywhere aroundWukong said Sanzang with alarm we have come the wrong way I wonder if the Great Immortal misdirected usThis river is so wide and the waves so big and there are no boats to be seenHow are we to cross it Journey to the West He didnt send us the wrong way replied Monkey with a smileLook over there Thats a bridge isnt itOnce were over that well have completed the true achievement When the venerable elder and the others went closer to look they saw a tablet beside it on which were written the words CLOUDTOUCHING CROSSING Now this bridge was only a single logIndeed From afar it seemed to span the void like a beam of jade Seen closer the bridge was but a withered spar crossing the waterTo bind a river and frame the sea is easier Than walking along the trunk of a single treeThe glow of a myriad rainbows spread out all around A thousand lengths of fine white silk stretched to the edge of the skyIt was narrow slippery and hard to cross Unless one was a god who could walk on coloured cloudsWukong said Sanzang in fear and trembling no mortal man could cross that bridgeLet us look elsewhere to find the way But this is the way replied Monkey with a smile this is the way Nobodys going to dare cross that even if it is the right way said Pig with alarmThe rivers so wide and there are those terrible waves and all there is is that narrow slippery treetrunkWe couldnt take a single step You all stand there while I go on it to show you replied MonkeyThe splendid Great Sage strode forward and sprang on the singletrunk bridge He quickly ran across to the other side swaying as he went and called out Come over come over The Tang Priest waved in refusal while Pig and Friar Sand bit their fingers and said Its much too hard Monkey then ran back again from the far side and pulled at PigCome with me you idiot he said come with me Its too slippery its too slippery said Pig lying down on the ground I could never cross itPlease spare me that and let me cross by wind and mist Monkey held him down as he replied This is no place for you to be allowed to go riding wind and mistYou can only become a Buddha by crossing this bridge Brother said Pig Ill never make itHonestly I cant walk across Journey to the West As the two of them were pulling at each other and fighting Friar Sand went over to talk them round Only then did they let go of each otherSanzang then looked round to see a man poling a boat towards them from downriver and shouting Ferry Come aboard Stop fooling around disciples said a delighted venerable elderThere is a ferryboat coming The other three sprang to their feet and all watched together as the boat drew closer It was a bottomless craftMonkey had already spotted with the golden pupils in his fiery eyes that this was the Welcoming Lord Buddha who is also known as Ratnadhvaja the Royal Buddha of Brightness but instead of giving this away he just kept calling Over here punt over here A moment later the ferryman had punted his boat up to the bank and was again shouting FerryCome aboard Sanzang was once more alarmed at the sightYour boat has no bottom he said so however could you ferry anyone across This boat of mine the Buddha said Has been famous since Chaos was first divided And been punted by me without any changesIt is stable in wind and stable in waves Enjoying great peace with no start and no endUntouched by the six types of dust it returns to the One Carries on calmly through all kinds of calamityHard it is for a bottomless boat to cross the oceans But since ancient times it has ferried all creatures The Great Sage Monkey put his hands together in front of his chest and thanked him with the words I am grateful to you for your generosity in coming to welcome my masterStep aboard MasterThat boat of his may have no bottom but its stable and wont capsize even in wind and waves The venerable elder was still very doubtful but Monkey seized him by the arms and pushed him forwardUnable to keep on his feet the master tumbled into the water where the ferryman grabbed hold of him at once and stood him on the boatThe master shook his clothes and stamped his feet complaining about Monkey who led Friar Sand and Pig to stand on board bringing the luggage and the horse with themGently and strongly the Buddha pushed off at which a corpse came floating downstream to the horror of the venerable elderDont be frightened Master said MonkeyThats you Its you its you said PigFriar Sand clapped his hands as he said Its you its you Journey to the West The boatman gave a call then also put in too Its you CongratulationsCongratulations The three of them all joined in these congratulations as the ferryman punted the boat quickly and steadily over the immortal Cloudtouching CrossingSanzang turned around and sprang lightly ashore on the opposite bankThere is a poem about this that goes When the wombborn flesh and body of blood is cast aside The primal spirit finds kinship and loveOn this morning of actions completed and Buddhahood attained The thirtysix kinds of dust from the past are washed awayThis was indeed what is meant by great wisdom the boundless dharma of crossing to the other bankWhen the four of them climbed the bank and looked back the bottomless boat had already disappeared goodness knew whereOnly when Brother Monkey explained that it had been the Welcoming Buddha did Sanzang find enlightenment At once he turned round to thank his three disciplesLets not exchange thanks said Monkey Weve helped each otherYou saved us three Master and showed us the way to win merit so as to complete the true achievementAnd we have protected you Master holding to the faith and helping you happily to cast off your mortal bodyMaster look at the magnificent scenery ahead Flowers grasses pines and bamboo as well as phoenixes cranes and deer Compare it with those places where evil beings created illusions through transformationAsk yourself which is beautiful and good and which ugly and evil Sanzang was full of expressions of gratitudeAll of them were now light of body and cheerful as they walked up Vulture PeakSoon the ancient Thunder Monastery could be seen Its rooftops touched the heavens Its roots joined with the Sumeru rangeAmazing peaks spread out in serried rank Craggy rocks formed interlocking shapesUnder the hanging scar were wonderful plants and flowers Beside the winding path grew magic mushrooms and orchidsImmortal apes were picking the fruit of the peach trees Like gold amid burning flames White cranes perched in the branches of the pines As if they were jade creatures amid smokeJourney to the West Coloured phoenixes in pairs Green phoenixes two by twoThe pairs of coloured phoenixes Brought blessings on the world as they called to the sun The green phoenixes two by two Danced in the wind a rare and wonderful sightOn the gleaming golden tiles were figures of mandarin ducks The brilliantly patterned bricks were set with agateTo East and West Were flowers of palaces and pearls of gateways To North and South Were endless precious pavilions and high buildingsThe Devaraja Hall streamed with coloured light Purple flames rose before the Lokapalas ChamberStupas stood out And fragrant were the blossoms of the udumbara treeTruly this was a place so fine it might have come from heaven Where the days seemed long under leisurely cloudsAway from the mortal world all fates came to an end All kalpas were complete within the Dharma hallAs master and disciples walked freely and at their ease up to the summit of Vulture Peak lay people could be seen under the green pines and pious men and women amid the jadecoloured cypressesThe venerable elder bowed to them politely whereupon all the lay men and women monks and nuns all hastened to put their hands together and say to him Do not bow to us holy monkCome back and talk with us when you have seen Sakyamuni Its a bit early for that replied Monkey with a grinLets go and worship the boss Journey to the West The venerable elder waved his arms and performed a ritual dance as he followed Monkey straight to the gates of the Thunder Monastery where four great vajrapanis greeted them with the words Have you arrived now holy monk Yes Sanzang replied with a bow Your disciple Xuanzang has arrived Having given this reply he was about to go in through the gatewayPlease wait for a moment holy monk the vajrapanis saidLet us report before you come in The vajrapanis sent a report of the Tang Priests arrival to the four great vajrapanis on the middle gates who in turn reported it to the inner gates inside which were divine monks making offeringsAs soon as they heard of the Tang Priests arrival they all hurried to the Mahavira Hall where they announced to the Tathagata Sakyamuni Buddha The holy monk from the Tang Court has arrived at your noble monastery to fetch the scriptures The Lord Buddha was very pleasedHe called together his Eight Bodhisattvas Four Vajrapanis Five Hundred Arhats Three Thousand Protectors Eleven Heavenly Shiners and Eighteen Guardians who drew themselves up in two lines and passed on the Buddhas command summoning the Tang Priest to enter Thus it was that the invitation was sent down from one level to the nextLet the holy monk come in Observing the requirements of ritual the Tang Priest went in through the gate with Wukong and Wujing who were leading the horse and carrying the luggage IndeedIn the past he had struggled to fulfil his commission After leaving the emperor at the steps of the throneAt dawn he had climbed mountains in mist and in dew At dusk he had slept on rocks amid the cloudsHe had carried his stick across three thousand rivers And climbed up countless crags with his monastic staffHis every thought had been set on the true achievement And today he was finally to see the TathagataAs the four of them arrived in front of the Mahavira Hall they all prostrated themselves and kowtowed to the Tathagata then to their left and rightAfter they had each completed three rounds of Worship they then knelt before the Buddha to present their passportWhen the Tathagata had read it carefully he handed it back to Sanzang who bowed his head low and reported Your disciple Xuanzang has made the long journey to your precious monastery at the command of the Great Tang emperor to beg for the true scriptures that will save all living beingsI implore the Lord Buddha in his goodness to grant them at once so that I may return to my country Journey to the West The Tathagata then opened his compassionate mouth and in the great mercy of his heart said to Sanzang Your Eastern land is in the Southern Continent of Jambu As the sky is lofty there the soil deep its products many and the people multitudinous there is much covetousness murder debauchery lying deception and dishonestyThey do not follow the Buddhist teaching do not turn towards good destinies and do not honour the sun moon and stars or value the five grainsThey are not loyal filial righteous or kind In the delusion of their hearts they mislead themselves cheating on weights and measures taking life and killing animals thus creating such boundless evil karma and such a superabundance of sin and evil that they bring the catastrophe of hell on themselvesThat is why they must fall for ever into the dark underworld to suffer the torments of being hammered smashed ground and pounded or are reborn as animalsMany of them take the shape of furry horned creatures to pay back the debts they owe from earlier lives and feed others with their own fleshIt is for such reasons that some fall into the Avici Hell from which they never emerge to be rebornAlthough Confucius established the doctrine of benevolence righteousness correct behavior and wisdom and although successive emperors have applied the penalties of imprisonment exile strangulation and beheading none of this affected those stupid benighted selfindulgent and unrestrained peopleI have Three Stores of scriptures that offer deliverance from suffering and release from disasterOf these Three Stores one is the Store of Dharma that deals with Heaven one is the Store of Sastras that deal with the Earth and one is the Store of Sutras that can save ghostsThere are thirtyfive scriptures altogether in  scrollsThese are indeed the path to the truth the gateway to goodnessThey include everything about the astronomy geography personalities birds beasts trees flowers objects of use and human affairs of the worlds four continentsNow that you have come from afar I would present them all to you to take away with you but the people of your country are stupid and coarse They are slanderers of the truth who cannot understand the mysteries of our teachingsAnanda Kasyapa he called take the four of them to the foot of the jewel tower and give them a vegetarian mealAfter the meal open up the pavilion select a few rolls from each of the thirtyfive scriptures in my Three Stores and tell them to propagate these scriptures in the East where they may eternally grant their great goodness Acting on the orders of the Buddha the two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the bottom of the tower where no end of rare and wonderful jewels and treasures were set outHere the divinities who made offerings set out a vegetarian banquet with immortal food immortal delicacies immortal tea immortal fruit and every kind of culinary delight not to be found in the mortal worldMaster and disciples bowed their heads to the ground in thanks for the Buddhas kindness and proceeded to eat to their hearts contentIndeed Precious flames and golden light dazzled the eye While the rare incense and delicacies were marvelously fineThe thousandstoried golden pavilion was infinitely lovely And pure sounded immortals music on the earMeatless food and magic flowers of the sort that are rare on earth Fragrant teas and exotic dishes that give eternal lifeAfter a long period of enduring a thousand kinds of suffering Today comes the glorious happiness of the Way completedJourney to the West This was a piece of good fortune for Pig and a great benefit to Friar Sand as they ate their fill of the food in the Buddhas land that gave eternal life and new flesh and bones for oldThe two arhats kept the four of them company till the meal was over after which they went to the treasure pavilion where the doors were opened for them to go in and lookOver this all was a thousandfold aura of coloured light and auspicious vapors while brilliant mists and clouds of good omen wafted all aroundAll over the scripture shelves and on the outside of the cases were pasted red labels on which were neatly written the titles of the scripturesThey were the Nirvana sutra  rolls Bodhisattva sutra  rolls Akasagarbha sutra  rolls Surangama sutra  rolls Collection of sutras on the meaning of grace  rolls Determination sutra  rolls Ratnagarbha sutra  rolls Avatamsaka sutra  rolls Sutra on Worshipping Bhutatathata  rolls Mahaprajnaparamita sutra  rolls Mahaprabhasa sutra  rolls Adbhutadharma sutras  rolls Vimalakirti sutra  rolls The Three Sastras  rolls Diamond sutra  rolls Saddharma sastra  rolls Buddhacaritakavya sutra  rolls Pancanaga sutra  rolls Bodhisattvavinaya sutra  rolls Mahasamnipata sutras  rolls Makara sutra  rolls Journey to the West Saddharmapundarika sutra  rolls Yoga sutra  rolls Precious Eternity sutra  rolls Sutra on the Western Heaven  rolls Samghika sutra  rolls SamyuktaBuddhadesa sutra  rolls Mahayanasraddhotpadasa sutra  rolls Great Wisdom sutra  rolls Ratnaprabhava sutra  rolls Original Pavilion sutra  rolls Principal vinaya sutra  rolls Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to read the titles of all the scriptures You have come here from the East holy monk they said to himHave you brought us any presentsHand them over right now then we can give you the scriptures When Sanzang heard this he said Your disciple Xuanzang has come a very long way and I did not bring any with me Thats very fine the two arhats said with a laughIf we hand the scriptures over for nothing theyll be passed down through the ages and our successors will have to starve to death Monkey could not stand hearing them talking tough like this and refusing to hand the scriptures over so he shouted Lets go and report them to the Tathagata Master Well get him to give me the scriptures himself Shut up said KasyapaWhere do you think you are acting up like thisCome here and take the scriptures Pig and Friar Sand who were keeping their own tempers under control calmed Monkey downThey turned back to accept the scriptures which were packed one by one into the luggage Some of it was put on the horses back and the rest tied up as two carryingpole loads that Pig and Friar Sand shouldered They all then returned to the Buddhas throne kowtowed thanked the Tathagata and went straight outThey bowed twice to every Buddha and every Bodhisattva they metWhen they reached the main entrance they bowed to the bhiksus the bhiksunis the laymen and the laywomen taking their leave of each one Then they hurried back down the mountainThe story tells not of them but of the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara who had been quietly listening in the library when the scriptures were handed over He understood perfectly well that Ananda and Kasyapa had handed over wordless scripturesThose stupid monks from the East didnt realize that those were wordless scriptures he thought with a smile to himself The holy monks journey across all those mountains and rivers will be a complete waste Who is in attendance here he called and the arhat Suklavira stepped forwardJourney to the West Use your divine might Dipamkara instructed him and go after the Tang Priest like a shooting starTake the wordless scriptures from him and tell him to come back to fetch the true scriptures The arhat Suklavira then flew off on a storm wind that roared away from the Thunder Monastery as he gave a great display of his divine mightThat splendid wind really was A warrior from the Buddhas presence Greater than the two wind gods of the Xun quarterThe angry roars from his divine orifices Were more powerful by far than the puffs of a young girlThis wind made Fish and dragons lose their dens While the waves flowed backwards in rivers and seasBlack apes could not present the fruit they carried Yellow cranes turned back to the clouds as they sought their nestsUgly rang the song of the red phoenix Raucous were the calls of the multicolored pheasantsThe branches of hoary pines were broken As the flowers of the udumbara blew awayEvery cane of green bamboo bowed low All the blooms of golden lotus swayedThe sound of the bell was carried a thousand miles While the chanting of sutras flew lightly up the ravinesRuined was the beauty of flowers under the crag The tender shoots of plants were laid low by the path The brilliant phoenixes could hardly spread their wings White deer hid beneath the cliffsThe heavens were heavy with fragrance Journey to the West As the clear wind blew right through the cloudsThe Tang Priest was walking along when he smelt the fragrant wind but he paid no attention to it taking it for an auspicious sign of the Lord BuddhaThen a noise could be heard as a hand reached down from midair to lift the scriptures lightly off the horses back which gave Sanzang such a shock that he beat his chest and howled aloudPig scrambled along in pursuit Friar Sand guarded the carryingpoles loaded with scriptures and Brother Monkey flew after the arhatSeeing that Monkey had almost caught up with him and frightened that the merciless cudgel would make no bones about wounding him badly the arhat tore the bundle of scriptures to shreds and flung it into the dustWhen Monkey saw the bundle falling in pieces that were being scattered by the fragrant wind he stopped chasing the arhat and brought his cloud down to look after the scripturesThe arhat Suklavira put the wind and the clouds away then went back to report to DipamkaraWhen Pig who was also in pursuit saw the scriptures falling he helped Monkey to collect them up and carry them back to the Tang PriestDisciples the Tang Priest exclaimed tears pouring from his eyes even in this world of bliss evil demons cheat people After gathering up the scattered scriptures in his arms Friar Sand opened one of them up and saw that it was as white as snow not a word was written on itQuickly he handed it to Sanzang with the remark Theres nothing in this scroll Master Monkey opened out another scroll to find that it had nothing written in it eitherPig opened another and it too had nothing in itOpen them all for us to examine said SanzangEvery single scroll was blank paperWe Easterners really do have no luck he said sighing and groaning What point is there in fetching wordless scriptures like theseHow could I ever face the Tang emperorI will have no way of avoiding execution for the crime of lying to my sovereign Monkey who already understood what had happened then said to the Tang Priest Say no more MasterAnanda and Kasyapa gave us these scrolls of blank paper because we hadnt got any presents to give them when they asked for themLets go back report them to the Tathagata and get them accused of extortion Thats right shouted Pig thats rightLets report them The four of them then hurried up the mountain again and after a few steps they were rushing back to the Thunder MonasteryBefore long they were once more outside the gates of the monastery where everyone raised their clasped hands in greeting Have you holy monks come to exchange your scriptures they asked with smilesSanzang nodded and expressed his thanksThe vajrapanis did not block them but let them go straight in to the Mahavira HallTathagata yelled Monkey our master and the rest of us have had to put up with endless monsters demons troubles and hardships to get here from the East to worship you You gave the orders for the scriptures to be handed over but Ananda and Kasyapa didnt do so because they were trying to extort things from us They conspired and deliberately let us take away blank paper versions without a single word written on themBut whats the point in taking thoseI beg you to have them punished Tathagata Stop yelling replied the Lord Buddha with a smileI already know that they asked you for presents But the scriptures cannot be casually passed onNor can they be taken away for nothingIn the past bhiksus and holy monks went down the mountain and recited these scriptures to the family of the elder Zhao in the land of Journey to the West Sravasti This ensured peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of the family All that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of granular goldI said they had sold the scriptures too cheap so I saw to it that Zhaos sons and grandsons would be poorYou were given blank texts because you came here to fetch them emptyhandedThe blank texts are true wordless scriptures and they really are goodBut as you living beings in the East are so deluded and have not achieved enlightenment well have to give you these ones insteadAnanda Kasyapa he called fetch the true scriptures with words at onceChoose a few rolls from each title to give them then come back here and tell me how many The two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the foot of the library building and once again asked the Tang Priest for a presentHaving nothing else to offer he ordered friar Sand to bring out the begging bowl of purple gold and presented it with both hands Your disciple is poor and has come a very long way he said and I did not bring any presents with meThis bowl was given to me by the Tang emperor with his own hands to beg for food with on my journeyI now offer it to you as a token of my heartfelt feelings I beg you arhats not to despise it but to keep itWhen I return to my court I shall report this to the Tang emperor who will certainly reward you richlyI only ask you to give me the true scriptures that have words to save me from failing in my imperial mission and making this long hard journey for nothing Ananda accepted the bowl with no more than a hint of a smileThe warriors guarding the precious library building the kitchen staff responsible for the spices and the arhats in charge of the library rubbed each others faces patted each others backs flicked each other with their fingers and pulled faces Disgraceful they all said with grins disgracefulDemanding presents from the pilgrims whove come to fetch the scriptures A moment later Ananda was frowning with embarrassment but still holding the bowl and not letting goOnly then did Kasyapa go into the library to check the scriptures through one by one and give them to SanzangDisciples called Sanzang take a good look at them not like last time The three of them took the rolls and examined them one by one All had words rolls were handed over the total in a single storeThey were neatly packed up and put on the horse and those left over were made into a carryingpole load for Pig to takeFriar Sand carried their own luggage and as Brother Monkey led the horse the Tang Priest took his staff pushed his Vairocana mitre into position shook his brocade cassock and went happily into the presence of the TathagataIndeed Sweet taste the True Scriptures of the Great Store Created fine and majestic by the TathagataRemember what Xuanzang suffered to climb this mountain Anandas greed was something ridiculousWhat they did not notice at first Dipamkara helped them to see Later the scriptures were real and they then found peaceSuccessful now they would take the scriptures to the East Where all could be refreshed by their lifegiving richnessJourney to the West Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to see the Tathagata who ascended his lotus throne and directed the two great arhats Dragonqueller and Tigersubduer to strike the cloudringing stone chimes that summoned all the Three Thousand Buddhas Three Thousand Protectors Eight Vajrapanis Four Bodhisattvas Five Hundred Arhats Eight Hundred Bhiksus the host of laymen bhiksunis laywomen and the greater and lesser honoured ones and holy monks of every cave every heaven the blessed lands and the magic mountains Those who were supposed to sit were asked to ascend their precious thrones and those who were supposed to stand stood on either sideAll of a sudden heavenly music rang out from afar and magical sounds wafted around The air was full of countless beams of auspicious light and of aura upon aura as all the Buddhas gathered together to pay their respects to the TathagataHow many rolls of scripture have you given them Ananda and Kasyapa the Tathagata askedPlease tell me the numbers one by one The two arhats then reported We are now handing over for the Tang court the Nirvana sutra rolls Bodhisattva sutra rolls Akasagarbha sutra rolls Surangama sutra rolls Collection of sutras on the meaning of grace rolls Determination sutra rolls Ratnagarbha sutra rolls Avatamsaka sutra rolls Sutra on Worshipping Bhutatathata rolls Mahaprajnaparamita sutra rolls Mahaprabhasa sutra rolls Adbhutadharma sutras rolls

Vynaptimatratasiddhi sastra rolls Abhidharmakosa sastra rolls From the thirtyfive scriptures in all of the stores we have selected  rolls to give to the holy monk These will be kept and handed down in TangThey have now all been packed neatly and put on the horse or made into carryingpole loadsThe pilgrims are only waiting to express their thanks Sanzang and his three followers then tethered the horse put down the loads joined their hands in front of their chests and bowed in worshipThe achievement of these scriptures is immeasurable the Tathagata said to the Tang Priest Although they are the source of foreknowledge and reflection for my school they are truly the origin of all Three SchoolsIf they reach your Southern Continent of Jambudvipa they must not be treated with disrespect when they are shown to all living beingsNobody who has not bathed avoided eating meat and observed the prohibitions Journey to the West may open the rollsTreasure them Honour themThey include the esoteric mysteries of the way of immortality and wonderful methods for discovering all transformations Kowtowing in thanks Sanzang faith fully accepted these instructions and determined to carry them out did three more circuits of homage round the Lord Buddha then with dutiful and sincere obedience accepted the scriptures and went out with them through the third of the monastery gates where he thanked all the holy beings one by one againOf him we will say no more After sending the Tang Priest on his way the Tathagata dissolved the assembly that had been called to pass on the scripturesThe Bodhisattva Guanyin then stepped forward from the side put her hands together and submitted to the lord Buddha It has been fourteen years from the time when your disciple went to the East that year to find the man who would fetch the scriptures to his success today That makes  daysMay the Worldhonoured One allow the holy monks to go back East from the West within eight days so as to complete the number of rolls in one store and then your disciple may report his mission as completed What you say is quite right replied the Tathagata with delightYou are permitted to report the completion of your mission With that he instructed the Eight Vajrapanis You are to use your divine might to escort the holy monks back to the East where they will hand the true scriptures over to be kept there After escorting the holy monks back you may return to the WestThis must be done within eight days in order to match the number of rolls in one storeThere must be no disobedience or delay The vajrapanis caught up with the Tang PriestCome with us scripturefetchers they called and the Tang Priest and the others became light and strong as they floated up on clouds after the vajrapanisIndeed Nature revealed and mind made clear they visited the Buddha Actions complete and all achieved they flew aloftIf you do not know how they passed on the scriptures after returning to the East listen to the explanation in the next installmentWhen the Nine Nines Are Complete the Demons Are All Destroyed After the Triple Threes Are Fulfilled the Way Returns to Its Roots The story goes on to tell how the Eight Vajrapanis escorted the Tang Priest back to their country but we will not go into that nowOutside the gates the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre the Four Duty Gods the Six Dings the Six Jias and the Guardians of the Faith went up to the Bodhisattva Guanyin and said We your disciples have given secret help to the holy monk in obedience to your dharma command BodhisattvaNow that they have fulfilled their deeds and you have reported your mission accomplished to the Lord Buddha we would like to report the completion of our mission Permission granted The Bodhisattva replied with delight permission granted The Bodhisattva then went on to ask What were the thoughts and actions of the Tang Priest and his three disciples on their journey Journey to the West They really were pious and determined the deities all replied as we are sure will not have escaped your profound perceptionBut the Tang Priests sufferings truly beggar descriptionYour disciples have made a careful record of the disasters and hardships that he has endured on his journeyThis is the account of his ordeals The Bodhisattva read it through from the beginning and this is what was written in it We Protectors were sent at the Bodhisattvas command To keep a close record of the Tang Priests ordeals The Golden Cicadas exile was the first ordeal Being born and almost killed was the second ordeal Abandonment in the

endured are one short of the full numberGo after the vajrapanis she ordered a protector and tell them to create another ordeal The protector headed East by cloud as soon as he was given this order and after a day and a night he caught up with the Eight Vajrapanis Its like this you see he said whispering in their ears in explanation adding so you must do as the Bodhisattva commands and not disobey When the Eight Vajrapanis heard this they stopped the wind with a swishing sound and dropped the four of them to the ground horse scriptures and allOh dearIt was a case of The Way of reaching the truth through the nine nines is hard Hold fast to your determination to stand at the mysterious passOnly through rigorous effort can the demons be repelled Perseverance is essential to the true Dharmas returnDo not mistake the scriptures for something easily won Of many a kind were the hardships endured by the holy monkThe marvellous union has always been hard to achieve The slightest mistake and the elixir will not be madeJourney to the West As his feet touched common ground Sanzang felt alarmedMarvellous said Pig roaring with laughter just marvellous Its a case of more haste less speed It really is marvellous said Friar SandTheyre giving us a rest here after going so fast As the saying goes remarked the Great Sage Wait ten days on a sandbank then cross nine in a single day Stop arguing you three said SanzangFind out which way we have come and where we are Were here said Friar Sand after looking all around Were hereListen to the water Master From the sound of the water I suppose it must be your family home observed Brother MonkeyHis home is the River of Flowing Sands said PigNo its not that replied Friar SandIts the River of Heaven Take a careful look at the other side disciple said Sanzang at which Monkey sprang into the air shaded his eyes with his hand and took a careful look around Master he said after coming down again this is the West bank of the River of Heaven I remember now said SanzangOn the East bank there is Chen Family VillageWhen we came here the other year they were so grateful to us for rescuing their son and daughter that they wanted to build a boat to take us across but the White Softshelled Turtle carried us overAs I recall there was no sign of human life anywhere on the West bankWhatever are we to do now They say that common mortals can be sinners said Pig but the vajrapanis who serve the Buddha in person are tooThe Buddha ordered them to bring us back East so why have they dropped us half way home Were stuck here nowHow ever are we going to get over Stop complaining brother said Friar SandOur master has found the Way He cast off his mortal body at the Cloudtouching Crossing so he wont possibly fall into the water nowOur big brother and we two can all do levitation magic so we can carry the master across Monkey laughed to himself under his breath as he replied We cant do it we cant do it Why do you think he said that they couldnt do itIf he had been prepared to use his divine powers and give away the secret of flying then master and disciples would have been able to cross a thousand riversBut he understood that as the Tang Priest had not yet completed the nine nines he was fated to undergo another ordeal which was why he had been held up hereTalking as they walked slowly along master and disciples headed straight to the riverbank where all of a sudden they heard someone calling This way Tang Priest this way They were all surprised and when they looked up there was no sign of anyone around and no boat eitherThere was only a big white scabbyheaded softshelled turtle raising its head by the bank and calling Master I have been waiting for you all these yearsWhy have you only just come back We troubled you in the past old turtle said Monkey with a smile and this year we meet again Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand were all delightedJourney to the West If you really do want to look after us come ashore Monkey said at which the turtle climbed out of the river with a boundMonkey had the horse tied to the turtle with Pig squatting behind the horses tail The Tang Priest stood to the left of the horses neck and Friar Sand to its right while Monkey stood with one foot on the turtles neck and the other on his head Take it easy and take it steady he saidThe turtle strode across the water just as if his four feet were walking on flat land carrying the master and his three disciples five of them altogether including the horse straight back to the Eastern bankThis was Indeed The mystery of the Dharma within the unique sect When the demons are all defeated man and heaven are made knownOnly now can the original face be seen And the causes of the one body all be completeHold to the Three Vehicles to come and go at will After the elixirs nine transformations you may do what you likeCarry your bundle let your staff fly and understand the inexpressible Lucky they were on their return to meet the Ancient TurtleCarrying them on his back the Ancient Softshelled Turtle walked across the waves for the best part of a day It was nearly evening when as they approached the East bank he suddenly asked Venerable master some years ago I begged you when you reached the West and saw our Tathagata Buddha to ask him when I would be converted and how long I would live Now ever since the venerable elder had reached the Western Heaven bathed in the Jade Truth Temple cast off his mortal body at the Cloudtouching Crossing and walked up the Vulture Peak his heart had been set only on worshipping the Buddha and when he met all the Buddhas Bodhisattvas holy monks and others his whole mind had been devoted to fetching the scriptures He had given no attention to anything else and so had not asked about how long the Ancient Turtle would liveHaving nothing he could say and not daring to lie to or deceive the turtle Sanzang was quiet for a long time and gave no replyWhen the turtle realized that Sanzang had not asked the questions on his behalf he gave a shake of his head and submerged with a loud splash dropping the four of them horse scriptures and all into the water Oh dearBut luckily the Tang Priest had cast off his mortal body and achieved the WayIf he had still been as he had before he would have sunk to the bottomIt was also lucky that the white horse was a dragon that Pig and Friar Sand could swim and that Brother Monkey gave a smiling and magnificent display of his great magic powers as he lifted the Tang Priest out of the water and up the East bankThe only thing was that the bundles of scriptures the clothes and the saddle were all soakedMaster and disciples had climbed up the bank to get themselves sorted out when a sudden fierce wind blew up the sky turned dark and amid thunder and lightning stones and sand flew all around This is what could be Journey to the West seenA wind Throwing heaven and earth into chaos Thunder Rocking mountains and rivers Lightning Flying like fire through the clouds Mists Covering all of the earthThe wind howled Loud roared the thunderThe lightning streaked red While clouds blocked out the moon and the starsThe windblown dust drove into the face And tigers and leopards hid in terrorThe lightning flashes set birds cawing And tress all vanished in the spreading mistsThe wind whipped up the waves of the River of Heaven The thunder terrified the fish and dragons in the River of Heaven The lightning lit up the whole of River of Heaven The mists enshrouded in darkness the banks of the River of HeavenSplendid wind Mountains toppled pines and bamboo fellSplendid thunder Its majesty alarmed insects and spread terror Journey to the West Splendid lightningIt moved across the sky and lit up the wilds like golden snakesSplendid mist Darkening the whole of space obscuring the nine heavensThis alarmed Sanzang who pressed down on the bundles of scriptures while Friar Sand held down their carryingpole and Pig clung to the white horseMonkey however swung his iron cudgel around with both hands as he kept guard to both right and leftNow the wind mist thunder and lightning were all signals made by evil demons who wanted to steal the scriptures that had been fetchedThey tried all night to grab them until the dawn only then did they stopThe venerable elder whose clothes were all soaking wet shivered and shook as he said How did all this start Wukong Master Brother Monkey replied snorting with fury you dont understand the inner truthBy escorting you to fetch these scriptures we have won the great achievement of heaven and earth You will enjoy perpetual youth and your dharma body will never decayThis is something heaven and earth cant stand for and the demons and gods detest They wanted to come and steal them in the darknessBut because the scriptures were soaked through and your true dharma body was holding them down the thunder could not bombard them the lightning could not illuminate them and the mist could not obscure themIt was also because I whirled my iron cudgel around to make its pure Positive nature protect themSince dawn the Positive has been in the ascendant again which is why they cant take them now Only then did Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand realize what had happened and all express unbounded thanksA little later when the sun was shining from high in the sky they took the scriptures to the top of a high cliff opened the bundles and put them out to dryThe rocks on which the scriptures were dried in the sun remain there to this dayThen they spread their clothes and shoes out to dry beside the cliff while they stood there sat down or leapt aroundIndeed The pure Positive body was happy in the sun When Negative demons dared not use their mightEven when water is dominant the true scriptures will win Not fearing wind or thunder lightning mist or lightAfter this clarification they come to the true perception From now on they will reach the immortals land in peaceOn the rocks where the scriptures were dried their traces still remain Journey to the West Never again will any demons come back to this placeAs the four of them were checking through the scriptures and drying them in the sun one by one some fishermen who were passing the river bank lifted up their heads and saw them thereOne of the fishermen recognized them and said Venerable teachers didnt you cross this river the other year when you were on your way to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures Yes yes said Pig thats rightWhere are you fromHow did you know who we are Were from Chen Village the fisherman repliedHow far is Chen Village from here Pig askedIts seven miles South from this gulch the fisherman said Lets take the scriptures to Chen Village and dry them there said Pig Theres somewhere we can stay there and well be able to get something to eat Besides we can get their family to wash our clothesThatll be best wont it We will not go there said SanzangWhen we have dried everything here we can pack up and find our way back The fishermen who passed the gulch to the South happened to meet Chen Cheng You two old gentlemen they called the teachers who went to be sacrificed instead of your children the other year have come back Where did you see them Chen Cheng askedDrying their scriptures in the sun on the rocks the fishermen repliedChen Cheng then took several of his tenants across the gulch saw the pilgrims and hurried towards them to kneel and say My lords now that you are coming back with your scriptures your achievement completed and your deeds done why dont you come to my house Why are you hanging around hereWont you please come straight to the house Well go with you when weve dried our scriptures in the sun Monkey repliedHow did your scriptures and clothes all get wet my lords Chen Cheng askedThe other year the White softshelled Turtle kindly carried us West across the river Sanzang replied and this year he carried us across it EastwardsWe were approaching the bank when he put some questions to me about the enquiries he had asked me to make with the Lord Buddha about how long he would live Now I never made this enquiry so he soaked us all in the waterThat was how they got wet Sanzang then told the whole story in all its details and as Chen Cheng was so sincere in pressing his invitation Sanzang could do nothing but pack up the scripturesAs it was not realized that the ends of several rolls of the Buddhacaritakavya sutra had stuck to the rock when wet the ends were torn off which is why the Buddhacaritakavya sutra is incomplete to this day and there are still traces of writing on the rocks where the scriptures were dried in the sunJourney to the West We were careless Sanzang said with remorseWe did not pay enough attention Youre wrong said Monkey with a laugh youre wrongHeaven and earth are incomplete and this scripture used to be complete Now its been soaked and torn to fulfil the mystery of incompletenessThis is not something that could have been achieved through human effort When master and disciples had finished packing the surras they returned with Chen Chang to his villageIn the village one person told ten ten told a hundred and a hundred a thousand till all of them young and old came out to welcome and see the pilgrimsAs soon as Chen Qing heard of it he had an incense table set out to greet them in front of the gates he also ordered drummers and players of wind instruments to performA moment later the travelers arrived and were welcomed and taken insideChen Qing led out his whole household to greet them with bows and thank them for their earlier kindness in saving their son and daughterTea and a vegetarian meal were then ordered but since receiving the immortal food and immortal delicacies of the Lord Buddha and casting off his mortal body to become a Buddha Sanzang had lost all desire for mortals foodAs the two old mens urgings were so insistent he took some of the food as a mark of gratitudeThe Great Sage Monkey had never been one to eat cooked food so he said That will be enough Friar Sand did not eat either and even Pig was not the Pig he used to behe soon put his bowl downArent you eating any more either idiot Monkey askedI dont know why Pig said but my stomachs gone weak all of a sudden The vegetarian banquet was then cleared away as the old men asked about how they had fetched the scripturesSanzang then gave them a detailed account that started with the bath in the Jade Truth Temple and the lightening of their bodies at Cloudtouching Crossing and went on to tell how they had seen the Tathagata at Thunder Monastery been feasted at the jeweled tower given the scriptures in the precious librarywordless scriptures at first because when the two arhats had demanded presents they had refused themhad gone back to pay their respects to the Tathagata again to be given the number of rolls in a single store had been plunged into the water by the White Softshelled Turtle and nearly had the scriptures stolen in the darkness by evil spirits After telling all this Sanzang took his leaveBut the whole family of the two old men was not at all willing to let them go We have been under a great debt to you for saving our children that we have not yet been able to repay they saidWe have built a Temple of Deliverance where incense has been burned to you ever since without ceasing Then they called out the children in whose place Monkey and Pig had gone to be sacrificed Chen Guangiven and Pan of Gold to kowtow in thanks and ask them into the shrine to take a lookSanzang then put the bundles of scriptures in front of the hall of their house and read them one roll of the Precious Eternity sutraThen they went to the temple where the Chens had set out delicaciesBefore the pilgrims could sit down another group of people came to invite them to another meal and before they could pick up their chopsticks yet another group came with a third invitationThis went on and on without end so that they had no chance to eat properlySanzang who dared not decline the invitations had to make gestures of eatingThe shrine was indeed most handsomely built The gateway was thickly painted in red Thanks to the generous donorsA tower rose there Journey to the West Where houses with a pair of cloisters had now been builtRed were the doors And the Seven Treasures were finely carvedIncense floated up to the clouds Pure light filled the vault of spaceSome tender cypress saplings were still being watered A number of pine trees did not yet form a groveLiving waters met one in front Where the waves of the River of Heaven were rolling High cliffs rose behind Where range upon range of mountains joined the earth dragonWhen Sanzang has seen everything he climbed the high tower where statues of the four pilgrims had been placedLooks just like you brother said pig tugging at Monkey when he saw themSecond brother said Friar Sand Your statues just like you tooThe only thing is that the masters is too goodlooking It is very good said Sanzang it is very good They then came downstairs where people were still waiting and urged them to eat the vegetarian food that was set out in the hall and in the cloisters behind itWhat happened to the Great Kings Temple that used to be here Brother Monkey askedIt was demolished that year the old men repliedMy lords we have had good harvests every year since this monastery was established thanks to your lordships blessed protection That was heavens gift said Monkey with a smile nothing to do with usBut after we have gone this time I guarantee that the families in your village will have many sons and grandsons flourishing livestock wind and rain at the right time year in and year out and rain and wind year out and year in at the right time The people all kowtowed in thanksWhat could then be seen were a countless number of people lined up behind each other to offer fruit and other vegetarian foodIll be blowed said Pig with a laughIn the old days when I could eat nobody ever asked me to do so ten times overBut now when I cant one family wont wait for another to finish before offering me food Although he was feeling full he did get going a little and ate eight or nine meatless dishes and despite having an injured stomach he also downed twenty or thirty steamed breadrollsWhen they were all full more people came with further invitationsGrateful though I am for your great affection Sanzang said I do not deserve Journey to the West itI hope that we may be allowed to rest tonight Tomorrow morning we will accept some more It was now late at nightSanzang who was guarding the true scriptures and would not leave them for a moment sat in meditation at the foot of the tower to keep a vigilAs the third watch of the night approached he said quietly Wukong the people here know that we have found the Way and completed our undertakingAs the old saying goes The true adept does not show his face who shows his face is no true adept I am afraid that if we tarry too long here that we may fail in our main enterprise What you say is right Master Monkey repliedLets slip quietly away in the middle of the night while theyre all sound asleep Pig too understood Friar Sand comprehended very clearly and the white horse also knew what he meant So they got up quietly loaded the packs shouldered the poles and carried the things out along the cloisterWhen they reached the main gates and found them locked Monkey used unlocking magic to open the inner gates and the main gatesThey followed the path East only to hear the Eight Vajrapanis calling from midairCome with us escapers The venerable elder then smelt incense as he rose up into the airThis was indeed a case of When the elixir is formed one sees the original face When the body is strong one can then visit ones sovereignIf you do not know how he saw the Tang emperor listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Journey Back to the East Is Made The Five Immortals Achieve Nirvana We will tell not of how the four travelers escaped and rose on the wind with the vajrapanis but of the many people in the Temple of Deliverance in Chen Village After they rose at dawn to prepare more fruit and delicacies to offer they came to the ground floor of the tower and found the Tang Priest goneSome asked questions and others searched They were all thrown into panic and did not know what to do Weve let those living Buddhas all get clean away they lamented as their howls rose to the skiesAs there was nothing else they could do about it they carried all the food they had prepared to the ground floor of the tower as offerings and burned imitation paper moneyFrom then on four major sacrifices and twentyfour minor sacrifices were held every yearIn addition people praying for cures or safety seeking marriages making vows and seeking wealth or sons came at every hour of every day to bum incense and make offerings IndeedIncense smoked in the golden burner for a thousand years The light burned in the lamps of jade through eternityJourney to the West We will say no more of this but tell of how the Eight Vajrapanis used a second fragrant wind to carry the four pilgrims off again Some days later they reached the East and Changan came gradually into viewNow after seeing the Tang Priest off from the city on the twelfth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of Then Guan the Emperor Taizong had in the sixteenth year sent officials of his Department of Works to build a Watching For the Scriptures Tower outside the city of Changan to receive the scriptures Here Taizong went in person every yearIt so happened that on the very day the emperor went to the tower the Western sky was filled with auspicious light and gusts of scented windHoly monk the vajrapanis said stopping in mid air this is the city of ChanganWe cannot come down as the people here are too clever we are afraid that they might give away what we look likeThe Great Sage Monkey and the other two gentlemen cannot go there eitherYou must go there yourself to hand the scriptures to your monarch then come back hereWe will be waiting for you up in the clouds ready to go to report back on your mission Although what you respected gentlemen say is right replied the Great Sage how could my master possibly shoulder the pole for carrying the scripturesAnd how could he lead this horseWell have to take him thereMay I trouble you to wait a moment up in the airWe wouldnt dare keep you waiting The other day the Bodhisattva Guanyin informed the Tathagata the vajrapanis replied that the return journey would take only eight days so as to make up the number of rolls of scriptures in the TripitakaWe have already spent over four days and we are worried that Pig will be so greedy for blessings and honors that he will make us overrun the time limit The masters a Buddha now Pig replied with a smile and I want to become one too So why should I want to be greedyCheeky great foolsWait here while we hand the scriptures over then well come back to return with you The idiot then shouldered a pole while Friar Sand held the horse and Brother Monkey led the holy monk as they brought their cloud down to land beside the Watching For the Scriptures TowerWhen Taizong and his officials all saw this they came down to greet the travelers with the words You are back Imperial Younger Brother The Tang Priest fell to the ground in a kowtow only to be helped back to his feet by Taizong who asked Who are these three They are disciples I took on along the way Sanzang replied Taizong was delightedHarness the horses to our imperial carriage he ordered his aides and invite the Imperial Younger Brother to mount his steed and return to the palace with us The Tang Priest thanked him and mounted his horseThe Great Sage followed closely behind whirling his golden cudgel Pig and Friar Sand led the horse and shouldered the pole as they followed the emperor back to Changan IndeedIn that year of peace and rising prosperity Civil and military officials are calm and magnificentAt a land and water mass the clergy displayed the dharma Journey to the West The monarch commands his ministers in the throne hall of the palaceA passport was given to Tang Sanzang The primal cause of the scriptures has been matched to the Five ElementsThrough painful tempering all monsters have been destroyed Now he returns in triumph to the capitalThe Tang Priest and his three disciples followed the imperial carriage back to the palace Everybody in the capital knew that the pilgrim who had gone to fetch the scriptures had now returnedWhen the monks young and old of the Hongfu Monastery in Changan where the Tang Priest used to live saw that the tops of a number of pine trees were all leaning towards the East they exclaimed in astonishment Odd very oddTheres been no wind today so why are the tops of these trees all bent Fetch our vestments at once said one of them who was a former disciple of SanzangThe master who went to fetch the scriptures is back How do you know the other monks all askedWhen the master left many years ago the former disciple replied he said that when the branches and tops of the pines turned East three four six or seven years after he had gone he would be backMy master speaks with the holy voice of a Buddha that is how I know They quickly put on their habits and went outBy the time they reached the Western street messengers had arrived to say The pilgrim who went for the scriptures has just returned and His Majesty is bringing him into the city As soon as they heard this the monks all hurried over to meet himWhen they saw the imperial carriage they dared not come close but followed it to the palace gates where the Tang Priest dismounted and went inside with his disciplesThe Tang Priest stood at the foot of the steps to the throne hall with the dragon horse the load of sutras Monkey Pig and Friar SandEmperor Taizong then summoned the Younger Brother to enter the throne hall and invited him to sit down which the Tang Priest did with thanks He then had the scriptures carried upMonkey and the others unpacked the scrolls which the officials in personal attendance handed to the emperorHow many scriptures are there the emperor askedAnd how did you fetch them When your clerical subject reached Vulture Peak and saw the Lord Buddha Sanzang replied he told the arhats Ananda and Kasyapa to take us first to a precious tower where we were given meatless food then to the library where we were handed the scripturesThe arhats demanded presents but as we had not brought any we had none to giveThen they gave us the scriptures When we had thanked the Buddha for his goodness and were travelling East the scriptures were snatched away by a demonic galeLuckily my disciples were able to recover them by using magic powers but they had been blown all over the placeOn opening them out to look at them we found that they were all blank wordless versionsWe were so shocked that we went back to report to the Buddha and plead for the real onesWhat the Lord Buddha said was When these scriptures were composed bhiksus and holy monks went down the mountain and recited them to the family of the elder Zhao Journey to the West in the land of Sravasti This ensured peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of the family All that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of granular goldI thought that they sold the scriptures too cheap so I saw to it that Zhaos sons and grandsons would be poor When we realized that the two arhats were demanding a present and that the Lord Buddha knew all about it we had no choice but to give them our begging bowl of purple gold Only then did they hand over the true scriptures with wordsThere are thirtyfive of them and a number of rolls from each of them was selected to be given us making a total of rollsThis corresponds to the number of rolls in a single Store At this Taizong was more delighted than everLet the Protocol Office arrange a thanksgiving banquet in the Eastern hall he ordered at which he suddenly saw the three disciples standing at the foot of the steps looking very strange indeed Are your distinguished disciples foreigners he askedMy senior disciples surname is Sun the venerable elder replied with a bow his Buddhist name is Wukong and I also call him Sun the NoviceHe originally came from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Divine BodyFor making great havoc in the palaces of heaven five hundred years ago he was crashed by the Lord Buddha in a stone cell in the Double Boundary Mountain on the Western frontier After the Bodhisattva Guanyin persuaded him to mend his ways he accepted conversion so when I arrived there I delivered himI am greatly indebted to him for my protectionMy second disciple Zhu has the Buddhist name Wuneng and I also call him PigHe came from the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mountain of Blessing and was a monster in Gao Village in the land of Stubet until he was converted by the Bodhisattva and subdued by WukongHe has made great efforts carrying the load all along the way and been very useful in crossing riversMy third disciples surname is Sha and his Buddhist name WujingHe used to be a monster in the Rowing Sands River He too was converted by the Bodhisattva and now believes in the Buddhist faithThe horse is not the one that my sovereign gave me How is that Taizong askedIts markings are the same When your subject was going to cross the waters of the Eagles Sorrow Gorge by Coiled Snake Mountain my original horse was devoured by this one Sanzang repliedSun the Novice obliged me by having the Bodhisattva asked about the horses background It was originally the son of the Dragon King of the Western Sea who had been sent there because of an offence He too was saved by the Bodhisattva who told him to work for me and turned him into a horse with the same markings as the original oneHe has been very helpful in climbing mountains crossing ridges fording rivers and negotiating difficult country On the outward journey I rode him and he carried the scriptures on the way backI have depended greatly on his efforts Taizong was full of boundless praise on learning thisHow long in fact was your journey to the far West he askedI remember the Bodhisattva saying that it was  miles Sanzang replied but I kept no record of the distances along the wayAll I know is that we experienced fourteen winters and summersEvery day there was a mountain or a ridgeThe woods were big and the rivers wideI also met several kings who inspected and stamped my passportDisciples he ordered fetch the passport and hand it to His Majesty When Taizong examined it he saw that it had been issued on the twelfth day of the ninth month of the thirteenth year of Zhen Guan You did indeed make a long and protracted journey he observed with a touch of a smileIt is now the twentyseventh year of Zhen Guan On the passport were the seals of the monarchs of Elephantia Wuji Tarrycart the Womanland of Western Liang Jisai Purpuria Leonia Bhiksuland and Dharmadestructia as well as the seals of the chief officials of Fengxian Yuhua and JinpingWhen Taizong had read through the passport he put it awayJourney to the West Soon the officials in personal attendance on the emperor came to invite them to go to the banquet whereupon Taizong led Sanzang by the hand out of the throne hall asking Do your distinguished disciples know how to behave themselves My disciples were all demons from mountain villages and from the wilderness Sanzang replied so they do not understand the etiquette of the sacred court of ChinaI beg you to forgive them for any offences Your Majesty We wont blame them Taizong said with a smile we wont blame themThey are all invited to come with us to the banquet in the Eastern pavilion Thanking him once again Sanzang called his three disciples and they all went to the Eastern pavilion to lookThis was indeed the great land of China no ordinary placeJust look Coloured silks hung from the gates Red carpets were spread on the floorHeavy rare fragrances Fresh and exotic foodsAmber cups Glazed dishes Set with gold and

disciples together with the civil and military officials stood to left and right as Emperor Taizong took his seat in the middleThere was singing dancing and instrumental music and all was ordered and solemn as the celebration lasted for the rest of the dayIndeed Journey to the West The monarchs banquet was finer than those of ancient Tang and Yu Great was the blessing of the true scriptures obtainedThis was a story to be told with glory for ever The light of the Buddha shines throughout the imperial capitalThat evening they thanked the emperor for his kindness after which Taizong returned to the living quarters of the palace and the officials went homeThe Tang Priest went back with his followers to the Hongfu Monastery where the monks welcomed his with kowtowsNo sooner had he gone in through the gates than the monks reported Master these treetops all suddenly leaned East this morningAs we remembered what you had said we went out of the city to meet you and you had indeed come Overcome with delight the venerable elder then entered the abbots lodgingsThis time Pig neither shouted for tea and food nor made a rowBrother Monkey and Friar Sand also both behaved wellAs the achievement was now complete they were naturally peacefulAt nightfall they went to bedEarly the next morning Taizong announced to his officials at his dawn audience When we thought of the most profound and great achievement of our Younger Brother that we have no way of rewarding we were unable to sleep all nightWe managed to draft a few colloquial sentences with which to express our thanks but could not write them outOfficials of the Secretariat he ordered write them all down while we recite them to you This is the text he dictatedIt is known that Heaven and Earth have their forms as a demonstration of how they provide the cover and support in which life is contained whereas the four seasons are invisible hiding the cold and heat with which they transform all creaturesThus it is that by examining Heaven and looking at the Earth even the stupid can know about their origins but few are the wise who can exhaust the numbers of the Negative and the PositiveHeaven and Earth which are enveloped by the Negative and Positive are easily understood because of their images but the Negative and Positive are hard to fathom because they are formlessIf images are clear and can be grasped even the stupid will not be confused if forms are hidden and invisible even the wise will be at a lossThe way of the Buddha honors emptiness rides on the mystery and controls silence yet saves all beings and dominates all regionsWhen it raises up the numinous there is nothing higher when it represses its own divine strength there is nothing lowerWhen it is big it extends throughout the cosmos when tiny it can be contained in a fraction of an inchIt does not die and it is not born it endures a thousand aeons and is eternalHalf hidden and half manifest it controls all blessings and makes them exist for everMysterious is the wonderful Way none of those who follow it know its limitsSilent is the flow of the Dharma of those who grasp it none finds its sourceSo how can mortal fools in their stupidity follow it without doubts or delusionThe great teaching arose in the WestLater a wondrous dream came to the Han court spreading its brilliance and charity to the EastIn ancient times when the Buddhas forms and traces were shared around they converted people before word could be spread abroadIn the age when they were sometimes visible and sometimes invisible the people looked up to them and followed themBut later the image was obscures and nirvana was reached it moved away and left the world the golden countenance was hidden away and no longer radiated its brilliance in the three thousand worldsPictures of the lovely image were made vainly Journey to the West trying to show the Buddhas thirtytwo holy marksThereafter his subtle words were widely propagated rescuing birds on the three roads of life the teachings he left behind were spread afar guiding all living beings along the ten stages of developmentThe Buddha has scriptures that can be divided into the Greater and Lesser VehiclesThere is also magic the art of spreading mistakes and making right into wrongNow our priest Xuanzang the Master of the Law is the leader of the Dharma faithIn his youth he was so careful and perceptive that he soon became aware of the value of the three voidsAs he grew up the clarity of his spirit embraced the four kinds of patience in his conductNot even a pine tree in a wind or the moon reflected in water could be compared with his purity immortals dew and bright pearls are no match for his lustrous splendorHis wisdom encompasses all without encumbrance his spirit fathoms the formlessRising far above the six impurities he extends his fragrance through a thousand agesWhen he concentrated his mind on the inner sphere he grieved at the torments suffered by the true Dharma when he settled his thoughts on the gate of mystery he was distressed by the distortion of the profound writings He longed to put them back into order so that the teachings of the past could be propagated again and to root out apocryphal texts enabling the true ones to stay in circulation so as to open the way for later scholarsThat is why he lifted up his heart towards the Pure Land and made a Dharma journey to the West braving the dangers of distant lands as he walked alone trusting to his staffWhen the snow whirled around at dawn the land would disappear in a moment and when the dust started to fly at evening the sky was blotted outHe advanced through the mists across a thousand leagues of mountains and rivers making his way forward through the frosts and rains of a hundred changes of seasonWith great singlemindedness and making light of his efforts he longed deeply to reach his goalHe wandered around the West for fourteen years visiting every one of those exotic countries in his search for the true teachingHe visited the Twin Trees and the Eight Rivers savoring the Way and braving the windIn Deer Park and on Vulture Peak he gazed upon wonders and marvelsHe received the good word from ancient sages and the true teaching from superior worthies probing deep within the wonderful gates and exhausting the mysteriesThe Way of the Three Vehicles and the Six Disciplines gallop across the field of his heart a hundred cases of texts belonging to one Store roll like waves in the sea of his eloquenceInfinitely many are the countries he has visited and vast the number of the scriptures he has collectedHe has obtained  rolls of all thirtyfive of the essential texts of the Great Vehicle to be translated and made known in China so that the wonderful cause may be promotedThe clouds of mercy he has drawn from the far West will shed their Dharma rain here in the EastThe holy teachings that had been incomplete are now complete once more the common folk who had sinned are brought back to blessingsThe searing flames of fire have been damped down and all have been saved from the ways of delusion the muddied waves in the water of wisdom have been made clear once more as all gather on the other bankFrom this it can be learned that the evil fall because of their karma while the good rise because of their destinyThe origins of these rises and falls lie in ones own actionsThis can be compared with a cassia growing on a high mountain where only clouds and dew can nourish its blossom or a lotus emerging from green waters its leaves unsullied by flying dustIt is not that the lotus is pure by nature and the cassia unsullied they are good because one attaches itself to what is lofty where mean and trivial things cannot encumber it while the other depends on what is clean where filth cannot dirty itNow if plants that know nothing can become good by building themselves up through goodness how much the more so should conscientious people achieve blessing through blessed cause and effectIt is now to be hoped that the true scriptures will be propagated as endlessly as the alternation of sun and moon and that this blessing will extend for ever eternal like heaven and earthAs soon as this had been written out the holy monk who was waiting outside the palace gates to express his thanks was summoned The moment he heard the summons Sanzang hurried and performed the ritual of kowtowsTaizong then invited him into the throne room and handed him the document Sanzang read it through prostrated himself once more in thanks and submitted this memorialYour Majestys writing is both lofty and in the ancient style it is reasoned profound and subtleBut I do not know what its title is Journey to the West What we drafted orally last night Taizong replied We would call a Preface to the Holy TeachingWould that be acceptable The venerable elder kowtowed and expressed his thanks at great lengthTaizong then said Our talent makes us ashamed by comparison with what is recorded on jade tablets our words are not worthy of what is inscribed on metal or stoneAs for the Inner Scriptures we are even more ignorant of themThe text we drafted orally is truly a base and clumsy composition that sullies golden tablets with brush and ink and is like placing pebbles in a forest of pearlsWhen we reflect on it we are filled with embarrassmentIt is most unworthy of merit we have put you to the trouble of thanking us for nothing The officials all expressed their congratulations and kowtowed before the imperial text on the holy teaching which was going to be published everywhere in the capital and the provincesWould you be willing to recite some of the true scriptures for us Younger Brother Taizong askedYour Majesty Sanzang replied if true scriptures are to be recited it must be done in the Buddhas groundA throne hall is no place for the recital of scriptures Taizong was most pleased to accept thisWhich is the purest monastery in the city of Changan he asked his officers it attendance at which the Academician Xiao Yu slipped forward from his rank to memorialize The Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa in the city is the purest of them all Taizong then ordered his officials Each of you is reverently to bring a few rolls of the true scriptures and accompany us to the Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa where we shall invite our younger brother to preach on the scriptures The officials all carrying some rolls of the scriptures went with Taizong to the monastery where a high platform was erected and everything was neatly set outPig Friar Sand the venerable elder commanded bring the dragon horse with you and put the luggage in orderMonkey will stay beside me He then addressed the emperor saying If Your Majesty wishes to spread the true scriptures throughout the world copies must be made before they can be publishedThe original texts must be stored as great treasuresThey may not be shown any disrespect or be defiled Younger Brother replied Taizong with a smile what you say is very correct very correct He then ordered the officials of the Hanlin Academy and the Palace Secretariat to copy out the true scriptures and had another monastery the Copying Monastery founded to the East of the city wallThe venerable elder mounted the platform with several scriptures in his hands He was just about to begin reciting them when scented breezes began to waft around and the Eight Great Vajrapanis appeared in midair to shout aloud Scripturereciter put those scriptures down and come back to the West with us Monkey and the other two who were standing below Sanzang all rose up above the ground together with the white horseSanzang put the scriptures down and also rose up to the ninth level of clouds then went away with them through the airTaizong and his officials were all so alarmed that they kowtowed to the skyThis was indeed a case of The holy monk long strove to fetch the scriptures For fourteen years across the West he strayedHe journeyed hard and met with much disaster Journey to the West By mountains and by rivers long delayedCompleting eight times nine and one nine more His deeds filled worlds in numbers beyond measureHe went back to his country taking sutras That people in the East will always treasureWhen Taizong and all the officials had finished worshipping eminent monks were selected to prepare a great Land and Sea Mass in the Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa at which the true scriptures of the Great Store would be recited and by which all evildoing ghosts in the underworld would be saved and goodness would spread all aroundWe will not describe how copies were made of the scriptures and published throughout the empireThe story tells instead how the Eight Vajrapanis led the venerable elder his three disciples and the horse all five of them back to Vulture PeakThe journey to Changan and back had taken eight daysJust when all the deities of Vulture Peak were listening to the Buddha preaching the Eight Vajrapanis led master and disciples inIn obedience to the golden command they reported to the Tathagata your disciples have carried the holy monks back to the land of Tang where they handed the scriptures overWe have now come to report our mission completed The Tang Priest and his disciples were then told to step forward and be given their jobsHoly Monk the Tathagata said in an earlier life you were my second disciple and called Master Golden CicadaBut because you would not listen to my sermon on the Dharma and had no respect for my great teaching I demoted your soul to be reborn in the EastNow happily you have come over to the faith and rely on our support and in following our teaching your achievement in fetching the true scriptures has been very great Your reward will be to be promoted to high office as the Candanapunya BuddhaSun Wukong when you made great havoc in the palaces of heaven I had to use powerful magic to crush you under the Five Elements Mountain until happily your heavensent punishment was completed and you were converted to the Sakyamunis faithIt was also fortunate that you suppressed your evil side and gave play to your good side as you won glory by defeating monsters and demons along the journey All that was begun has now been completed and you too will be rewarded with high office as the Victorious Fighting BuddhaZhu Wuneng you used to be a water god in the River of Heaven as Marshal Tian Peng Because of your drunken flirtation with an immortal maiden at the Peach Banquet you were sent down to be born in the lower world as a beastFrom your love of the human body you sinned in the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mount of Blessing before your conversion to the great faith and entry into our Buddhist sectYou guarded the holy monk on his journey but your heart is still unregenerate and you are not yet purged of your lustBut as you won merit by carrying the luggage you will be rewarded with promotion as the Altar Cleanser Theyve both been made Buddhas Pig shouted so why am I only the Altar Cleanser Because you have a voracious appetite a lazy body and a huge belly the Tathagata repliedNow very many people in the worlds four continents believe in our teachings I will ask you to clean up the altars after all Buddhist services your post is of a rank that provides plenty to eatWhat is wrong with that Journey to the West Sha Wujing you used to be the Curtainlifting General until you were banished to the lower world for smashing a crystal bowl at a Peach BanquetYou fell into the River of Flowing Sands where you sinned by killing and eating people until thank goodness you were converted to our teaching sincerely relied on our support and won merit by protecting the holy monk and leading the horse up the mountain Your reward will be elevation to high office as the Golden Arhat Then he said to the white horseYou were originally the son of Guangjin the Dragon King of the Western OceanBecause you disobeyed your father you were punished for being unfilial until you too were converted to the Dharma and to our faith Every day you carried the holy monk to the West and after that you carried the holy scriptures back to the East For these achievements you will be rewarded by being made a Heavenly Dragon of the Eight Classes of Being The venerable elder and his three disciples all kowtowed to express their thanks and the horse showed its gratitude tooA protector was then ordered to take the horse straight down to the Dragontransforming Pool by the precipice at the back of Vulture Peak and push him into the poolAt once the horse stretched itself out shed all its hair and acquired horns Golden scales grew all over its body and a silver beard sprouted on its cheeks and chin Then shining all over with auspicious aura and with clouds of good omen in every claw it flew up from the Dragontransforming Pool to coil itself around the Heavensupporting Winged ColumnAll the Buddhas expressed their admiration for the Tathagatas great magicMaster Monkey said to the Tang Priest now that Ive become a Buddha just like you surely I dont have to go on wearing this golden band Do you plan to say any more Bandtightening Spells to tighten it round my headSay a Bandloosening Spell as quickly as you can take it off and smash it to smithereens Dont let that Bodhisattva or whatever she is make life miserable for anyone else with it It was because you were so uncontrollable in those days that this magic was needed to keep you in order Sanzang repliedNow that you are a Buddha it can of course go There is no reason for it to stay on your head any longerFeel there now When Monkey raised his hands to feel he found that it had indeed goneThe Candanapunya Buddha the Victorious Fighting Buddha the Altar Cleanser and the Golden Arhat had all completed the true achievement and reached their proper places The heavenly dragon horse had also come back to its true selfThere is a poem to prove this that goes All of reality turns to dust When the four appearances combine the body is renewedThe substance of the Five Elements is all void Forget about the passing

Ten Regions all the Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas Mahaprajnaparamita Here ends the Journey to the WestCHAPTER Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood In The Peach Garden One Victory Shatters The Rebels In BattlegroundsDomains under heaven after a long period of division tends to unite after a long period of union tends to divide This has been so since antiquityWhen the rule of the Zhou Dynasty weakened seven contending kingdoms sprang up warring one with another until the kingdom of Qin prevailed and possessed the empireBut when Qins destiny had been fulfilled arose two opposing kingdoms Chu and Han to fight for the mastery And Han was the victorThe rise of the fortunes of Han began when Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor slew a white serpent to raise the banners of uprising which only ended when the whole empire belonged to Han  This magnificent heritage was handed down in successive Han emperors for two hundred years till the rebellion of Wang Mang caused a disruption But soon Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder restored the empire and Han emperors continued their rule for another two hundred years till the days of Emperor Xian which were doomed to see the beginning of the empires division into three parts known to history as The Three KingdomsBut the descent into misrule hastened in the reigns of the two predecessors of Emperor XianEmperors Huan and Lingwho sat in the Dragon Throne about the middle of the second centuryEmperor Huan paid no heed to the good people of his court but gave his confidence to the Palace eunuchsHe lived and died leaving the scepter to Emperor Ling whose advisers were Regent Marshal Dou Wu and Imperial Guardian Chen FanDou Wu and Chen Fan disgusted with the abuses of the eunuchs in the affairs of the state plotted the destruction for the powerabusing eunuchs But Chief Eunuch Cao Jie was not to be disposed of easily The plot leaked out and the honest Dou Wu and Chen Fan were put to death leaving the eunuchs stronger than beforeIt fell upon the day of full moon of the fourth month the second year in the era of Established Calm  that Emperor Ling went in state to the Hall of VirtueAs he drew near the throne a rushing whirlwind arose in the corner of the hall and lofrom the roof beams floated down a monstrous black serpent that coiled itself up on the very seat of majestyThe Emperor fell in a swoon Those nearest him hastily raised and bore him to his palace while the courtiers scattered and fledThe serpent disappearedBut there followed a terrific tempest thunder hail and torrents of rain lasting till midnight and working havoc on all sidesTwo years later the earth quaked in Capital Luoyang while along the coast a huge tidal wave rushed in which in its recoil swept away all the dwellers by the sea Another evil omen was recorded ten years later when the reign title was changed to Radiant Harmony certain hens suddenly crowedAt the new moon of the sixth month a long wreath of murky cloud wound its way into the Hall of Virtue while in the following month a rainbow was seen in the Dragon ChamberAway from the capital a part of the Five Mountains collapsed leaving a mighty rift in the flankSuch were some of various omensEmperor Ling greatly moved by these signs of the displeasure of Heaven issued an edict asking his ministers for an explanation of the calamities and marvels A court counselor Cai Yong replied bluntlyFalling rainbows and changes of fowls sexes are brought about by the interference of empresses and eunuchs in state affairs The Emperor read this memorial with deep sighs and Chief Eunuch Cao Jie from his place behind the throne anxiously noted these signs of griefAn opportunity offering Cao Jie informed his fellows and a charge was trumped up against Cai Yong who was driven from the court and forced to retire to his country house With this victory the eunuchs grew bolderTen of them rivals in wickedness and associates in evil deeds formed a powerful party known as the Ten Regular AttendantsZhang Rang Zhao Zhong Cheng Kuang Duan Gui Feng Xu Guo Sheng Hou Lan Jian Shuo Cao Jie and Xia Yun One of them Zhang Rang won such influence that he became the Emperors most honored and trusted adviserThe Emperor even called him Foster Father So the corrupt state administration went quickly from bad to worse till the country was ripe for rebellion and buzzed with brigandageAt this time in the county of Julu was a certain Zhang family of whom three brothers bore the name of Zhang Jue Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang respectively The eldest Zhang Jue was an unclassed graduate who devoted himself to medicineOne day while culling simples in the woods Zhang Jue met a venerable old gentleman with very bright emerald eyes and fresh complexion who walked with an oakwood staff The old man beckoned Zhang Jue into a cave and there gave him three volumes of the Book of Heaven This book said the old gentleman is the Way of Peace With the aid of these volumes you can convert the world and rescue humankindBut you must be singleminded or rest assured you will greatly suffer With a humble obeisance Zhang Jue took the book and asked the name of his benefactorI am Saint Hermit of the Southern Land was the reply as the old gentleman disappeared in thin airZhang Jue studied the wonderful book eagerly and strove day and night to reduce its precepts to practice Before long he could summon the winds and command the rain and he became known as the Mystic of the Way of PeaceIn the first month of the first year of Central Stability  there was a terrible pestilence that ran throughout the land whereupon Zhang Jue distributed charmed remedies to the afflicted The godly medicines brought big successes and soon he gained the tittle of the Wise and Worthy MasterHe began to have a following of disciples whom he initiated into the mysteries and sent abroad throughout all the land They like their master could write charms and recite formulas and their fame increased his followingZhang Jue began to organize his disciples He established thirtysix circuits the larger with ten thousand or more members the smaller with about half that number Each circuit had its chief who took the military title of GeneralThey talked wildly of the death of the blue heaven and the setting up of the golden one they said a new cycle was beginning and would bring universal good fortune to all members and they persuaded people to chalk the symbols for the first year of the new cycle on the main door of their dwellings With the growth of the number of his supporters grew also the ambition of Zhang Jue The Wise and Worthy Master dreamed of empireOne of his partisans Ma Yuanyi was sent bearing gifts to gain the support of the eunuchs within the PalaceTo his brothers Zhang Jue said For schemes like ours always the most difficult part is to gain the popular favor But that is already oursSuch an opportunity must not pass And they began to prepareMany yellow flags and banners were made and a day was chosen for the uprisingThen Zhang Jue wrote letters to Eunuch Feng Xu and sent them by one of his followers Tang Zhou who alas betrayed his trust and reported the plot to the courtThe Emperor summoned the trusty Regent Marshal He Jin and bade him look to the issue Ma Yuanyi was at once taken and beheadedFeng Xu and many others were cast into prison The plot having thus become known the Zhang brothers were forced at once to take the field They took up grandiose titlesZhang Jue the Lord of Heaven Zhang Bao the Lord of Earth and Zhang Liang the Lord of Human And in these names they put forth this manifestoThe good fortune of the Han is exhausted and the Wise and Worthy Man has appearedDiscern the will of Heaven O ye people and walk in the way of righteousness whereby alone ye may attain to peace Support was not lackingOn every side people bound their heads with yellow scarves and joined the army of the rebel Zhang Jue so that soon his strength was nearly half a million strong and the official troops melted away at a whisper of his comingRegent Marshal and Guardian of the Throne He Jin memorialized for general preparations against the Yellow Scarves and an edict called upon every one to fight against the rebelsIn the meantime three Imperial CommandersLu Zhi Huangfu Song and Zhu Junmarched against them in three directions with veteran soldiers Meanwhile Zhang Jue led his army into Youzhou the northeastern region of the empireThe Imperial Protector of Youzhou was Liu Yan a scion of the Imperial HouseLearning of the approach of the rebels Liu Yan called in Commander Zhou Jing to consult over the position Zhou Jing said They are many and we fewWe must enlist more troops to oppose them Liu Yan agreed and he put out notices calling for volunteers to serve against the rebelsOne of these notices was posted up in the county of Zhuo where lived one man of high spiritThis man was no mere bookish scholar nor found he any pleasure in studyBut he was liberal and amiable albeit a man of few words hiding all feeling under a calm exteriorHe had always cherished a yearning for high enterprise and had cultivated the friendship of humans of markHe was tall of stature His ears were long the lobes touching his shoulders and his hands hung down below his knees His eyes were very big and prominent so that he could see backward past his ears His complexion was as clear as jade and he had rich red lipsHe was a descendant of Prince Faubus of Zhongshan whose father was the Emperor Myers the occupant of the Dragon Throne a century and a half BC His name was Liu Bei Many years before one of his forbears had been the governor of that very county but had lost his rank for remissness in ceremonial offerings However that branch of the family had remained on in the place gradually becoming poorer and poorer as the years rolled onHis father Liu Hong had been a scholar and a virtuous official but died youngThe widow and orphan were left alone and Liu Bei as a lad won a reputation for filial pietyAt this time the family had sunk deep in poverty and Liu Bei gained his living by selling straw sandals and weaving grass matsThe family home was in a village near the chief city of ZhuoNear the house stood a huge mulberry tree and seen from afar its curved profile resembled the canopy of a wagonNoting the luxuriance of its foliage a soothsayer had predicted that one day a man of distinction would come forth from the familyAs a child Liu Bei played with the other village children beneath this tree and he would climb up into it saying I am the Son of Heaven and this is my chariot  His uncle Liu Yuanqi recognized that Liu Bei was no ordinary boy and saw to it that the family did not come to actual wantWhen Liu Bei was fifteen his mother sent him traveling for his education For a time he served Zheng Xuan and Lu Zhi as masters And he became great friends with Gongsun ZanLiu Bei was twentyeight when the outbreak of the Yellow Scarves called for soldiersThe sight of the notice saddened him and he sighed as he read itSuddenly a rasping voice behind him cried Sir why sigh if you do nothing to help your country Turning quickly he saw standing there a man about his own height with a bullet head like a leopards large eyes a swallow pointed chin and whiskers like a tigers He spoke in a loud bass voice and looked as irresistible as a dashing horseAt once Liu Bei saw he was no ordinary man and asked who he wasZhang Fei is my name replied the strangerI live near here where I have a farm and I am a wine seller and a butcher as well and I like to become acquainted with worthy humansYour sighs as you read the notice drew me toward you Liu Bei replied I am of the Imperial Family Liu Bei is my nameAnd I wish I could destroy these Yellow Scarves and restore peace to the land but alas I am helpless I have the means said Zhang Fei Suppose you and I raised some troops and tried what we could do This was happy news for Liu Bei and the two betook themselves to the village inn to talk over the projectAs they were drinking a huge tall fellow appeared pushing a handcart along the road At the threshold he halted and entered the inn to rest awhile and he called for wine And be quick added he for I am in haste to get into the town and offer myself for the army Liu Bei looked over the newcomer item by item and he noted the man had a huge frame a long beard a vivid face like an apple and deep red lipsHe had eyes like a phoenixs and fine bushy eyebrows like silkworms His whole appearance was dignified and aweinspiringPresently Liu Bei crossed over sat down beside him and asked his name I am Guan Yu replied heI am a native of the east side of the river but I have been a fugitive on the waters for some five years because I slew a ruffian who since he was powerful was a bullyI have come to join the army here Then Liu Bei told Guan Yu his own intentions and all three went away to Zhang Feis farm where they could talk over the grand projectSaid Zhang Fei The peach trees in the orchard behind the house are just in full flowerTomorrow we will institute a sacrifice there and solemnly declare our intention before Heaven and Earth And we three will swear brotherhood and unity of aims and sentiments thus will we enter upon our great task Both Liu Bei and Guan Yu gladly agreedAll three being of one mind next day they prepared the sacrifices a black ox a white horse and wine for libation Beneath the smoke of the incense burning on the altar they bowed their heads and recited this oath We threeLiu Bei Guan Yu and Zhang Feithough of different families swear brotherhood and promise mutual help to one end We will rescue each other in difficulty we will aid each other in dangerWe swear to serve the state and save the peopleWe ask not the same day of birth but we seek to die togetherMay Heaven the allruling and Earth the allproducing read our hearts and if we turn aside from righteousness or forget kindliness may Heaven and Human smite us They rose from their kneesThe two others bowed before Liu Bei as their elder brother and Zhang Fei was to be the youngest of the trioThis solemn ceremony performed they slew other oxen and made a feast to which they invited the villagers Three hundred joined them and all feasted and drank deep in the Peach Garden The next day weapons were mustered But there were no horses to rideThis was a real grief but soon they were cheered by the arrival of two horse dealers with a drove of horsesThus does Heaven help us said Liu BeiAnd the three brothers went forth to welcome the merchants They were Zhang Shiping and Su Shuang from Zhongshan They went northwards every year to buy horses They were now on their way home because of the Yellow ScarvesThe brothers invited them to the farm where wine was served before them Then Liu Bei told them of the plan to strive for tranquillityZhang Shiping and Su Shuang were glad and at once gave the brothers fifty good steeds and beside five hundred ounces of gold and silver and one thousand five hundred pounds of steel fit for the forging of weapons The brothers expressed their gratitude and the merchants took their leave Then blacksmiths were summoned to forge weaponsFor Liu Bei they made a pair of ancient swords for Guan Yu they fashioned a longhandled curve blade called GreenDragon Saber which weighed a full one hundred twenty pounds and for Zhang Fei they created a tenfoot spear called OctaneSerpent HalberdEach too had a helmet and full armorWhen weapons were ready the troop now five hundred strong marched to Commander Zhou Jing who presented them to Imperial Protector Liu YanWhen the ceremony of introduction was over Liu Bei declared his ancestry and Liu Yan at once accorded him the esteem due to a relationBefore many days it was announced that the rebellion had actually broken out and a Yellow Scarves chieftain Cheng Yuanzhi had invaded the region with a body of fifty thousand rebelsLiu Yan bade Zhou Jing and the three brothers to go out to oppose them with the five hundred troopsLiu Bei joyfully undertook to lead the van and marched to the foot of the Daxing Hills where they saw the rebelsThe rebels wore their hair flying about their shoulders and their foreheads were bound with yellow scarvesWhen the two armies had been drawn up opposite each other Liu Bei rode to the front Guan Yu to his left Zhang Fei to his right Flourishing his whip Liu Bei began to hurl reproaches at the rebels crying O malcontentsWhy not dismount and be bound Their leader Cheng Yuanzhi full of rage sent out one general Deng Mao to begin the battleAt once rode forward Zhang Fei his octaneserpent halberd poised to strikeOne thrust and Deng Mao rolled off his horse pierced through the heart At this Cheng Yuanzhi himself whipped up his steed and rode forth with sword raised ready to slay Zhang FeiBut Guan Yu swung up his ponderous greendragon saber and rode at Cheng YuanzhiAt the sight fear seized upon Cheng Yuanzhi and before he could defend himself the great saber fell cutting him in halvesTwo heroes new to wars alarms Ride boldly forth to try their armsTheir doughty deeds three kingdoms tell And poets sing how these befellTheir leader fallen the rebels threw away their weapons and fled The official soldiers dashed in among them Many thousands surrendered and the victory was complete Thus this part of the rebellion was broken upOn their return Liu Yan personally met them and distributed rewardsBut the next day letters came from Imperial Protector Gong Jing of Qingzhou saying that the rebels were laying siege to the chief city and it was near falling Help was needed quickly I will go said Liu Bei as soon as he heard the newsAnd he set out at once with his own soldiers reinforced by a body of five thousand under Zhou JingThe rebels seeing help coming at once attacked most fiercelyThe relieving force being comparatively small could not prevail and retired some ten miles where they made a campThey are many and we but few said Liu Bei to his brothersWe can only beat them by superior strategy So they prepared an ambush Guan Yu and Zhang Fei each with a goodly party went behind the hills right and left and there hidWhen the gongs beat they were to move out to support the main army These preparations made the drums rolled noisily for Liu Bei to advance The rebels also came forward But Liu Bei suddenly retired Thinking this was their chance the rebels pressed forward and were led over the hills Then suddenly the gongs sounded for the ambush Guan Yu and Zhang Fei poured out from right and left as Liu Bei faced around to meet the rebelsUnder threeside attack the rebels lost heavily and fled to the walls of Qingzhou CityBut Imperial Protector Gong Jing led out an armed body to attack them and the rebels were entirely defeated and many slain Qingzhou was no longer in danger Though fierce as tigers soldiers be Battle are won by strategyA hero comes he gains renown Already destined for a crownAfter the celebrations in honor of victory were over Commander Zhou Jing proposed to return to YouzhouBut Liu Bei said We are informed that Imperial Commander Lu Zhi has been struggling with a horde of rebels led by Zhang Jue at Guangzong Lu Zhi was once my teacher and I want to go to help him So Liu Bei and Zhou Jing separated and the three brothers with their troops made their way of GuangzongThey found Lu Zhis camp were admitted to his presence and declared the reason of their comingThe Commander received them with great joy and they remained with him while he made his plansAt that time Zhang Jues one hundred fifty thousand troops and Lu Zhis fifty thousand troops were facing each other Neither had had any success Lu Zhi said to Liu Bei I am able to surround these rebels hereBut the other two brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang are strongly entrenched opposite Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun at YingchuanI will give you a thousand more troops and with these you can go to find out what is happening and we can then settle the moment for concerted attack So Liu Bei set off and marched as quickly as possible to YingchuanAt that time the imperial troops were attacking with success and the rebels had retired upon Changshe They had encamped among the thick grassSeeing this Huangfu Song said to Zhu Jun The rebels are camping in the field We can attack them by fire So the Imperial Commanders bade every man cut a bundle of dry grass and laid an ambushThat night the wind blew a gale and at the second watch they started a blazeAt the same time Huangfu Song and Zhu Juns troops attacked the rebels and set their camp on fire The flames rose to the very heaven The rebels were thrown into great confusion There was no time to saddle horses or don armor they fled in all directions The battle continued until dawnZhang Liang and Zhang Bao with a group of flying rebels found a way of escapeBut suddenly a troop of soldiers with crimson banners appeared to oppose themTheir leader was a man of medium stature with small eyes and a long beard He was Cao Cao a Beijuo man holding the rank of General of the Flying CavalryHis father was Cao Song but he was not really a Cao Cao Song had been born to the Xiahou family but he had been brought up by Eunuch Cao Teng and had taken this family nameAs a young man Cao Cao had been fond of hunting and delighted in songs and dancingHe was resourceful and full of guile An uncle seeing the young fellow so unsteady used to get angry with him and told his father of his misdeeds His father remonstrated with himBut Cao Cao made equal to the occasionOne day seeing his uncle coming he fell to the ground in a pretended fitThe uncle alarmed ran to tell his father who came and there was the youth in most perfect healthBut your uncle said you were in a fit are you better said his fatherI have never suffered from fits or any such illness said Cao CaoBut I have lost my uncles affection and he has deceived you Thereafter whatever the uncle might say of his faults his father paid no heedSo the young man grew up licentious and uncontrolledA man of the time named Qiao Xuan said to Cao Cao Rebellion is at hand and only a man of the greatest ability can succeed in restoring tranquillityThat man is yourself And Ho Yo of Nanyang said of him The dynasty of Han is about to fallHe who can restore peace is this man and only he Cao Cao went to inquire his future of a wise man of Runan named Xu ShaoWhat manner of man am I asked Cao CaoThe seer made no reply and again and again Cao Cao pressed the questionThen Xu Shao replied In peace you are an able subject in chaos you are a crafty hero Cao Cao greatly rejoiced to hear thisCao Cao graduated at twenty and earned a reputation of piety and integrity He began his career in a county near Capital LuoyangIn the four gates of the city he ruled he hung up clubs of various sorts and he would punish any breach of the law whatever the rank of the offenderNow an uncle of Eunuch Jian Shuo was found one night in the streets with a sword and was arrested In due course he was beatenThereafter no one dared to offend again and Cao Caos name became heardSoon he became a magistrate of Dunqiu At the outbreak of the Yellow Scarves Cao Cao held the rank of General and was given command of five thousand horse and foot to help fight at Yingchuan He just happened to fall in with the newly defeated rebels whom he cut to piecesThousands were slain and endless banners and drums and horses were captured together with huge sums of moneyHowever Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang got away and after an interview with Huangfu Song Cao Cao went in pursuit of them Meanwhile Liu Bei and his brothers were hastening toward Yingchuan when they heard the din of battle and saw flames rising high toward the sky However they arrived too late for the fightingThey saw Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun to whom they told the intentions of Lu ZhiThe rebel power is quite broken here said the commanders but they will surely make for Guangzong to join Zhang Jue You can do nothing better than hasten back The three brothers thus retraced their stepsHalf way along the road they met a party of soldiers escorting a prisoner in a cagecart When they drew near they saw the prisoner was no other than the man they were going to helpHastily dismounting Liu Bei asked what had happenedLu Zhi explained I had surrounded the rebels and was on the point of smashing them when Zhang Jue employed some of his supernatural powers and prevented my victoryThe court sent down Eunuch Zhuo Feng to inquire into my failure and that official demanded a bribe I told him how hard pressed we were and asked him where in the circumstances I could find a gift for himHe went away in wrath and reported that I was hiding behind my ramparts and would not give battle and that I disheartened my armySo I was superseded by Dong Zhuo and I have to go to the capital to answer the charge This story put Zhang Fei into a rageHe was for slaying the escort and setting free Lu Zhi But Liu Bei checked himThe government will take the proper course said Liu Bei You must not act hastily And the escort and the three brothers went two waysIt was useless to continue on that road to Guangzong so Guan Yu proposed to go back to Zhuo and they retook the roadTwo days later they heard the thunder of battle behind some hills Hastening to the top they beheld the government soldiers suffering great loss and they saw the countryside was full of Yellow Scarves On the rebels banners were the words Zhang Jue the Lord of Heaven written large We will attack this Zhang Jue said Liu Bei to his brothers and they galloped out to join in the battleZhang Jue had worsted Dong Zhuo and was following up his advantage He was in hot pursuit when the three brothers dashed into his army threw his ranks into confusion and drove him back fifteen miles Then the brothers returned with the rescued general to his campWhat offices have you asked Dong Zhuo when he had leisure to speak to the brothers None replied theyAnd Dong Zhuo treated them with disrespect Liu Bei retired calmly but Zhang Fei was furiousWe have just rescued this menial in a bloody fight cried Zhang Fei and now he is rude to usNothing but his death can slake my anger Zhang Fei stamped toward Dong Zhuos tent holding firmly a sharp swordAs it was in olden time so it is today The simple wight may merit well Officialdom holds sway Zhang Fei the blunt and hasty Where can you find his peerBut slaying the ungrateful would Mean many deaths a yearDong Zhuos fate will be unrolled in later chapters CHAPTER Zhang Fei Whips The Government Officer He Jin Plots To Kill The Eunuchs Dong Zhuo was born in the far northwest at Lintao in Longxi As the governor of Hedong Dong Zhuo himself was arrogant and overbearing But the day he had treated Liu Bei with contumely had been his last had not Liu Bei and Guan Yu restrained their wrathful brother Zhang FeiRemember he has the government commission said Liu Bei who are we to judge and slay It is bitter to take orders from such a wretch I would rather slay himYou may stay here if you wish to but I will seek some other place said Zhang FeiWe three are one in life and in death there is no parting for usWe will all go hence So spoke Liu Bei and his brother was satisfiedWherefore all three set out and lost no time in traveling until they came to Zhu Jun who received them well and accepted their aid in attacking Zhang BaoAt this time Cao Cao had joined himself to Huangfu Song and they were trying to destroy Zhang Liang and there was a great battle at QuyangZhang Bao was commanding some eighty thousand troops The rebel had led his army to a strong position in the rear of the hillsAn attack being decided upon Liu Bei was the van leaderOn the rebel side a general of Zhang Bao Gao Sheng came out to offer battle Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to smite Gao ShengOut rode Zhang Fei at full speed his spear ready set After a few bouts Zhang Fei wounded Gao Sheng who was unhorsed At this Liu Bei signaled the main army to advanceThen Zhang Bao while still mounted loosened his hair grasped his sword and uttered his incantationsThereupon began the wind to howl and the thunder to roll while a dense black cloud from the heavens settled upon the field And therein seemed to be horsemen and footmen innumerable who swept to attack the imperial troopsFear came upon them and Liu Bei led off his troops but they were in disorder and returned defeated Zhu Jun and Liu Bei considered the matterZhang Bao uses magic said Zhu JunTomorrow then will I prepare counter magic in the shape of the blood of slaughtered swine and goats and dogsThis blood shall be sprinkled upon their hosts from the precipices above by soldiers in ambushThus shall we be able to break the power of their shamanic art So it was done Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took each a thousand troops and hid them on the high cliffs behind the hills and they had a plentiful supply of the blood of swine and goats and dogs and all manners of filthy thingsAnd so next day when the rebels with fluttering banners and rolling drums came out to challenge Liu Bei rode forth to meet themAt the same moment that the armies met again Zhang Bao began his magic and again the elements began to struggle together Sand flew in clouds pebbles were swept along the ground black masses of vapor filled the sky and rolling masses of foot and horse descended from on highLiu Bei turned as before to flee and the rebels rushed onBut as they pressed through the hills the trumpets blared and the hidden soldiers exploded bombs threw down filth and spattered bloodThe masses of soldiers and horses in the air fluttered to the earth as fragments of torn paper the wind ceased to blow the thunder subsided the sand sank and the pebbles lay still upon the groundZhang Bao quickly saw his magic had been countered and turned to retire Then he was attacked on the flanks by Guan Yu and Zhang Fei and in rear by Liu Bei and Zhu Jun The rebels were routedLiu Bei seeing from afar the banner of Zhang Bao The Lord of Earth galloped toward it but only succeeded in wounding Zhang Bao with an arrow in the left armWounded though he was Zhang Bao got away into the city of Yangcheng where he fortified himself and was besieged by Zhu Jun Scouts sent out to get news of Huangfu Song reportedCommander Huangfu Song had been very successful and Dong Zhuo had suffered many reverses Therefore the court put Huangfu Song in the latters placeZhang Jue had died before Huangfu Songs arrivalZhang Liang had added his brothers army to his own but no headway could be made against Huangfu Song whose army gained seven successive victories And Zhang Liang was slain at QuyangBeside this Zhang Jues coffin was exhumed the corpse beheaded and the head after exposure was sent to Capital LuoyangThe common crowd had surrenderedFor these services Huangfu Song was promoted to General of the Flying Cavalry and the Imperial Protector of Jizhou Huangfu Song did not forgotten his friendsHis first act after he had attained to power was to memorialize the Throne concerning the case of Lu Zhi who was then restored to his former rank for his meritorious conductsCao Cao also received advancement for his services and was preparing to go to Jinan to his new post Hearing these things Zhu Jun pressed harder yet upon Yangcheng and the approaching breakup of the rebellion became evidentThen one of Zhang Baos officers Yan Zheng killed his leader and brought the head in token of submissionThus rebellion in that part of the country was stamped out and Zhu Jun made his report to the government However the embers of the Yellow Scarves still smolderedThree other rebels Zhao Hong Han Zhong and Sun Zhong gathered some thirty thousand rebels and began to murder and rob and burn calling themselves the avengers of Master Zhang JueThe court commanded the successful Zhu Jun to lead his veteran and successful troops to destroy the rebelsHe at once marched toward the city of Wancheng which the rebels were holding When Zhu Jun arrived Han Zhong went to oppose himZhu Jun sent Liu Bei and his brothers to attack the southwest corner of the cityHan Zhong at once led the best of his troops to defend the cityMeanwhile Zhu Jun himself led two thousand of armored horsemen to attack the opposite cornerThe rebels thinking the city being lost abandoned the southwest and turned back into the city to help the defendersLiu Bei pressed hotly in their rear and they were utterly routedThey took refuge in the city which was then invested When famine pressed upon the besieged they sent a messenger to offer to surrender but Zhu Jun refused the offerSaid Liu Bei to Zhu Jun Seeing that the founder of the Han Dynasty Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor could welcome the submissive and receive the favorable why reject these The conditions are different replied Zhu JunIn those old days disorder was universal and the people had no fixed lord Wherefore submission was welcomed and support rewarded to encourage people to come overNow the empire is united and the Yellow Scarves are the only malcontentsTo receive their surrender is not to encourage the goodTo allow brigands when successful is to give way to every license and to let them surrender when they fail is to encourage brigandageYour plan is not a good one Liu Bei replied Not to let brigands surrender is well But the city is surrounded as by an iron barrelIf the rebels request be refused they will be desperate and fight to the death and we can hardly withstood a myriad of such menMoreover in the city there are many times that number all doomed to deathLet us withdraw from one corner and only attack the oppositeThey will all assuredly flee and have no desire to fight We shall take them Zhu Jun saw that the advice was good and followed it As predicted the rebels ran out led by Han ZhongThe besiegers fell upon them as they fled and Han Zhong was slain The rebels scattered in all directionsBut the other two rebel chieftains Zhao Hong and Sun Zhong came with large reinforcements and as they appeared very strong the imperial soldiers retired and the new body of rebels reentered WanchengZhu Jun encamped three miles from the city and prepared to attackJust then there arrived a body of horse and foot from the eastAt the lead was one general with a broad open face a body as an alert tigers and a torso as a lofty bearsHis name was Sun Jian He was a native of Fuchun in the old state of Wu a descendant of the famous Sun Zi the StrategistWhen he was seventeen Sun Jian was with his father on the River Qiantang and saw a party of pirates who had been plundering a merchant dividing their booty on the river bankWe can capture these said he to his fatherSo gripping his sword he ran boldly up the bank and cried out to this side and that as if he was calling his men to come onThis made the pirates believe the soldiers were on them and they fled leaving their booty behind themHe actually killed one of the piratesIn this way be became known and was recommended for officeThen in collaboration with the local officials he raised a band of one thousand and helped to quell the rebellion of one Xu Chang who called himself the Sun Emperor and had ten thousand supporters The rebels son Xu Shao was also slain with his fatherFor this Sun Jian was commended by Imperial Protector Zang Min in a memorial to the Throne and he received further promotion to the post of magistrate of Yandu then of Xuyi and then of XiapiWhen the Yellow Scarves rebellion began Sun Jian gathered together the youths of his village some of the merchant class got a troop of one thousand five hundred of veteran soldiers and took the field Now he had reached the fighting areaZhu Jun welcomed Sun Jian gladly and ordered him to attack the south gate of Wancheng The north and the west gates were simultaneously attacked by Liu Bei and Zhu Jun but the east gate was left free to give the rebels a chance of exitSun Jian was the first to mount the wall and cut down more than twenty rebels with his own swordThe rebels ran but the leader Zhao Hong rode directly at Sun Jian with his spear ready to thrustSun Jian leaped down from the wall snatched away the spear and with it knocked Zhao Hong from the horseThen Sun Jian mounting Zhao Hongs horse rode hither and thither slaying as he went The rebels fled north Meeting Liu Bei they declined to fight and scatteredBut Liu Bei drew his bow fitted an arrow and shot their leader Sun Zhong who fell to the groundThe main army of Zhu Jun came up and after tremendous slaughter the rebels surrenderedThus was peace brought to the ten counties about the Nanyang areaZhu Jun returned to Capital Luoyang was promoted to the General of the Flying Cavalry and received the governorship of Henan He did not forget those who had helped him to win victoryThus he reported the merits of Liu Bei and Sun Jian to the ThroneSun Jian having influential friends and connections to support him quickly got an appointment to a post of Commander of Changsha and went to assume the new officeBut Liu Bei in spite of Zhu Juns memorial waited in vain for preferment and the three brothers became very sad Walking along one day in the capital Liu Bei met a court official Zhang Jun to whom he related his services and told his sorrowsZhang Jun was much surprised at this neglect and one day at court spoke to the Emperor about it Said he The Yellow Scarves rebelled because the eunuchs sold offices and bartered ranks There was employment only for their friends punishment only for their enemies This led to rebellionWherefore it would be well to slay the Ten Eunuchs and expose their heads and proclaim what had been done throughout the whole empire Then reward the worthyThereby the land would be wholly tranquil But the eunuchs fiercely opposed this and said Zhang Jun was insulting the Emperor and the Emperor bade the guards thrust Zhang Jun outHowever the eunuchs took counsel together and one said Surely some one who rendered some service against rebels resents being passed over So they caused a list of unimportant people to be prepared for preferment by and byAmong them was Liu Bei who received the post of magistrate of the county of Anxi to which he proceeded without delay after disbanding his army and sending them home to their villages He retained two dozens or so as escortThe three brothers reached Anxi and soon the administration of the county was so reformed and the rule so wise that in a month there was no lawbreaking The three brothers lived in harmony eating at the same table and sleeping on the same couchBut when Liu Bei was in public sessions or in company of others Guan Yu and Zhang Fei would stand in attendance were it even a whole dayFour months after their arrival there came out a general order for the reduction of the number of military officers holding civil posts and Liu Bei began to fear that he would be among those thrown outIn due course the inspecting official Du Biao by name arrived and was met at the boundary but to the polite obeisance of Liu Bei he made no return save a wave of his whip as he sat on his horseThis made Guan Yu and Zhang Fei furious but worse was to followWhen the inspector had arrived at his lodging he took his seat on the dais leaving Liu Bei standing belowAfter a long time he addressed Liu BeiMagistrate what was your origin Liu Bei replied I am descended from Prince Faubus of ZhongshanSince my first fight with the Yellow Scarves rebels at Zhuo County I have been in some thirty battles wherein I gained some trifling meritMy reward was this office You lie about your descent and your statement of services is false roared the inspectorNow the court has ordered the reduction of your sort of low class and corrupt officials Liu Bei muttered to himself and withdrewOn his return to the magistracy he took council with his secretariesThis pompous attitude only means the inspector wants a bribe said theyI have never wronged the people to the value of a single coin then where is a bribe to come from Next day the inspector had the minor officials before him and forced them to bear witness that their master had oppressed the peopleLiu Bei time after time went to rebut this charge but the doorkeepers drove him away and he could not enter Now Zhang Fei had been all day drowning his sorrow in wine and had drunk far too muchCalling for his horse he rode out past the lodging of the inspector and at the gate saw a small crowd of whitehaired people weeping bitterly He asked whyThey said The inspector has compelled the underlings to bear false witness against our magistrate with the desire to injure the virtuous Liu BeiWe came to beg mercy for him but are not permitted to enter Moreover we have been beaten by the doorkeepers This provoked the irascible and half intoxicated Zhang Fei to furyHis eyes opened wide until they became circles he ground his teeth in a moment he was off his steed had forced his way past the scared doorkeepers into the building and was in the rear apartments There he saw Imperial Inspector Du Biao sitting on high with the official underlings in bonds at his feetOppressor of the people robber cried Zhang Fei Do you know me But before the inspector could reply Zhang Fei had had him by the hair and had dragged him downAnother moment he was outside and firmly lashed to the hitching post in front of the buildingThen breaking off a switch from a willow tree Zhang Fei gave his victim a severe thrashing only staying his hand when the tenth switch was too short to strike with Liu Bei was sitting alone communing with his sorrow when he heard a shouting before his doorHe asked what the matter was They told him General Zhang Fei had bound somebody to a post and was thrashing him Hastily going outside Liu Bei saw who the unhappy victim was and asked Zhang Fei the reasonIf we do not beat this sort of wretch to death what may we expect said Zhang FeiNoble Sir save me cried the inspectorNow Liu Bei had always been kindly and gracious wherefore he bade his brother release the officer and go his wayThen Guan Yu came up saying Brother after your magnificent services you only got this petty post and even here you have been insulted by this fellowA thorn bush is no place for a phoenixLet us slay this fellow leave here and go home till we can evolve a bigger scheme Liu Bei contented himself with hanging the official seal about the inspectors neck saying If I hear that you injure the people I will assuredly kill youI now spare your life and I return to you the sealWe are going The inspector went to the governor of Dingzhou and complained and orders were issued for the arrest of the brothers but they got away to Daizhou and sought refuge with Liu Hui who sheltered them because of Liu Beis noble birthBy this time the Ten Regular Attendants had everything in their hands and they put to death all who did not stand in with themFrom every officer who had helped to put down the rebels they demanded presents and if these were not forthcoming he was removed from officeImperial Commanders Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun both fell victims to these intrigues and were deprived from offices while on the other hand the eunuchs received the highest honorsThirteen eunuchs were ennobled including Zhao Zhong who was added to the rank of General of the Flying CavalryThe government grew worse and worse and every one was irritatedRebellions broke out in Changsha led by Ou Xing and in Yuyang led by Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun Memorials were sent up in number as snow flakes in winter but the Ten suppressed them allOne day the Emperor was at a feast in one of the gardens with the Ten when High Counselor Liu Tao suddenly appeared showing very great distressThe Emperor asked what the matter wasSire how can you be feasting with these when the empire is at the last gasp said Liu TaoAll is well said the EmperorWhere is anything wrong Said Liu Tao Robbers swarm on all sides and plunder the citiesAnd all is the fault of the Ten Eunuchs who sell offices and injure the people oppress loyal officials and deceive their superiorsAll virtuous ones have left the services and misfortune is before our very eyes At this the eunuchs pulled off their hats and threw themselves at their masters feet If Minister Liu Tao disapproves of us they said we are in dangerWe pray that our lives be spared and we may go to our farms We yield our property to help defray military expenses And they wept bitterlyThe Emperor turned angrily to Liu Tao saying You also have servants why cant you bear with mine And thereupon the Emperor called to the guards to eject Liu Tao and put him to deathLiu Tao cried aloud My death matters nothingThe pity is that Han Dynasty after four centuries of reign is falling fast The guards hustled him away and were just about to carry out the Emperors order when a minister stopped them shouting Strike notWait till I have spoken with His Majesty It was the Minister of the Interior Chen Dan He went in to the Emperor to whom he said For what fault is Counselor Liu Tao to be put to death He has vilified my servants and has insulted me said the EmperorAll the empire would eat the flesh of the eunuchs if they could and yet Sire you respect them as if they were your parents They have no merit but they are created noblesMoreover Feng Xu was in league with the Yellow Scarves Unless Your Majesty looks to it the state will crumble There was no proof against Feng Xu replied the EmperorAbout the Ten Eunuchs are there none faithful among them Chen Dan beat his forehead on the steps of the throne and did not desist from remonstranceThen the Emperor grew angry and commanded his removal and imprisonment with Liu TaoThat night Liu Tao and Chen Dan were murderedThen the eunuchs sent a forged edict to Sun Jian making him Governor of Changsha with orders to suppress the rebellion of Ou Xing In less than two months Sun Jian reported the county all tranquil For this he was created Lord of WuchengFurther Liu Yu was made Imperial Protector of Youzhou to move against Yuyang and suppress Zhang Ju and Zhang ChunLiu Hui of Daizhou recommended Liu Bei to Liu Yu Liu Yu welcomed Liu Bei and gave him rank of commander and sent him against the rebels He fought with and worsted them and entirely broke their spirit Zhang Chun was cruel and his leaders turned against himOne of his officers then slew him and brought in his head after which the others submittedThe other leader Zhang Ju saw that all was lost and killed himselfYuyang being now tranquil Liu Beis services were reported to the Throne and he received full pardon for the insult to the imperial inspectorHe also became Magistrate Deputy of Micheng Then Gongsun Zan praised Liu Beis former services and he was promoted to Magistrate of PingyuanThis place was very prosperous and Liu Bei recovered something of his old manner before the days of adversityLiu Yu also received preferment and was promoted to Grand CommanderIn the summer of the six year of Central Stability  Emperor Ling became seriously ill and summoned He Jin into the palace to arrange for the future He Jin had sprung from a humble family of butchers but his sister had become a concubine of rank and borne a son to the Emperor named Bian LiuAfter this she became Empress He and He Jin became the powerful Imperial Guardian and Regent MarshalThe Emperor had also greatly loved a beautiful girl Lady Wang who had borne him a son named Liu XianEmpress He had poisoned Lady Wang from jealousy and the baby had been given into the care of Empress Dong who was the mother of Emperor LingLady Dong was the wife of Liu Chang Lord of JieduAs time went on and the Emperor Huan had no son of his own he adopted the son of Liu Chang who succeeded as the Emperor LingAfter his accession Emperor Ling had taken his own mother into the palace to live and had conferred upon her the title of Empress DowagerEmpress Dong had always tried to persuade her son to name Liu Xian as the Heir Apparent and in fact the Emperor greatly loved the boy and was disposed to do as his mother desiredWhen he fell ill one of the eunuchs Jian Shuo said If Liu Xian is to succeed He Jin must be killed to prevent countermoves The Emperor saw this too and commanded Imperial Guardian He Jin to come to himBut at the very gates of the palace He Jin was warned of his danger by Commander Pan Yin who said This must be a trap of Jian Shuo to destroy you He Jin rushed back to his quarters and called many of the ministers to his side and they met to consider how to put the eunuchs to deathAt this assembly a man spoke against the plot The influence of the eunuchs dates back half a century and has spread like a noxious weed in all directions How can we hope to destroy itAbove all keep this plot secret or you will be exterminated He Jin eyed down and saw General of Military Standards Cao CaoHe Jin was very angry at this speech and cried What do inferiors like you know of the ways of government And in the midst of the confusion Pan Yin came to sayThe Emperor is no more The eunuchs have decided to keep the death a secret and forge a command to the Imperial Guardian to come into the palace to settle the successionMeanwhile to prevent trouble they have inscribed the name of Liu Xian on the roll And as Pan Yin finished speaking the edict arrivedThe matter for the moment is to set up the rightful heir said Cao CaoThe other affairs can wait Who dares to join me in supporting the rightful heirPrince Bian Liu asked He Jin the Imperial GuardianAt once one stood forward saying Give me five thousand veterans and we will break into the palace set up the true heir slay the eunuchs and sweep clean the governmentThen peace will come to the empire The energetic speaker was Yuan Shao son of the former Minister of the Interior Yuan Feng and nephew of Minister Yuan Wei Yuan Shao then held the rank of Imperial CommanderHe Jin mustered five thousand royal guardsYuan Shao put on complete armor and took commandHe Jin supported by He Yu Xun You Zheng Tai and more than thirty other ministers and highrank officials went into the palace and in the hall where lay the coffin of the late Emperor they placed Bian Liu on the throneAfter the ceremony was over and all had bowed before the new Emperor Yuan Shao went in to arrest Eunuch Jian ShuoJian Shuo in terror fled into the palace garden and hid among the shrubs where he was discovered and murdered by Guo Sheng one of the Ten EunuchsThe guards under Jian Shuos command all surrendered Yuan Shao said Their gangs have broken the most opportune moment is now to slay all the eunuchs But Zhang Rang and the eunuchs of the Ten scented the danger and rushed to see Empress HeThey said The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Jian Shuo only he was concerned and no otherNow the Imperial Guardian on Yuan Shaos advice wishes to slay every one of usWe implore your pity O Your Majesty Fear not said Empress He whose son had just become Emperor I will protect you She sent for her brother and said You and I are of lowly origin and we owe our good fortune to the eunuchsThe misguided Jian Shuo is now dead and need you really put all the others to death as Yuan Shao advises And He Jin obeyed her wish He explained to his party saying The real offender Jian Shuo has met his fate and his clan will be punishedBut we need not exterminate the whole party nor injure his colleagues Slay them root and branch cried Yuan Shao or they will ruin you I have decided said He Jin coldly say no more Within a few days He Jin became Chair of the Secretariat and his associates received high officesNow Empress Dong summoned the eunuch Zhang Rang and his party to a council Said she It was I who first brought forward the sister of He JinToday her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends and her influence is enormousWhat can we do Zhang Rang replied Your Highness should administer the state from behind the veil create the late Emperors son Liu Xian a prince give your brother the Imperial Uncle Dong Chong a high rank and place him over the army and use usThat will do it Empress Dong approvedNext day she held a court and issued an edict in the sense proposed She made Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu and Dong Chong General of the Flying Cavalry and she allowed the eunuchs again to participate state affairsWhen Empress He saw this she prepared a banquet to which she invited her rival Empress DongIn the middle of the feast when all were well warmed with wine Empress He rose and offered a cup to her guest saying It is not fitting that we two should meddle in state affairsIn the beginning of the Han Dynasty when Empress Lu laid hands upon the government all her clans were put to deathWe ought to remain content immured in our palaces and leave state affairs to the state officialsThat would be well for the country and I trust you will act thus But Empress Dong only got angry saying You poisoned Lady Wang out of jealousyNow relying upon the fact that your son sits on the throne and that your brother is powerful you speak these wild wordsI will command that your brother be beheaded and that can be done as easily as I turn my hand Empress He in her turn waxed wroth and said I tried to persuade you with fair words why get so angry You low born daughter of a butcher what do you know of offices cried Empress Dong And the quarrel waxed hot The eunuchs persuaded the ladies to retireBut in the night Empress He summoned her brother into the palace and told him what had occurred He went out and took counsel with the principal officers of stateNext morning a court was held and a memorial was presented sayingEmpress Dong being the foster mother of Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu a regional princeonly a collateralcannot properly occupy any part of the Palace She is to be removed into her original fief of Hejian and is to depart immediately And while they sent an escort to remove Empress Dong a strong guard was placed about the Imperial Uncle Dong Chongs dwellingThey took away his seal of office and he knowing this was the end killed himself in his private apartmentsHis dependents who wailed his death were driven off by the guardsThe eunuchs Zhang Rang and Duan Gui having lost their patroness sent large gifts to He Jins younger brother He Miao and his mother Lady Wuyang and thus got them to put in a good word to Empress He so as to gain her protection And so they gained favor once more at courtIn the sixth month of that year the secret emissaries of He Jin poisoned Empress Dong in her residence in the country Her remains were brought to the capital and buried in Wen TombsHe Jin feigned illness and did not attend the funeralCommander Yuan Shao went one day to see He Jin saying The two eunuchs Zhang Rang and Duan Gui are spreading the report outside that you has caused the death of the late empress and is aiming at the throneThis is an excuse for you to destroy themDo not spare them this time or you will pay like Dou Wu and Chen Fan who in the previous reign missed their chance because the secret had not been kept and they paid by their own deathsNow you and your brother have many commanders and officers behind so that the destruction of the eunuchs can be but an easeIt is a heavensent opportunityDelay no further But He Jin replied Let me think it over He Jins servants overheard the discussion and secretly informed the intended victims who sent further gifts to the younger brother He MiaoCorrupted by these he went in to speak with his sister Empress He and said The General is the chief support of the new Emperor yet he is not gracious and merciful but thinks wholly of slaughterIf he slays the eunuchs without cause it may bring about revolution Soon after He Jin entered and told her of his design to put the eunuchs to deathShe argued with him Those officials look after palace affairs and are old servantsTo kill the old servants just after the death of their master would appear disrespectful to the dynastys ancestral temple And as He Jin was of a vacillating mind he murmured assent and left her What about it said Yuan Shao on meeting himShe will not consent what can be done Call up an army and slay them it is imperative Never mind her consent That is an excellent plan said He JinAnd he sent orders all round to march soldiers to the capitalBut Counselor Chen Lin objected Nay do not act blindlyThe proverb says To cover the eyes and snatch at swallows is to fool oneself If in so small a matter you cannot attain your wish with covered eyes what of great affairsNow by virtue of the imperial prestige and with the army under your hand you may do as you please To use such enormous powers against the eunuchs would resemble lighting up a furnace to burn a hairBut act promptly use your powers and smite at once and all the empire will be with youBut to summon forces to the capital to gather many bold persons into one spot each with ones own schemes is to turn our weapons against our own person to place ourselves in the power of anotherNothing but failure can come of it nothing but confusion The view of a mere bookworm said He Jin with a smileThen one of those about He Jin suddenly clapped his hands laughing Solving this issue is as easy as turning over ones handWhy so much talk The speaker was Cao CaoWouldst thou withdraw wicked people from thy princes side Then seek counsel of the wise people of the stateWhat Cao Cao said will be disclosed in later chapters CHAPTER In Wenming Garden Dong Zhuo Denounces Ding Yuan With RedHare Li Su Bribes Lu Bu What Cao Cao said was thisThe eunuch evil is of very old standing but the real cause of the present trouble is in the improper influence allowed them by the emperors and the misplaced favoritism they have enjoyedBut a gaoler would be ample force to employ against this kind of evil and getting rid of the main culprits is quite enough Why increase confusion by summoning troops from the regionsAny desire to slay all of them will speedily become known and the plan will fail Then Cao Cao you have some scheme of your own to further said He Jin with a sneerCao Cao left the meeting proclaiming The one throwing the world into chaos is He Jin Then He Jin sent swift secret letters far and wide to several bases It must be recalled that Dong Zhuo had failed in his attempt to destroy the Yellow Scarves rebellionHe would have been punished if he had not bribed the Ten Eunuchs heavily for their protection Later he obtained the rank of Imperial Protector in the westernmost region of Xizhou and an army of two hundred thousand troops But Dong Zhuo was treacherous and disloyal at heartSo when he received the summons to the capital he rejoiced greatly and lost no time in obeying itHe left a soninlaw Commander Niu Fu to look after the affairs of Xizhou and set out for LuoyangDong Zhuo took with him a huge army and four generalsLi Jue Guo Si Zhang Ji and Fan ChouDong Zhuos adviser and soninlaw Li Ru said Though a formal summons has come there are many obscurities in itIt would be well to send up a memorial stating plainly our aims and intentionsThen we can proceed So Dong Zhuo composed something like thisThy servant knows that the continual rebellions owe their origin to the eunuchs who act counter to all recognized preceptsNow to stop the ebullition of a pot the best way is to withdraw the fire to cut out an abscess though painful is better than to nourish the evilI have dared to undertake a military advance on the capital with thy permission and now pray that Zhang Rang and the other eunuchs be removed for the happiness of the dynasty and of the empire He Jin read this memorial and showed it to his partisansThen said Minister Zheng Tai A fierce wild beast if he comes his prey will be humans He Jin replied You are too timorous you are unequal to great schemes But Lu Zhi also said Long have I known this man in appearance innocent he is a very wolf at heartLet him in and calamity enters with himStop him do not let him come and thus will you avoid chaos He Jin was obstinate and both Zheng Tai and Lu Zhi gave up their posts and retired as did more than half the ministers of state while He Jin sent a warm welcome to Dong Zhuo who soon camped at Shengchi Lake and stationed there without further actionThe eunuchs knew this move was directed against them and recognized that their only chance for safety was to strike the first blowSo they first hid a band of fifty armed ruffians at the Gate of Grand Virtue in the Palace of Happiness then they went in to see Empress He They said The General feigning to act under command has called up armies to the capital to destroy usWe pray you Your Majesty pity and save us Go to the General and confess your faults said the EmpressIf we did then should we be cut to mincemeatRather summon the General into your presence and command him to ceaseIf he will not then we pray but die in your presence The Empress issued the requisite command and He Jin was just going to her when Counselor Chen Lin advised him not to enter saying The eunuchs are certainly behind the order and mean your harm But He Jin could only see the command of the Empress and was blind to all elseOur plot is no longer a secret said Yuan Shao still you may go if you are ready to fight your way in Get the eunuchs out first said Cao Cao Silly children said He JinWhat can they do against the man who holds the forces of the empire in the palm of his hand Yuan Shao said If you will go then we will come as a guard just as a precaution Whereupon both Yuan Shao and Cao Cao chose five hundred best men under their command at whose head they placed a brother of Yuan Shao named Yuan ShuYuan Shu clad in mail drew up his troops outside the palace entrance while Yuan Shao and Cao Cao holding swords went as escortWhen He Jin neared the palace the eunuchs said The orders are to admit the Imperial Guardian and none other So the escort was detained outsideHe Jin went in proudlyAt the Gate of Grand Virtue he was met by Zhang Rang and Duan Gui and their followers quickly closed in around him He Jin began to feel alarmedThen Zhang Rang in a harsh voice began to revile him What crime had Empress Dong committed that she should have been put to deathAnd when the Mother of the Country was buried who feigned sickness and did not attendWe raised you and your paltry huckstering family to all the dignity and wealth you have and this is your gratitude You would slay usYou call us sordid and dirty who is the cleaner He Jin was panic stricken and looked about for a way to escape but the eunuchs closed him in and then the assassins appeared and cut He Jin into halvesClosing the days of the Hans and the years of their rule were near spent Stupid and tactless was He Jin yet stood he highest in office Many were they who advised him but he was deaf as he heard not Wherefore fell he a victim under the swords of the eunuchs So He Jin died Yuan Shao and Cao Cao waited longBy and by impatient at the delay they called through the gate Thy carriage waits O General For reply the head of He Jin was flung over the wall A decree was proclaimed He Jin has contemplated treachery and therefore has been slainIt pardons his adherents Yuan Shao shouted The eunuchs have slain the High MinisterLet those who will slay this wicked party come and help me Then one of He Jins generals Wu Kuang set fire to the gateYuan Shu at the head of his guards burst in and fell to slaying the eunuchs without regard to age or rankYuan Shao and Cao Cao broke into the inner part of the palaceFour of the eunuchsZhao Zhong Cheng Kuang Xia Yun and Guo Shengfled to the Blue Flower Lodge where they were hacked to piecesFire raged destroying the buildingsFour of the Ten Regular AttendantsZhang Rang Duan Gui Cao Jie and Hou Lanled by Zhang Rang carried off the Empress Emperor Bian and Prince Xian of Chenliu toward the north palaceLu Zhi since he had resigned office was at home but hearing of the revolution in the Palace he donned his armor took his spear and prepared to fightHe saw the eunuch Duan Gui hurrying the Empress along and called out You rebel how dare you abduct the Empress The eunuch fledThe Empress leaped out of a window and was taken to a place of safetyGeneral Wu Kuang burst into one of the inner halls where he found He Miao sword in handYou also were in the plot to slay your own brother cried Wu KuangYou shall die with the others Let us kill the plotter against his elder brother cried manyHe Miao looked around his enemies hemmed him in on every sideHe was hacked to piecesYuan Shu bade his soldiers scatter and seek out all the families of the eunuchs sparing none In that slaughter many beardless men were killed in errorCao Cao set himself to extinguish the fires He then begged Empress He to undertake the direction of affairs and soldiers were sent to pursue Zhang Rang and rescue the young Emperor and the young Prince of ChenliuMeanwhile Zhang Rang and Duan Gui had hustled away the Emperor and the Prince They burst through the smoke and fire and traveled without stopping till they reached the Beimang Hills It was then the third watch They heard a great shouting behind them and saw soldiers in pursuitTheir leader Min Gong a commander in Henan was shouting Traitors stop stop Zhang Rang seeing that he was lost jumped into the river where he was drownedThe two boys ignorant of the meaning of all this confusion and terrified out of their senses dared not utter a cry they crept in among the rank grass on the river bank and hidThe soldiers scattered in all directions but failed to find themSo they remained till the fourth watch shivering with cold from the drenching dew and very hungryThey lay down in the thick grass and wept in each others arms silently lest any one should discover themThis is no a place to stay in said Prince Xian we must find some way out So the two children knotted their clothes together and managed to crawl up the bankThey were in a thicket of thorn bushes and it was quite dark They could not see any pathThey were in despair when all at once millions of fireflies sprang up all about them and circled in the air in front of the EmperorGod is helping us said Prince XianThey followed whither the fireflies led and gradually got into a roadThey walked till their feet were too sore to go further when seeing a heap of straw near the road they crept to it and lay downThis heap of straw was close to a farm houseIn the night as the farmer was sleeping he saw in a vision two bright red suns drop behind his dwelling Alarmed by the portent he hastily dressed and went forth to look about him Then he saw a bright light shooting up from a heap of straw He hastened thither and then saw two youths lying behind itTo what household do you belong young gentlemen asked the farmerThe Emperor was too frightened to reply but his companion said He is the Emperor There was a revolution in the palace and we ran awayI am his brother Prince of Chenliu The farmer bowed again and again and said My name is Sui Lie My brother Sui Yi is the former minister of the interior My brother was disgusted with the behavior of the eunuchs and so resigned and hid away here The two lads were taken into the farm and their host on his knees served them with refreshmentIt has been said that Min Gong had gone in pursuit of Eunuch Duan GuiBy and by Min Gong overtook Duan Gui and cried Where is the Emperor He disappearedI do not know where he is Min Gong slew Duan Gui and hung the bleeding head on his horses neck Then he sent his troops searching in all directions and he rode off by himself on the same quest Presently he came to the farmSui Lie seeing what hung on his horses neck questioned him and satisfied with his story led him to the Emperor The meeting was affecting all were moved to tearsThe state cannot be without its ruler said Min GongI pray Your Majesty return to the city At the farm they had but one sorry nag and this they saddled for the EmperorThe young Prince was taken on Min Gongs charger And thus they left the farmNot beyond one mile from the farm they fell in with other officials and several hundred guards and soldiers made up an imposing cavalcade In the cavalcade were Wang Yun Minister of the Interior Yang Biao Regent Marshal Chunyu Qiong Commander of the Left Army Zhao Meng Commander of the Right Army Bao Xin Commander of the Rear Army and Yuan Shao Commander of the Central ArmyTears were shed freely as the ministers met their EmperorA man was sent on in front to the capital there to expose the head of Eunuch Duan Gui As soon as they could they placed the Emperor on a better steed and the young Prince had a horse to himself Thus the Emperor returned to Luoyang and so it happened after all as the street childrens ditty ranThough the emperor doesnt rule though the prince no office fills Yet a brilliant cavalcade comes along from Beimang HillsThe cavalcade had not proceeded far when they saw coming towards them a large body of soldiers with fluttering banners hiding the sun and raising a huge cloud of dustThe officials turned pale and the Emperor was greatly alarmed Yuan Shao rode out in advanceWho are you said Yuan ShaoFrom under the shade of an embroidered banner rode out a general saying Do you have the Emperor The Emperor was too panic stricken to respond but the Prince of Chenliu rode to the front and cried Who are you Dong Zhuo Imperial Protector of Xizhou Have you come to protect the Chariot or to steal it said Prince XianI have come to protect said Dong ZhuoIf that is so the Emperor is here why do you not dismount Dong Zhuo hastily dismounted and made obeisance on the left of the road Then Prince Xian spoke graciously to himFrom first to last the Prince had carried himself most perfectly so that Dong Zhuo in his heart admired his behavior and then arose the first desire to set aside the Emperor in favor of the Prince of ChenliuThey reached the Palace the same day and there was an affecting interview with Empress HeBut when they had restored order in the palace the Imperial Hereditary Seal the special seal of the Emperor was missingDong Zhuo camped without the walls but every day he was to be seen in the streets with an escort of mailed soldiers so that the common people were in a state of constant trepidationHe also went in and out of the Palace careless of all the rules of proprietyImperial Commander Bao Xin spoke of Dong Zhuos behavior to Yuan Shao saying This man harbors some evil design and should be removed Nothing can he done till the government is more settled said Yuan ShaoThen Bao Xin saw Minister of the Interior Wang Yun and asked what he thoughtLet us talk it over was the replyBao Xin said no more but he left the capital and retired to the Taishan MountainsDong Zhuo induced the soldiers of the two brothers He Jin and He Miao to join his command and privately spoke to his adviser Li Ru about deposing the Emperor in favor of the Prince of Chenliu The government is really without a head there can be no better time than this to carry out your plan Delay will spoil allTomorrow assemble the officials in the Wenming Garden and address them on the subjectPut all opponents to death and your prestige is settled So spoke Li Ru and the words pleased Dong Zhuo mightilySo the next day Dong Zhuo spread a feast and invited many guestsAs all the officers went in terror of him no one dared be absentDong Zhuo himself rode up to the garden last of all and took his place with his sword girded onWhen the wine had gone round several times Dong Zhuo stopped the service and the music and began to speak I have something to say listen quietly all of you All turned towards himThe emperor is lord of all and if he lacks dignity and behaves in an unseemly manner he is no fitting inheritor of the ancestral prerogativesHe who is now on the throne is a weakling inferior to the Prince of Chenliu in intelligence and love of learningThe Prince is in every way fitted for the throne I desire to depose the Emperor and set up the Prince in his placeWhat think you The assembly listened in perfect silence none daring at first to utter a word of dissentBut one dared for suddenly a guest stood up in his place smote the table and criedWho are you that you dare utter such bold wordsThe Emperor is the son of the lawful consort and has done no wrong Why then should he be deposedAre you a rebel The speaker was Ding Yuan Imperial Protector of JingzhouDong Zhuo glared at Ding Yuan roaring There is life for those who are with me death for those against Dong Zhuo drew his sword and made for the objectorBut the watchful Li Ru had noticed standing behind Ding Yuan a particularly dangerous looking henchman of his who was now handling his halberd threateningly and whose eyes were blazing with angerSo Li Ru hastily interposed saying But this is the banquet chamber and state affairs should be left outsideThe matters can be fully discussed tomorrow His fellow guests persuaded Ding Yuan to leave and after his departure Dong Zhuo said Is what I said just and reasonable You are mistaken Illustrious Sir said Lu Zhi Of old Emperor Tai Jia of the Shang Dynasty was unenlightenedWherefore the sage Minister Yi Yin immured him in the Tung Palace till he reformedLater Prince Changyi ascended the throne and in twentyseven days he committed more than three thousand categorical faults Wherefore Regent Marshal Huo Guang declared in the ancestral temple that Prince Changyi was deposedOur present Emperor is young but he is intelligent benevolent and wise He has not committed a single faultYou Sir are an imperial protector of a frontier region and not a metropolitan official and have had no experience in state administrationNeither have you the pure intentions of Yi Yin and Huo Guang which qualified their actionsWithout that justification such an act is presumption Dong Zhuo angrily drew his sword to slay the bold Lu Zhi but two other officials remonstratedMinister Lu Zhi is the cynosure of the whole country and his violent death would stir the hearts of all humans said Court Counselors Cai Yong and Peng BoDong Zhuo then stayed his handThen said Wang Yun A great question like the deposition and substitution of emperors is not one to be decided after a wine party Let it be put off till another time So the guests dispersedDong Zhuo stood at the gate with drawn sword watching them depart Standing thus Dong Zhuo noticed a spearman galloping to and fro on a fiery steed and asked Li Ru who that wasThat is Lu Bu the adopted son of Ding YuanYou must keep out of his way my lord Dong Zhuo went inside the gate so that he could not be seenBut next day a man reported to him that Ding Yuan had come out of the city with a small army and was challenging to a battleDong Zhuo with his army went forth to accept the challengeAnd the two armies were drawn up in proper array Lu Bu was a conspicuous figure in the forefront His hair was arranged under a handsome headdress of gold and he had donned a embroidered thousandflower fighting robe a pheasanttailed helmet and breast plate and round his waist was a gleaming jade belt with a lions head clasp With spear set he rode close behind his master Ding Yuan Ding Yuan riding forth pointing his finger at Dong Zhuo began to revile himUnhappy indeed was this state when the eunuchs became so powerful that the people were as if trodden into the mire under their feet Now you devoid of the least merit dare to talk of deposing the rightful emperor and setting up anotherThis is to desire rebellion and no less Dong Zhuo could not reply for Lu Bu eager for the fight rode straight at himDong Zhuo fled and Ding Yuans army came onThe battle went in Ding Yuans favor and the beaten troops retired ten miles and made another camp Here Dong Zhuo called his officers to a councilThis Lu Bu is a marvel said Dong ZhuoIf he were only on my side I would defy the whole world At this a man advanced saying Be content O my lordI am a fellow villager of his and know him well his bravery his prowess his cupidity and his unscrupulousnessWith this little blarneying tongue of mine I can persuade him to put up his hands and come over to your side Dong Zhuo was delighted and gazed admiringly at the speakerIt was Li Su a general in the Imperial Tiger ArmyWhat arguments will you use with him asked Dong ZhuoYou have a fine horse RedHare one of the best ever bred I must have this steed and gold and pearls to win his heart Then will I go and persuade himHe will certainly abandon Ding Yuans service for yours What think you said Dong Zhuo to his adviser Li RuOne cannot grudge a horse to win an empire was the replySo they grave Li Su what he demandeda thousand ounces of gold ten strings of beautiful pearls a jeweled belt and RedHareand these accompanied Li Su on his visit to his fellow villagerLi Su reached the camp and said to the guard Please tell General Lu Bu that a very old friend has come to visit him He was admitted forthwithWorthy brother have you been well since we last met greeted Li Su while bowingHow long it is since we last saw each other replied Lu Bu bowing in returnAnd where are you now I am a general in the Imperial Tiger ArmyWhen I learned you were a strong supporter of the Throne I could not say how I rejoicedI have come now to present to you a really fine horse a fivehundredmileaday horse one that crosses rivers and goes up mountains as if they were the level plain Its name is RedHareIt will be a fitting aid to your valor Lu Bu bade his guards lead out the horseIt was of a uniform color like glowing sun red not a hair of another colorIt measured ten spans from head to tail and from hoof to neck eight spansWhen it neighed the sound filled the empyrean and shook the oceanMark ye the steed swift and tireless see the dust spurned by his hoofs rising in clouds Now it swims the river anon climbs the hill rending the purple mist asunder Scornful it breaks the rein shakes from its head the jeweled bridle It is as a fiery dragon descending from the highest heavenLu Bu was delighted with the horse and said What return can I hope to make for such a creature What return can I hope forI came to you out of a sense of what is right replied Li SuWine was brought in and they drankWe have seen very little of each other but I am constantly meeting your honorable father said Li SuYou are drunk said Lu BuMy father has been dead for years Not so I spoke of Ding Yuan the man of the day Lu Bu startedYes I am with him but only because I can do no better Sir your talent is higher than the heavens deeper than the seas Who in all the world does not bow before your nameFame and riches and honors are yours for the takingAnd you say you can do no better than remain a subordinate If I could only find a master to serve said Lu BuThe clever bird chooses the branch whereon to perch the wise servant selects the master to serveSeize the chance when it comes for repentance ever comes too late Now you are in the governmentWho think you is really the bravest of all asked Lu BuI despise the whole lot except Dong Zhuo He is one who respects wisdom and reveres scholarship he is discriminating in his rewards and punishmentsSurely he is destined to be a really great man Lu Bu said I wish that I could serve him but there is no way I fear Then Li Su produced his pearls and gold and the jeweled belt and laid them out before his hostWhat is this What does it mean said Lu Bu Send away the attendants requested Li SuAnd he went on Dong Zhuo has long respected your valor and sent these by my handRedHare was also from him But if he loves me like this what can I do in return Li Su said If a stupid fellow like me can be a general in the Imperial Tiger Army it is impossible to say what honors await you I am sorry I can offer him no service worth mentioning Li Su said There is one service you can do and an extremely easy one to perform but you would not render that Lu Bu pondered long in silence then he said I might slay Ding Yuan and bring over his soldiers to Dong Zhuos side what think you of that If you would do that there could be no greater serviceBut such a thing must be done quickly And Lu Bu promised his friend that he would do the deed and come over on the morrow So Li Su took his leaveThat very night at the second watch Lu Bu entered sword in hand into his masters tent He found Ding Yuan reading by the light of a solitary candleSeeing who came in Ding Yuan said My son what is afoot I am a bold hero said Lu BuDont you think I am willing to be a son of yours Why this change Lu Bu As a reply Lu Bu made one cut and Ding Yuans head fell to the earthThen Lu Bu called the attendants and said He was an unjust man and I have slain himLet those who back me stay the others may depart Most ran awayNext day with the head of the murdered man as his gift Lu Bu betook himself to Li Su who led him to Dong ZhuoDong Zhuo received him with a warm welcome and had wine set before himYour coming is welcome as the gentle dew to the parched grass said Dong ZhuoLu Bu made Dong Zhuo seat himself and then made an obeisance saying Pray let me bow to you as my adopted father Dong Zhuo gave his newly won ally gold and armor and silken robes and spread the feast of welcome They then separatedThence Dong Zhuos power and influence increased rapidly He gave the lordship of Hu  and the rank Commander of the Left Army to his brother Dong Min He appointed Lu Bu Lord of Luoyang Commander of Capital District and Commander of the Right Army Dong Zhuo made himself Commander of the Central ArmyThe adviser Li Ru never ceased from urging him to carry out the design of deposing the young EmperorThe now allpowerful Dong Zhuo prepared a banquet in the capital at which all the officers of state were guests He also bade Lu Bu post a company of armed men right and left ready for action The feast began and several courses were served with nothing to distinguish that banquet from any otherThen suddenly the host arose and drew his sword saying He who is above us being weak and irresolute is unfit for the duties of his high placeWherefore I as of old did Yi Yin and Huo Guang will set aside this Emperor giving him the title of Prince of Hongnong and I will place on the throne the present Prince of Chenliu And those who do not support me will suffer death Fear seized them in its grip and they were silent all but Yuan Shao who said The Emperor was innocent of any fault and to set him aside in favor of a commoner was rebellion and nothing else The empire is in my hands cried Dong Zhuo and when I choose to do this thing who will dare say nay Think you my sword lacks an edge If your sword is sharp mine is never blunt said Yuan Shao as his sword flashed out of the sheathThe two men stood face to face amid the feastersWhen Ding Yuan by treacherous murder died The loss was great to Yuan Shaos sideThe fate of Yuan Shao will be disclosed in later chapters CHAPTER  The Deposition Of The Emperor Prince Of Chenliu Becomes Emperor Schemes Against Dong Zhuo Cao Cao Presents A SwordDong Zhuo was on the point of slaying Yuan Shao but Li Ru checked him saying You must not kill rashly while the business hangs in the balance Yuan Shao his sword still unsheathed left the assemblyHe hung up the seals of his office at the east gate and went to Jizhou RegionDong Zhuo said to Imperial Guardian Yuan Wei Your nephew behaved improperly but I pardon him for your sake what think you of my scheme What you think is right was the replyIf any one opposes the great scheme he will be dealt with by military law said Dong ZhuoThe ministers thoroughly dreaded promised obedience and the feast came to an endDong Zhuo asked Counselor Zhou Bi and Commandant Wu Qiong what they thought of the flight of Yuan ShaoZhou Bi said He left in a state of great angerIn such a state of excitement much harm may ensue to the present state of affairs especially as the Yuan family have been noted for their high offices for four generations and their proteges and dependents are everywhereIf they assemble bold spirits and call up their clients all the valiant warriors will be in arms and the east region of the Huashang Mountains will be lost You would better pardon Yuan Shao and give him a postHe will be glad at being forgiven and will do no harm Wu Qiong said Yuan Shao is fond of scheming but he fails in decision and so is not to be fearedBut it would be well to give him rank and thus win popular favor Dong Zhuo followed this advice and thereupon sent a messenger to offer Yuan Shao the governorship of BohaiOn the first day of the ninth month the Emperor was invited to proceed to the Hall of Virtue where was a great assembly of officialsThere Dong Zhuo sword in hand faced the gathering and said The Emperor is a weakling unequal to the burden of ruling this landNow listen ye to the document I have prepared And Li Ru read as followsThe dutiful Emperor Ling too soon left his peopleThe emperor is the cynosure of all the people of this landUpon the present Emperor Bian the Heaven has conferred but small gifts in dignity and deportment he is deficient and in mourning he is remiss Only the most complete virtue can grace imperial dignityEmpress He has trained him improperly and the whole state administration has fallen into confusionEmpress Dong died suddenly and no one knew whyThe doctrine of the three bondsHeaven Earth and Humanand the continuity of Heaven and Earth interdependence have both been injured But Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu is sage and virtuous beside being of handsome exterior He conforms to all the rules of proprietyhis mourning is sincere and his speech is always correctEulogies of him fill the empireHe is well fitted for the great duty of consolidating the rule of Han Now therefore the Emperor is deposed and created Prince of Hongnong and Empress He retires from the administration I pray the Prince of Chenliu to accept the throne in conformity with the decrees of Heaven and Earth the desires of people and the fulfillment of the hopes of humankind This having been read Dong Zhuo bade the attendants lead the Emperor down from the throne remove his seal and cause him to kneel facing the north styling himself faithful servant of the Throne and requesting commandsMoreover Dong Zhuo bade Empress He strip off her royal dress of ceremony and await the imperial commandBoth victims of this oppression wept bitterly and every minister present was deeply affectedOne minister put his discontent into words crying The false Dong Zhuo is the author of this insult which I will risk my life to wipe away And with this he rushed at Dong Zhuo threatening with his ivory baton of officeIt was Secretary Ding GuanDong Zhuo had Ding Guan removed and summarily put to deathBefore his death Ding Guan ceased not to rail at the oppressor nor was he frightened at deathThe rebel Dong Zhuo conceived the foul design To thrust the King aside and wrong his line With folded arms the courtiers stood save one Ding Guan who dared to cry that wrong was doneThen the Emperor designate Prince of Chenliu went to the upper part of the hall to receive congratulationsAfter this the late Emperornow Prince of Hongnong his mother and the Imperial Consort Lady Tang were removed to the Palace of Forever Calm The entrance gates were locked against all comers It was pitifulThere was the young emperor after reigning less than half a year deposed and another put in his placeThe new Emperor was Liu Xian the second son of the late Emperor LingHe was nine years of age five years younger than his deposed brotherThe new reignstyle was changed to Inauguration of Tranquillity the first year Becoming the Prime Minister Dong Zhuo was most powerful and arrogant When he bowed before the Throne he did not declare his name in going to court he did not hasten Booted and armed he entered the reception halls He amassed a wealth exceeding any othersHis adviser Li Ru impressed upon Dong Zhuo constantly to employ people of reputation so that he should gain public esteemSo when they told him Cai Yong was a man of talent Dong Zhuo summoned him But Cai Yong would not goDong Zhuo sent a message to him that if he did not come he and his whole clan should be exterminatedThen Cai Yong gave in and appearedDong Zhuo was very gracious to him and promoted him thrice in a month Cai Yong became High Minister Such was the generosity of the tyrantMeanwhile the deposed ruler his mother and his consort were immured in the Palace of Forever Calm and found their daily supplies gradually diminishingThe deposed Emperor wept incessantlyOne day a pair of wallows gliding to and fro moved him to verse Spring and the green of the tender grass Flushes with joy as the swallows pass The wayfarers pause by the rippling stream And their eyes will new born gladness gleam With lingering gaze the roofs I see Of the palace that one time sheltered me But those whom I sheltered in all righteousness Lets not stay in silence when the days pass uselessThe messenger sent by Dong Zhuo from time to time to the palace for news of the prisoners got hold of this poem and showed it to his master So he shows his resentment by writing poems ehA fair excuse to put them all out of the way said Dong ZhuoLi Ru was sent with ten men into the palace to consummate the deed The three were in one of the upper rooms when Li Ru arrived The Emperor shuddered when the maid announced the visitors name Presently Li Ru entered and offered a cup of poisoned wine to the EmperorThe Emperor asked what this meantSpring is the season of blending and harmonious interchange and the Prime Minister sends a cup of the wine of longevity said Li RuIf it be the wine of longevity you may share it too said Empress He Then Li Ru became brutally frankYou will not drink asked heHe called the men with daggers and cords and bade the Emperor look at themThe cup or these said he Then said Lady Tang Let the handmaiden drink in place of her lord Spare the mother and her son I pray And who may you be to die for a prince said Li RuThen he presented the cup to the Empress once more and bade her drink She railed against her brother the feckless He Jin the author of all this trouble She would not drinkNext Li Ru approached the EmperorLet me say farewell to my mother begged he and he did so in these lines The heaven and earth are changed Alas the sun and the moon leave their courses I once the center of all eyes am driven to the farthest confinesOppressed by an arrogant minister my life nears its end Everything fails me and vain are my falling tears Lady Tang sangHeaven is to be rent asunder Earth to fall away I handmaid of an Emperor would grieve if I followed him notWe have come to the parting of ways the quick and the dead walk not together AlasI am left alone with the grief in my heart When they had sung these lines they fell weeping into each others arms The Prime Minister is awaiting my report said Li Ru and you delay too longThink you that there is any hope of succor The Empress broke into another fit of railing The rebel forces us to death mother and son and Heaven has abandoned usBut you the tool of his crime will assuredly perish Thereupon Li Ru grew more angry laid hands on the Empress and threw her out of the windowThen he bade the soldiers strangle Lady Tang and forced the lad to swallow the wine of deathLi Ru reported the achievement to his master who bade them bury the victims without the city After this Dong Zhuos behavior was more atrocious than beforeHe spent his nights in the Palace defiled the imperial concubines there and even slept on the Dragon CouchOnce he led his soldiers out of the city to Yangcheng when the villagers men and women were assembled from all sides for the annual spring festival His troops surrounded the place and plundered itThey took away booty by the cart load and women prisoners and more than one thousand severed heads The procession returned to Capital Luoyang and published a story that they had obtained a great victory over some rebelsThey burned the heads beneath the walls and the women and jewelry were shared out among the soldiersA general named Wu Fu was disgusted at this ferocity and sought a chance to slay Dong Zhuo Wu Fu constantly wore a breastplate underneath his court dress and carried in conceal a sharp daggerOne day when Dong Zhuo came to court Wu Fu met him on the steps and tried to stab him But Dong Zhuo was a very powerful man and held Wu Fu off till Lu Bu came to his helpLu Bu struck down the assailantWho told you to rebel said Dong ZhuoWu Fu glared at him and cried You are not my prince I am not your minister where is the rebellionYour crimes fill the heavens and every man would slay youI am sorry I cannot tear you asunder with chariots to appease the wrath of the world Dong Zhuo bade the guards take him out and hack him to piecesWu Fu only ceased railing as he ceased to liveThat loyal servant of the latter days of HanHis valor was high as the Heavens in all ages unequaled In the court itself would he slay the rebel great is his fame Throughout all time will people call him a heroThereafter Dong Zhuo always went well guardedAt Bohai Yuan Shao heard of Dong Zhuos misuse of power and sent a secret letter to Minister of the Interior Wang YunThat rebel Dong Zhuo outrages Heaven and has deposed his rulerCommon people dare not speak of him that is understandable Yet you suffer his aggressions as if you knew naught of them How then are you a dutiful and loyal ministerI have assembled an army and desire to sweep clean the royal habitation but I dare not lightly begin the taskIf you are willing then find an opportunity to plot against this manIf you would use force I am at your command The letter arrived but Wang Yun could see no chance to plot against Dong ZhuoOne day while among the throng in attendance mostly people of long service Wang Yun said to his colleagues This is my birthday I pray you come to a little party in my humble cot this evening We certainly will they cried and wish you long life That night the tables were spread in an inner room and his friends gathered thereWhen the wine had made a few rounds the host suddenly covered his face and began to weepThe guests were aghast Sir on your birthday too why do you weep said they It is not my birthday replied Wang YunBut I wished to call you together and I feared lest Dong Zhuo should suspect so I made that the excuseThis man insults the Emperor and does as he wishes so that the imperial prerogatives are in imminent perilI think of the days when our illustrious founder destroyed the Qin annihilated Chu and obtained the empireWho could have foreseen this day when that Dong Zhuo has subjugated all to his willThat is why I weep Then they all wept with himSeated among the guests however was Cao Cao who did not join in the weeping but clapped his hands and laughed aloud If all the officers of the government weep till dawn and from dawn weep till dark will that slay Dong Zhuo said Cao Cao Wang Yun turned on him angrilyYour forbears ate the bounty of the Hans do you feel no gratitudeYou can laugh I laughed at the absurdity of an assembly like this being unable to compass the death of one manFoolish and incapable as I am I will cut off his head and hang it at the gate as an offering to the people Wang Yun left his seat and went over to Cao CaoThese later days Cao Cao continued I have bowed my head to Dong Zhuo with the sole desire of finding a chance to destroy himNow he begins to trust me and so I can approach him sometimesYou have a sword with seven precious jewels which I would borrow and I will go into his palace and kill himI care not if I die for it What good fortune for the world that this is so said Wang YunWith this Wang Yun himself poured out a goblet for Cao Cao who drained it and swore an oathAfter this the treasured sword was brought out and given to Cao Cao who hid it under his dress He finished his wine took leave of the guests and left the hall Before long the others dispersedThe next day Cao Cao with this short sword girded on came to the palace of the Prime Minister Where is the Prime Minister asked heIn the small guest room replied the attendantsSo Cao Cao went in and found his host seated on a couch Lu Bu was at his sideWhy so late Cao Cao said Dong ZhuoMy horse is out of condition and slow replied Cao Cao Dong Zhuo turned to his henchman Lu BuSome good horses have come in from the westYou go and pick out a good one as a present for him And Lu Bu leftThis traitor is doomed thought Cao CaoHe ought to have struck then but Cao Cao knew Dong Zhuo was very powerful and he was afraid to act he wanted to make sure of his blowNow Dong Zhuos corpulence was such that he could not remain long sitting so he rolled over couch and lay face inwardsNow is the time thought the assassin and he gripped the good sword firmlyBut just as Cao Cao was going to strike Dong Zhuo happened to look up and in a mirror he saw the reflection of Cao Cao behind him with a sword in the hand What are you doing Cao Cao said Dong Zhuo turning suddenlyAnd at that moment Lu Bu came along leading a horseCao Cao in a flurry dropped on his knees and said I have a precious sword here which I wish to present to Your Benevolence Dong Zhuo took itIt was a fine blade over a foot in length inlaid with the seven precious signs and very keena fine sword in very truthDong Zhuo handed the weapon to Lu Bu while Cao Cao took off the sheath which he also gave to Lu BuThen they went out to look at the horse Cao Cao was profuse in his thanks and said he would like to try the horse So Dong Zhuo bade the guards bring saddle and bridleCao Cao led the creature outside leapt into the saddle laid on his whip vigorously and galloped away eastwardLu Bu said Just as I was coming up it seemed to me as if that fellow was going to stab you only a sudden panic seized him and he presented the weapon instead I suspected him too said Dong ZhuoJust then Li Ru came in and they told himCao Cao has no family here in the capital but lodges quite alone and not far away said Li RuSend for him If he comes forthwith the sword was meant as a gift but if he makes any excuses he had bad intentionsAnd you can arrest him They sent four prison warders to call Cao CaoThey were absent a long time and then came back saying Cao Cao had not returned to his lodging but rode in hot haste out of the eastern gateTo the gate commanders questions he replied that he was on a special message for the Prime MinisterHe went off at full speed His conscience pricked him and so he fled there is no doubt that he meant assassination said Li RuAnd I trusted him so well said Dong Zhuo in a rage There must be a conspiracy afootWhen we catch him we shall know all about it said Li RuLetters and pictures of the fugitive Cao Cao were sent everywhere with orders to catch himA large reward in money was offered and a patent of nobility while those who sheltered him would be held to share his guiltCao Cao traveled in hot haste toward Qiao his home countyOn the road at Zhongmou he was recognized by the guards at the gate and made prisoner They took him to the MagistrateCao Cao declared he was a merchant named Huang FuThe Magistrate scanned his face most closely and remained in deep thought Presently the Magistrate said When I was at the capital seeking a post I knew you as Cao CaoWhy do you try to conceal your identity The Magistrate ordered Cao Cao to the prison till the morrow when he could send Cao Cao to the capital and claim the rewardHe gave the soldiers wine and food as a rewardAbout midnight the Magistrate sent a trusty servant to bring the prisoner into his private rooms for interrogationThey say the Prime Minister treated you well why did you try to harm him said MagistrateHow can swallows and sparrows understand the flight of the crane and the wild gooseI am your prisoner and to be sent to the capital for a rewardWhy so many questions The Magistrate sent away the attendants and turning to the prisoner said Do not despise meI am no mere hireling only I have not yet found the lord to serve Said Cao Cao My ancestors enjoyed the bounty of Han and should I differ from a bird or a beast if I did not desire to repay them with gratitudeI have bowed the knee to Dong Zhuo that thereby I might find an opportunity against him and so remove this evil from the stateI have failed for this timeSuch is the will of heaven And where are you going Home to my countyThence I shall issue a summons calling all the bold spirits to come with forces to kill the tyrantThis is my desire Thereupon the Magistrate himself loosened the bonds of the prisoner led him to the upper seat and bowed saying I am called Chen GongMy aged mother and family are in the east county of DongjunI am deeply affected by your loyalty and uprightness and I will abandon my office and follow you Cao Cao was delighted with this turn of affairsChen Gong at once collected some money for the expenses of their journey and gave Cao Cao a different dress Then each took a sword and rode away toward QiaoThree days later at eventide they reached ChenggaoCao Cao pointed with his whip to a hamlet deep in the woods and said There lives my uncle Lu Boshe a swornbrother of my fatherSuppose we go and ask news of my family and seek shelter for the night Excellent said his companion Chen Gong and they rode over dismounted at the farm gate and enteredLu Boshe greeted them and said to Cao Cao I hear the government has sent stringent orders on all sides to arrest you Your father has gone into hiding to ChenliuHow has this all come about Cao Cao told him and said Had it not been for this man here with me I should have been already hacked to pieces Lu Boshe bowed low to Chen Gong saying You are the salvation of the Cao familyBut be at ease and rest I will find you a bed in my humble cottage Lu Boshe then rose and went into the inner chamber where he stayed a long timeWhen he came out he said There is no good wine in the houseI am going over to the village to get some for you And he hastily mounted his donkey and rode awayThe two travelers sat a long time Suddenly they heard at the back of the house the sound of sharpening a knifeCao Cao said to Chen Gong He is not my real uncle I am beginning to doubt the meaning of his going off Let us listen So they silently stepped out into a straw hut at the backPresently some one said Bind before killing eh As I thought said Cao Cao now unless we strike first we shall be taken Suddenly Cao Cao and Chen Gong dashed in sword in hand and slew the whole household male and female in all eight personsAfter this they searched the house In the kitchen they found a pig bound ready to kill You have made a huge mistake said Chen Gong and we have slain honest folks Cao Cao and Chen Gong at once mounted and rode awaySoon they met their host Lu Boshe coming home and over the saddle in front of him they saw two vessels of wine In his hands he carried fruit and vegetables Why are you going Sirs Lu Boshe called to themAccused people dare not linger said Cao Cao But I have bidden them kill a pig Why do you refuse my poor hospitalityI pray you ride back with me Cao Cao paid no heed urging his horse forward But he suddenly drew his sword and rode back after Lu Boshe Who is that coming along called Cao CaoLu Boshe turned and looked back and Cao Cao at the same instant cut Lu Boshe down Chen Gong was frightened You were wrong enough before cried Chen GongWhat now is this When he got home and saw his family killed think you he would bear it patientlyIf he had raised an alarm and followed us we should have been killed To kill deliberately is very wrong said Chen GongI would rather betray the world than let the world betray me was the replyChen Gong only thoughtThey rode on some distance by moonlight and presently knocked up an inn for shelterHaving first fed their horses Cao Cao was soon asleep but Chen Gong lay thinkingI took him for a true man and left all to follow him but he is as cruel as a wolf If I spare him he will do more harm later thought Chen GongAnd Chen Gong rose intending to kill his companionIn his heart lie cruelty and venom he is no true man In nought does he differ from his enemy Dong ZhuoThe further fortunes of Cao Cao will be told in later chaptersCHAPTER  Cao Cao Appeals To The Powerful Lords The Three Brothers Fight Against Lu Bu At the close of the last chapter Chen Gong was about to slay Cao Cao But Chen Gong reflected I joined him to do righteous things Now if I killed him I would only do unrighteousness and the people would condemn meI rather leave in silence Rising from his bed before the sunrise Chen Gong mounted his horse and rode away eastward to his home county of Dongjun Cao Cao awoke with the day and missed his companionThought he Chen Gong thinks me brutal because of a couple of egoistic phrases I used and so he has goneI ought to push on too and not linger here So Cao Cao traveled as quickly as possible toward QiaoWhen he saw his father he related what had happened and said he wanted to dispose of all the family property and enlist soldiers with the moneyOur possessions are but small said his father and not enough to do anything withHowever there is a graduate here one Wei Hong careless of wealth but careful of virtue whose family is very rich With his help we might hope for success A feast was prepared and Wei Hong was invited Cao Cao made him a speech The Hans have lost their lordship and Dong Zhuo is really a tyrant He flouts his prince and is cruel to the people who gnash their teeth with rageI would restore the Hans but my means are insufficientSir I appeal to your loyalty and public spirit Wei Hong replied I have long desired this but so far have not found a person fit to undertake the task Since you Cao Cao have so noble a desire I willingly devote all my property to the cause This was joyful news and the call to arms was forthwith prepared and sent far and nearSo they established a corps of volunteers and set up a large white recruiting banner with the words Loyalty and Honor inscribed thereonThe response was rapid and volunteers came in like rain drops in numberOne day came a certain Yue Jin from Yangping and another Li Dian from Julu These two were appointed to Cao Caos personal staffAnother was one Xiahou Dun from Qiao He was descended from Xiahou Ying of oldXiahou Dun had been trained from his early boyhood to use the spear and the clubWhen only fourteen he had been attached to a certain masterinarms One day one person spoke disrespectfully of his master and Xiahou Dun killed that person For this deed however he had to flee and had been an exile for some timeNow he came to offer his services accompanied by his cousin Xiahou Yuan Each brought a thousand trained soldiersReally these two were brothers of Cao Cao by birth since Cao Caos father was originally of the Xiahou family and had only been adopted into the Cao familyA few days later came Cao Caos two cousins Cao Ren and Cao Hong each with one thousand followersThese two were accomplished horsemen and trained in the use of armsThen drill began and Wei Hong spent his treasure freely in buying clothing armor flags and bannersFrom all sides poured in gifts of grainWhen Yuan Shao received Cao Caos call to arms he collected all those under his command to the number of thirty thousandThen he marched from Bohai to Qiao to take the oath to Cao Cao Next a manifesto was issuedCao Cao and his associates moved by a sense of duty now make this proclamation Dong Zhuo defies Heaven and Earth He is destroying the state and injuring his princeHe pollutes the Palace and oppresses the peopleHe is vicious and cruel His crimes are heaped upNow we have received a secret command to call up soldiers and we are pledged to cleanse the empire and destroy the evildoersWe will raise a volunteer army and exert all our efforts to maintain the dynasty and succor the peopleRespond to this O Nobles by mustering your soldiers Many from every side answered the summons as the following list shows Governor of NanyangYuan Shu Imperial Protector of Jizhou RegionHan Fu Imperial Protector of Yuzhou RegionKong Zhou Imperial Protector of Yanzhou RegionLiu Dai Governor of HeneiWang Kuang Governor of ChenliuZhang Miao Governor of DongjunQiao Mao Governor of ShanyangYuan Yi  Lord of JibeiBao Xin Governor of BeihaiKong Rong Governor of Guangling Zhang Chao Imperial Protector of Xuzhou RegionTao Qian Governor of XiliangMa Teng  Governor of BeipingGongsun Zan Governor of ShangdangZhang Yang Governor of ChangshaSun Jian Governor of BohaiYuan ShaoThese contingents varied in size from ten thousand to thirty thousand but each was complete in itself with its officers civil and military and battleleaders They were heading for Capital LuoyangThe Governor of Beiping Gongsun Zan while on his way with his force of fifteen thousand passed through the county of PingyuanThere he saw among the mulberry trees a yellow flag under which marched a small companyWhen they drew nearer he saw the leader was Liu BeiGood brother what do you here asked Gongsun ZanYou were kind to me once and on your recommendation I was made the magistrate of this county I heard you were passing through and came to salute you May I pray you my elder brother enter into the city and rest your steed Who are these two said Gongsun Zan pointing to Liu Beis brothersThese are Guan Yu and Zhang Fei my sworn brothers Were they fighting with you against the Yellow Scarves rebels asked Gongsun Zan All my success was due to their efforts said Liu BeiAnd what offices do they fill Guan Yu is a mounted archer Zhang Fei is a foot archer Thus are able humans buried said Gongsun Zan sighing Then he continuedAll the highest in the land are now going to destroy the rebellious Dong ZhuoMy brother you would do better to abandon this petty place and join us in restoring the House of Han Why not I should like to go said Liu BeiIf you had let me kill him that other time you would not have this trouble today said Zhang Fei to Liu Bei and Guan YuSince things are so let us pack and go said Guan Yu So without more ado the three brothers with a few horsemen joined Gongsun Zan and marched with him to join the great armyOne after another the feudal lords came up and encamped Their camps extended over seventy miles and moreWhen all had arrived Cao Cao as the head prepared sacrificial bullocks and horses and called all the lords to a great assembly to decide upon their plan of attackThen spoke the Governor of Henei Wang Kuang We have been moved by a noble sense of right to assemble hereNow must we first choose a chief and bind ourselves to obedience Then said Cao Cao For four generations the highest offices of state have been filled by members of the Yuan family and its clients and supporters are everywhere As a descendant of ancient ministers of Han Yuan Shao is a suitable man to be our chief lord Yuan Shao again and again declined this honorBut they all said It must be he there is no other And then he agreedSo the next day a threestory altar was built and they planted about it the banners of all parties in five directions of space And they set up white yaks tails and golden axes and emblems of military authority and the seals of leadership round aboutAll being ready the chief lord was invited to ascend the altar Clad in ceremonial robes and girded with a sword Yuan Shao reverently ascended There he burned incense made obeisance and recited the oathThe House of Han has fallen upon evil days the bands of imperial authority are loosenedThe rebel minister Dong Zhuo takes advantage of the discord to work evil and calamity falls upon honorable families Cruelty overwhelms simple folksWe Yuan Shao and his confederates fearing for the safety of the imperial prerogatives have assembled military forces to rescue the stateWe now pledge ourselves to exert our whole strength and act in concord to the utmost limit of our powers There must be no disconcerted or selfish actionShould any depart from this pledge may he lose his life and leave no posterityAlmighty Heaven and Universal Earth and the enlightened spirits of our forebears be ye our witnesses The reading finished Yuan Shao smeared the blood of the sacrifice upon his lips and upon the lips of those who shared the pledgeAll were deeply affected by the ceremony and many shed tearsThis done the chief lord was supported down from the high place and led to his tent where he took the highest place and the others arranged themselves according to rank and age Here wine was servedPresently Cao Cao said It behooves us all to obey the chief we have this day set up and support the stateThere must be no feeling of rivalry or superiority based upon numbers Yuan Shao replied Unworthy as I am yet as elected chief I must impartially reward merit and punish offensesLet each see to it that he obeys the national laws and the army preceptsThese must not be broken Only thy commands are to be obeyed cried allThen Yuan Shao said My brother Yuan Shu is appointed Chief of the Commissariat He must see to it that the whole camp is well suppliedBut the need of the moment is a van leader who shall go to River Si Pass and provoke a battleThe other forces must take up strategic positions in support Then the Governor of Changsha Sun Jian offered himself for this serviceYou are valiant and fierce and equal to this service said Yuan ShaoThe force under Sun Jian set out and presently came to River Si PassThe guard there sent a swift rider to the capital to announce to the Prime Minister the urgency of the situationEver since Dong Zhuo had secured his position he had given himself up to luxury without stintWhen the urgent news reached the adviser Li Ru he at once went to his master who much alarmed called a great councilLu Bu stood forth and said Do not fear my father I look upon all the lords beyond the passes as so much stubbleAnd with the warriors of our fierce army I will put every one of them to death and hang their heads at the gates of the capital With your aid I can sleep secure said Dong ZhuoBut some one behind Lu Bu broke in upon his speech saying An oxcleaver to kill a chickenThere is no need for the General to go I will cut off their heads as easily as I would take a thing out of my pocket Dong Zhuo looked up and his eyes rested on a stalwart man of fierce mien lithe and supple as a beastHe had round head like a leopard and shoulders like an apesHis name was Hua Xiong of GuanxiDong Zhuo rejoiced at Hua Xiongs bold words and at once appointed him Commander of Royal Cavaliers and gave him fifty thousand of horse and foot Hua Xiong and three other generalsLi Su Hu Zhen and Zhao Cenhastily moved toward River Si PassAmong the feudal lords Bao Xin the Lord of Jibei was jealous lest the chosen Van Leader Sun Jian should win too great honors Wherefore Bao Xin endeavored to meet the foe first and so he secretly dispatched his brother Bao Zhong with three thousand by a bye road As soon as this small force reached the Pass they offered battleFast reacting Hua Xiong at the head of five hundred armored horsemen swept down from the Pass crying Flee not rebel But Bao Zhong was afraid and turned backHua Xiong came on his arm rose the sword fell and Bao Zhong was cut down from his horse Most of Bao Zhongs company were capturedBao Zhongs head was sent to the Prime Ministers palace Hua Xiong was promoted to Commander in ChiefSun Jian presently approached the PassHe had four generalsCheng Pu of Tuyin whose weapon was an ironspined lance with snakeheaded blade Huang Gai of Lingling who wielded an iron whip Han Dang of Lingzhi using a heavy saber and Zu Mao of Wujun who fought with a pair of swordsCommander Sun Jian wore a helmet of fine silver wrapped round with a purple turban He carried across his body his sword of ancient ingot iron and rode a dappled horse with flowing mane Sun Jian advanced to the Pass and hailed the defenders crying Helpers of a villainBe quick to surrender Hua Xiong bade Hu Zhen lead five thousand out against Sun JianCheng Pu with the snaky lance rode out from Sun Jians side and engagedAfter a very few bouts Cheng Pu killed Hu Zhen on the spot by a thrust through the throat Then Sun Jian gave the signal for the main army to advanceBut from the Pass Hua Xiongs troops rained down showers of stones which proved too much for the assailants and they retired into camp at LiangdongSun Jian sent the report of victory to Yuan Shao Sun Jian also sent an urgent message for supplies to the commissaryBut a counselor said to the Controller Yuan Shu This Sun Jian is a very tiger in the eastShould he take the capital and destroy Dong Zhuo we should have a tiger in place of a wolfDo not send him grainStarve his troops and that will decide the fate of that army And Yuan Shu gave ears to the detractor and sent no grain or forage Soon Sun Jians hungry soldiers showed their disaffection by indiscipline and the spies bore the news to the defenders of the PassLi Ru made a plot with Hua Xiong saying We will launch tonight a speedy attack against Sun Jian in front and rear so that we can capture him Hua Xiong agreed and prepared for the attackSo the soldiers of the attacking force were told off and given a full meal At dark they left the Pass and crept by secret paths to the rear of Sun Jians campThe moon was bright and the wind coolThey arrived about midnight and the drums beat an immediate attack Sun Jian hastily donned his fighting gear and rode outHe ran straight into Hua Xiong and the two warriors engagedBut before they had exchanged many passes Li Rus army came up from behind and set fire to whatever would burnSun Jians army were thrown into confusion and fled in disorder A general melee ensued and soon only Zu Mao was left at Sun Jians side These two broke through the Pass and fledHua Xiong coming in hot pursuit Sun Jian took his bow and let fly two arrows in quick succession but both missedHe fitted a third arrow to the string but drew the bow so fiercely that it snapped He cast the bow to the earth and set off at full gallopThen spoke Zu Mao My lords purple turban is a mark that the rebels will too easily recognizeGive it to me and I will wear it So Sun Jian exchanged his silver helmet with the turban for his generals headpiece and the two men parted riding different waysThe pursuers looking only for the purple turban went after its wearer and Sun Jian escaped along a byroadZu Mao hotly pursued then tore off the headdress which he hung on the post of a halfburned house as he passed and dashed into the thick woodsHua Xiongs troops seeing the purple turban standing motionless dared not approach but they surrounded it on every side and shot at it with arrowsPresently they discovered the trick went up and seized it This was the moment that Zu Mao awaitedAt once he rushed forth his two swords whirling about and dashed at the leader But Hua Xiong was too quickWith a loud yell Hua Xiong slashed at Zu Mao and cut him down the horseHua Xiong and Li Ru continued the slaughter till the day broke and they led their troops back to the PassCheng Pu Huang Gai and Han Dang in time found their chief and the soldiers gatheredSun Jian was much grieved at the loss of Zu Mao When news of the disaster reached Yuan Shao he was greatly chagrined and called all the lords to a councilThey assembled and Gongsun Zan was the last to arriveWhen all were seated in the tent Yuan Shao said The brother of General Bao Xin disobeying the rules we made for our guidance rashly went to attack the enemy he was slain and with him many of our soldiersNow Sun Jian has been defeated Thus our fighting spirit has suffered and what is to be done Every one was silentLifting his eyes Yuan Shao looked round from one to another till he came to Gongsun Zan and then he remarked three men who stood behind Gongsun Zans seat They were of striking appearance as they stood there all three smiling cynicallyWho are those men behind you said Yuan ShaoGongsun Zan told Liu Bei to come forward and said This is Liu Bei Magistrate of Pingyuan and a brother of mine who shared my humble cottage when we were students It must be the Liu Bei who broke up the Yellow Scarves rebellion said Cao CaoIt is he said Gongsun Zan and he ordered Liu Bei to make his obeisance to the assembly to whom Liu Bei then related his services and his origin all in full detailSince he is of the Han line he should be seated said Yuan Shao and he bade Liu Bei sitLiu Bei modestly thanked him decliningSaid Yuan Shao This consideration is not for your fame and office I respect you as a scion of the imperial family So Liu Bei took his seat in the lowest place of the long line of lords And his two brothers with folded arms took their stations behind himEven as they were at this meeting came in a scout to say that Hua Xiong with a company of mailclad horsemen was coming down from the Pass They were flaunting Sun Jians captured purple turban on the end of a bamboo pole The enemy was soon hurling insults at those within the stockade and challenging them to fightWho dares go out to give battle said Yuan ShaoI will go said Yu She a renown general of Yuan Shu stepping forwardSo Yu She went and almost immediately one came back to say that Yu She had fallen in the third bout of Hua Xiong Fear began to lay its cold hand on the assemblyThen Imperial Protector Han Fu said I have a brave warrior among my army Pan Feng is his name and he could slay this Hua Xiong So Pan Feng was ordered out to meet the foeWith his great battleax in his hand Pan Feng mounted and rode forthBut soon came the direful tidings that General Pan Feng too had fallenThe faces of the gathering paled at thisWhat a pity my two able generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou are not hereThen should we have some one who would not fear this Hua Xiong said Yuan ShaoHe had not finished when from the lower end a voice tolled I will go take Hua Xiongs head and lay it before you here All turned to look at the speaker He was tall and had a long beard His eyes were those of a phoenix and his eyebrows thick and bushy like silkworms His face was a swarthy red and his voice deep as the sound of a great bellWho is he asked Yuan ShaoGongsun Zan told them it was Guan Yu brother of Liu BeiAnd what is he asked Yuan ShaoHe is in the train of Liu Bei as a mounted archer What An insult to us all roared Yuan Shu from his place Have we no leaderHow dare an archer speak thus before usLet us beat him forth But Cao Cao intervened Peace O Yuan ShuSince this man speaks great words he is certainly valiant Let him tryIf he fails then we may reproach him Hua Xiong will laugh at us if we send a mere archer to fight him said Yuan ShaoThis man looks no common person And how can the enemy know he is but a bowman said Cao CaoIf I fail then can you take my head spoke Guan YuCao Cao bade them heat some wine and offered a cup to Guan Yu as he went out Pour it out said Guan YuI shall return in a little space Guan Yu went with his weapon in his hand and vaulted into the saddleThose in the tent heard the fierce roll of the drums and then a mighty sound as if skies were falling and earth rising hills trembling and mountains tearing asunder And they were sore afraid And while they were listening with ears intent lothe gentle tinkle of horse bells and Guan Yu returned throwing at their feet the head of the slain leader their enemy Hua XiongThe wine was still warm This doughty deed has been celebrated in verseThe power of the man stands first in all the world At the gate of the camp was heard the rolling of the battle drums Then Guan Yu set aside the wine cup till he should have displayed his valor And the wine was still warm when Hua Xiong had been slainCao Cao was greatly excited at this successBut Zhang Feis voice was heard shouting My brother has slain Hua Xiong What are we waiting for Why not break through the Pass and seize Dong ZhuoCould there have been a better time Again arose the angry voice of Yuan Shu We high officials are too meek and yielding Here is the petty follower of a small magistrate daring to flaunt his prowess before usExpel him from the tent I say But again Cao Cao interposed Shall we consider the station of him who has done a great service If you hold a mere magistrate in such honor then I simply withdraw said Yuan ShuIs a word enough to defeat a grand enterprise said Cao CaoThen he told Gongsun Zan to lead the three brothers back to their own camp and the other chiefs then dispersedThat night Cao Cao secretly sent presents of meat and wine to soothe the three after this adventureWhen Hua Xiongs troops straggled back and told the story of defeat and death Li Ru was greatly distressed He wrote urgent letters to his master who called in his trusted advisers to a councilLi Ru summed up the situation saying We have lost our best leader and the rebel power has thereby become very greatYuan Shao is at the head of this confederacy and his uncle Yuan Wei is holder of the office of Imperial Guardianship If those in the capital combine with those in the country we may sufferTherefore we must remove themSo I request you Sir Prime Minister to place yourself at the head of your army and break this confederation Dong Zhuo agreed and at once ordered his two generals Li Jue and Guo Si to take five hundred troops and surround the residence of Imperial Guardian Yuan Wei slay every soul regardless of age and hang the head of Yuan Wei outside the gate as trophyAnd Dong Zhuo commanded two hundred thousand troops to advance in two armies The first fifty thousand were under Li Jue and Guo Si and they were to hold River Si Pass They should not necessarily fightThe other one hundred fifty thousand under Dong Zhuo himself went to Tiger Trap Pass His counselors and commanders Li Ru Lu Bu Fan Chou Zhang Ji and othersmarched with the main armyTiger Trap Pass is fifteen miles from Capital LuoyangAs soon as they arrived Dong Zhuo bade Lu Bu take thirty thousand soldiers and make a strong stockade on the outside of the PassThe main body with Dong Zhuo would occupy the PassNews of this movement reaching the confederate lordsYuan Shao summoned a councilSaid Cao Cao The occupation of the Pass would cut our armies in two therefore must we oppose Dong Zhuos army on the way So eight of the commandersWang Kuang Qiao Mao Bao Xin Yuan Yi Kong Rong Zhang Yang Tao Qian and Gongsun Zanwere ordered to go in the direction of the Tiger Trap Pass to oppose their enemyCao Cao and his troops moved among them as reserve to render help where neededOf the eight Wang Kuang the Governor of Henei was the first to arrive and Lu Bu went to give battle with three thousand armored horsemenWhen Wang Kuang had ordered his army horse and foot in battle array he took his station under the great banner and looked over at his foe Lu Bu was a conspicuous figure in front of the line On his head was a triple curved headdress of ruddy gold with pheasant tails He wore a warring velvetred robe of Xichuan silk embroidered with thousand flowers which was overlapped by golden mail adorned with a gaping animals head joined by rings at the sides and girt to his waist with a belt fastened by a beautiful lionhead claspHis bow and arrows were slung on his shoulders and he carried a long heavy trident halberd He was seated on his snorting steed RedHare Indeed Lu Bu was the man among humans as RedHare was the horse among horsesWho dares go out to fight him asked Wang Kuang turning to those behind himIn response a valiant general from Henei named Fang Yue spurred to the front his spear set ready for battle Lu Bu and Fang Yue metbefore the fifth bout Fang Yue fell under a thrust of the trident halberd and Lu Bu dashed forwardWang Kuangs troops could not stand and scattered in all directionsLu Bu went to and fro slaying all he met He was irresistibleLuckily two other troops led by Qiao Mao and Yuan Yi came up and rescued the wounded Wang Kuang and Lu Bu pulled backThe three having lost many troops withdrew ten miles and made a stockade And before long the remaining five commanders came up and joined themThey held a council and agreed Lu Bu was a hero no one could matchAnd while they sat there anxious and uncertain it was announced that Lu Bu had returned to challenge themThey mounted their horses and placed themselves at the heads of eight forces each body in its station on the high groundAround them was the opposing army in formation commanded by Lu Bu innumerable horse and foot with splendid embroidered banners waving in the breeze They attacked Lu BuMu Shun a general of Governor Zhang Yang rode out with his spear set but soon fell at the first encounter with Lu BuThis frightened the others Then galloped forth Wu Anguo a general under Governor Kong RongWu Anguo raised his iron mace ready at his rivalLu Bu whirling his halberd and urging on his steed came to meet Wu AnguoThe two fought well matched for ten bouts when a blow from the trident halberd broke Wu Anguos wrist Letting his mace fall to the ground he fledThen all eight of the lords led forth their armies to his rescue and Lu Bu retired to his lineThe fighting then ceased and after their return to camp another council metCao Cao said No one can stand against the prowess of Lu Bu Let us call up all the lords and evolve some good planIf only Lu Bu were taken Dong Zhuo could easily be killed While the council was in progress again came Lu Bu to challenge them and again the commanders moved out against himThis time Gongsun Zan flourishing his spear went to meet the enemyAfter a very few bouts Gongsun Zan turned and fled Lu Bu following at the topmost speed of RedHareRedHare was a fivehundredmileaday horse swift as the windThe lords watched RedHare gained rapidly upon the flying horseman and Lu Bus halberd was poised ready to strike Gongsun Zan just behind the heartJust then dashed in a third rider with round glaring eyes and a bristling mustache and armed with a tenfoot octaneserpent halberdStay O twice bastard roared he I Zhang Fei of Yan await you  Seeing this opponent Lu Bu left the pursuit of Gongsun Zan and engaged the new adversary Zhang Fei was elated and he rode forth with all his energiesThey two were worthily matched and they exchanged half a hundred bouts with no advantage to either sideThen Guan Yu impatient rode out with his huge and weighty greendragon saber and attacked Lu Bu on the other flankThe three steeds formed a triangle and their riders battered away at each other for thirty bouts yet still Lu Bu stood firmThen Liu Bei rode out to his brothers aid his double swords raised ready to strike The steed with the flowing mane was urged in at an angle and now Lu Bu had to contend with three surrounding warriors at whom he struck one after another and they at him the flashing of the warriors weapons looking like the revolving lamps suspended at the new yearAnd the warriors of the eight armies gazed rapt with amazement at such a battle But Lu Bus guard began to weaken and fatigue seized himLooking hard in the face of Liu Bei Lu Bu feigned a fierce thrust thus making Liu Bei suddenly draw backThen lowering his halberd Lu Bu dashed through the angle thus opened and got away But was it likely they would allow him to escapeThey whipped their steeds and followed hardThe soldiers of the eight armies cracked their throats with thunderous cheers and all dashed forward pressing after Lu Bu as he made for the shelter of the Tiger Trap Pass And first among his pursuers were the three brothers An ancient poet has told of this famous fight in these lines The fateful day of Han came in the reigns of Huan and Ling Their glory declined as the sun sinks at the close of dayDong Zhuo infamous minister of state pulled down the youthful Bian It is true the new Xian was a weakling too timid for his timesThen Cao Cao proclaimed abroad these wicked deeds And the great lords moved with anger assembled their forcesIn council met they and chose as their oathchief Yuan Shao Pledged themselves to maintain the ruling house and tranquillityOf the warriors of that time matchless Lu Bu was the boldest His valor and prowess are sung by all within the four seasHe clothed his body in silver armor like the scales of a dragon On his head was a golden headdress with pheasant tails About his waist a shaggy belt the clasp two wild beasts heads with gripping jaws His flowing embroidered robe fluttered about his form His swift courser bounded over the plain a mighty wind following His terrible trident halberd flashed in the sunlight bright as a placid lakeWho dared face him as he rode forth to challengeThe bowels of the confederate lords were torn with fear and their hearts trembledThen leaped forth Zhang Fei the valiant warrior of the north Gripped in his mighty hand the long octaneserpent halberd His mustache bristled with anger standing stiff like wireHis round eyes glared lightning flashes darted from them Neither quailed in the fight but the issue was undecidedGuan Yu stood out in front his soul vexed within him His greendragon saber shone white as frost in the sunlight His bright colored fighting robe fluttered like butterfly wings Demons and angels shrieked at the thunder of his horse hoofs In his eyes was fierce anger a fire to be quenched only in bloodNext Liu Bei joined the battle gripping his twin sword blades The heavens themselves trembled at the majesty of his wrathThese three closely beset Lu Bu and long drawn out was the battle Always he warded their blows never faltering a momentThe noise of their shouting rose to the sky and the earth reechoed it The heat of battle ranged to the frozen pole starWorn out feeling his strength fast ebbing Lu Bu thought to flee He glanced at the hills around and thither would fly for shelter Then reversing his halberd and lowering its lofty point Hastily he fled loosing himself from the battle With head low bent he gave the rein to his courser Turned his face away and fled to Tiger Trap PassThe three brothers maintained the pursuit to the Pass Looking up they saw an immense umbrella of black gauze fluttering in the west windCertainly there is Dong Zhuo cried Zhang FeiWhat is the use of pursuing Lu BuBetter far seize the chiefest rebel and so pluck up the evil by the roots And he whipped up his steed toward the PassTo quell rebellion seize the leader if you can If you need a wondrous service then first find a wondrous manThe following chapters will unfold the result of the battleCHAPTER  Burning The Capital Dong Zhuo Commits An Atrocity Hiding The Imperial Hereditary Seal Sun Jian Breaks Faith Zhang Fei rode hard up to the Pass but the defenders sent down stones and arrows like rain so that he could not enter and he returned The eight lords all joined in felicitations to the three brothers for their services and the story of victory was sent to Yuan Shao who ordered Sun Jian to make an immediate advanceThereupon Sun Jian with two trusty generals Cheng Pu and Huang Gai went over to the camp of Yuan ShuTracing figures on the ground with his staff Sun Jian said Dong Zhuo and I had no personal quarrelYet now I have thrown myself into the battle regardless of consequences exposed my person to the risk of wounds and fought bloody battles to their bitter end And why That I might be the means of ridding my country of a rebel and for the private advantage of your familyYet you heeding the slanderous tongue of certain counselor formerly withheld the supplies absolutely necessary to me and so I suffered defeat How can you explain General Yuan Shu confused and frightened had no word to replyHe ordered the death of the slanderer to placate Sun JianThen suddenly they told Sun Jian Some officer has come riding down from the Pass to see you General he is in the camp Sun Jian therefore took his leave and returned to his own camp where he found the visitor was Li Jue one of the much trusted commanders of Dong ZhuoWherefore come you said Sun JianLi Jue replied You are the one person for whom my master has respect and admiration and he sends me to arrange a matrimonial alliance between the two familiesHe wishes that his daughter may become the wife of your son What Dong Zhuo that rebel and renegade that subverter of the throne I wish I could destroy his nine generations as a thankoffering to the empire Think you I would be willing to have an alliance with such a familyI will not slay you as I ought but go and go quickly Yield the Pass and I may spare your livesIf you delay I will grind your bones to powder and make mincemeat of your flesh Li Jue threw his arms over his head and ran out He returned to his master and told him what a rude reception he had met withDong Zhuo asked his adviser Li Ru how to reply to thisLi Ru said Lu Bus late defeat had somewhat blunted the edge of our armys desire for battleIt would be well to return to the capital and remove the Emperor to Changan as the street children had been lately singingA Han on the west a Han on the eastThe deer  will be safe in Changan Li Ru continued If you think out this couplet it applies to the present junctureHalf the first line refers to the founder of the dynasty Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor who became ruler in the western city of Changan which was the capital during twelve reignsThe other half corresponds to Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder who ruled from Luoyang the eastern capital during twelve latter reignsThe revolution of the heavens brings us back to this starting momentThus if you remove to Changan there will be no need for anxiety Dong Zhuo was exceedingly pleased and said Had you not spoken thus I should not have understood Then taking Lu Bu with him Dong Zhuo started at once for Capital LuoyangHere he called all the officials to a great council in the palace and addressed them After two centuries of rule here the royal fortune has been exhausted and I perceive that the aura of rule has migrated to Changan whither I now desire to move the courtAll you would better pack up for the journey Yang Biao Minister of the Interior said I pray you reflect Within that city all is destructionThere is no reason to renounce the ancestral temples and abandon the imperial tombs here I fear the people will be alarmedIt is easy to alarm them but difficult to pacify them Do you oppose the state plans said Dong Zhuo angrilyAnother official Grand Commander Huang Wan supported his colleague In the era of Recommencement  Fan Chong of the Red Eyebrows rebels burned Changan to the ground and reduced the place to broken tilesThe inhabitants scattered all but a fewIt is wrong to abandon these palaces here for a wasteland Dong Zhuo replied The East of the Pass is full of sedition and all the empire is in rebellion The city of Changan is protected by the Yaohan Mountains and the Hangu PassMoreover it is near Longyou whence can be easily brought timber stone brick and building materials In a month or so palaces can be erectedSo an end to your wild words Yet Minister of Works Xun Shuang raised another protest against disturbing the people but Dong Zhuo overbore him alsoHow can I stop to consider a few common people when my scheme affects the empire said Dong ZhuoThat day the three objectorsYang Biao Huang Wan and Xun Shuang were removed from their offices and reduced to the rank of commonersAs Dong Zhuo went out to get into his coach he met two other officers who made obeisance They were the Secretary General Zhou Bi and the Commander of the City Gate Wu Qiong Dong Zhuo stopped and asked them what they wantedSaid Zhou Bi We venture to try to dissuade you from moving the capital to Changan Dong Zhuo replied They used to say you two were supporters of Yuan Shao now he has already turned traitor and you are of the same party And without more ado he bade his guards take both outside the city and put them to deathThe command to remove to the new capital immediately was issuedSpeaking to Dong Zhuo Li Ru pointed out We are short of money and food and the rich people of Luoyang could be easily plunderedThis is a good occasion to link them to the rebels and to confiscate their properties Dong Zhuo sent five thousand troops out to plunder and slay They captured many thousand wealthy householders and having stuck flags on their heads saying they were Traitors and Rebels drove them out of the city and put them to death Their properties were all seizedThe task of driving forth the inhabitants some millions was given to two of Dong Zhuos commanders Li Jue and Guo SiThe people were sent off in bands each band between two parties of soldiers who drove them forward ChanganEnormous numbers fell by the road side and died in the ditches and the escort plundered the fugitives and defiled the womenA wail of sorrow arose to the very skyDong Zhuos final orders as he left Capital Luoyang were to burn the whole city houses palaces temples and everything was devoured by the flamesThe capital became but a patch of scorched earthDong Zhuo sent Lu Bu to desecrate the tombs of the emperors and their consorts for the jewels therein and the common soldiers took the occasion to dig up the graves of officers and plunder the cemeteries of the wealthy The spoil of the city gold and silver pearls and silks and beautiful ornaments filled many cartsWith these and the persons of the Emperor and his household Dong Zhuo moved off to the new capital in the first year of Inauguration of Tranquillity Luoyang being thus abandoned the general of Dong Zhuo at River Si Pass Zhao Cen evacuated that post of vantage which Sun Jian at once occupied Liu Bei and his brothers took Tiger Trap Pass and the confederate lords advancedSun Jian hastened to the late capital which was still in flamesWhen he arrived dense smoke hung all over it and spread for miles around No living thing not a fowl or a dog or a human being remainedSun Jian told off his soldiers to extinguish the fires and set out camping places for the confederate lordsCao Cao went to see Yuan Shao and said Dong Zhuo has gone west we ought to follow and attack his rear without loss of time why do you remain inactive All our colleagues are worn out and there is nothing to be gained by attack said Yuan ShaoCao Cao said This moment was most propitious in the utter confusion that reigned palaces burned the Emperor abducted the whole world upset and no one knowing whither to turn The villain will soon be ended and a single blow could exterminate Dong Zhuo Why not pursue But all the confederate lords seemed of one mind and that mind was to postpone action So they did nothingThose unworthy ones cannot discuss worthy thing cried Cao CaoThen he and his six generalsXiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Cao Ren Cao Hong Li Dian and Yue Jinand ten thousand troops started in pursuit The road to the new capital led through YingyangWhen Dong Zhuo reached it Governor Xu Rong went to welcome the cavalcadeLi Ru said As there is some danger of pursuit it would be well to order the Governor of this place to lay an ambush outside the cityHe is to let the pursuers pass and be ready to cut off their retreat when our army beats them offThat will teach any others not to follow Then Dong Zhuo ordered Lu Bu to command the rear guardVery soon they saw Cao Cao coming up and Lu Bu laughed at his colleagues foresightHe set out his troops in fighting orderCao Cao rode forward crying Rebels abductors drovers of the people where are you going Lu Bu replied Treacherous simpleton what mad words are these Then from Cao Cao army rode forth Xiahou Dun with his spear set and Lu Bu and Xiahou Dun engagedThe combat had hardly begun when Li Ru with a cohort came in from the leftCao Cao bade Xiahou Yuan meet this onslaught However on the other side appeared Guo Si and his company Cao Cao sent Cao Ren against Guo SiThe onrush on three sides was too much to withstand and Lu Bus army was overwhelming so Xiahou Dun had to retire to the main lineThereupon Lu Bus armored troops attacked and completed the defeat The beaten army of Cao Cao turned toward YingyangThey got as far as the foot of a hill in the evening about the second watch and the moon made it as light as day Here they halted to reformJust as they were burying the boilers to prepare a meal there arose a great noise of shouting on all sides and out came the troops of Governor Xu Rong from the ambush fresh to attackCao Cao thrown into a flurry mounted and fled He ran right in the way of the waiting Xu RongThen he dashed off in another direction but Xu Rong shot an arrow after him which struck him in the shoulderThe arrow still in the wound Cao Cao fled for his lifeAs he went over the hill two soldiers lying in wait among the grass suddenly dashed out and wounded his horse which fell and rolled overAnd as he slipped from the saddle he was seized and made prisonerJust then a horseman came riding at full speed and whirling his sword up cut down both the captors and rescued Cao CaoIt was Cao Hong Cao Cao said I am doomed Good Brother go and save yourself My lord mount my horse quickly I will go afoot said Cao HongIf those wretches come up what then said Cao CaoThe world can do without Cao Hong but not without you my lord If I live I shall owe you my life said Cao Cao So he mountedCao Hong tore off his own breastplate gripped his sword and went on foot after the horseThus they proceeded till the fourth watch when they saw before them a broad stream and behind they still heard the shouts of pursuers drawing nearer and nearer This is my fate said Cao Cao I am really doomed Cao Hong helped Cao Cao down from his horseThen taking off his fighting robe and helmet Cao Hong took the wounded man on his back and waded into the streamWhen they reached the further side the pursuers had already gained the bank whence they shot arrows Cao Cao all wet pushed onDawn was near They went on another ten miles and then sat down to rest under a precipiceSuddenly loud shouting was heard and a party of horse appeared It was Governor Xu Rong who had forded the river higher upJust at this moment Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan with several dozens men came alongHurt not my lord cried Xiahou Dun to Xu Rong who at once rushed at him But the combat was shortXu Rong speedily fell under a spear thrust of Xiahou Dun and his troops were driven off Before long Cao Caos other generals arrived Sadness and joy mingled in the greetingsThey gathered together the few hundreds of soldiers left and then returned to LuoyangWhen the confederate lords entered Luoyang Sun Jian after extinguishing the fires camped within the walls his own tent being set up near the Dynastic TempleHis people cleared away the debris and closed the rifted tombsThe gates were barredOn the site of the Dynastic Temple he put up a mat shed containing three apartments and here he begged the lords to meet and replace the sacred tablets with solemn sacrifices and prayersThis ceremony over the others left and Sun Jian returned to his camp That night the stars and moon vied with each other in brightness As Sun Jian sat in the open air looking up at the heavens he noticed a mist spreading over the stars of the Constellation Draco The Emperors star is dulled said Sun Jian with a sighNo wonder a rebellious minister disturbs the state the people sit in dust and ashes and the capital is a waste And his tears began to fallThen a soldier pointing to the south said There is a beam of colored light rising from a well Sun Jian bade his people light torches and descend into the wellSoon they brought up the corpse of a woman not in the least decayed although it had been there many days She was dressed in palace clothing and from her neck hung an embroidered bagOpening this a red box was found with a golden lock and when the box was opened they saw a jade seal square in shape an inch each way On it were delicately engraved five dragons intertwinedOne corner had been broken off and repaired with goldThere were eight characters in the seal style of engraving which interpreted read I have received the command from Heavenmay my time be always long and prosperous Sun Jian showed this to his adviser General Cheng Pu who at once recognized it as the Imperial Hereditary Seal of the EmperorCheng Pu said This seal has a historyIn olden days Bian He saw a phoenix sitting on a certain stone at the foot of the Jing Mountains He offered the stone at court The king of Chu split open the stone and found a piece of jadeIn the twentysixth year of Qin Dynasty  a jade cutter made a seal from it and Li Si the First Emperors Prime Minister engraved the charactersTwo years later while the First Emperor was sailing in the Dongting Lake a terrific storm arrivedThe Emperor threw the seal to the water as a propitiatory offering and the storm immediately ceasedTen years later again when the First Emperor was making a progress and had reached Huaying an old man by the road side handed a seal to one of the attendants saying This is now restored to the ancestral dragon and had then disappearedThus the jewel returned to QinThe next year the First Emperor diedLater Zi Ying the grandson of the First Emperor presented the seal to Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor the founder of the Han DynastyTwo hundred years later in Wang Mangs rebellion the Emperors mother Lady Yuan struck two of the rebels Wang Xun and Su Xian with the seal and broke off a corner which was repaired with goldLiu Xiu the Latter Han Founder got possession of it at Yiyang and it has been regularly bequeathed hereafterI heard this treasured seal had been lost during the trouble in the Palace when the Ten Regular Attendants hurried off the Emperor It was missed on His Majestys returnNow my lord has it and certainly will come to the imperial dignity But you must not remain here in the northQuickly go home Changsha south of the Great River where you can lay plans for the accomplishment of the great design Your words exactly accord with my thoughts said Sun JianTomorrow I will make an excuse that I am unwell and get away The soldiers were told to keep the discovery a secret But one among them was a compatriot of the elected chief of the confederacyYuan Shao He thought this might be of great advantage to him so he stole away out of the camp and betrayed his masterHe went to Yuan Shaos camp informed the secret and received a liberal reward Yuan Shao kept the informant in his own campNext morning Sun Jian came to take leave saying  I am rather unwell and wish to return to Changsha Yuan Shao laughed saying I know what you are suffering from it is called the Imperial Hereditary Seal This was a shock to Sun Jian and he paled but said Whence these words Yuan Shao said The armies were raised for the good of the state and to relieve it from oppressionThe seal is state property and since you have got hold of it you should publicly hand it over to me as chief When Dong Zhuo has been slain it must go back to the governmentWhat do you mean by concealing it and going away How could the seal get into my hands said Sun JianWhere is the article out of the well I have it not why harass me thus Quickly produce it or it will be the worst for you Sun Jian pointing toward the heavens as an oath said If I have this jewel and am hiding it myself may my end be unhappy and my death violent The lords all said After an oath like this we think he cannot have it Then Yuan Shao called out his informantWhen you pulled that thing out of the well was this man there asked he of Sun JianSun Jians anger burst forth and he sprang forward to kill the manYuan Shao also drew his sword saying You touch that soldier and it is an insult to me Behind Sun Jian Generals Cheng Pu Huang Gai and Han Dang stepped forth behind Yuan Shao Generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou were ready to act In a moment on all sides swords flew from their scabbardsBut the confusion was stayed by the efforts of the others and Sun Jian left the assemblySoon he broke up his camp and marched to his own place Yuan Shao was not satisfiedHe wrote to Jingzhou and sent the letter by a trusty hand to tell Imperial Protector Liu Biao to stop Sun Jian and take away the sealJust after this came the news of the defeat and misfortune of Cao Cao and when he was coming home Yuan Shao sent out to welcome him and conduct him into camp They also prepared a feast to console himDuring the feast Cao Cao said sadly My object was for the public good and all you gentlemen nobly supported meMy plan was to get Yuan Shao with his Henei troops to approach Mengching and my force at Qiao to keep Chenggao while the others of you to hold Suanzao to close the passes of Huanyuan and Daigu and to take possession of the granaries to control the points of vantage and thus to secure the Capital DistrictI planned for Yuan Shu with his Nanyang army to occupy the counties of Danshi and Xilin and go into Wu Pass to help the three supportsAll were to fortify their positions and not fight Advantage lay in an uncertain military force showing the empires possibilities of dealing with the rebellionVictory would have been ours at onceBut then came delays and doubts and inaction and the confidence of the people was lost and I am ashamed No reply was possible and the guests dispersedCao Cao saw that the others mistrusted him and in his heart knew that nothing could be accomplished So he led off his force to YanzhouThen Gongsun Zan said to Liu Bei This Yuan Shao is an incapable and things will turns chaoticWe would better go too So he broke camp and went northAt Pingyuan he left Liu Bei in command and went to strengthen his own position and refresh his troopsThe Imperial Protector of Yanzhou Liu Dai wished to borrow grain of the Governor of Dongjun Qiao MaoBeing denied Liu Dai attacked the camp killed Qiao Mao and took over all his armyYuan Shao seeing the confederacy breaking up also marched away and went east On the way home Sun Jian was passing through JingzhouThe Imperial Protector of Jingzhou Liu Biao was a scion of the imperial house and a native of ShanyangAs a young man he had made friends with many famous persons and he and his companions were called the Eight Wise OnesThe other seven were Chen Xiang from Runan Fan Pang from Runan Kong Yu from Luting Fan Kang from Bohai Tan Fu from Shanyang  Zhang Jian from Shanyang  Cen Zhi from NanyangLiu Biao was friends with all these He had three famous persons who helped him in the government of his regionThey were Kuai Liang and Kuai Yue from Yanping and Cai Mao from XiangyangWhen Yuan Shaos letter detailing the fault of Sun Jian arrived Liu Biao ordered Kuai Yue and Cai Mao with ten thousand soldiers to bar the wayWhen Sun Jian drew near the force was arranged in fighting order and the leaders were in the frontWhy are you thus barring the road with armed troops asked Sun JianWhy do you a servant of Han secrete the Emperors special seal Leave it with me at once and you go free said Kuai YueSun Jian angrily ordered out General Huang GaiOn the other side Cai Mao rode forth with his sword set to strikeBut after a few bouts Huang Gai dealt Cai Mao a blow with the iron whip on the armor just over the heartCai Mao turned his steed and fled and Sun Jian got through with a sudden rushHowever there arose the sound of gongs and drums on the hills behind and there was Liu Biao in person with a large armySun Jian rode straight up to him and bowing low spoke Why did you on the faith of a letter from Yuan Shao try to coerce the chief of a neighboring region You have concealed the state jewel and I want you to restore it was Liu Biaos replyIf I have this thing may I die a violent death If you want me to believe you let me search your baggage What force have you that you dare come to flout me thus And only Liu Biaos prompt retirement prevented a battle Sun Jian proceeded on his wayBut from the rear of the second hill an ambush suddenly discovered itself and Kuai Yue and Cai Mao were still pursuing Sun Jian seemed entirely hemmed inWhat does a man to hold the state jewel for If its possession lead to strifeHow Sun Jian got clear of the difficulty will presently be told CHAPTER Yuan Shao Fights Gongsun Zan At The River Pan Sun Jian Attacks Liu Biao Across The Great River At the close of the last chapter Sun Jian was surrounded However aided by Cheng Pu Huang Gai and Han Dang he eventually fought his way through though with the loss of more than half his troops Sun Jian he returned to the South Land southeast of the Great River Henceforward Sun Jian and Liu Biao were open enemiesYuan Shao was in HeneiBeing short of supplies he sent to borrow from the Imperial Protector of Jizhou Han Fu whence he obtained the wherewithal to support his armyThen one of Yuan Shaos advisers Peng Ji said to him You are really the strongest power here about why then depend upon another for foodJizhou is rich and wide why not seize it I have no good plan replied Yuan ShaoYou could secretly send a letter to Gongsun Zan asking him to attack promising him your supportImperial Protector Han Fu of Jizhou being incapable must ask you to take over his region and you will get it without lifting a finger So the letter was sentWhen Gongsun Zan saw therein the proposal to make a joint attack and divide the territory he agreed to give his helpIn the meantime Yuan Shao had sent to warn Han Fu of Gongsun Zans threatHan Fu sought advice from Advisers Xun Chang and Xin Ping Xun Chang said Governor Gongsun Zan of Beiping is commanding a huge and strong armyIf he came to attack us we could not stand against him especially if he had the help of Liu Bei and his brothersAt present Yuan Shao is bolder than most and he has many able and famous leaders under him You cannot do better than ask him to assist in administering this regionYuan Shao will certainly treat you with generosity and you need have no fear from Gongsun Zan Han Fu agreed and sent a message to Yuan Shao by the hand of Guan ChunBut the commander of the palace Geng Wu remonstrated with his master saying Yuan Shao is a needy man with a hungry army and as dependent on us for existence as an infant in arms on its mother Stop the flow of milk and the infant diesWhy should you hand the region over to himIt is nothing less than letting a tiger into the sheepfold Han Fu replied I am one of the clients of the Yuan family and I know the abilities of Yuan Shao which is far better than mineWhy are you all so jealousThe ancients counseled yielding to the sage Geng Wu sighed Jizhou is lost When the news got abroad more than thirty officers of Jizhou left their employment and the cityHowever Geng Wu and Guan Chun hid in the suburbs to await the arrival of Yuan Shao They had not long to waitSome days later Yuan Shao with his soldiers came and Geng Wu and Guan Chun tried to assassinate him with knives This attempt failedYuan Shaos generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou beheaded Geng Wu and Guan Chun instantly Thus both of them died and the object of their hatred entered Jizhou CityYuan Shaos first act was to confer on Han Fu a high sounding title General Who Demonstrates Grand and Vigor Courage in Arms but the administration was entrusted to four of Yuan Shaos confidantsTian Feng Ju Shou Xu You and Peng Jiwho speedily deprived the Imperial Protector of all powerFull of chagrin Han Fu soon abandoned all even his family and rode alone to take refuge with the Governor of Chenliu Zhang MiaoHearing of Yuan Shaos invasion Gongsun Zan sent his brother Gongsun Yue to see the usurper and demand his share of the region I want to see your elder brother himselfHe and I have things to discuss said Yuan ShaoThus Gongsun Yue was sent backBut after traveling some fifteen miles on the homeward road Gongsun Yue saw a group of soldiers appear We are guards of Prime Minister Dong Zhuo cried the soldiersInstantly Gongsun Yue was killed by a flight of arrowsThose of Gongsun Yues followers who escaped carried the news to their late masters brotherGongsun Zan was very angry and said Yuan Shao prevailed on me to attack and now he has taken possessionAlso he pretends the murderers of my brother were not his people Shall I not avenge my brothers injury Gongsun Zan brought up all his force to the attackLearning the movement Yuan Shao sent out his army and they met at River Pan They halted on opposite sides of the river over which was a bridgeGongsun Zan took his station on the bridge and cried to his enemy Renegade how dared you mislead me Yuan Shao rode to the other end of the bridge and pointing at Gongsun Zan replied Han Fu yielded place to me because he was unequal to the ruleWhat concern is it of yours Gongsun Zan replied Formerly you were regarded as loyal and public spirited and we chose you chief of the confederacyNow your deeds prove you cruel and base and wolfhearted in behaviorHow can you look the world in the face Who will capture him cried Yuan Shao in a rageAt once Wen Chou rode out with his spear setGongsun Zan rode down the bridge to the enemys side where the two engagedTen bouts showed Gongsun Zan the terrible power of Wen Chou and so he drew offThe enemy came onGongsun Zan took refuge within his formation but Wen Chou cut his way in and rode this way and that slaying right and leftThe four best of Gongsun Zans generals offered joint battle but one fell under the first stroke of the doughty warrior and the other three fledWen Chou followed clearing through to the rear of the army Gongsun Zan made for the mountains Wen Chou forced his horse to its utmost pace crying hoarsely Down Dismount and surrender Gongsun Zan fled for lifeHis bow and quiver dropped from his shoulders his helmet fell off and his hair streamed straight behind him as he rode in and out between the sloping hillsThen his steed stumbled and he was thrown rolling over and over to the foot of the slopeWen Chou was now very near and poising his spear for the thrustThen suddenly came out from the shelter of a grassy mound on the left a general of youthful mien but sitting his steed bravely and holding a sturdy spear He rode directly at Wen Chou and Gongsun Zan crawled up the slope to look on The new warrior was of middle height with bushy eyebrows and large eyes a broad face and a heavy jowl a youth of commanding presence The two exchanged some fifty bouts and yet neither had the advantageThen Gongsun Zans rescue force came along and Wen Chou turned and rode awayThe youth did not pursueGongsun Zan hurried down the hill and asked the young fellow who he wasHe bowed low and replied My name is Zhao Yun from ChangshanI first served Yuan Shao but when I saw that he was disloyal to his prince and careless of the welfare of the people I left him and I was on my way to offer service to youThis meeting in this place is most unexpected Gongsun Zan was very pleased and the two went together to the camp where they at once busied themselves with preparations for a new battleNext day Gongsun Zan prepared for fight by dividing his army into two wingsHe had five thousand cavalry in the center all mounted on white horsesGongsun Zan had formerly seen service against the frontier tribes the Qiang Peoples where he always placed his white horses in the van of his army and thus he had won the sobriquet of General Who Commands White HorsesThe tribes held him so much in fear that they always fled as soon as the white horses their sacred creatures appearedOn Yuan Shaos side Yan Liang and Wen Chou were Leaders of the Van Each had one thousand of archers and crossbowmenThey were set out half on either side those on the left to shoot at Gongsun Zans right and those on the right to shoot at his leftIn the center was Qu Yi with eight hundred bowmen and ten thousand of foot and horse Yuan Shao took command of the reserve force in the rearIn this fight Gongsun Zan employed his new adherent Zhao Yun for the first time and as Gongsun Zan did not feel assured of Zhao Yuns good faith put him in command of a company at the rearThe Van Leader was Yan Guang and Gongsun Zan himself commanded the centerHe took his place on horseback on the bridge beside an enormous red standard on which was displayed the word Commanding General in gold embroideryFrom sunrise to noon the drums rolled for the attack but Yuan Shaos army made no moveQu Yi made his bowmen hide under their shieldsThey heard the roar of explosions the whistling of arrows and the rattle of the drums as Yan Guang approached from the other side but Qu Yi and his men lay closer than ever and never stirredThey waited till Yan Guang had got close on them and then as the sound of a bomb rent the air the whole eight hundred men let fly their arrows in a cloudYan Guang was quite taken aback and would have retired but Qu Yi rode furiously toward him whirled up his sword and cut him down So Gongsun Zans army lost that battleThe two wings that should have come to the rescue were kept back by the bowmen under Yan Liang and Wen ChouYuan Shaos troops advanced right up to the bridgeThen Qu Yi rode forward slew the standard bearer and hacked through the staff of the embroidered bannerSeeing this Gongsun Zan turned his steed and galloped away Qu Yi followedBut just as he caught up the fugitive there came prancing forth Zhao Yun who rode directly at him with spear ready to strikeAfter a few bouts Qu Yi was laid in the dustThen Zhao Yun attacked the soldiers and turned the tide Plunging forward on this side dashing in on that he went through as if there were no antagonists and seeing this Gongsun Zan turned and came again into the fight The final victory was on his sideFrom the scouts sent to find out how the battle went Yuan Shao heard the good news of Qu Yis success in slaying the standard bearer capturing the flag and his pursuitSo Yuan Shao took no further care but rode out with his General Tian Feng and a few guards to look on at the enemy and enjoy his victory Ha ha Yuan Shao laughedGongsun Zan is an incapable But even as Yuan Shao spoke he saw in front the redoubtable Zhao YunHis guards hastened to prepare their bows but before they could shoot Zhao Yun was in their midst and men were falling before him wherever he went The others fledGongsun Zans army then gathered round and hemmed in Yuan ShaoTian Feng then said to his master Sir take refuge in this empty building here But Yuan Shao dashed his helmet to the ground crying The brave man rather faces death in the battle than seeks safety behind a wall This bold speech gave new courage to his soldiers who now fought fiercely and with such success that Zhao Yun could nowhere force his way in Yuan Shao was soon reinforced by the arrival of his main body and Yan Liang and the two armies pressed forwardZhao Yun could only just get Gongsun Zan safe out of the press Then they fought their way back to the bridgeBut Yuan Shaos troops still came on and fought their way across the bridge forcing multitudes of their adversaries into the water where many were drowned Yuan Shao was leading in person and his troops still advancedBut not more than two miles for soon a great shouting was heard behind some hills whence suddenly burst out a body of troops led by Liu Bei Guan Yu and Zhang FeiAt Pingyuan they had heard of the struggle between their protector and his enemy Yuan Shao and had at once set out to helpNow the three riders each with his peculiar weapon flew straight at Yuan Shao who was so frightened that his soul seemed to leave his body and fly beyond the confines of heaven His sword fell from his hand and he fled for his lifeHe was chased across the bridge when Gongsun Zan called in his army and they returned to campAfter the usual greetings Gongsun Zan said If you had not come to our help we should have been in very bad case Liu Bei and Zhao Yun were made acquainted with each other and a warm affection sprang up from the very first so that they were always togetherYuan Shao had lost that battle and Gongsun Zan would not risk another They strengthened their defenses and the armies lay inactive for over a monthIn the meantime news of the fighting had reached Capital Changan and Dong Zhuo was toldHis adviser Li Ru went to see his master and said The two active leaders of today are Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan who are at grips at River PanPretend you have an imperial command to make peace between them and both will support you out of gratitude for your intervention Good said Dong ZhuoSo he sent the Imperial Guardian Ma Midi and the Minister of the Palace Bureau Zhao Qi on the missionWhen these men were arriving the North of Yellow River Yuan Shao sent out to welcome them thirty miles from his headquarters and received the imperial command with the greatest respectThen the two officers went to Gongsun Zan and made known their errand Gongsun Zan sent letters to his adversary proposing friendshipThe two emissaries returned to report their task accomplished Gongsun Zan drew off his armyHe also sent up a memorial eulogizing Liu Bei who was raised to the rank of Governor of PingyuanThe farewell between Liu Bei and Zhao Yun was affecting They held each others hands a long time their eyes streaming with tears and could not tear themselves apartZhao Yun said with a sob I used to think Gongsun Zan a true hero but  see now that he is no different from Yuan ShaoThey are both alike But you are now in his service we shall surely meet again said Liu BeiBoth men wept freely as they separatedNow Yuan Shu in Nanyang hearing that his brother had come into Jizhou sent to beg a thousand horsesThe request was refused and enmity sprang up between the brothersYuan Shu also sent to Jingzhou to borrow grain which Imperial Protector Liu Biao would not sendIn his resentment Yuan Shu wrote to Sun Jian trying to get him to attack Liu Biao The letter ran like thisWhen Liu Biao stopped you on your way home it was at the instigation of my brotherNow the same two have planned to fall upon your territories southeast of the Great River wherefore you should at once strike at Liu BiaoI will capture my brother for you and both resentments will be appeasedYou will get Jingzhou and I shall have Jizhou I cannot bear Liu Biao said Sun Jian as he finished reading this letterHe certainly did bar my way home and I may wait many years for my revenge if I let slip this chance He called a councilYou may not trust Yuan Shu he is very deceitful said Cheng PuI want revenge on my own part what care I for his help said Sun JianHe dispatched Huang Gai to prepare a river fleet arm and provision them Big warships were to take horses on board The force soon set outNews of these preparations came to Liu Biao and he hastily summoned his advisers and warriorsKuai Liang told him to be free from anxiety and said Put General Huang Zu at the head of the Jiangxia army to make the first attack and you Sir support him with the forces from XiangyangLet Sun Jian come riding the rivers and straddling the lakes what strength will he have left after arriving here So Liu Biao bade Huang Zu prepare to march and a great army was assembledHere it may be said that Sun Jian had four sons all the issue of his wife who was of the Wu familyTheir names in order were Sun Ce Sun Quan Sun Yi and Sun KuangSun Jian had a second wife who was the sister of his first wife And the second wife bore him a son and a daughter the former called Sun Lang the latter Sun RenSun Jian had also adopted a son from the Yu family named Sun ShaoAnd he had a younger brother named Sun Jing As Sun Jian was leaving on this expedition his brother Sun Jing with all his six sons stood in front of Sun Jians steed and dissuaded him saying Dong Zhuo is the real ruler of the state for the Emperor is a weakling The whole country is in rebellion every one is scrambling for territoryOur area is comparatively peaceful and it is wrong to begin a war merely for the sake of a little resentmentI pray you Brother think before you start Sun Jian replied Brother say no moreI desire to make my strength felt throughout the empire and shall I not avenge my injuries Then father if you must go let me accompany you said the eldest son Sun CeThis request was granted and father and son embarked to go to ravage the city of FankouNow Huang Zu had placed archers and crossbowmen along the river bank When the ships approached a flight of arrows met themSun Jian ordered his troops to remain under cover in the ships which then sailed to and fro drawing the fire for three daysSeveral times the ships pretended to land and this drew showers of arrows from the bankAt last the arrows of the defenders were all shot away and Sun Jian who collected them found he had many myriadsThen with a fair wind Sun Jians troops shot them back to the enemyThose on the bank were thrown into great disorder and retiredThe army then landed Two divisions led by Cheng Pu and Huang Gai set out for Huang Zus camp along different roads and between them marched Han DangUnder this triple attack Huang Zu was worsted He left Fankou and hastened to DengchengLeaving the ships under the command of Huang Gai Sun Jian led the pursuing forceHuang Zu came out of his city and drew up for battle in the open countryWhen Sun Jian had disposed his army he rode out to the standardSun Ce clad in armor placed himself beside his fatherHuang Zu rode out with two generalsZhang Hu from Jiangxia and Chen Sheng from XiangyangFlourishing his whip Huang Zu abused his enemy You swarm of rebels from ChangshaWhy do you invade the land of a scion of the ruling house Zhang Hu challenged to combat and Han Dang went out to acceptThe two champions fought thirty bouts and then Chen Sheng seeing his fellow general becoming exhausted rode to his aidSun Jian saw Chen Sheng coming laid aside his spear reached for his bow and shot an arrow wounding Chen Sheng in the face He fell from his horse Panic seized upon Zhang Hu at the fall of his comrade and he could no longer defend himselfThen Han Dang with a slash of his sword clove Zhang Hus skull in twainBoth having fallen Cheng Pu galloped up to make prisoner of Huang Zu who threw off his helmet slipped from his steed and mingled for safety among his troopsSun Jian led on the attack and drove the enemy to the Han River where he ordered Huang Gai to move the fleet upriver and moor thereHuang Zu led his defeated troops back and told Liu Biao saying Sun Jian was too strong for my army Kuai Liang was called in to advise and he said Our newly defeated soldiers have no heart for fighting nowTherefore we must fortify our position while we seek help from Yuan ShaoThen we can extricate ourselves A stupid move said Cai MaoThe enemy is at the city gates shall we fold our hands and wait to be slainGive me troops and I will go out and fight to the finish So Cai Mao was placed in command of ten thousand troops and went out to the Xian Hills where he drew up his battle lineSun Jian led the invaders now flushed with successWhen Cai Mao approached Sun Jian looked at him and said He is brotherinlaw to Liu Biao who will capture him Cheng Pu set his ironspined lance and rode outAfter a few bouts Cai Mao turned and fledSun Jians army rode in and slaughtered till corpses filled the countryside and Cai Mao took refuge in XiangyangKuai Liang said Cai Mao ought to be put to death by military lawThis defeat was due to his obstinacy But Liu Biao was unwilling to punish the brother of his newly wedded wifeSun Jian surrounded Xiangyang and assailed the walls dailyOne day a fierce gale sprang up and the pole bearing his standard was broken Very inauspicious said Han DangWe ought to go back Sun Jian said I have won every battle and the city is on the point of fallingShall I return because the wind breaks a flagstaff He flouted the advice and attacked the walls still more vigorously Within the city the defenders had seen an omenKuai Liang told Liu Biao Last night I saw that a great star fall into the sky corresponding to Sun Jians territoryI calculated that it inferred the fall of Sun Jian Then Kuai Liang advised Liu Biao to seek help from Yuan Shao as quickly as possibleSo Liu Biao wrote Then he asked who would undertake to fight his way through the blockade with the letterOne Lu Gong a warrior of great strength offered himself for this serviceKuai Liang said If you undertake this service listen to my advice You will have five hundred soldiers choose good bowmen Dash through the enemys formation and make for Xian HillsYou will be pursued but send a hundred soldiers up the hill to prepare large stones and place a hundred archers in ambush in the woodsThese are not to flee from the pursuers but to beguile them along devious ways round to the place where the boulders have been prepared There stones will be rolled down and arrows shotIf you succeed fire off a series of bombs as a signal and the armies in the city will come out to helpIf you are not pursued get away as fast as possibleTonight will be suitable as there is very little moon Start at dusk Lu Gong having received these directions prepared his force to carry them outAs soon as day began to close in he went quietly out at the east gateSun Jian was in his tent when he heard shouting and a soldier came to report There was a group of horsemen going out from the city Sun Jian at once mounted and rode out with thirty horsemen to discover the causeLu Gongs troops had already hidden themselves in the thick woodsSun Jian rode ahead of his escort and soon he found himself alone and close to the enemyHe called out to them to haltLu Gong at once turned back and came as if to fightBut they had only exchanged a single pass when Lu Gong again fled taking the road among the hillsSun Jian followed but soon lost sight of his foeSun Jian turned up the hill Then the gongs clanged and down the hills fell showers of stones while from among the trees the arrows flew in clouds Sun Jian was hit by several arrows and a huge stone crushed in his head Both he and his steed were killedSun Jian was only thirtyseven years old at his deathHis escort was overpowered and every man of them slain Then Lu Gong let off a series of bombs the sign of success as agreedAt this signal Huang Zu Kuai Yue and Cai Mao led three armies out of the city and fell upon the Changsha troops throwing them into the utmost confusionWhen Huang Gai heard the sound of battle he led up the troops from the shipsHe met Huang Zu and took Huang Zu prisoner after a brief fightCheng Pu set out to bear the sad news to Sun Ce While he was seeking a way out he came across Lu GongCheng Pu at once put his horse at full speed and engaged Lu Gong After a few bouts Lu Gong went down under a spear thrustThe battle became general and continued till daylight broke when each drew off his armyLiu Biao withdrew into the cityWhen Sun Ce returned to the river he heard that his father had perished in the fight and his body had been carried within the enemys wallsHe uttered a great cry and the army joined him with wailing and tearsHow can I return home leaving my fathers corpse with them cried Sun CeHuang Gai said We have Huang Zu as our prisonerLet one enter the city and discuss peace giving up our prisoner for our lords body He had barely finished speaking when an officer in the army Huan Jie offered himself as messenger saying I am an old friend of Liu BiaoI volunteer to take the mission Sun Ce agreed So Huan Jie went and peace was discussedLiu Biao told Huan Jie saying The body is already laid in a coffin and ready to be delivered as soon as Huang Zu returnedLet us both cease fighting and never again invade each others territories Huan Jie thanked him and took his leaveBut as Huan Jie went down the steps Kuai Liang suddenly broke in saying No noLet me speak and I will see to it that not a single enemy can surviveI pray you first put this person to death and then to employ my means Pursuing his enemy Sun Jian dies On a peaceful mission Huan Jie is threatenedThe fate of the ambassador will be disclosed in a later chapter CHAPTER  Wang Yun Prepares The Chaining Scheme Dong Zhuo Rages At Phoenix PavilionThis is what Kuai Liang said Sun Jian is now gone and his sons are but youthsSeize this moment of weakness to break into Changsha and it is yours in one beat of the drumIf you return the corpse and make peace you give them time to grow powerful and evil will ensue to Jingzhou How can I leave Huang Zu in their hands said Liu BiaoWhy not sacrifice this blundering warrior for a region But he is my dear friend and to abandon him is wrong So Huan Jie was allowed to return to his own side with the understanding that Sun Jians dead body should be given in exchange Sun Ce freed his prisoner brought away his fathers coffin and the fighting ceasedSun Jian was interred in the plains of QueWhen the ceremonies were over Sun Ce led his army home againIn Changsha the southern territory of the Great River  Sun Ce set himself to the task of ruling wellBeing humble and generous he invited to his side humans of wisdom and valor and so bore himself that all the best and bravest of the country gathered about himMeanwhile Dong Zhuo at Capital Changan when he heard of the death of the turbulent Sun Jian said An evil that pressed hard upon my heart has been removed He asked what children Sun Jian had left and when they told him the eldest was but seventeen he dismissed all anxiety from his thoughtsFrom this time forward his arrogance and domineering spirit waxed worse and worse He styled himself Imperial Rector a name full of honor and in all his behavior aped imperial stateHe created his younger brother Dong Min Lord of Huazhou and made him Commander of the Left ArmyA nephew Dong Huang was made Court Counselor and placed in command of the Palace Guard and everyone of his clan young or old was ennobledEighty miles from the capital Dong Zhuo laid out a city called Meiwo an exact replica of Changan with its palaces granaries treasuries and magazines and employed a quarter of a million people to build it Here he accumulated supplies sufficient for twenty yearsHe selected eight hundred of the most beautiful maidens and sent them to dwell in his new city The stores of wealth in every form were incalculableAll his family and retainers found quarters in this new cityDong Zhuo visited his city at intervals of a month or so and every visit was like an imperial progress with booths by the roadside to refresh the officials and courtiers who attended him to the northwest Royal Gate and saw him startOn one occasion Dong Zhuo spread a great feast for all those assembled to witness his departure and while it was in progress there arrived a large number of rebels from the north who had voluntarily surrenderedThe tyrant had them brought before him as he sat at table and meted out to them wanton cruelties The hands of this one were lopped off the feet of that one had his eyes gouged out another lost his tongue Some were boiled to deathShrieks of agony arose to the very heavens and the courtiers were faint with terror But the author of the misery ate and drank chatted and smiled as if nothing was going onAnother day Dong Zhuo was presiding at a great gathering of officers who were seated in two long rowsAfter the wine had gone up and down several times Lu Bu entered and whispered a few words in his masters ear Dong Zhuo smiled and said He was always so Take Minister Zhang Wen outside The others all turned paleIn a little time a serving man brought the head of their fellow guest on a red dish and showed it to their host They nearly died with frightDo not fear said Dong Zhuo smilingMinister Zhang Wen was in league with Yuan Shu to assassinate me A letter he wrote fell by mistake into the hands of my son so I have had him put to deathYou gentlemen who have no reason need have no fear The officials hastened to disperseOne of them Minister of the Interior Wang Yun who had witnessed all this returned to his palace very pensive and much distressedThe same evening a bright moonlight night he took his staff and went strolling in his private garden Standing near one of the creeper trellises he gazed up at the sky and the tears rolled down his cheeksSuddenly he heard a rustle in the Peony Pavilion and someone sighing deeplyStealthily creeping near he saw there one of the household singing girls named Diao ChanThis maiden had been brought up in his palace where she had been taught to sing and dance At twentyone she was then just bursting into womanhood a pretty and clever girl whom Wang Yun regarded more as a daughter than a dependantAfter listening for some time Wang Yun suddenly called out What mischief are you up to there you naughty girl The maiden dropped on her knees in terror saying Would thy unworthy handmaid dare to do anything wrong Then what are you sighing about out here in the darkness May thy handmaid speak from the bottom of her heart Tell me the whole truth do not conceal anything And the girl said Thy handmaid has been the recipient of bountiful kindnessShe has been taught to sing and dance and been treated so kindly that were she torn in pieces for her lords sake it would not repay a thousandth partShe has noticed lately that her lords brows have been knit in distress and knows it is on account of the state troubles But she has not dared to askThis evening he seemed more sad than ever and she was miserable on her lords account But she did not know she would be seenCould she be of any use she would not shrink from a myriad deaths A sudden idea came to Wang Yun and he stuck the ground with his staffAnd he said Who would think that the fate of Han lay on your palmCome with me The girl followed him into the houseThen he dismissed all the waiting attendants placed Diao Chan on a chair and bowed before her She was frightened and threw herself on the ground asking in terror what it all meantSaid Wang Yun You can sympathize with the people of Han and the fount of his tears opened afreshMy lord as thy handmaid said just now use her in any way thy handmaid will never shrink said the girlWang Yun knelt saying The people are on the brink of destruction the prince and his officers are in jeopardy and you you are the only saviorThat wretch Dong Zhuo wants to depose the Emperor and not a person among us can find means to stop him Now he has a son a bold warrior it is true but both father and son have a weakness for beauty and I am going to use what I may call the chaining planI shall first propose you in marriage to Lu Bu and then after you are betrothed I shall present you to Dong Zhuo and you will take every opportunity to force them asunder and turn sway their countenances from each other cause the son to kill his adopted father and so put an end to the great evilThus you may restore the altars of the land that it may live againAll this lies within your power will you do it Thy handmaid has promised not to recoil from death itselfYou may use my poor self in any way and I must do my best But if this gets abroad then we are all lost Fear not said she if thy handmaid does not show gratitude may she perish beneath a myriad swords Thank you thank you said Wang YunThen Wang Yun took from the family treasury many pearls and bade a cunning jeweler make therewith a fine golden headdress which was sent as a present to Lu BuHe was delighted and came to thank the donorWhen Lu Bu arrived he was met at the gate by Wang Yun himself and within found a table full of dainties for his delectation He was conducted into the private apartments and placed in the seat of honorLu Bu said I am but a simple officer in the palace of a minister you are an exalted officer of state why am I treated thus Because in the whole land there is no hero your equalPoor Wang Yun bows not to an officers rank poor Wang Yun bows to his ability  This gratified Lu Bu mightily and his host continued to praise and flatter and ply him with wine and to talk of the virtues of the Prime Minister and his henchmanLu Bu laughed and drank huge gobletsPresently most of the attendants were sent away only a few kept to press the guest to drinkWhen the guest was very mellow Wang Yun suddenly said Let the child come in Soon appeared two attendants dressed in white leading between them the exquisite and fascinating Diao ChanWho is this said Lu Bu startled into sobrietyThis is my little girl Diao Chan You will not be annoyed at my familiarity will youBut you have been so very friendly I thought you would like to see her Wang Yun bade Diao Chan present a goblet of wine and her eyes met those of the warriorWang Yun feigning intoxication said My little child begs you General to take a cup or twoWe all depend upon you all our house Lu Bu begged Diao Chan to sit down She pretended to wish to retireHer master pressed her to remain saying that she might do so since the guest was a dear friendSo she took a seat modestly near her masterLu Bu kept his gaze fixed upon the maid while he swallowed cup after cup of wine I should like to present her to you as a handmaid would you accept said Wang Yun The guest started upIf that is so you may rely upon my abject gratitude said Lu BuWe will choose a propitious day ere long and send her to the palace Lu Bu was overjoyedHe could not keep his eyes off Diao Chan and loving glances flashed from her liquid eyesHowever the time came for the guest to leave and Wang Yun said I would ask you to remain the night but the Prime Minister might suspect something Lu Bu thanked him again and again and departedSome few days later when Wang Yun was at court and Lu Bu was absent Wang Yun bowed low before Dong Zhuo and said I wish that you would deign to come to dine at my lowly cottage could your noble thought bend that way Should you invite me I would certainly hasten was the replyWang Yun thanked him Then Wang Yun went home and prepared in the reception hall a feast in which figured every delicacy from land and sea Beautiful embroideries surrounded the chief seat in the center and elegant curtains were hung within and withoutAt noon next day when the Prime Minister arrived Wang Yun met him at the gate in full court costumeWang Yun stood by while Dong Zhuo stepped out of his chariot and Dong Zhuo and a host of one hundred armed guards crowded into the hallDong Zhuo took his seat at the top his suite fell into two lines right and left while Wang Yun stood humbly at the lower end Dong Zhuo bade his people conduct Wang Yun to a place beside himselfSaid Wang Yun The great Prime Ministers abundant virtue is as the high mountains neither the ancient sagesYi Yin and Duke Zhoucould attain thereto Dong Zhuo smiledThey bore in the dishes and the wine and the music began Wang Yun plied his guest with assiduous flattery and studied deferenceWhen it grew late and the wine had done its work Dong Zhuo was invited to the inner chamberSo he sent away his guards and wentHere the host raised a goblet and drank to his guest saying From my youth up I have understood something of astrology and have been studying the aspect of the heavensI read that the days of Han are numbered and that the great Prime Ministers merits command the regard of all the world as when King Shun succeeded King Yao and King Yu continued the work of King Shun all by the strength of their own merits conforming to the mind of Heaven and the desire of people How dare I expect this said Dong ZhuoFrom the days of old those who walk in the way have replaced those who deviate therefrom those who lack virtue have fallen before those who possess itCan one escape fate If indeed the decree of Heaven devolves on me you shall be held the first in merit said Dong Zhuo Wang Yun bowedThen lights were brought in and all the attendants were dismissed save the serving maids to hand the wine So the evening went onPresently Wang Yun said The music of these everyday musicians is too commonplace for your ear but there happens to be in the house a little maid that might please you Excellent said the guestThen a curtain was loweredThe shrill tones of reed instruments rang through the room and presently some attendants led forward Diao Chan who then danced on the outside of the curtain A poem praises herFor a palace this maiden was born So timid so graceful so slender Like a tiny bird flitting at morn Over the dewladen lily buds tender Were this exquisite maid only mine For never a mansion Id pine Another poem runs thusThe music falls the dancer comes a swallow gliding in A dainty little damsel soft as silk Her beauty captivates the guest yet saddens him within For he must soon depart and leave her thereShe smiles no gold could buy that smile no other smiled so No need to deck her form with jewels rareBut when the dance is over and coy glances come and go Then who shall be the chosen of the fairThe dance endedDong Zhuo bade them lead the maiden in and she came bowing low as she approached him He was much taken with her beauty and modest graceWho is she said Dong ZhuoA singing girl her name is Diao Chan Then can she sing The master bade her sing and she did so to the accompaniment of castanets There is a measure describing her youthful beautyYou stand a dainty maiden Your cherry lips so bright Your teeth so pearly white Your fragrant breath loveladen Yet is your tongue a sword Cold death is the reward Of loving thee O maidenDong Zhuo was delighted and praised her warmlyShe was told to present a goblet of wine to the guest which he took from her hands and then asked her ageShe replied Thy unworthy handmaid is twentyone A perfect little fairy said Dong ZhuoThen Wang Yun rose and said If the Prime Minister would not mind I should like to offer him this little maid How could I be grateful enough for such a kindness She would be most fortunate if she could be your servant said Wang YunDong Zhuo thanked his host warmlyThen the orders were given to prepare a closed carriage and convey Diao Chan to the Prime Ministers palaceSoon after Dong Zhuo took his leave and Wang Yun accompanied him the whole wayAfter he had taken leave Wang Yun mounted to ride homeward Half way he met two lines of guards with red lamps who were escorting Lu Bu who was on horseback and armed with his trident halberd Seeing Wang Yun Lu Bu at once reined in stopped seized him by the sleeve and said angrily You promised Diao Chan to me and now you have given her to the Prime Ministerwhat foolery is this Wang Yun checked him saying This is no place to talk I pray you come to my house So they went together and Wang Yun led Lu Bu into a private roomAfter the usual exchange of polite greetings Wang Yun said Why do you find fault with me General Somebody told me that you had sent Diao Chan to the Prime Ministers palace in a covered carriage what does it mean Of course you do not understandYesterday when I was at court the Prime Minister told me he had something to talk to me about in my own houseSo naturally I prepared for his coming and while we were at dinner he said I have heard something of a girl named Diao Chan whom you have promised to my son Lu BuI thought it was mere rumor so I wanted to ask if it was trueBeside I should like to see her I could not say no so she came in and made her bow to the lord of lordsThen he said that it was a lucky day and he would take her away with him and betroth her to you Just think Sirwhen the Prime Minister had come himself could I stop him You were not so very wrong said Lu Bu but for a time I had misunderstood youI owe you an apology The girl has a small trousseau which I will send as soon as she has gone over to your dwelling Lu Bu thanked him and went awayNext day he went into the Palace to find out the truth but could hear nothingThen he made his way into the private quarters and questioned the maidsPresently one told him that the Prime Minister had brought home a new bedfellow the night before and was not up yetLu Bu was very angry Next he crept round behind his masters sleeping apartmentBy this time Diao Chan had risen and was dressing her hair at the window Looking out she saw a long shadow fall across the little lakeShe recognized the headdress and peeping around she saw it was indeed no other than Lu BuThereupon she contracted her eyebrows simulating the deepest grief and with her dainty handkerchief she wiped her eyes again and againLu Bu stood watching her a long timeSoon after he went in to give morning greetingDong Zhuo was sitting in the reception room Seeing his henchman Dong Zhuo asked if there was anything new Nothing was the reply Lu Bu waited while Dong Zhuo took his morning mealAs he stood beside his master he glanced over at the curtain and saw a woman there behind the screen showing a half face from time to time and throwing amorous glances at him He felt it was his beloved and his thoughts flew to herPresently Dong Zhuo noticed his expression and began to feel suspicious If there is nothing you may go said Dong ZhuoLu Bu sulkily withdrewDong Zhuo now thought of nothing but his new mistress and for more than a month neglected all affairs devoting himself entirely to pleasureOnce he was a little indisposed and Diao Chan was constantly at his side never even undressing to show her solicitude She gratified his every whim Dong Zhuo grew more and more fond of herOne day Lu Bu went to inquire after his fathers healthDong Zhuo was asleep and Diao Chan was sitting at the head of his couch Leaning forward she gazed at the visitor with one hand pointed to her heart the other at Dong Zhuo asleep and her tears fellLu Bu felt heartbrokenDong Zhuo drowsily opened his eyes and seeing his sons gaze fixed on something behind him he turned over and saw who it wasHe angrily rebuked his son saying Dare you make love to my beauty He told the servants to turn Lu Bu out shouting Never let him enter here again Lu Bu went off home very wrathMeeting Li Ru he told Li Ru the cause of his angerThe adviser hastened to see his master and said Sir you aspire to be ruler of the empire why then for a small fault do you blame the GeneralIf he turns against you it is all over Then what can I do said Dong ZhuoRecall him tomorrow treat him well overwhelm him with gifts and fair words and all will be well So Dong Zhuo did soHe sent for Lu Bu and was very gracious and said I was irritable and hasty yesterday owing to my illness and I wronged you I knowForget it He gave Lu Bu three hundred ounces of gold and twenty rolls of brocade And so the quarrel was made upBut though Lu Bus body was with his adopted father Dong Zhuo his heart was with his promised bride Diao ChanDong Zhuo having quite recovered went to court again and Lu Bu followed him as usualSeeing Dong Zhuo deep in conversation with the Emperor Lu Bu armed as he was went out of the Palace and rode off to his chiefs residenceHe tied up his steed at the entrance and halberd in hand went to the private apartment to seek his loveHe found Diao Chan and she told him to go out into the garden where she would join him soonHe went taking his halberd with him and he leaned against the rail of the Phoenix Pavilion to wait for Diao ChanAfter a long time she appeared swaying gracefully as she made her way under the drooping willows and parting the flowers as she passed She was exquisite a perfect little fairy from the Palace of the Moon Tears were in her eyes as she came up and said Though I am not the Ministers real daughter yet he treated me as his own childThe desire of my life was fulfilled when he plighted me to you But ohto think of the wickedness of the Prime Minister stealing my poor self as he did I suffered so much I longed to die only that I had not told you the real truthSo I lived on bearing my shame as best as I could but feeling it mean still to liveNow that I have seen you I can end it allMy poor sullied body is no longer fit to serve a heroI can die before your eyes and so prove how true I am Thus speaking she seized the curving rail and started into the lily pondLu Bu caught her in his strong arms and wept as he held her close I knew it I always knew your heart he sobbedOnly we never had a chance to speak She threw her arms about Lu BuIf I cannot be your wife in this life I will in the ages to come she whisperedIf I do not marry you in this life I am no hero said heEvery day is a year long O pity me Rescue meMy lord I have only stolen away for a brief moment and I am afraid that old rebel will suspect something so I must not stay too long said Lu BuDiao Chan clung to his robe saying If you fear the old thief so much I shall never see another sunrise Lu Bu stoppedGive me a little time to think said he And he picked up his halberd to goIn the deep seclusion of the harem I heard the stories of your prowess you were the one man who excelled all othersLittle did I think that you of all heroes would rest content under the dominion of another And tears rained againA wave of shame flooded his face Leaning his halberd against the railing he turned and clasped the girl to his breast soothing her with fond wordsThe lovers held each other close swaying to and fro with emotion How could they bring themselves to say farewellIn the meantime Dong Zhuo missed his henchman and doubt filled his heart Hastily taking leave of the Emperor he mounted his chariot and returned to his palace There at the gate stood Lu Bus well known steed RedHare riderlessDong Zhuo questioned the doorkeepers and they told him the General was within He sent away his attendants and went alone to the private apartments Lu Bu was not thereHe called Diao Chan but there was no replyHe asked where she was and the waiting maids told him she was in the garden among the flowersSo Dong Zhuo went into the garden and there he saw the lovers in the pavilion in most tender talk Lu Bus trident halberd was leaning on the railing beside himA howl of rage escaped Dong Zhuo and startled the loversLu Bu turned saw who it was and ran awayDong Zhuo caught up the halberd and ran in pursuitBut Lu Bu was fleet of foot while his master was very stout Seeing no hope of catching the runaway Dong Zhuo hurled the halberdLu Bu fended it off and it fell to the ground Dong Zhuo picked it up and ran onBut by this time Lu Bu was far aheadJust as Dong Zhuo was running out at the garden gate he dashed full tilt against another man running in and down he wentSurged up his wrath within him as the billows heavenward leap Crashed his unwieldy body to earth in a shapeless heapWe shall presently see who the other runner was CHAPTER Lu Bu Kills Dong Zhuo For Wang Yun Li Jue Attacks The Capital On Jia Xus Advice The person who collided with the irate Dong Zhuo was his most trusty adviser Li RuLi Ru had not fallen in spite of the shock and at once scrambled to help Dong Zhuo to regain his feet and led him inside to the library where they sat down What were you coming about said Dong ZhuoHappening to be passing your gates I heard that you had gone into your private garden to look for your adopted sonThen came Lu Bu running and crying out that you wanted to kill him and I was coming in as fast as I could to intercede for him when I accidentally collided with youI am very sorryI deserve death The wretchHow could I bear to see him toying with my fair oneI will be the death of his yet Your Graciousness is making a mistake It is the plucked tassel story over again But if you remember the banquet of old time where all guests were to tear the tassels of their hatsIn that banquet King Zhuang of Chu made no fuss about the liberties taken with his queen although the hattassel in her hand betrayed the culprit Jiang Xiong His restraint stood him good stead for the same Jiang Xiong saved his life when he was hemmed in by the soldiers of QinAfter all Diao Chan is only a handmaid but Lu Bu is your trustiest friend and most dreaded commanderIf you took this chance of making the girl over to him your kindness would win his undying gratitudeI beg you Sir to think over it well Dong Zhuo hesitated a long time he sat murmuring to himself Presently he said What you say is right I must think over it Li Ru felt satisfiedHe took leave of his master and went awayDong Zhuo went to his private rooms and called Diao Chan What were you doing there with Lu Bu said heShe began to weep saying Thy handmaid was in the garden among the flowers when he rushed in on me I was frightened and ran awayHe asked why I ran away from a son of the family and pursued me right to the pavilion where you saw us He had that halberd in his hand all the timeI felt he was a vicious man and would force me to his will so I tried to throw myself into the lily pond but he caught me in his arms and held me so that I was helplessLuckily just at that moment you came and saved my life Suppose I send you to him said Dong ZhuoStunned she said in tears What have thy handmaid done The honor of serving only Your Highness could not stand being given to a mere underlingI would rather die And with this she snatched down a dagger hanging on the wall to kill herselfDong Zhuo plucked it from her hand and throwing his arms about her and cried I was only joking She lay back on his breast hiding her face and sobbing bitterlyThis is the doing of that Li Ru said sheHe is much too thick with Lu Bu He suggested that I knowLittle he cares for the Imperial Rectors reputation or my lifeI could eat him alive Do you think I could bear to lose you said Dong ZhuoThough you love me yet I must not stay here That Lu Bu will try to ruin me if I doI fear him We will go to Meiwo tomorrow you and I and we will be happy together and have no cares She dried her tears and thanked himNext day Li Ru came again to persuade Dong Zhuo to send the damsel to Lu Bu This is a propitious day said Li RuHe and I standing in the relation of father and son I cannot very well do that said Dong ZhuoBut I will say no more about his faultYou may tell him so and soothe him as well as you can You are not being beguiled by the woman are you said Li RuDong Zhuo colored saying Would you like to give your wife to some body elseDo not talk about this any furtherIt would be better not to Li Ru left the chamber When he got outside he cast his eyes up to heaven saying We are dead people slain by the hand of this girl When a scholar of history reached this episode he wrote a verse or two Just introduce a woman Conspiracies succeed Of soldiers or their weapons There really is no need They fought their bloody battles And doughty deeds were done But in a garden summer house The victory was wonThe order was given to journey to Meiwo and the whole body of officers assembled to add luster to the startDiao Chan from her carriage saw Lu Bu among the crowdShe at once dropped her eyes and assumed an appearance of deepest melancholyAfter the cavalcade started and when her carriage had almost disappeared in the distance the disappointed lover reined in his steed on a mount whence he could watch the dust that rose around it Unutterable sadness filled his heartSuddenly a voice said Why do you not accompany the Prime Minister General instead of standing here and sighing It was Wang YunI have been confined to the house by illness these few days continued he so I have not seen youBut I had to struggle out today to see the Prime Minister set off This meeting is most fortunateBut why were you sighing Just on account of that daughter of yours said Lu BuFeigning great astonishment Wang Yun said So long a time and yet not given to you The old ruffian has fallen in love with her himself Surely this cannot be true Lu Bu related the whole story while Wang Yun listened silent but stamping on the ground as with irritation and perplexityAfter a long time Wang Yun said I did not think he was such a beast Taking Lu Bu by the hand Wang Yun said Come to my house and we will talk it over So they went away together to the house and retired to a secret roomAfter some refreshments Lu Bu told the whole story of the episode in Phoenix Pavilion just as it happenedWang Yun said He seems to have corrupted my little girl and has stolen your wife He will be an object of shame and ridicule to the whole worldAnd those who do not laugh at him will laugh at you and meI am old and powerless and can do nothing More pitied than blamedBut you General you are a warrior the greatest hero in the world Yet you have been put to this shame and exposed to this contempt A wave of fierce wrath rolled up in Lu BuBanging the table he shouted and roaredHis host ostentatiously tried to calm him saying I forgot myself I should not have spoken like thatDo not be so angry I pray I will kill the wretch I swear it In no other way can I wash away my shame No noDo not say such a thing said Wang Yun putting his hand over the others mouthYou will bring trouble on poor me and my family When one is born great one cannot be patient for long under another persons domination said Lu BuIt needs some one greater than the Prime Minister to limit the scope of such talents as yours Lu Bu said I would not mind killing the old wretch were it not for the relation in which we standI fear to provoke the hostile criticism of posterity Wang Yun smiled saying Your name is Lu Bu his is Dong ZhuoWhere was the paternal feeling when he threw the halberd at you I had been misled if you had not said that said Lu Bu hotlyWang Yun saw the effect of his words and continued It would be a loyal deed to restore the House of Han and history would hand down your name to posterity perpetually fragrantIf you lend your aid to Dong Zhuo you will be a traitor and your name will be tainted through all ages Lu Bu rose from his place and bowed to Wang Yun I have decided said heYou need not fear Sir But yet you may fail and bring upon yourself misfortune said Wang YunLu Bu drew his dagger pricking his arm and swearing by the blood that flowed Wang Yun fell on his knees and thanked himThen the Han sacrifices will not be cut off and you will be their saviorBut this must remain a secret and I will tell you how the plot shall be worked out Lu Bu took leave with great emotionWang Yun took into his confidence two colleagues Minister Shisun Rui and Imperial Commander Huang WanShisun Rui said The moment is favorable The Emperor has just recovered from his illness and we can dispatch an able talker to Meiwo to persuade Dong Zhuo to come here to discuss affairsMeanwhile we will obtain a secret decree as authority for Lu Bu to lay an ambush just inside the palace gates to kill Dong Zhuo as he entersThis is the best plan to adopt But who would dare to go said Huang WanLi Su General of the Imperial Tiger Army would go He belongs to the same region as Lu Bu and is very angry with the Prime Minister for not advancing himHis going would assure us the plan would be completed Good said Wang YunLet us see what Lu Bu thinks of it When Lu Bu was consulted he told them that this Li Sus persuasion had led him to kill Ding Yuan his former benefactorIf Li Su refuses this mission I will kill him said Lu Bu So they sent for Li SuWhen Li Su arrived Lu Bu said Formerly you talked me into killing Ding Yuan and going over to Dong ZhuoNow we find Dong Zhuo means evil for the Emperor and is an oppressor of the people His iniquities are many and he is hated by gods and humansYou go to Meiwo say you have a command from the Emperor to summon the Prime Minister to the Palace He will come and he will be put to death You will have the credit of being loyal and restoring the Hans Will you undertake this I also wish to slay him was the reply But I could not find anyone to assist meHow can I hesitateYour intervention is directly from Heaven And Li Su snapped an arrow in twain as register of his oathIf this succeeds what glorious rank will be yours said Wang YunNext day Li Su with a small escort set out for Meiwo and announced himself as bearer of a decree He was conducted into Dong Zhuos presenceAfter he had made his obeisance Dong Zhuo asked what the decree wasHis Majesty has recovered and wishes his ministers to meet him in the Palace to consider the question of his abdication in your favorThat is what this summons means What does Wang Yun think of the scheme Wang Yun has already begun the construction of the Terrace of Abdication and only awaits my lords arrival Last night I dreamed a dragon coiled round my body said Dong Zhuo greatly pleased and now I get this happy tidingsI must not neglect the opportunity So Dong Zhuo gave instructions to his four trusted generals for the safekeeping of his city Li Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Ji were to guard Meiwo with three thousand troops of the Flying Bear Army Then Dong Zhuo announced his intention of starting on the morrowWhen I am Emperor you shall be Commander of the Capital District said heYour minister thanks you said Li SuDong Zhuo went to bid farewell to his ninetyyearold mother Whither are you going my son asked sheI go to receive the abdication of Han and soon you will be the Empress I have been feeling nervous and creepy these few daysIt is a bad sign Any one about to become the Mother of the State must have premonitions said her sonHe left her with these wordsJust before starting he said to Diao Chan When I am Emperor you shall be Lady of the Palace She bowed low thanking him but she knew and inwardly rejoicedDong Zhuo went out mounted his carriage and began his journey to Capital Changan with an imposing escortLess than ten miles the wheel of his carriage broke He left it and mounted a horseAnother ten miles the horse snorted and neighed threw up his head and snapped the reins Dong Zhuo turned to Li Su and asked what these things portendedIt means that you are going to receive the abdication of the Hans which is to renew all things to mount the jeweled chariot and sit in the golden saddle And Dong Zhuo was pleased and convinced with this answerDuring the second days journey a violent gale sprang up and the sky became covered with a thick mist What does this mean said Dong ZhuoThe wily Li Su had an interpretation for this also saying You are ascending to the place of the dragon there must be bright light and lurid vapor to dignify your majestic approach Dong Zhuo had no more doubtsHe presently arrived and found many officials waiting without the city gate to receive him all but Li Ru who was ill and unable to leave his chamberHe entered and proceeded to his own palace where Lu Bu came to congratulate himWhen I sit on the throne you shall command the whole armies of the empire horse and foot said Dong Zhuo That night Dong Zhuo slept in the midst of his escortIn the suburbs that evening some children at play were singing a little ditty and the words drifted into the bedchamber on the windThe grass in the meadow looks fresh now and green Yet wait but ten days not a blade will be seen The song sounded ominous but Li Su was again prepared with a happy interpretationIt only means that the Lius are about to disappear and the Dongs to be exalted Next morning at the first streak of dawn Dong Zhuo prepared for his appearance at courtOn the way he saw a Taoist dressed in a black robe and wearing a white turban who carried in his hand a tall staff with a long strip of white cloth attached At each end of the cloth was drawn a mouthWhat is the meaning of this said Dong ZhuoHe is a madman said Li Su and he told the guards to drive the fellow awayDong Zhuo went in and found all the officials in court dress lining the roadLi Su walked beside his carriage a sword in his handWhen Li Su reached the north gate of the Palace he found the soldiers of Dong Zhuo drawn up outside and only the pushers of the palace carriage a twenty or so were allowed to proceed furtherWhen Dong Zhuo arrived near the Reception Hall he saw that Wang Yun and all the other officials standing at the door were armed Why are they all armed said Dong Zhuo to Li SuLi Su was silent as he helped push the carriage forward swiftly to the entranceSuddenly Wang Yun shouted The rebel is hereWhere are the executioners At this call sprang from both sides soldiers armed with halberds and spears who attacked Dong Zhuo He had not put on the breastplate he usually wore and a spear pierced his breastHe sank down in the carriage calling loudly for his son Where is Lu Bu Here and with a decree to deal with a rebel said Lu Bu as he appeared in front of his father Thereupon he thrust his trident halberd through the victims throatThen Li Su hacked off the head and held it upLu Bu his left hand holding his halberd thrust his right hand into his bosom whence he drew the decree crying The decree was to slay the rebel Dong Zhuo no other The whole assembly shouted Live forever O Emperor A sympathetic poet has written a few lines in pity Await the time O noble and be king Or failing reap the solace riches bring Heaven never is partial but severely just Meiwo stood strong yet now it lies in dustThe lust of blood awakened Lu Bu urged the slaughter of Li Ru who had been the confidant of the murdered Prime Minister and Li Su volunteered to go in search of himBut just then a shouting was heard at the gates and it was told them that a household servant had brought Li Ru in bondsWang Yun ordered his immediate execution in the market placeDong Zhuos head was exposed in a crowded thoroughfareHe was very fat and the guards made torches by sticking splints into the body spilling the corpses grease over the groundThe passersby pelted the head and spurned the body with their feetWang Yun ordered a force of fifty thousand under Lu Bu Huangfu Song and Li Su to destroy MeiwoLearning the news of their master Li Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Ji fled west swiftly through the night with their Flying Bear Army to LiangzhouWhen arriving Meiwo Lu Bus first deed was to take Diao Chan into his chargeThen they slew every member of the Dong family sparing none not even Dong Zhuos aged motherThe heads of Dong Zhuos brother Dong Min and his nephew Dong Huang were publicly displayed in the market place In Meiwo were hidden many young ladies of good family These were set free All properties were confiscatedThe wealth was enormousseveral hundred thousand ounces of gold millions of silver coins pearls gems silks velvets furs grain storesWhen they returned to report success Wang Yun rewarded and feasted the soldiers Banquets were held in the Ministry Hall to which all the officials were invited They drank and congratulated each otherWhile the feasting was in progress it was announced that some one had come and was wailing over Dong Zhuos corpse exposed in the market placeDong Zhuo has been put to death said Wang Yun angrily Every body is glad to be rid of him and yet one is found to lament over himWho is this So Wang Yun gave orders to arrest the mourner and bring him in Soon he was brought in and when they saw him all were startled For he was no other than Imperial Historian Cai YongWang Yun spoke to Cai Yong angrily Dong Zhuo has been put to death as a rebel and all the land rejoicesYou a Han minister instead of rejoicing weep for himWhy Cai Yong confessed his fault saying I am without talent yet know what is right I am the man to turn my back on my country and toward Dong ZhuoYet once I experienced his kindness and I could not help mourning for him I know my fault is grave but I pray you regard the reasonsIf you will leave my head and only cut off my feet you may use me to continue the History of Han whereby I may have the good fortune to be allowed to expiate my fault All were sorry for Cai Yong for he was a man of great talents and they begged that he might be sparedThe Imperial Guardian Ma Midi secretly interceded for him saying Cai Yong is famous as a scholar and he can write glorious history and it is inadvisable to put to death a man renowned for rectitude without consideration But in vain for the High Minister was now strong and obdurateWang Yun said Centuries ago Emperor Wu spared Sima Qian and employed him on the annals with the result that many slanderous stories have been handed down to usThis is a trying period of great perplexity and we dare not let a specious fellow like this wield his pen in criticism of those about the court of a youthful prince and abuse us as he will Remonstrance and appeal being vain Ma Midi retiredBut he said to his colleagues Is Wang Yun then careless of the futureWorthy people are the mainstay of the state laws are the canons of action To destroy the mainstay and nullify the laws is to hasten destruction As was just said Wang Yun was obdurateCai Yong whose offense was an expression of gratitude was thrown into prison and there strangledThe people of that day wept for Cai Yong for they refused to see any offense in what he had done and death was a harsh punishmentDong Zhuo the dictator Tyrannized the state Fell and his sole mourner Shared his direful fateZhuge Liang in seclusion Was content to dream Felt his worth and never Helped a traitors schemeThose generalsLi Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Jiwhom Dong Zhuo had left to guard Meiwo fled when their master was slain and went into the county of Shanxi in Liangzhou Region Thence they sent in a memorial entreating amnesty But Wang Yun would not hear of itFour of them were the chief instruments of Dong Zhuos aggressions Now though a general amnesty were proclaimed these men should be excluded from its benefit said Wang YunThe messenger returned and told the four there was no hope of pardon and they could only fleeThen their adviser Jia Xu said If we throw away our arms and flee singly then we shall fall easy victims to any village beadle who may seize usRather let us cajole the Shanxi people to throw in their lot with us and make a sudden onslaught on the capital and so avenge Dong ZhuoIf we succeed we control the court and the empireThere will be enough time to run away if we fail The plan was adopted and they spread abroad the story that Wang Yun intended to massacre the countyHaving thus thrown the people into a state of terror they went a step farther and said There is no advantage in dying for nothingRevolt and join us So they cajoled the people into joining them and gathered a host equal to one hundred thousand This horde was divided into four parts and they all set out to raid Capital ChanganOn the way they fell in with a soninlaw of their late chief Imperial Commander Niu Fu who marched five thousand troop from Xiliang Niu Fu had set out to avenge his fatherinlaw and he became the van leader of the hordeAs they advanced the news came to Wang Yun and he consulted Lu BuThey are a lot of rats said Lu Bu Never mind how many there are of themBe not in the least anxious So Lu Bu and Li Su went to oppose themThe latter was in advance and met Niu FuThey fought Niu Fu was outmatched and retired after suffering a slaughterBut unexpectedly Niu Fu returned in a night attack found Li Su quite unprepared and drove Li Sus force some ten miles slaying manyLi Su reported the defeat and Lu Bu raged at him saying You have sullied my reputation as a warrior and destroyed our fighting spirit And Lu Bu put Li Su to death exposing his head at the camp gateNext day Lu Bu advanced his own force and engaged Niu FuHe overwhelmed Niu Fu and drove him offThat night Niu Fu called in his most trusted man Hu Chier to advise him Hu Chier said Lu Bu is too doughty a fighter for us to hope to overcome him Our case is hopelessOur best course is to desert these four generals secrete their valuables and leave the army with just a few of our followers The plan of Hu Chier was adopted and the two traitors and some others that very night packed up and made their way out of camp They were only half a dozenThey came to a river and while crossing Hu Chier tempted by the lust of wealth slew his companion Then he went to offer the head of Niu Fu to Lu BuLu Bu inquired into the matter and when a follower told him the truth he put the double traitor Hu Chier to deathThen Lu Bu advanced against the rebels and fell in with Li Jues forceWithout giving them time to form in battle Lu Bu attacked Horses curvetting and spears set the army dashed in irresistibly and Li Jue making no stand fell back a long way Li Jue took up a position under a hill fifteen miles away and thence sent to call his fellows to council Li Jue said Lu Bu though brave in battle is no strategist and so not really formidableI will lead my troops to hold the mouth of the gorge and every day I will incite him to attack and when he comes toward me General Guo Si can smite his rear after the manner of Peng Yue when he fought against ChuWhile thus I am alternating attack and retreat Generals Fan Chou and Zhang Ji will march off in different directions toward Changan Such an attack at two points must end both Wang Yun and Lu Bu They set themselves to carry out this schemeAs soon as Lu Bu reached the hills a force of Li Jue came out to attack himLu Bu made an angry dash toward the enemy who retired up the hills whence they shot arrows and hurled stones like rain Lu Bus troops haltedAt this moment the report came that the rear was being attacked and there appeared Guo SiAt once Lu Bu wheeled toward the new enemy but immediately the rolling drums gave the signal to retire and Lu Bu could not come to blows with themAs he called in his army the gongs clanged on the other side and his former opponent Li Jue came to attack his frontBut before Lu Bu could join battle his rear was again assaulted by Guo Si who in his turn drew off immediatelyThus Lu Bu was baited till his bosom was near bursting with rageThe same tactics continued for several days He could neither strike his enemies nor escape them his troops had no rest In the midst of these distracting maneuver a messenger rode up in hot haste to reportThe capital is in imminent danger from a double attack of Fan Chou and Zhang Ji Lu Bu at once ordered a march to save the capital which became a rout when both his opponents Li Jue and Guo Si came in pursuit His loss was heavyHe soon reached Changan and found the rebels there in enormous numbers and the city quite surroundedLu Bus attack had but little effect and as his temper became more savage under defeat many of his soldiers went over to the rebels He fell into deep melancholyThen a remnant of Dong Zhuos adherents still in the city led by Li Meng and Wang Fang began to lend aid to the attackers and by and by they secretly opened the city gate and the besiegers poured in Lu Bu exerted himself to the utmost but could not stem the tideAt the head of some hundred horse he dashed over to the Black Lock Gate and called out to Wang Yun who was on the other side The case is desperate nowRide with me to a place of safety Wang Yun replied If I am gifted with the holy spirit of the state I shall succeed in restoring the tranquillity which I desire but if I have it not then I offer my body a sacrificeI will not quail before dangersThank the noble supporters beyond the Pass for their efforts and bid them remember their country Lu Bu urged Wang Yun again and again but Wang Yun would not leaveSoon flames started up ail over the city and Lu Bu had to leave abandoning his family to their fate He fled to seek refuge with Yuan ShuLi Jue Guo Si and his fellow leaders gave full license to their ruffians who robbed and murdered their fillMany high officers perished Ministers Chong Fu Lu Kui and Zhou Huan Imperial Commanders Cui Lie and Wang Qi all died in the fightingIn time the rebels penetrated to the inner palace and the courtiers begged the Emperor to proceed to the Gate of Pervading Peace to try to quell the riotingAt sight of the yellow umbrella Li Jue and Fan Chou checked their armies and they all shouted Long life O Emperor The Emperor stood by the tower and addressed them Nobles what means it that you enter the capital in this unruly manner and without my summons The two leaders looked up and said Dong Zhuo Your Majestys Prime Minister has been slain by Wang Yun and we are here to avenge him We are no rebels SireLet us only have Wang Yun and we draw off our troops Wang Yun was actually among the courtiers and at the Emperors sideHearing this demand he said The plan was made for the benefit of the Throne but as this evil has grown therefrom Your Majesty will not grudge losing meI have brought about evil and I will go down to these rebels The Emperor was torn with sorrow and waveredBut the faithful minister leaped from the wall crying Wang Yun is here The two leaders drew their swords crying For what crime was our master slain His crimes filled the heavens and covered the earth no tongue can tell themThe day he died was a day of rejoicing in the whole city as you well know said Wang YunAnd if he was guilty of some crime what had we done not to be forgiven Seditious rebels why bandy wordsI am ready to die And Wang Yun was slain at the foot of the towerMoved by the peoples sufferings Vexed at his princes grief Wang Yun compassed the traitors death That they might find reliefEvery one knows him a hero Leal to the state alwaysLiving he guarded the princely towers His soul keeps guard today Having done the loyal minister to death at the Emperors feet they proceeded to exterminate also his whole familyEvery one mournedThen said the ruffians to each other Having gone so far what could be better than to make away with the Emperor and complete our scheme The traitor condoned his crime Rebellion ought to cease But his licentious followers Disturb the empires peaceThe fate of the Emperor will be disclosed in the next chapterCHAPTER  Gathering Arms Ma Teng Moves To Rescue The Emperor Commanding An Army Cao Cao Marches to Avenges His Father In the last chapter the two arch rebels Li Jue and Guo Si proposed to murder Emperor Xian but their followers Zhang Ji and Fan Chou opposed this No the people will not approve of his death now Restore him to power and get the leaguers inside Changans control Remove his supporters and then we can compass his death And the empire shall be in our hands So they ceased the attackThe Emperor again spoke from the tower saying Why do you still remainYou have slain Wang Yun now withdraw these soldiers Then Li Jue and Guo Si replied Your servants desire rank us a reward for their good service to your dynasty And what rank Sirs All four wrote their wishes and handed them up to the Emperor who had no choice but to accede to the request and they were createdLi Jue was appointed General of the Flying Cavalry Lord of Chiyang Commander of Capital District Court Administrator and granted Military Insignia Guo Si was appointed General of the Rear Army Lord of Meiyang Court Administrator and granted Military InsigniaFan Chou was appointed General of the Right Army and Lord of Wanian Zhang Ji was appointed General of the Flying Cavalry and Lord of PingyanLi Meng and Wang Fang for opening the city gates were appointed Imperial CommanderAfter receiving ranks of nobility Li Jue and Guo Si thanked the Emperor and went away to camp at Xunung the suburb of Changan The inferior rebel leaders also were gratified with ranks And once more the capital was free of troops Dong Zhuos followers having so far succeeded did not forget their late leaderThey sought his corpse for burial but only a few fragments were discoverable Then they had sculptors engrave a statue of fragrant wood in his likeness laid that out in proper form and instituted a nobles sacrifices and prayers The remains were dressed in the robes of a prince laid in a princely coffin for burial They selected Meiwo for his tomb and having found an auspicious day conveyed the coffin thitherBut a terrific thunder storm came on at the time of inhumation and the ground was flooded The coffin was rived asunder and the poor remains knocked out by thundersA second time they buried the coffin but a similar thing happened in the nightAnd yet a third time in another place but the earth rejected the remains Meanwhile the thunderfire had entirely consumed themSo it may be said justly that Heaven was exceedingly angry with Dong ZhuoSo now Li Jue and Guo Si wielded the real power of the scepter and they were hard upon the peopleThey also removed the attendants from the Palace and replaced them by their own creatures who maintained a most perfect watch over every movement of the Emperor so that he was greatly hampered and embarrassedAll appointments and demotions were made by the two rebelsFor the sake of popularity they especially summoned Zhu Jun to court made him Minister of the Palace Bureau and associated him with the governmentOne day came a report that the Governor of Xiliang Ma Teng and the Imperial Protector of Bingzhou Han Sui with one hundred thousand troops are rapidly approaching the capital with the intention of attacking the rebels in the name of the EmperorNow these leaders from the west had laid careful plans Ma Teng and Han Sui had sent trusty friends to the capital to find out who would support them They had conspired with three officialsCourt Counselors Ma Yu and Chong Shao and Imperial Commander Liu Fanto be their inside allies and plot against the rebelsThese three obtained from the Throne two secret edicts conferring the ranks of Commander Who Conquers the West on Ma Teng and Commander Who Guards the West on Han Sui With these powers the two commanders joined forces and began their marchThe four leaders of the party in powerLi Jue Guo Si Fan Chou and Zhang Jiheld a consultation with their generals as to how to meet the attackAdviser Jia Xu said Since the attackers are coming from a distance our plan is to fortify and wait till shortage of food shall work for usIn a hundred days their supplies will be consumed and they must retireWe can pursue and we shall capture them Li Meng and Wang Fang rose and said This plan is badGive us ten thousand troops and we will put an end to both of them and offer their heads before your ensign To fight forthwith means defeat said Jia XuLi Meng and Wang Fang cried with one voice If we fail we are willing to lose our heads but if we win then your head is forfeit Jia Xu then suggested to Li Jue and Guo Si saying Seventy miles west of the capital stand the Zhouzhi Hills The passes are narrow and difficultSend Generals Zhang Ji and Fan Chou to occupy this point of vantage and fortify themselves so that they may support Li Meng and Wang Fang Li Jue and Guo Si accepted this adviceThey told off fifteen thousand horse and foot and Li Meng and Wang Fang left in high spiritThey made a camp ninety miles from ChanganThe force from the west arrived Ma Teng and Han Sui led out their troops to the attackThey found their opponents Li Meng and Wang Fang in battle array Ma Teng and Han Sui rode to the front side by sidePointing to the rebel leaders the commanders abused them crying Those are traitors who will capture them Hardly were the words spoken when there came out a youth general with a clear white complexion as jade eyes like shooting stars lithe of body and strong of limbHe was armed with a long spear and bestrode an excellent steedThis young leader was Ma Chao son of Ma Teng then seventeen years of age Though young he was a supreme valianceWang Fang despising him on account of his youth galloped forth to fight himBefore they had exchanged many passes Wang Fang was disabled and fell to a thrust of the young Ma Chaos spearThe victor turned to retire into the formation but Li Meng rode after Ma Chao to avenge his fallen colleagueMa Chao did not see Li Meng but his father called out You are followed Hardly had Ma Teng spoken when he saw that the pursuer was a prisoner seated on his sons steedNow Ma Chao had known he was followed but pretended not to see waiting till his enemy should have come close and lifted his spear to strikeThen Ma Chao suddenly wheeled about The spear thrust met only empty air and as the horses passed Ma Chaos powerful arm shot out and pulled Li Meng from the saddleThus Li Meng and Wang Fangs soldiers were left leaderless and fled in all directionsThe army of Ma Teng and Han Sui dashed in pursuit and a complete victory was scored They pressed into one of the passes and made a camp Then they decapitated Li Meng and exposed his headWhen Li Jue and Guo Si heard that both the boastful generals had fallen under the hand of one young man they knew that Jia Xu had given good advice and was gifted with clear prescience So they valued his plans the more highly and decided to act on the defensive They refused all challenges to combatSurely enough after a couple of months the supplies of the Xiliang force were all exhausted and the leaders began to consider retreat Just at this juncture a household servant of Ma Yus family betrayed his master and told of the conspiracy of the three court officials to assist the attackersThe two chiefs Li Jue and Guo Si in revenge seized the three conspiratorsMa Yu Chong Shao and Liu Fan with every member of their households and beheaded them in the market place The heads of the three were exposed at the front gate of the capitalBeing short of food and hearing of the destruction of their three adherents in the city the only course for Ma Teng and Han Sui was to retreatAt once Zhang Ji went in pursuit of Ma Teng and Fan Chou followed Han SuiThe retreating army under Ma Teng was beaten and only by Ma Chaos desperate efforts were the pursuers driven offFan Chou pursued the other army and when he had come close Han Sui rode boldly up and addressed him saying You and I Sir are fellow villagersWhy then behave so unfriendly Fan Chou replied I must obey the commands of my chief I am here for the service of the state why do you press me so hard said Han SuiAt this Fan Chou turned his horse called in his troops and left Han Sui in peaceUnwittingly a nephew of Li Jue had been a witness of this scene and when he saw the enemy allowed to go free he returned and told his uncleAngry that his enemy had escaped Li Jue would have sent an army to wreak vengeance on his general but his adviser Jia Xu again came in saying The people are yet unsettled it was dangerous to provoke another warInstead invite Fan Chou to a banquet and while the feast was in progress executing him for dereliction of duty This seemed good to Li Jue so the banquet was preparedZhang Ji and Fan Chou accepted their invitations and went cheerfullyToward the latter part of the entertainment a sudden change came over their host Li Jue and he suddenly asked Fan Chou Why have you been intriguing with Han SuiYou are turning traitor eh The unhappy guest was taken aback and before he could frame his words to reply he saw the assassins rush out with swords and axes In a moment all was over and Fan Chous head lay beneath the tableScared beyond measure his fellowguest Zhang Ji groveled on the floorFan Chou was a traitor said the host raising Zhang Ji by the arm and he has his deserts you are my friend and need not fear Li Jue gave Zhang Ji command of Fan Chous army with which Zhang Ji returned to his headquarters garrison in HongnongNo one of the leaders among the leaguers dared attempt an attack on the party newly risen from Dong Zhuos disaffection while on the other hand Jia Xu never ceased to urge his masters to exert themselves for the welfare of the people and thus to tempt wise people to join themAnd by these means the government began to prosper and the court to reassert its authorityHowever a new trouble arose in the shape of a resurgence of Yellow Scarves in Qingzhou They came under numerous chieftains in the number of hundreds of thousand and plundered any place they reachedMinister Zhu Jun said he knew of one who could destroy this sedition and when asked who was the man he proposed Zhu Jun said You want to destroy this horde of rebels you will fail unless you get the services of Cao Cao And where is he asked Li Jue He is Governor of DongjunHe has a large army and you have only to order him to act the rising will be broken A messenger went post haste with a command for Cao Cao and Bao Xin Lord of Jibei to act together in quelling the rebellionAs soon as Cao Cao received the court command he arranged with his colleague first to attack the rebels at ShouyangBao Xin made a dash right into their midst and inflicting damage wherever he could but he was killed in a battleCao Cao pursued the rebels as they fled Ten thousand surrenderedThen Cao Cao put his quondam enemies in the van and when his army reached any place many more surrendered and joined himAfter three months of these tactics he had won over many thousands both of soldiers and ordinary folksOf these new adherents the strongest and boldest were made the Qingzhou Army and the others were sent home to their fieldsIn consequence of these successes Cao Caos prestige and fame became very great and increased dailyHe reported his success to Capital Changan and was rewarded with the title of General Who Guards the EastAt his headquarters in Yanzhou Cao Cao welcomed wise counselors and bold warriors and many gathered around himTwo clever persons uncle and nephew came at the same time both from Yanzhou named Xun Yu and Xun YouThe uncle had once been in the service of Yuan Shao Cao Cao rejoiced when he had won the elder Xun to his side saying Xun Yu is my Zhang Liang He made Xun Yu a Marching General The nephew Xun You was famed for his ability and had been in the court service when it was in Luoyang but he had abandoned that career and retired to his villageCao Cao made him a Military InstructorXun Yu said to Cao Cao There is a certain wise person of Yanzhou somewhere but I do not know in whose service he is Who is he Cheng Yu he belongs to the eastern region of Yanzhou Yes I have heard of him said Cao CaoSo a messenger was sent to his native place to inquireCheng Yu was away in the hills engaged in study but he came at Cao Caos invitationI shall prove unworthy of your recommendation said Cheng Yu to his friend Xun Yu for I am rough and ignorantBut have you forgotten a fellow villager of yours Guo Jia He is really able Why not spread the net to catch him I had nearly forgotten said Xun Yu suddenly So he told Cao Cao of this man who was at once invitedGuo Jia discussing the world at large with Cao Cao recommended Liu Ye from Henan who was a descendant of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter HanWhen Liu Ye had arrived he was the means of inviting two moreMan Chong from Shanyang and Lu Qian from Wucheng who were already known to Cao Cao by reputation These two brought to their new masters notice the name of Mao Jie from Chenliu who also came and was given officeThen a famous leader with his troop of some hundreds arrived to offer serviceThis was Yu Jin of Taishan an expert horseman and archer and skilled beyond his fellows in every form of military exercise He was made an army inspectorThen another day Xiahou Dun brought a fellow to present to Cao Cao Who is he asked Cao Cao He is from Chenliu and is named Dian Wei He is the boldest of the bold the strongest of the strongHe was one of Zhang Miaos people but quarreled with his tent companions and killed some dozens of them with his fists Then he fled to the mountains where I found himI was out shooting and saw him follow a tiger across a stream I persuaded him to join my troop and I recommend him I see he is no ordinary man said Cao CaoHe is fine and straight and looks very powerful and bold He isHe killed a man once to avenge a friend and carried his head through the whole market place Hundreds saw him but dared not come nearThe weapon he uses now is a couple of spears each weighs a hundred and twenty pounds and he vaults into the saddle with these under his arm Cao Cao bade the man give proof of his skillSo Dian Wei galloped to and fro carrying the spearsThen he saw away among the tents a huge banner swaying dangerously with the force of the wind and on the point of falling A crowd of soldiers were vainly struggling to keep it steadyDown he leaped shouted to the men to clear out and held the staff quite steady with one hand keeping it perfectly upright in spite of the strong windThis is old E Lai again said Cao CaoHe gave Dian Wei a post in the headquarters and besides made Dian Wei presents of an embroidered robe he was wearing and a swift steed with a handsome saddleCao Cao encouraged able people to assist him and he had advisers on the civil side and valiant generals in the army He became famous throughout the East of the Pass Now Cao Caos father Cao Song was living at Langye whither he had gone as a place free from the turmoil of the partisan strugglesNow Cao Cao wished to be united with him As a dutiful son Cao Cao sent the Governor of Taishan Ying Shao to escort his father to Yanzhou Old Cao Song read the letter with joy and the family prepared to moveThey were some forty in all with a train of a hundred servants and many cartsTheir road led through Xuzhou where the Imperial Protector Tao Qian was a sincere and upright man who had long wished to get on good terms with Cao Cao but hitherto had found no means of effecting a bond of unionHearing that the family of the great man was passing through his region Tao Qian went to welcome them treated them with great cordiality feasting and entertaining them for two days and when they left he escorted them to his boundaryFurther he sent with them one General Zhang Kai with a special escort of five hundredThe whole party reached the county of Huafei It was the end of summer just turning into autumn and at this place they were stopped by a tremendous storm of rain The only shelter was an old temple and thither they went The family occupied the main rooms and the escort the two side wingsThe men of the escort were drenched angry and discontentedThen Zhang Kai called some of his petty officers to a secret spot and said We are old Yellow Scarves and only submitted to Tao Qian because there was no other choice We have never got much out of itNow here is the Cao family with no end of gear and we can be rich very easily We will make a sudden onslaught tonight at the third watch and slay the whole lot Then we shall have plenty of treasure and we will get away to the mountains They all agreedThe storm continued into the night and as Cao Song sat waiting anxiously for signs of clearing he suddenly heard a hubbub at the west end of the templeHis brother Cao De drawing his sword went out to see what it was about and Cao De was at once cut downCao Song seized one of the concubines by the hand rushed with her through the passage toward the back of the temple so that they might escapeBut the lady was stout and could not get through the narrow doors so the two hid in one of the small outhouses at the side However they were seen and slainThe unhappy Governor Ying Shao fled for his life to Yuan ShaoThe murderers fled into the South of River Huai with their plunder after having set fire to the old templeCao Cao whom the ages praise Slew his hosts on his former flight Nemesis never turns aside Murdered too his family diedSome of the escort escaped and took the evil tidings to Cao CaoWhen he heard it he fell to the earth with a great cry They raised himWith set teeth he muttered Tao Qians people have slain my father no longer can the same sky cover usI will sweep Xuzhou off the face of the earthOnly thus can I satisfy my vengeance Cao Cao left one small army of thirty thousand under Xun Yu and Cheng Yu to guard the east headquarters and the three counties of Juancheng Fanxia and Dongjun Then he set forth with all the remainder to destroy Xuzhou and avenge his fatherXiahou Dun Yu Jin and Dian Wei were Van Leaders with Cao Caos orders to slaughter all the inhabitants of each captured city Now the Governor of Jiujiang Bian Rang was a close friend of Tao QianHearing Xuzhou was threatened Bian Rang set out with five thousand troops to his friends aidAngered by this move Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to stop and kill Bian Rang while still on the marchAt this time Chen Gong was in office in Dongjun and he was also on friendly terms with Tao QianHearing of Cao Caos design to destroy the whole population Chen Gong came in haste to see his former companionCao Cao knowing Chen Gongs errand put him off at first and would not see him But then Cao Cao could not forget the kindness he had formerly received from Chen Gong and presently the visitor was called to his tentChen Gong said They say you go to avenge your fathers death on Xuzhou to destroy its people I have come to say a wordImperial Protector Tao Qian is humane and a good man He is not looking out for his own advantage careless of the means and of othersYour worthy father met his unhappy death at the hands of Zhang Kai Tao Qian is guiltlessStill more innocent are the people and to slay them would be an evilI pray you think over it Cao Cao retorted angrily You once abandoned me and now you have the impudence to come to see meTao Qian slew my whole family and I will tear his heart out in revenge I swear it You may speak for your friend and say what you willI shall be as if I heard not Intercession had failedChen Gong sighed and took his leave He said AlasI cannot go to Tao Qian and look upon his face So Chen Gong rode off to the county of Chenliu to give service to Governor Zhang MiaoCao Caos army of revenge laid waste whatever place it passed through slaying the people and desecrating their cemeteries When Tao Qian heard the terrible tidings he looked up to heaven saying I must be guilty of some fault before Heaven to have brought this evil upon my people He called together his officials to consultOne of them Cao Bao said Now the enemy is upon us we cannot sit and await death with folded handsI for one will help you to make a fight Tao Qian reluctantly sent the army outFrom a distance he saw Cao Caos army spread abroad like frost and rushed far and wide like snow In their midst was a large white flag and on both sides was written Vengeance When he had ranged his troops Cao Cao rode out dressed in mourning white and abused Tao QianBut Tao Qian advanced and from beneath his ensign he bowed low and said I wished to make friends with you Illustrious Sir and so I sent Zhang Kai to escort your familyI knew not that his rebel heart was still unchangedThe fault does not lie at my door as you must see You old wretch you killed my father and now you dare to mumble this nonsense said Cao CaoAnd he asked who would go out and seize Tao QianXiahou Dun undertook this service and rode outTao Qian fled to the inner portion of his array and as Xiahou Dun came on Cao Bao went to meet himBut just as the two horses met a hurricane burst over the spot and the flying dust and pebbles threw both sides into the utmost confusion Both drew off Tao Qian retired into the city and called his officers to council The force against us is too strong said he I will give myself up as a prisoner and let him wreak his vengeance on meI may save the people But a voice was heard saying You have long ruled here and the people love youStrong as the enemy are they are not necessarily able to break down our walls especially when defended by you and your peopleI have a scheme to suggest that I think will make Cao Cao die in a place where he will not find burial These bold words startled the assembly and they eagerly asked what the scheme wasMaking overtures for friendship Tao Qian encountered deadly hate But where danger seemed most threatening he discovered safetys gateThe next chapter will disclose who the speaker was CHAPTER Liu Bei Rescues Kong Rong At Beihai Lu Bu Defeats Cao Cao Near Puyang It was one Mi Zhu who said he knew how to defeat Cao Cao utterlyMi Zhu came of a wealthy family of merchants in Donghai and trading in Luoyang One day traveling homeward from that city in a carriage he met an exquisitely beautiful lady trudging along the road who asked him to let her ride He stopped and yielded his place to her She invited him to share the seat with herHe mounted but sat rigidly upright never even glancing in her direction They traveled thus for some miles when she thanked him and alightedJust as she left she said I am the Goddess of Fire from the Southern Land I am on my way to execute a decree of the Supreme God to burn your dwelling but your extreme courtesy has so deeply touched me that I now warn youHasten homeward remove your valuables for I must arrive tonight Thereupon she disappearedMi Zhu hastily finished his journey and as soon as he arrived moved everything out of his houseSure enough that night a fire started in the kitchen and involved the whole houseAfter this he devoted his wealth to relieving the poor and comforting the afflictedTao Qian gave him the magistracy office he then held The plan Mi Zhu proposed was this I will go to Beihai and beg Governor Kong Rong to helpAnother should go to Qingzhou on a similar mission to get the help from Imperial Protector Tien KaiIf the armies of these two places march on Cao Cao he will certainly retire Tao Qian accepted the plan and wrote two lettersHe asked for a volunteer to go to Qingzhou and a certain Chen Deng offered himself and after he had left Mi Zhu was formally entrusted with the mission to the north Meanwhile Tao Qian and his generals would hold the city as they couldKong Rong was a native of Qufu in the old state of Lu He was one of the twentieth generation in descent from the great Teacher ConfuciusKong Rong had been noted as a very intelligent lad somewhat precocious When ten years old he had gone to see Li Ying the Governor of Henan but the doorkeeper demurred to letting him in But when Kong Rong said I am Minister Li Yings intimate friend he was admitted Li Ying asked Kong Rong what relations had existed between their families that might justify the term intimateThe boy replied Of old my ancestor Confucius questioned your ancestor the Taoist sage Laozi concerning ceremonies So our families have known each other for many generations Li Ying was astonished at the boys ready witPresently High Minister Chen Wei visited to whom Li Ying told the story of his youthful guestHe is a wonder this boy said Li Ying pointing to Kong RongChen Wei replied It does not follow that a clever boy grows up into a clever man The lad took him up at once saying By what you say Sir you were certainly one of the clever boys The minister adviser and the governor all laughed saying The boy is going to be a noble vessel Thus from boyhood Kong Rong was famousAs a man he rose to be an Imperial Commander and was sent as Governor to Beihai where he was renowned for hospitality He used to quote the linesLet the rooms be full of friends And the cups be full of wineThat is what I like After six years at Beihai the people were devoted to himThe day that Mi Zhu arrived Kong Rong was as usual seated among his guests and the messenger was ushered in without delayIn reply to a question about the reason of the visit Mi Zhu presented Tao Qians letter which said that Cao Cao was pressing on Xuzhou City and the Imperial Protector prayed for helpThen said Kong Rong Your master and I are good friends and your presence here constrains me to go to his aidHowever I have no quarrel with Cao Cao either so I will first write to him to try to make peaceIf he refuses my offer then I must set the army in motion Cao Cao will not listen to proposals of peace he is too certain of his strength said Mi ZhuKong Rong wrote his letter and also gave orders to muster his troopsJust at this moment happened another rising of the Yellow Scarves ten thousand of them and the ruffians began to rob and murder at BeihaiIt was necessary to deal with them first and Kong Rong led his army outside the cityThe rebel leader Guan Hai rode out to the front saying I know this county is fruitful and can well spare ten thousand carts of grainGive me that and we retire refuse and we will batter down the city walls and destroy every soul Kong Rong shouted back I am a servant of the great Hans entrusted with the safety of their landThink you I will feed rebels  Guan Hai whipped his steed whirled his sword around his head and rode forwardZong Bao one of Kong Rongs generals set his spear and rode out to give battle but after a very few bouts Zong Bao was cut downSoon the soldiers fell into panic and rushed pellmell into the city for protectionThe rebels then laid siege to the city on all sidesKong Rong was very downhearted and Mi Zhu who now saw no hope for the success of his mission was grieved beyond wordsThe sight from the city wall was exceeding sad for the rebels were there in enormous numbers One day standing on the wall Kong Rong saw afar a man armed with a spear riding hard in among the Yellow Scarves and scattering them before him like chaff before the windBefore long the man had reached the foot of the wall and called out Open the gate But the defenders would not open to an unknown man and in the delay a crowd of rebels gathered round the rider along the edge of the moatSuddenly wheeling about the warrior dashed in among them and bowled over a dozen at which the others fell back At this Kong Rong ordered the wardens to open the gates and let the stranger enterAs soon as he was inside he dismounted laid aside his spear ascended the wall and made humble obeisance to the GovernorMy name is Taishi Ci and I am from the county of LaihuangI only returned home yesterday from the north to see my mother and then I heard that your city was in danger from a rebel attackMy mother said you had been very kind to her and told me I should try to helpSo I set out all alone and here I am This was cheeringKong Rong already knew Taishi Ci by reputation as a valiant fighting man although they two had never metThe son being far away from his home Kong Rong had taken his mother who dwelt a few miles from the city under his especial protection and saw that she did not suffer from wantThis had won the old ladys heart and she had sent her son to show her gratitudeKong Rong showed his appreciation by treating his guest with the greatest respect making him presents of clothing and armor saddles and horsesPresently said Taishi Ci Give me a thousand soldiers and I will go out and drive off these fellows You are a bold warrior but these are very numerousIt is a serious matter to go out among them said Kong Rong My mother sent me because of your goodness to herHow shall I be able to look her in the face if I do not raise the siegeI would prefer to conquer or perish I have heard Liu Bei is one of the heroes in the world and if we could get his help there would be no doubt of the resultBut there is no one to send I will go as soon as I have received your letter So Kong Rong wrote letters and gave them to his helperTaishi Ci put on his armor mounted his steed attached his bow and quiver to his girdle took his spear in his hand tied his packed haversack firmly to his saddle bow and rode out at the city gate He went quite aloneAlong the moat a large party of the besiegers were gathered and they came to intercept the solitary riderBut Taishi Ci dashed in among them and cut down several and so finally fought his way throughGuan Hai hearing that a rider had left the city guessed what his errand would be and followed Taishi Ci with a party of horsemen Guan Hai spread them out so that the messenger rider was entirely surroundedThen Taishi Ci laid aside his spear took his bow adjusted his arrows one by one and shot all round him And as a rider fell from his steed with every twang of Taishi Cis bowstring the pursuers dared not close inThus he got clear away and rode in hot haste to Liu BeiTaishi Ci reached Pingyuan and after greeting his host in proper form he told how Kong Rong was surrounded and had sent him for help Then he presented the letter which Liu Bei readAnd who are you asked Liu BeiI am Taishi Ci a fellow from LaihuangI am not related by ties of kin to Kong Rong nor even by ties of neighborhood but I am by the bonds of sentiment and I share his sorrows and misfortunesThe Yellow Scarves have invested his city and he is distressed with none to turn to and destruction is very nearYou are known as humane righteous and eager to help the distressed Therefore at his command I have braved all dangers and fought my way through his enemies to pray you save him Liu Bei smiled saying And does he know there is a Liu Bei in this world So Liu Bei together with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei told off three thousand troops and set out to help raise the siegeWhen the rebel leader Guan Hai saw these new forces arriving he led out his army to fight them thinking he could easily dispose of so small a force The brothers and Taishi Ci with them sat on their horses in the forefront of their array Guan Hai hastened forwardTaishi Ci was ready to fight but Guan Yu had opened the combatHe rode forth and the two steeds met The soldiers set up a great shout for how could there be any doubt of the resultAfter a few bouts Guan Yus greendragon saber rose and fell and with the stroke fell the rebel leader This was the signal for Zhang Fei and Taishi Ci to take a share and they advanced side by side With their spears ready they dashed in and Liu Bei urged forward his forceThe besieged Governor saw his doughty rescuers laying low the rebels as tigers among a flock of sheep None could withstand them and he then sent out his own troops to join in the battle so that the rebels were between two armiesThe rebels force was completely broken and many troops surrendered while the remainder scattered in all directionsThe victors were welcomed into the city and as soon as possible a banquet was prepared in their honor Mi Zhu was presented to Liu BeiMi Zhu related the story of the murder of Cao Song by Zhang Kai Cao Caos vengeful attack on Xuzhou and his coming to beg for assistanceLiu Bei said Imperial Protector Tao Qian is a kindly man of high character and it is a pity that he should suffer this wrong for no fault of his own You are a scion of the imperial family said Governor Kong Rong and this Cao Cao is injuring the people a strong man abusing his strengthWhy not go with me to rescue the sufferers I dare not refuse but my force is weak and I must act cautiously said Liu BeiThough my desire to help arises from an old friendship yet it is a righteous act as well I do not think your heart is not inclined toward the right said Kong RongLiu Bei said This being so you go first and give me time to see Gongsun Zan from whom I may borrow more troops and horsesI will come anon You surely will not break your promise said the GovernorWhat manner of man think you that I am said Liu BeiThe wise one said Death is common to all the person without truth cannot maintain the self Whether I get the troops or not certainly I shall myself come So the plan was agreed toMi Zhu set out to return forthwith while Kong Rong prepared for his expeditionTaishi Ci took his leave saying My mother bade me come to your aid and now happily you are safeLetters have come from my fellow townsman Liu Yao Imperial Protector of Yangzhou calling me thither and I must goI will see you again Kong Rong pressed rewards upon Taishi Ci but he would accept nothing and departedWhen his mother saw him she was pleased at his success saying she rejoiced that he had been able to prove his gratitude and after this he departed for YangzhouLiu Bei went away to his friend Gongsun Zan and laid before Gongsun Zan his design to help XuzhouCao Cao and you are not enemies why do you spend yourself for the sake of another said Gongsun ZanI have promised Liu Bei replied and dare not break faith I will lend you two thousand horse and foot said Gongsun ZanAlso I wish to have the services of Zhao Yun said Liu BeiGongsun Zan agreed to this also They marched away Liu Beis own troops being in the front and Zhao Yun with the borrowed troops being in rearIn due course Mi Zhu returned saying that Kong Rong had also obtained the services of Liu BeiThe other messenger Chen Deng came back and reported that Tien Kai would also bring help Then was Tao Qians heart set at easeBut both the leaders though they had promised aid greatly dreaded their antagonist and camped among the hills at a great distance fearful of coming to close quartersCao Cao knew of their coming and divided his army into parts to meet them so postponing the attack on the city itselfPresently Liu Bei came up and went to see Kong Rong who said The enemy is very powerful and Cao Cao handles his army skillfully We must be cautiousLet us make most careful observations before we strike a blow What I fear is famine in the city said Liu Bei They cannot hold out very longI will put my troops with yours under your command while I with Zhang Fei make a dash through to see Tao Qian and consult with him Kong Rong approved of this so he and Tien Kai took up positions on the oxhorn formation with Guan Yu and Zhao Yun on either side to support themWhen Liu Bei and Zhang Fei leading one thousand troops made their dash to get through Cao Caos army they got as far as the flank of his camp when there arose a great beating of drums and horse and foot rolled out like billows on the ocean The leader was Yu JinHe checked his steed and called out You mad men from somewhere where are you going Zhang Fei heard Yu Jin but deigned no replyHe only rode straight to attack the speakerAfter they had fought a few bouts Liu Bei waved his double swords as signal for his troops to come on and they drove Yu Jin before themZhang Fei led the pursuit and in this way they reached the city wallFrom the city wall the besieged saw a huge banner embroidered in white Liu Bei of Pingyuan and the Imperial Protector bade them open the gate for the rescuers to enterLiu Bei was made very welcome conducted to the residency and a banquet prepared in his honor The soldiers also were feastedTao Qian was delighted with Liu Bei admiring his highspirited appearance and clear speech Tao Qian bade Mi Zhu offer Liu Bei the seal and insignia of the protectorship office But Liu Bei shrank back startledWhat does this mean said Liu BeiTao Qian said There is trouble on every side and the kingly rule is no longer maintainedYou Sir are a member of the family and eminently fitted to support them and their prerogativesI am verging on senility and I wish to retire in your favorI pray you not to decline and I will report my action to the court Liu Bei started up from his seat and bowed before his host saying Scion of the family I may be but my merit is small and my virtue meagerI doubt my fitness even for my present post and only a feeling of doing right sent me to your assistance To hear such speech makes me doubtSurely you think I came with greed in my heartMay God help me no more if I cherished such a thought It is a poor old mans real sentiment said Tao Qian Time after time Tao Qian renewed his offer to entrust the region of Xuzhou to Liu Bei but Liu Bei kept refusingIn the midst of this came Mi Zhu saying The enemies had reached the wall and something must be done to drive them offThe present matter could await a more tranquil time Said Liu Bei I ought to write to Cao Cao to press him to raise the siegeIf he refuses we will attack forthwith Orders were sent to the three camps outside to remain quiescent till the letter could reach Cao CaoIt happened that Cao Cao was holding a council when a messenger with a war letter was announcedThe letter was brought in and handed to him and when he had opened and looked at it he found it was from Liu Bei This is the letter very nearlySince meeting you outside the pass fate has assigned us to different quarters of the world and I have not been able to pay my respects to youTouching the death of your noble father it was owing to the vicious nature of Zhang Kai and due to no fault of Tao QianNow while the remnant of the Yellow Scarves is disturbing the lands and Dong Zhuos partisans have the upper hand in the capital I wish that you Illustrious Sir would regard the critical position of the court rather than your personal grievances and so divert your forces from the attack on Xuzhou to the rescue of the stateSuch would be for the happiness of that city and the whole world Cao Cao gave vent to a torrent of abuseWho is this Liu Bei that he dares write and exhort meBeside he means to be satirical Cao Cao issued orders to put the bearer of the letter to death and to press on the siegeBut Guo Jia remonstrated saying Liu Bei has come from afar to help Tao Qian and he is trying the effect of politeness before resorting to arms I pray you my lord reply with fair words that his heart may be lulled with a feeling of safetyThen attack with vigor and the city will fall Cao Cao found this advice good so he spared the messenger telling him to wait to carry back his replyWhile this was going on a horseman came with news of misfortuneLu Bu has invaded Yanzhou now holding Puyang The three counties leftJuancheng Fanxia and Dongjunare under severe attacks When Li Jue and Guo Si the two partisans of Dong Zhuo succeeded in their attack on the capital Lu Bu had fled to Yuan ShuHowever Yuan Shu looked askance at him for his instability and refused to receive him Then Lu Bu went to try Yuan Shao who was a brother of Yuan ShuYuan Shao accepted the warrior and made use of him in an attack upon Zhang Yan in ChangshanBut his success filled him with pride and his arrogant demeanor so annoyed the other commanders that Yuan Shao was on the point of putting him to deathTo escape this Lu Bu had gone away to Zhang Yang Governor of Shangdang who accepted his servicesAbout this time Pang Shu who had been hiding and protecting Lu Bus family in Changan since his disappearance restored them to himThis deed angered Li Jue and Guo Si so that they put Pang Shu to death and wrote to Lu Bus protector to serve him the same To escape this Lu Bu once again had to flee and this time joined himself to Zhang MiaoLu Bu arrived just as Zhang Miaos brother Zhang Chao was introducing Chen GongChen Gong said to Zhang Miao The rupture of the empire has begun and warriors are seizing what they canIt is strange that you with all the advantages of population and provisions you enjoy do not strike for independenceCao Cao has gone on an expedition against the east leaving his own territory defenselessLu Bu is one of the fighting people of the day If you and he together attacked and got Yanzhou you could then proceed to the dominion Zhang Miao was pleased and resolved to tryHe ordered an attack and soon Lu Bu was in possession of Yanzhou and its neighborhood all but three small counties of Juancheng Fanxia and Dongjun which were vigorously and desperately defended by Xun Yu and Cheng Yu in concertCao Caos cousin Cao Ren had fought many battles but was repeatedly defeated and the messenger with the evil tidings had come from him asking prompt helpCao Cao was greatly disturbed by this and said If my own region be lost I have no home to return toI must do something at once The best thing would be to become friends with Liu Bei at any cost and return to Yanzhou said Guo JiaThen Cao Cao wrote to Liu Bei gave the letter to the waiting messenger and broke campThe news that the enemy had left was very gratifying to Tao Qian who then invited his various defenders into Xuzhou City and prepared banquets and feasts in token of his gratitude At one of these when the feasting was over he proceeded with his wish of retirement in favor of Liu BeiPlacing Liu Bei in the seat of highest honor Tao Qian bowed before him and then addressed the assembly I am old and feeble and my two sons lack the ability to hold so important an office as thisThe noble Liu Bei is a descendant of the imperial house He is of lofty virtue and great talentLet him then take over the rule of this region and only too willingly I shall retire to have leisure to nurse my health Liu Bei replied I came at the request of Governor Kong Rong because it was the right thing to doXuzhou is saved but if I take it surely the world will say I am a wicked man Mi Zhu said You may not refuseThe House of Han is falling their realm is crumbling and now is the time for doughty deeds and signal servicesThis is a fertile region well populated and rich and you are the man to rule over it But I cannot accept said Liu BeiImperial Protector Tao Qian is a great sufferer said Chen Deng and cannot see to mattersYou may not decline Sir Said Liu Bei Yuan Shu belongs to a family of rulers who have held the highest offices of state four times in three generations The multitude people respects himWhy not invite him to this task Because Yuan Shu is a drying skeleton in a dark tomb not worth talking aboutThis opportunity is a gift from Heaven and you will never cease to regret its loss said Kong Rong So spoke Kong Rong but still Liu Bei obstinately refusedTao Qian besought him with tears saying I shall die if you leave me and there will be none to close my eyes Brother you should accept the offer thus made said Guan Yu Why so much fuss said Zhang FeiWe have not taken the place it is he who wishes to give it you You all persuade me to do what is wrong said Liu BeiSeeing he could not persuade Liu Bei Tao Qian then said As you are set in determination perhaps you will consent to encamp at XiaopeiIt is only a little town but thence you can keep watch and ward over the region They all with one voice prayed Liu Bei to consent so he gave in The feast of victory being now ended the time came to say farewellWhen Zhao Yun took his leave Liu Bei held his hands alternately while dashing away the falling tears Kong Rong and Tien Kai went home to their own places When Liu Bei and his brothers took up their abode in Xiaopei they first repaired the defenses and then they put out proclamations in order to calm the inhabitants In the meantime Cao Cao had marched toward his own regionCao Ren met and told him Lu Bu is very powerful and he has Chen Gong as adviser Yanzhou is as good as lost with the exception of three counties which have been vigorously and desperately defended by Xun Yu and Cheng Yu Cao Cao said I own that Lu Bu is a bold fighter but nothing more he has no craftSo we need not fear him seriously Then he gave orders to make a strong camp till they could think out some victorious planLu Bu knowing of Cao Caos return called two of his subordinate generals Xue Lan and Li Feng to him and assigned to them the task of holding the city of Yanzhou saying I have long waited for opportunity to employ your skill now I give you ten thousand soldiers and you are to hold the city while I go forth to attack Cao Cao They acceptedBut Chen Gong the strategist came in hastily saying General you are going away whither I am going to camp my troops at Puyang that vantage point You are making a mistake said Chen Gong The two you have chosen to defend this city are unequal to the taskFor this expedition remember that about sixty miles due south on the treacherous road to the Taishan Mountains is a very advantageous position where you should place your best men in ambushCao Cao will hasten homeward by double marches when he hears what has happened and if you strike when half his troops have gone past this point you may seize him Said Lu Bu I am going to occupy Puyang and see what developsHow can you guess my big plan So Lu Bu left Xue Lan in command at Yanzhou and went awayNow when Cao Cao approached the dangerous part of the road near the Taishan Mountains Guo Jia warned him to take care as there was doubtless an ambush But Cao Cao laughed saying We know all Lu Bus dispositions Xue Lan is keeping the city Do you think Lu Bu has laid an ambushI shall tell Cao Ren to besiege Yanzhou and I shall go to Puyang In Puyang when Chen Gong heard of the enemys approach he spoke saying The enemy will be fatigued with long marches so attack quickly before they have time to recover Lu Bu replied I a single horseman am afraid of none I go and come as I will Think you I fear this Cao CaoLet him settle his camp I will take him after that Now Cao Cao neared Puyang and he made a campThe next day he led out his commanders and they arrayed their armies in open countryCao Cao took up his station on horseback between the two standards watching while his opponents arrived and formed up in a circular areaLu Bu was in front followed by eight of his generals all strong men Zhang Liao of Mayi backed by Hao Meng Cao Xing and Cheng Lian Zang Ba of Huaying backed by Wei Xu Song Xian and Hou ChengThey led an army of fifty thousand in totalThe drums began their thunderous roll and Cao Cao pointing to his opponent said You and I had no quarrel why then did you invade my land The empire of Han is the possession of all what is your special claim said Lu BuSo saying Lu Bu ordered Zang Ba to ride forth and challengeFrom Cao Caos side the challenge was accepted by Yue JinThe two steeds approached each other two spears were lifted both together and they exchanged near thirty blows with no advantage to eitherThen Xiahou Dun rode out to help his colleague and in reply out went Zhang Liao from Lu Bus side And they four foughtThen fierce anger seized upon Lu Bu Setting his trident halberd he urged his RedHare forward to where the fight was wagingSeeing him approach Xiahou Dun and Yue Jin both fled but Lu Bu pressed on after them and Cao Caos army lost the day Retiring ten miles they made a new campLu Bu called in and mustered his troopsThe day having gone against him Cao Cao called a council and Yu Jin said From the hill tops today I saw a camp of our enemies on the west of PuyangThey were but few men therein and tonight after todays victory it will not be defendedLet us attack and if we can take the camp we shall strike fear into the heart of Lu BuThis is our best plan Cao Cao thought so too He and six of his generalsCao Hong Li Dian Mao Jie Lu Qian Yu Jin and Dian Weiand twenty thousand horse and foot left that night by a secret road for the campIn his camp Lu Bu was rejoicing for that days victory when Chen Gong reminded him saying The western camp is importance point and it might be attacked But Lu Bu replied The enemy will not dare approach after todays defeat Cao Cao is a very able commander replied Chen GongYou must keep a good lookout for him lest he attack our weak spot So arrangements were made for defenseGenerals Gao Shun Wei Xu and Hou Cheng were ordered to march thereAt dusk Cao Cao reached the camp and began an immediate attack on all four sidesThe defenders could not hold him off They ran in all directions and the camp was capturedNear the fourth watch when the defending party came Cao Cao sallied forth to meet them and met Gao Shun Another battle then began and waged till dawn About that time a rolling of drums was heard in the west and they told Cao Cao that Lu Bu himself was at handThereupon Cao Cao abandoned the attack and fledGao Shun Wei Xu and Hou Cheng pursued him Lu Bu taking the leadCao Caos two generals Yu Jin and Yue Jin attacked the pursuers but could not check them Cao Cao went away northBut from behind some hills came out Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to attackLu Qian and Cao Hong were sent to stop the attackers but Lu Qian and Cao Hong were both defeatedCao Cao sought safety in the westHere again his retreat was met by Lu Bus four generals Hao Meng Cao Xing Cheng Lian and Song XianThe fight became desperate Cao Cao dashed at the enemys array The din was terribleArrows fell like pelting rain upon them and they could make no headwayCao Cao was desperate and cried out in fear Who can save me Then from the crush dashed out Dian Wei with his double spears crying Fear not my master Dian Wei leapt from his steed leaned his double spears against a wall and laid hold of a handful of battleaxesTurning to his followers he said When the ruffians are at ten paces call out to me Then he set off with mighty strides plunging forward careless of the flying arrowsLu Bus horsemen followed and when they got near Dian Weis followers shouted Ten paces Five then call shouted back Dian Wei and went onPresently Five paces Then Dian Wei spun round and flung the battleaxes With every fling a man fell from the saddle and never a battleax missedHaving thus slain ten or so the remainder fled and Dian Wei quickly remounted his steed set his twin spears and rushed again into the fight with a vigor that none could withstand One by one his opponents yielded and he was able to lead Cao Cao safely out of the press of battleCao Cao and his commanders went to their campBut as evening fell the noise of pursuit fell on their ears and soon appeared Lu Bu himself Cao Cao you rebel do not flee shouted Lu Bu as he approached with his halberd ready for a thrust All stopped and looked in each others faces the soldiers were weary their steeds spent Fear smote them and they looked around for some place of refugeYou may lead your lord safely out of the press But what if the enemy followWe cannot say here what Cao Caos fate was but the next chapter will relate CHAPTER Tao Qian Thrice Offers Xuzhou To Liu Bei Cao Cao Retakes Yanzhou From Lu Bu In Battles The last chapter closed with Cao Cao in great danger However help came Xiahou Dun with a body of soldiers found his chief checked the pursuit and fought with Lu Bu till duskRain fell in torrents swamping everything and as the daylight waned they drew off and Cao Cao reached campHe rewarded Dian Wei generously and advanced him in rankWhen Lu Bu reached his camp he called in his adviser Chen Gong Then Chen Gong proposed a new stratagemHe said In Puyang there is a rich leading family Tian by name who number thousands enough to populate a whole county in themselvesMake one of these people go to Cao Caos camp with a pretended secret letter about Lu Bus ferocity and the hatred of the people and their desire to be rid of himEnd by saying that only Gao Shun is left to guard the city and they would help any one who would come to save themThus our enemy Cao Cao will be inveigled into the city and we will destroy him either by fire or ambushHis skill may be equal to encompassing the universe but he will not escape Lu Bu thought this trick might be tried and they arranged for the Tian family letter to be sentComing soon after the defeat when Cao Cao felt uncertain what step to take next the secret letter was read with joyIt promised interior help and said the sign should be a white flag with the word Rectitude written thereonHeaven is going to give me Puyang said Cao Cao joyfullySo he rewarded the messenger very liberally and began to prepare for the expeditionThen came Liu Ye saying Lu Bu is no strategist but Chen Gong is full of guile I fear treachery in this letter and you must be carefulIf you will go then enter with only one third your army leaving the others outside the city as a reserve Cao Cao agreed to take this precautionHe went to Puyang which he found gay with fluttering flags Looking carefully he saw among them at the west gate the white flag with the lookedfor inscription His heart rejoicedThat day just about noon the city gates opened and two bodies of soldiers appeared as if to fight Gao Shun was the front commander and Hou Cheng the rear commanderCao Cao told off his general Dian Wei to oppose themNeither body however came on to full engagement but fell back into the cityBy this move Dian Wei and his troops had been drawn close up to the drawbridgeFrom within the city several soldiers were seen taking any chance of confusion to escape and come outside To Cao Cao they said We are clients of the Tian family and they gave him secret letters statingThe signal will be given about the first watch setting by beating a gong That will be the time to attackThe gates will be opened So Cao Cao ordered Xiahou Dun to march to the left and Cao Hong to the rightCao Cao led the main armytogether with Xiahou Yuan Li Dian and Yue Jininto the cityLi Dian pressed upon his master the precaution saying My lord should stay outside the city let us go in first But Cao Cao bade him be silent saying If I do not go who will advance And so at the first watch Cao Cao led the wayThe moon had not yet arisenAs he drew near the west gate they heard a crackling sound then a loud shouting and then torches moved hither and thitherNext the gates were thrown wide open and Cao Cao whipping up his steed galloped inBut when he reached the state residence he noticed the streets were quite deserted and then he knew he had been tricked Wheeling round his horse he shouted to his followers to retire This was the signal for another moveAn explosion of a signal bomb was heard close at hand and it was echoed from every side in a deafening roarGongs and drums beat all around with a roar like rivers rushing backward to their source and the ocean boiling up from its depths From two sides east and west came bodies of soldiers eager to attack led by Lu Bus generals Zhang Liao and Zang BaCao Cao dashed off toward the north only to find his way barred by Hao Meng and Cao XingCao Cao tried for the south gate but met enemies led by Gao Shun and Hou ChengCao Caos trusty commander Dian Wei with fierce eyes and gritting teeth at last burst through and got out with the enemy close after him But when Dian Wei reached the drawbridge he glanced behind him and missed his master Immediately Dian Wei turned back and cut an arterial alley inside Just within he met Li DianWhere is our lord cried Dian WeiI am looking for him said Li Dian Quick Get help from outside shouted Dian Wei I will seek him So Li Dian hastened for aid and Dian Wei slashed his way in looking on every side for Cao Cao He was not to be foundDashing out of the city Dian Wei ran up against Yue Jin who asked where their lord wasI have entered the city twice in search of him but cannot find him said Dian Wei Let us go in together said Yue Jin They rode up to the gateBut the noise of bombs from the gate tower frightened Yue Jins horse so that it refused to passWherefore Dian Wei alone went in butting through the smoke and dashing through the flames But he got in and searched on every sideWhen Cao Cao saw his sturdy protector Dian Wei cut his way out and disappear leaving him surrounded he again made an attempt to reach the north gateOn the way sharply outlined against the glow he saw the figure of Lu Bu coming toward him with his trident halberd ready to killCao Cao covered his face with his hand whipped up his steed and galloped pastBut Lu Bu came galloping up behind him and tapping him on the helmet with the halberd cried Where is Cao Cao Cao Cao turned and pointing to a dun horse well ahead cried There on that dunThats he Hearing this Lu Bu left pursuing Cao Cao to gallop after the rider of the dunThus relieved Cao Cao set off for the east gateThen he fell in with Dian Wei who took him under his protection and fought through the press leaving a trail of death behind till they reached the gate Here the fire was raging fiercely and burning beams were falling on all sides The earth element seemed to have interchanged with the fire element Dian Wei warded off the burning pieces of wood with his lance and rode into the smoke making a way for his lordJust as they were passing through the gate a flaming beam fell from the gate tower Cao Cao just warded it off with his arm but it struck his steed on the quarters and knocked the steed downCao Caos hand and arm were badly burned and his hair and beard singedDian Wei turned back to his rescue Luckily Xiahou Yuan came along just then and the two raised Cao Cao and set him on Xiahou Yuans horseAnd thus they got him out of the burning cityBut they had to go through heavy fighting till daybreak Cao Cao returned to his campHis officers crowded about his tent anxious for news of his health He soon recovered and laughed when he thought of his escape I blundered into that fools trap but I will have my revenge said heLet us have a new plan soon said Guo Jia I will turn his trick to my own useI will spread the false report that I was burned in the fire and that I died at the fifth watchHe will come to attack as soon as the news gets abroad and I will have an ambush ready for him in Maling HillsI will get him this time Really a fine stratagem said Guo JiaSo the soldiers were put into mourning and the report went everywhere that Cao Cao was deadAnd soon Lu Bu heard it and he assembled his army at once to make a surprise attack taking the road by the Maling Hills to his enemys campAs he was passing the hills he heard the drums beating for an advance and the ambushing soldiers leapt out all round himOnly by desperate fighting did he get out of the melee and with a sadly diminished force returned to his camp at Puyang There he strengthened the fortifications and could not be tempted forth to battleThis year locusts suddenly appeared and they consumed every green bladeThere was a famine and in the northeast grain rose to fifty strings of cash a cart People even took to cannibalismCao Caos army suffered from want and he marched them to JuanchengLu Bu took his troops to ShanyangPerforce therefore the fighting ceasedIn Xuzhou Imperial Protector Tao Qian over sixty years of age suddenly fell seriously ill and he summoned his confident Mi Zhu to his chamber to make arrangements for the futureAs to the situation the adviser said Cao Cao abandoned his attack on this place because of his enemys seizure of Yanzhou and now they are both keeping the peace solely because of the famineBut Cao Cao will surely renew the attack in the spring When Liu Bei refused to allow you to vacate office in his favor you were in full vigorNow you are ill and weak and you can make this a reason for retirementHe will not refuse again So a message was sent to the little garrison town Xiaopei calling Liu Bei to a counsel on military affairs This brought him with his brothers and a slender escort He was at once called in to the sick mans chamber Quickly disposing of the inquiries about his health Tao Qian soon came to the real object of his call for Liu BeiSir I asked you to come for the sole reason that I am dangerously ill and likely to die at any timeI look to you Illustrious Sir to consider the Hans and their empire as more important than anything else and so to take over the symbols of office of this region the commission and the seal that I may close my eyes in peace You have two sons why not depute them to relieve you said Liu Bei Both lack the requisite talentsI trust you will instruct them after I have gone but do not let them have the guidance of affairs But I am unequal to so great a charge I will recommend to you one who could assist youHe is Sun Qian from Beihai who could be appointed to some post Turning to Mi Zhu Tao Qian said The noble Liu Bei here is the most prominent man of the time and you should serve him well Still would Liu Bei have put from him such a post but just then the Imperial Protector pointing to his heart to indicate his sincerity passed awayWhen the ceremonial wailing of the officials was over the insignia of office were brought to Liu Bei But he would have none of themThe following days the inhabitants of the town and country around crowded into the state residence bowing and with tears calling upon Liu Bei to receive the charge If you do not we cannot live in pence said theyTo these requests his brothers added their persuasion till at length he consented to assume the administrative dutiesHe forthwith appointed Sun Qian and Mi Zhu as his official advisers and Chen Deng his secretaryHe moved his army from Xiaopei to Xuzhou City and he put forth proclamations to reassure the peopleHe also attended to the burial ceremonies he and all his army dressing in mourningAfter the fullest sacrifices and ceremonies a burial place for the late Imperial Protector was found close to the source of the Yellow RiverThe dead mans testament was forwarded to court The news of the events in Xuzhou duly reached the ears of Cao Cao then in Juancheng Said he angrily I have missed my revenge This Liu Bei has simply stepped into command of the region without expending half an arrow he sat still and attained his desireBut I will put him to death and then dig up Tao Qians corpse in revenge for the death of my noble father Orders were issued for the army to prepare for a new campaign against XuzhouBut Adviser Xun Yu remonstrated with Cao Cao saying The Supreme Ancestor secured the Land Within the Pass  and his illustrious successor on the throne Liu Xiu took Henei They both first consolidated their position whereby they could command the whole empire Their whole progress was from success to success Hence they accomplished their great designs in spite of difficultiesIllustrious Sir your Land Within the Pass and your Henei are Yanzhou and the Yellow River which you had first and which is of the utmost strategic point of the empireIf you undertake this expedition against Xuzhou leaving many troops here for defense you will not accomplish your design if you leave too few Lu Bu will fall upon usAnd finally if you lose this and fail to gain Xuzhou whither will you retire That region is not vacantAlthough Tao Qian has gone Liu Bei holds it and since the people support him they will fight to the death for himTo abandon this place for that is to exchange the great for the small to barter the trunk for the branches to leave safety and run into dangerI would implore you to reflect well Cao Cao replied It is not a good plan to keep soldiers idle here during such scarcity If that is so it would be more advantageous to attack the eastern counties of Chencheng Yingchuan and Runan and feed your army on their suppliesThe remnants of the Yellow Scarves He Yi and Huang Shao are there with stores and treasures of all kinds that they have amassed by plundering wherever they could Rebels of their stamp are easily broken Break them and you can feed your army with their grain Moreover both the court and the common people will join in blessing you This new design appealed strongly to Cao Cao and he quickly began his preparations to carry it outHe left Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren to guard Juancheng while his main body under his own command marched to seize Chencheng This done they went to Runan and YingchuanNow when the Yellow Scarves leaders He Yi and Huang Shao knew that Cao Cao was approaching they came out in a great body to oppose him They met at Goat HillThough the rebels were numerous they were a poor lot a mere pack of beasts without organization and lacking disciplineCao Cao ordered his strong archers and vigorous crossbowmen to keep them in check Dian Wei was sent out to challengeThe rebel leaders chose a secondrate champion for their side who rode out and was vanquished in the third boutThen Cao Caos army pushed forward and they made a camp at Goat HillThe following day the rebel Huang Shao himself led forth his army and made his battle array along a circleA leader advanced on foot to offer combat He wore a yellow turban on his head and a green robe His weapon was an iron mace He shouted I am He Man the devil who shoots across the sky who dare fight with me Cao Hong uttered a great shout and jumped from the saddle to accept the challengeSword in hand he advanced on foot and the two engaged in fierce combat in the face of both armies They exchanged some fifty blows neither gaining the advantageThen Cao Hong feigned defeat and ran away He Man went after himJust as he closed Cao Hong tried a feint and then suddenly wheeling about wounded his adversary Another slash and He Man lay deadAt once Li Dian dashed forward into the midst of the Yellow Scarves and laid hands on the rebel chief Huang Shao whom he carried off captiveCao Caos troops then set on and scattered the rebels The spoil of treasure and food was immenseThe other rebel leader He Yi fled with a few hundred horsemen toward Kobei HillsBut while on their road thither there suddenly appeared a force led by a certain swashbuckler who shall be nameless for the momentThis bravo was a wellbuilt man thickset and stout With a waist ten span in girth He used a long sword He barred the way of retreatHe Yi set his spear and rode toward him But at the first encounter the bravo caught He Yi under his arm and bore He Yi off a prisonerAll the rebels were terrorstricken dropped from their horses and allowed themselves to be bound Then the victor drove them like cattle into an enclosure with high banksPresently Dian Wei still pursuing the rebels reached Kobei Hills The swashbuckler went out to meet himAre you also a Yellow Scarf said Dian WeiI have some hundreds of them prisoners in an enclosure here Why not bring them out said Dian WeiI will if you win this sword from my hand This annoyed Dian Wei who attacked himThey engaged and the combat lasted for two long hours and then was still undecided Both rested a while The swashbuckler was the first to recover and renewed the challengeThey fought till dusk and then as their horses were quite spent the combat was once more suspendedIn the meantime some of Dian Weis men had run off to tell the story of this wondrous fight to Cao Cao who hastened in amazement followed by many officers to watch it and see the resultNext day the unknown warrior rode out again and Cao Cao saw himIn Cao Caos heart he rejoiced to see such a doughty hero and desired to gain his servicesSo Cao Cao bade Dian Wei feign defeatDian Wei rode out in answer to the challenge and some thirty bouts were fought Then Dian Wei turned and fled toward his own side The bravo followed and came quite close But a flight of arrows drove him awayCao Cao hastily drew off his men for one and a half miles and then secretly sent a certain number to dig a pitfall and sent troops armed with hooks to lie in ambushThe following day Dian Wei was sent out with one hundred horse His adversary nothing loath came to meet Dian WeiWhy does the defeated leader venture forth again cried he laughingThe swashbuckler spurred forward to join battle but Dian Wei after a faint show of fighting turned his horse and rode awayHis adversary intent upon capture took no care and he and his horse all blundered into the pitfall The hookmen took him captive bound him and carried him before Cao CaoAs soon as he saw the prisoner Cao Cao advanced from his tent sent away the soldiers and with his own hands loosened the leaders bonds Then he brought out clothing and dressed him bade him be seated and asked who he was and whence he came I am named Xu ChuI am from QiaoWhen the rebellion broke out I and my relations of some hundreds built a stronghold within a rampart for protectionOne day the robbers came but I had stones ready for them I told my relatives to keep on bringing them up to me and I threw them hitting somebody every time I threwThis drove off the robbers Another day they came and we were short of grain So I agreed with them to an exchange of plow oxen against grainThey delivered the grain and were driving away the oxen when the beasts took fright and tore off to their pens I seized two of oxen by the tail one with each hand and hauled them backwards a hundred or so pacesThe robbers were so amazed that they thought no more about oxen but went their waySo they never troubled us again I have heard of your mighty exploits said Cao Cao Will you join my army That is my strongest desire said Xu ChuSo Xu Chu called up his clan some hundreds in all and they formally submitted to Cao CaoXu Chu received the rank of general and received ample rewardsThe two rebel leaders He Yi and Huang Shao were executedRunan and Yingchuan were now perfectly pacified Cao Cao withdrew his army and went back to JuanchengXiahou Dun and Cao Ren came out to welcome him and they told him that spies had reported Yanzhou City to be left defenseless Lu Bus generals Xue Lan and Li Feng had given up all its garrison to plundering the surrounding country They wanted him to go against it without loss of time With our soldiers fresh from victory the city will fall at a tap of the drum said theySo Cao Cao marched the army straight to the cityAn attack was quite unexpected but the two leaders Xue Lan and Li Feng hurried out their few soldiers to fightXu Chu the latest recruit said he wished to capture these two and he would make of them an introductory gift The task was given him and he rode forthLi Feng with his halberd advanced to meet Xu ChuThe combat was brief as Li Feng fell in the second boutHis colleague Xue Lan retired with his troops But he found the drawbridge had been seized by Li Dian so that he could not get shelter within the cityXue Lan led his men toward JuyeBut Lu Qian pursued and killed him with an arrow His soldiers scattered to the four windsAnd thus Yanzhou was recaptured Next Cheng Yu proposed an expedition to take Puyang Cao Cao marched his army out in perfect orderThe van leaders were Dian Wei and Xu Chu Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan led the left wing Li Dian and Yue Jin led the right wing Yu Jin and Lu Qian guarded the rear Cao Cao himself commanded the centerWhen they approached Puyang Lu Bu wished to go out in person and alone to attack but his adviser Chen Gong protested saying General you should not go out until the arrival of the other officers Whom do I fear said Lu BuSo he threw caution to the winds and went out of the city He met his foes and he began to revile themThe redoubtable Xu Chu went to fight with him but after twenty bouts neither combatant was any the worseHe is not the sort that one man can overcome said Cao CaoAnd he sent Dian Wei to attack Lu Bu from another directionLu Bu stood the double onslaught Soon after the flank commanders joined in Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan attacking the left Li Dian and Yue Jin surrounding the right Lu Bu had six opponentsThese proved really too many for him so he turned his horse and rode back to the cityBut when the members of the Tian family saw him coming back beaten they raised the drawbridgeLu Bu shouted Open the gatesLet me in But the Tians said We have gone over to Cao Cao This was hard to hear and the beaten man abused them roundly before he leftChen Gong got away through the east gate taking with him the generals familyThus Puyang came into Cao Caos hands and for their present services the Tian family were pardoned their previous faultHowever Liu Ye said Lu Bu is a savage beast If let alive he will be a great dangerHunt him down Liu Ye was ordered to keep Puyang Wherefore Cao Cao determined to follow Lu Bu to Dingtao whither he had gone for refugeLu Bu Zhang Miao and Zhang Chao were assembled in the city Gao Shun and other generals were out foragingCao Cao army arrived but did not attack for many days and presently he withdrew fifteen miles and made a stockadeIt was the time of harvest and he set his soldiers to cut the wheat for foodThe spies reported this to Lu Bu who came over to seeBut when he saw that Cao Caos stockade lay near a thick wood he feared an ambush and retired Cao Cao heard that Lu Bu had come and gone and guessed the reason He fears an ambush in the wood said Cao Cao We will set up flags there and deceive himThere is a long embankment near the camp but behind it there is no waterThere we will lay an ambush to fall upon Lu Bu when he comes to burn the wood So Cao Cao hid all his soldiers behind the embankment except half a hundred drummers and he got together many peasants to loiter within the stockade as though it was not emptyLu Bu rode back and told Chen Gong what he had seenThis Cao Cao is very crafty and full of wiles said the adviserDo not act I will use fire this time and burn out his ambush said Lu BuNext morning Lu Bu rode out and there he saw flags flying everywhere in the wood He ordered his troops forward to set fire on all sides But to his surprise no one rushed out to make for the stockadeStill he heard the beating of drums and doubt filled his mind Suddenly he saw a party of soldiers move out from the shelter of the stockade He galloped over to see what it meantThen the signalbombs exploded out rushed the troops and all their leaders dashed forward Xiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Xu Chu Dian Wei Li Dian and Yue Jin all attacked at onceLu Bu was at a loss and fled into the open countryOne of his generals Cheng Lian was killed by an arrow of Yue JinTwo thirds of his troops were lost and the beaten remainder went to tell Chen Gong what had come to pass We would better leave said Chen GongAn empty city cannot be held So Chen Gong and Gao Shun taking their chiefs family with them abandoned DingtaoWhen Cao Caos soldiers got into the city they met with no resistance Zhang Chao committed suicide by burning himselfZhang Miao fled to Yuan ShuThus the whole northeast fell under the power of Cao CaoHe immediately tranquilized the people and rebuilt the cities and their defenses Lu Bu in his retreat fell in with his generals and Chen Gong also rejoined him so that he was by no means brokenI have but small army said Lu Bu but still enough to break Cao Cao And so he retook the backward road IndeedThus does fortune alternate victory defeat The happy conqueror today tomorrow must retreatWhat was the fate of Lu Bu will appear laterCHAPTER  Li Jue and Guo Si Duel In Changan The Emperor Establishes Anyi The New Capital The last chapter told of the defeat of Lu Bu and his gathering the remnant of his army at Dingtao When all his generals had joined him he began to feel strong enough to try conclusions with Cao Cao once again Said Chen Gong who was opposed to this course Cao Cao is too strong right now seek some place where we can rest a time before trying Suppose I went to Yuan Shao said Lu Bu Send first to make inquiries Lu Bu agreedThe news of the fighting between Cao Cao and Lu Bu had reached Jizhou and one of Yuan Shaos advisers Shen Pei warned him saying Lu Bu is a savage beastIf he gets possession of Yanzhou he will certainly attempt to add this region to itFor your own safety you should help to crush him Wherefore Yuan Shao sent Yan Liang with fifty thousand troops to destroy Lu BuThe spies heard this and at once told Lu Bu who was greatly disturbed and called in Chen GongGo over to Liu Bei who has lately succeeded to Xuzhou Hence Lu Bu went thitherHearing this Liu Bei said Lu Bu is a hero and we will receive him with honor But Mi Zhu was strongly against receiving him saying He was a cruel bloodthirsty beast But Liu Bei replied How would misfortune have been averted from Xuzhou if he had not attacked YanzhouHe cannot be our enemy now that he comes seeking an asylum Brother your heart is really too goodAlthough it may be as you say yet it would be well to prepare said Zhang FeiThe new Imperial Protector with a great following met Lu Bu ten miles outside the city gates and the two chiefs rode in side by sideThey proceeded to the residence and there after the elaborate ceremonies of reception were over they sat down to converseSaid Lu Bu After Wang Yun and I plotted to slay Dong Zhuo and my misfortune in the Li Jue and Guo Sis sedition I drifted about from one place to another and none of the nobles east of the Huashang Mountains seemed willing to receive meWhen Cao Cao with wicked ambition invaded this region and you Sir came to its rescue I aided you by attacking Yanzhou and thus diverting a portion of his forceI did not think then that I should be the victim of a vile plot and lose my leaders and my soldiersBut now if you will I offer myself to you that we may together accomplish great designs Liu Bei replied When the late Tao Qian died there was no one to administer Xuzhou and so I assumed that task for a timeNow since you are here General it is most suitable that I step down in your favor Whereupon Liu Bei handed the insignia and the seal of authority to Lu BuLu Bu was on the point of accepting them when he saw Guan Yu and Zhang Fei who stood behind the Imperial Protector glaring at him with angry eyesSo Lu Bu put on a smile and said I may be something of a fighting man but I could not rule a great region like this Liu Bei repeated his offerBut Chen Gong said The strong guest does not oppress his host You need not fear Lord Liu Bei Then Liu Bei desistedBanquets were held and dwelling places prepared for the guest and his retinueAs soon as convenient Lu Bu returned the feast Liu Bei went with his two brothersHalf through the banquet Lu Bu requested Liu Bei to retire to one of the inner private rooms whither Guan Yu and Zhang Fei followed himThere Lu Bu bade his wife and daughter bow as to their benefactorHere also Liu Bei showed excessive modestyLu Bu said Good Younger Brother you need not be so very modest Zhang Fei heard what Lu Bu said and his eyes glared crying What sort of a man are you that dares call our brother younger brother He is one of the ruling familya jade leaf on a golden branchCome out and I will fight you three hundred bouts for the insult Liu Bei hastily checked the impulsive one and Guan Yu persuaded him to go awayThen Liu Bei apologized saying My poor brother talks wildly after he has been drinking I hope you will not blame him Lu Bu nodded but said nothingSoon after the guests departedBut as the host escorted Liu Bei to his carriage he saw Zhang Fei galloping up armed as for a frayLu Bu you and I will fight that duel of three hundred bouts shouted Zhang Fei Liu Bei bade Guan Yu check himNext day Lu Bu came to take leave of his host You O Lord kindly received me but I fear your brothers and I cannot agreeSo I will seek some other asylum General if you go the blame is mineMy rude brother has offended and must eventually apologizeIn the meantime what think you of a temporary sojourn at the town where I was encamped for some time XiaopeiThe place is small and mean but it is near and I will see to it that you are supplied with all you need Lu Bu thanked him and accepted this offer He led his troops there and took up residenceAfter he had gone Liu Bei buried his annoyance and Zhang Fei did not again refer to the matterThat Cao Cao had subdued the east of the Huashang Mountains has been stated before He memorialized the Throne and was rewarded with the title of General Who Exhibits Firm Virtue and Lord of FeitingAt this time the rebellious Li Jue was commanding the court and he had made himself Regent Marshal and his colleague Guo Si styled himself Grand Commander Their conduct was abominable but no one dared to criticize themImperial Guardian Yang Biao and Minister Zhu Jun privately talked with Emperor Xian and said Cao Cao has two hundred thousand troops and many capable advisers and leaders it would be well for the empire if he would lend his support to the imperial family and help to rid the government of this evil party His Majesty wept I am weary of the insults and contempt of these wretches and should be very glad to have them removed I have thought of a plan to estrange Li Jue and Guo Si and so make them destroy each other Then Cao Cao could come and cleanse the court said Yang BiaoHow will you manage it asked the EmperorGuo Sis wife Lady Qiong is very jealous and we can take advantage of her weakness to bring about a quarrel So Yang Biao received instruction to act with a secret edict to support himYang Biaos wife Lady Kai made an excuse to visit Lady Qiong at her palace and in the course of conversation said There is talk of secret liaison between the General your husband and the wife of Minister Li JueIt is a great secret but if Minister Li Jue knew it he might try to harm your husbandI think you ought to have very little to do with that family Lady Qiong was surprised but said I have wondered why he has been sleeping away from home lately but I did not think there was anything shameful connected with itI should never have known if you had not spokenI must put a stop to it By and by when Lady Kai took her leave Lady Qiong thanked her warmly for the information she had givenSome days passed and Guo Si was going over to the dwelling of Li Jue to a dinner Lady Qiong did not wish him to go and she said This Li Jue is very deep and one cannot fathom his designsYou two are not of equal rank and if he made away with you what would become of your poor handmaid Guo Si paid no attention and his wife could not prevail on him to stay at homeLate in the afternoon some presents arrived from Li Jues palace and Lady Qiong secretly put poison into the delicacies before she set them before her lordGuo Si was going to taste at once but she said It is unwise to consume things that come from outsideLet us try on a dog first They did and the dog diedThis incident made Guo Si doubt the kindly intentions of his colleagueOne day at the close of business at court Li Jue invited Guo Si to his palaceAfter Guo Si arrived home in the evening rather the worse for too much wine he was seized with a colicHis wife said she suspected poison and hastily administered an emetic which relieved the painGuo Si began to feel angry saying We did everything together and helped each other always Now he wants to injure me If I do not get in the first blow I shall suffer some injury So Guo Si began to prepare his guards for any sudden emergencyThis was told to Li Jue and he in turn grew angry saying So Guo Si is doing so and so Then Li Jue got his guards under way and came to attack Guo SiBoth houses had ten thousand and the quarrel became so serious that they fought a pitched battle under the city walls When that was over both sides turned to plunder the peopleThen a nephew of Li Jue Li Xian suddenly surrounded the Palace put the Emperor and Empress in two carriages and assigned Jia Xu and Zuo Ling to carry them offThe palace attendants were made to follow on footAs they went out of the rear gate they met Guo Sis army who began to shoot at the cavalcade with arrows They killed many attendants before Li Jues army came up and forced them to retireThe carriages were got out of the Palace and eventually reached Li Jues camp while Guo Sis soldiers plundered the Palace and carried off all the women left there to their camp Then the Palace was set on fireAs soon as Guo Si heard of the whereabouts of the Emperor he came over to attack the camp of Li JueThe Emperor between these two opposing factions was greatly alarmed IndeedSlowly the Hans had declined but renewed their vigor with Liu Xiu Twelve were the rulers before him followed him also twelve othersFoolish were two of the latest dangers surrounded the altars These were degenerate days with authority given to eunuchsThen did He Jin the simple the inept who commanded the army Warriors call to the capital wishing to drive out the vermin Though they drove out the leopards tigers and wolves quickly entered All kinds of evil were wrought by a low class creature from XizhouWang Yun honest of heart beguiled this wretch with a woman Much desired of his henchman thus sowing seeds of dissension Strife resulted and peace no longer dwelt in the empireNo one suspected that Li Jue and Guo Si would continue the evil Much to the sorrow of the Middle Empire yet they stove for a trifleFamine stalked in the Palace grief for the clashing of weapons Why did the warriors strive Why was the land thus partitionedThey had turned aside from the way appointed of HeavenKings must ponder these things heavy the burden lies on them Chiefest in all the realm theirs is no common appointment Should the King falter or fail calamities fall on the multitude people The empire is drenched with their blood grisly ruin surrounds themSteeped in sorrow and sad read you the ancient records Long is the tale of years the tale of sorrow is longerWherefore one who would rule chiefly must exercise forethought This and a keenedged blade these must suffice to maintain oneGuo Sis army arrived and Li Jue went out to give battleGuo Sis troops had no success and retiredThen Li Jue removed the imperial captives to Meiwo with his nephew Li Xian as gaolerSupplies were reduced and famine showed itself on the faces of the eunuchs The Emperor sent to Li Jue to request five carts of rice and five sets of bullock bones for his attendantsLi Jue angrily replied The court gets food morning and evening why do they ask for more He sent putrid meat and rotten grain and the Emperor was very vexed at the new insultImperial Counselor Yang Qi counseled patience saying Li Jue is a base creature but under the present circumstances Your Majesty must put up with itYou may not provoke him The Emperor bowed and was silent but the tears fell on his garmentsSuddenly some one came in with the tidings that a force of cavalry their sabers glittering in the sun was approaching to rescue them Then they heard the gongs beat and the roll of the drumsThe Emperor sent to find out who it wasBut it was Guo Si and the sadness fell again Presently arose a great din For Li Jue had gone out to do battle with Guo Si whom he abused by name I treated you well and why did you try to kill me said Li JueYou are a rebel why should I not slay you cried Guo SiYou call me rebel when I am guarding the Emperor You have abducted him do you call that guarding Why so many wordsLet us forgo a battle and settle the matter in single combat the winner to take the Emperor and go The two generals fought in front of their armies but neither could prevail over the otherThen they saw Yang Biao come riding up to them crying Rest a while O CommandersFor I have invited a party of officers to arrange a peace Wherefore the two leaders retired to their campsSoon Yang Biao Zhu Jun and sixty other officials came up and went to Guo Sis camp They were all thrown into confinementWe came with good intentions they moaned and we are treated like this Li Jue has run off with the Emperor I have to have the officers said Guo SiWhat does it mean One has the Emperor the other his officers What do you want said Yang BiaoGuo Si lost patience and drew his sword but Commander Yang Mi persuaded him not to slay the speakerThen Guo Si released Yang Biao and Zhu Jun but kept the others in the campHere are we two officers of the Throne and we cannot help our lord We have been born in vain said Yang Biao to Zhu JunThrowing their arms about each other they wept and fell swooning to the earthZhu Jun went home fell seriously ill and died Thereafter the two adversaries fought every day for nearly three months each losing many soldiersNow Li Jue was irreligious and practiced magic He often called witches to beat drums and summon spirits even when in campJia Xu used to remonstrate with him but quite uselesslyYang Qi said to the Emperor That Jia Xu although a friend of Li Jue never seems to have lost the sense of loyalty to Your Majesty Soon after Jia Xu himself arrivedThe Emperor sent away his attendants and said to Jia Xu weeping the while Can you not pity the Hans and help me Jia Xu prostrated himself saying That is my dearest wishBut Sire say no more let thy servant work out a plan The Emperor dried his tears and soon Li Jue came inHe wore a sword by his side and strode straight up to the Emperor whose face became the color of clayThen Li Jue spoke Guo Si has failed in his duty and imprisoned the court officersHe wished to slay Your Majesty and you would have been captured but for me The Emperor joined his hands together in salute and thanked Li JueLi Jue went away Before long Huangfu Li entered and the Emperor knowing him as a man of persuasive tongue and that he came from the same county as Li Jue bade him go to both factions to try to arrange peaceHuangfu Li accepted the mission and first went to Guo Si who said I would release the officers if Li Jue would restore the Emperor to full liberty Huangfu Li then went to the other sideTo Li Jue he said Since I am a Xiliang man the Emperor and the officers have selected me to make peace between you and your adversaryGuo Si has consented to cease the quarrel will you agree to peace I overthrew Lu Bu I have upheld the government for four years and have many great services to my credit as all the world knowsThat other fellow that horsethief has dared to seize the officers of state and to set himself up against me I have sworn to slay him Look around youDo you not think my army large enough to break him It does not follow said Huangfu LiIn ancient days in Youqiong Hou Yi proud of and confident in his archers skill gave no thought to others and governed alone and he so perishedLately you yourself have seen the powerful Dong Zhuo betrayed by Lu Bu who had received many benefits at his hands In no time Dong Zhuos head was hanging over the gateSo you see mere force is not enough to ensure safetyNow you are a general with the axes and whips and all the symbols of rank and high office your descendants and all your clan occupy distinguished positions You must confess that the state has rewarded you liberallyTrue Guo Si has seized the officers of state but you have done the same to the Most Revered Who is worse than the other Li Jue angrily drew his sword and shouted Did the Son of Heaven send you to mock and shame me But his commander Yang Feng checked himGuo Si is still alive said Yang Feng and to slay the imperial messenger would be giving him a popular excuse to raise an army against youAnd all the nobles would join him Jia Xu also persuaded Li Jue and gradually his wrath cooled downHuangfu Li was urged to go away But Huangfu Li would not be satisfied with failureAs he went out of the camp he cried loudly Li Jue will not obey the Emperors commandHe will kill his prince to set up himself Counselor Hu Miao tried to shut Huangfu Lis mouth saying Do not utter such wordsYou will only bring hurt upon yourself But Huangfu Li shrieked at him also saying You also are an officer of state and yet you even back up the rebel When the prince is put to shame the minister dies That is our codeIf it be my lot to suffer death at the hands of Li Jue so be it And Huangfu Li maintained a torrent of abuseThe Emperor heard of the incident called in Huangfu Li and sent him away to his own country XiliangNow more than half Li Jues troops were from Xiliang and he had also the assistance of the Qiangs the tribespeople beyond the borderWhen Huangfu Li spread that Li Jue was a rebel and so were those who helped him and that there would be a day of heavy reckoning those stories disturbed the soldiersLi Jue sent one of his officers General Wang Chang of the Tiger Army to arrest Huangfu Li but Wang Chang had a sense of right and esteemed Huangfu Li as an honorable manInstead of carrying out the orders Wang Chang returned to say he could not be foundJia Xu tried to work on the feelings of the barbarian tribes He said to them The Son of Heaven knows you are loyal to him and have bravely fought and sufferedHe has issued a secret command for you to go home and then he will reward you The tribesmen had a grievance against Li Jue for not paying them so they listened readily to the insidious persuasions of Jia Xu and desertedThen Jia Xu advised the Emperor Li Jue is covetous in natureHe is deserted and enfeebled a high office should be granted to him to lead him astray So the Emperor officially appointed Li Jue Regent MarshalThis delighted him greatly and he ascribed his promotion to the potency of his wise witches prayers and incantations He rewarded those people most liberally But his army was forgottenWherefore his commander Yang Feng was angry and he said to General Song Guo We have taken all the risks and exposed ourselves to stones and arrows in his service yet instead of giving us any reward he ascribes all the credit to those witches of his Let us put him out of the way and rescue the Emperor said Song GuoYou explode a bomb within as signal and I will attack from outside So the two agreed to act together that very night in the second watchBut they had been overheard and the eavesdropper told Li JueSong Guo was seized and put to deathThat night Yang Feng waited outside for the signal and while waiting out came Li Jue himself Then a melee began which lasted till the fourth watchBut Yang Feng got away and fled to XianBut from this time Li Jues army began to fall away and he felt more than ever the losses caused by Guo Sis frequent attacksThen came news that Zhang Ji at the head of a large army was coming down from Shanxi to make peace between the two factionsZhang Ji vowed he would attack the one who was recalcitrantLi Jue tried to gain favor by hastening to send to tell Zhang Ji he was ready to make peaceSo did Guo Si So the strife of the rival factions ended at last and Zhang Ji memorialized asking the Emperor to go to Hongnong near LuoyangThe Emperor was delighted saying I have longed to go back to the east Zhang Ji was rewarded with the title of Commander of the Flying Cavalry and was highly honoredZhang Ji saw to it that the Emperor and the court had good supplies of necessariesGuo Si set free all his captive officers and Li Jue prepared transport for the court to move to the eastLi Jue told off companies of his Royal Guard to escort the cavalcade The progress had been without incident as far as XinfengNear Baling Bridge the west wind of autumn came on to blow with great violence but soon above the howling of the gale was heard the trampling of a large body of forceThey stopped at a bridge and barred the way Who comes cried a voice The Imperial Chariot is passing and who dares stop it said Yang Qi riding forwardTwo leaders of the barring party advanced to Yang Qi saying General Guo Si has ordered us to guard the bridge and stop all spiesYou say the Emperor is here we must see him and then we will let you pass So the pearl curtain was raised and the Emperor said I the Emperor am hereWhy do you not retire to let me pass Gentlemen They all shouted Long LifeLong Life and fell away to allow the cortege through But when they reported what they had done Guo Si was very angry saying I meant to outwit Zhang Ji seize the Emperor and hold him in MeiwoWhy have you let him get away He put the two officers to death set out to pursue the cavalcade and overtook it just at the county of HuayingThe noise of a great shouting arose behind the travelers and a loud voice commanded Stop the train The Emperor burst into tearsOut of the wolfs den into the tigers mouth said he No one knew what to do they were all too frightenedBut when the rebel army was just upon them they heard the beating of drums and from behind some hills came into the open a cohort of one thousand soldiers preceded by a great flag bearing the name Han General Yang FengHaving defeated by Li Jue Yang Feng fled to the foothills of the Xian and he came up to offer his services as soon as he heard the Emperors journeySeeing it was necessary to fight now he drew up his line of battleGuo Sis general Cui Yong rode out and began a volley of abuseYang Feng turned and said Where is Xu Huang In response out came a valiant warrior gripping a heavy battleaxHe galloped up on his fleet bay making directly for Cui Yong whom he felled at the first blow At this the whole force dashed forward and routed Guo SiThe defeated army went back some seven miles while Yang Feng rode forward to see the Emperor who graciously said It is a great service you have rendered you have saved my life Yang Feng bowed and thanked him and the Emperor asked to see the actual slayer of the rebel leaderSo Xu Huang was led to the chariot where he bowed and was presented as Xu Huang of Hedong The Emperor recognized the achievement of the warriorThen the cavalcade went forward Yang Feng acting as escort as far as the city of Huaying the halting place for the nightThe Commander of the place Duan Wei supplied them with clothing and foodAnd the Emperor passed the night in Yang Fengs campNext day Guo Si having mustered his troops appeared in front of the camp and Xu Huang rode out to engageBut Guo Si threw his army out so that they entirely surrounded the camp and the Emperor was in the middleThe position was very critical when help appeared in the person of a galloping general from the southeast and the rebels fell away at his assaultThen Xu Huang smote them and so scored a victoryWhen they had time to see their helper they found him to be Dong Cheng the uncle of the Emperor or the State Uncle The Emperor wept as he related his sorrows and dangersSaid Dong Cheng Be of good courage SireGeneral Yang Feng and I have pledged ourselves to kill both the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si and so purify the world The Emperor bade them travel east as soon as possible and so they went on night and day till they reached their destination Hongnong Guo Si led his defeated army back Meeting Li Jue he told Li Jue of the rescue of the Emperor and whither they was goingIf they reach the Huashang Mountains and get settled in the east they will send out proclamations to the whole country calling up the nobles to attack us and we and our families will be in danger said Guo SiZhang Ji is holding Changan and we must be carefulThere is nothing to prevent a joint attack on Hongnong when we can kill the Emperor and divide the empire between us said Li JueGuo Si found this a suitable scheme so their armies came together again in one place and united in plundering the countryside As they proceeded to Hongnong they left destruction behind themYang Feng and Dong Cheng heard of the rebels approach when they were yet a long way off so Yang Feng and Dong Cheng turned back and decided to meet them at DongjianLi Jue and Guo Si had previously made their plan Since the loyal troops were few as compared with their own horde they would overwhelm the loyal troops like a flood So when the day of battle came they poured out covering the hills and filling the plainsYang Feng and Dong Cheng devoted themselves solely to the protection of the Emperor and EmpressThe officials the attendants the archives and records and all the paraphernalia of the court were left to care for themselvesThe rebels ravaged Hongnong but the two protectors got the Emperor safely away into ShanbeiWhen the rebel generals showed signs of pursuit Yang Feng and Dong Cheng had to play a doubleedged swordThey sent to offer to discuss terms of peace with Li Jue and Guo Si at the same time they sent a secret edict to enlist the help from the leaders of the old White Wave rebels Han Xian Li Yue and Hu CaiLi Yue was actually a brigand and had inspired rebels throughout the country but the need for help was so desperateThese three being promised pardon for their faults and crimes and a grant of official rank naturally responded to the call and thus the loyal side was strengthened so that Hongnong was recapturedBut meanwhile Li Jue and Guo Si laid waste whatever place they reached slaying the aged and weakly forcing the strong to join their ranksWhen going into a fight they forced these peoplesoldiers to the front and they called them the DaretoDie soldiers Li Jue and Guo Sis force was overwhelmingWhen Li Yue the White Wave leader approached with his army Guo Si bade his soldiers scatter clothing and valuables along the road The late robbers could not resist the temptation so a scramble beganThen Guo Sis soldiers fell upon the disordered ranks and did much damageYang Feng and Dong Cheng had to take the Emperor away to the north Li Jue and Guo Si pursuedLi Yue said The danger is graveI pray Your Majesty mount a horse and go in advance The Emperor replied I cannot bear to abandon my officers They wept and struggled on as best they couldThe White Wave leader Hu Cai was killed in one attackThe enemy came very near and the Emperor left his carriage and went on foot Yang Feng and Dong Cheng escorted him to the bank of the Yellow RiverLi Yue sought a boat to ferry him to the other sideThe weather was very cold and the Emperor and Empress cuddled up close to each other shivering They reached the river but the banks were too high and they could not get down into the boatSo Yang Feng proposed to fasten together the horses bridles and lower down the Emperor slung by the waistHowever the Empress brother Fu De found some rolls of white silk from dead soldiers and they rolled up the two imperial personages in the silk and thus they lowered them down near the boatThen Li Yue took up his position in the prow leaning on his swordFu De carried the Empress on his back into the boatThe boat was too small to carry everybody and those unable to get on board clung to the cable but Li Yue cut them down and they fell into the waterThey ferried over the Emperor and then sent back the boat for the othersThere was a great scramble to get on board and they had to chop off the fingers and hands of those who persisted in clinging to the boat The lamentation rose to the heavensWhen they mustered on the farther bank many were missing only a dozen of the Emperors suite were leftYang Feng found a bullock cart and transported the Emperor and Empress to DayangThey had no food and at night sought shelter in a poor tileroofed house The cottagers gave them some boiled millet but it was too coarse to be swallowedNext day the Emperor conferred titles on those who had protected him Li Yue was made General Who Conquers the North and Han Xian was appointed General Who Conquers the East The flight continuedSoon two officers of rank came up with the cortege and they bowed before His Majesty with many tears They were Regent Marshal Yang Biao and Minister Han RongThe Emperor and Empress lifted up their voices and wept with themSaid Han Rong to his colleague The rebels have confidence in my wordsYou stay as guard of the Emperor and I will take my life in my hands and try to bring about peace After Han Rong had gone the Emperor rested for a time in Yang Fengs campBut Yang Biao requested the Emperor to head for Anyi and make the capital thereWhen the train reached the town they found it containing not a single lofty building and the court lived in grass huts devoid even of doorsThey surrounded these with a fence of thorns as a protection and within this the Emperor held counsel with his ministers The soldiers camped round the fenceNow Li Yue and his fellow ruffians showed their true colors They wielded the powers of the Emperor as they wished and officials who offended them were beaten or abused even in the presence of the EmperorThey purposely provided thick wine and coarse food for the Emperors consumption He struggled to swallow what they sentLi Yue and Han Xian joined in recommending to the Throne the names of convicts common soldiers sorcerers leeches and such people who thus obtained official ranks There were more than two hundred of such peopleAs seals could not be engraved pieces of metal were hammered into some sort of a shapeNow Han Rong went to see Li Jue and Guo SiAfter listening to his vigorous persuasions the two rebel generals agreed to set free the officials and palace peopleA famine occurred that same year and people were reduced to eating grass from the roadside Starving they wandered hither and thitherBut food and clothing were sent to the Emperor from the governor of Henei Zhang Yang and the governor of Hedong Wang Yi and the court began to enjoy a little reposeDong Cheng and Yang Feng sent laborers to restore the palaces in Luoyang with the intention of moving the court thitherLi Yue was opposed to thisDong Cheng argued Luoyang is the original capital as opposed to the paltry town of AnyiRemoval would be but reasonable Li Yue wound up by saying You may get the court to remove but I shall remain here But when the consent of the Emperor had been given and a start made Li Yue secretly sent to arrange with Li Jue and Guo Si to capture the Emperor However this plot leaked out and the escort so arranged as to prevent such a thing and they pressed on to the pass at Zhiguan Hills as rapidly as possibleLi Yue heard this and without waiting for his rebel colleagues to join him set out to act aloneAbout the fourth watch just as the cavalcade was passing Zhiguan Hills a voice was heard shouting Stop those carriagesLi Jue and Guo Si are here This frightened the Emperor greatly and his terror increased when he saw the whole mountain side suddenly light up IndeedThe rebel party erstwhile split in twain To work their wicked will now join three againHow the Son of Heaven escaped this peril will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER Cao Cao Moves The Court To Xuchang Lu Bu NightRaids Xuzhou The last chapter closed with the arrival of Li Yue who shouted out falsely that the army was that of the two arch rebels Li Jue and Guo Si come to capture the imperial cavalcade But Yang Feng recognized the voice of Li Yue and bade Xu Huang go out to fight himXu Huang went and in the first bout the traitor fellThe White Wave rebels scattered and the travelers got safely through Zhiguan Hills Here the Governor of Henei Zhang Yang supplied them plentifully with food and other necessaries and escorted the Emperor to ZhidaoFor his timely help the Emperor conferred upon Zhang Yang the rank of a Grand CommanderYang Feng moved his army to the northeast of Luoyang and camped at YewangCapital Luoyang was presently entered Within the walls all was destruction The palaces and halls had been burned the streets were overgrown with grass and brambles and obstructed by heaps of ruins The palaces and courts were represented by broken roofs and toppling wallsA small palace however was soon built and therein the officers of court presented their congratulations standing in the open air among thorn hushes and bramblesThe reign style was changed from Prosperous Stability to Rebuilt Tranquillity the first year The year was a year of grievous famineThe Luoyang people even reduced in numbers as they were to a few hundreds had not enough to eat and they prowled about stripping the bark off trees and grubbing up the roots of plants to satisfy their starving hunger Officers of the government of all but the highest ranks went out into the country to gather fuelMany people were crushed by the falling walls of burned housesAt no time during the decadence of Han did misery press harder than at this period A poem written in pity for the sufferings of that time saysMortally wounded the white serpent poured forth its life blood at Mangdang Hills Bloodred pennons of war waved then in every quarter Chieftain with chieftain strove and raided each others borders Midst the turmoil and strife the Kingship even was threatenedWickedness stalks in a country when the King is a weakling Brigandage always is rife when a dynastys failing Had one a heart of iron wholly devoid of feeling Yet would one surely grieve at the sight of such desolationRegent Marshal Yang Biao memorialized the Throne saying The decree issued to me some time ago has never been acted uponNow Cao Cao is very strong in the east of Huashang Mountains and it would be well to associate him in the government that he might support the ruling house The Emperor replied There was no need to refer to the matter againSend a messenger when you will So the decree went forth and a messenger bore it into the East of HuashangNow when Cao Cao had heard that the court had returned to Capital Luoyang he called together his advisers to consult Xun Yu laid the matter before Cao Cao and the council thus Eight hundred years ago Lord Wen of Yin supported Prince Xiang of the declining Shang Dynasty and all the feudal lords backed Lord WenThe Founder of the Hans Liu Bang won the popular favor by wearing mourning for Emperor Yi of QinNow Emperor Xian has been a fugitive on the dusty roads To take the lead in offering an army to restore him to honor is to have an unrivaled opportunity to win universal regardBut you must act quickly or some one will get in before you Cao Cao understood and at once prepared his army to moveJust at this moment an imperial messenger was announced with the very command Cao Cao wanted and Cao Cao immediately set out At Luoyang everything was desolateThe walls had fallen and there were no means of rebuilding them while rumors and reports of the coming of Li Jue and Guo Si kept up a state of constant anxietyThe frightened Emperor spoke with Yang Feng saying What can be doneThere is no answer from the East of Huashang and our enemies are near Then Yang Feng and Han Xian said We your ministers will fight to the death for you But Dong Cheng said The fortifications are weak and our military resources small so that we cannot hope for victory and what does defeat meanI see nothing better to propose than a move into the east of Huashang Mountains The Emperor agreed to this and the journey began without further preparationThere being few horses the officers of the court had to march afootHardly a bowshot outside the gate they saw a thick cloud of dust out of which came all the clash and clamor of an advancing armyThe Emperor and his Consort were dumb with fearThen appeared a horseman he was the messenger returning from the East of Huashang He rode up to the chariot made an obeisance and said General Cao Cao as commanded is coming with all the military force of the East of Huashang but hearing that Li Jue and Guo Si had again approached the capital he has sent Xiahou Dun in advanceWith Xiahou Dun are many capable leaders and fifty thousand of proved soldiers They will guard Your Majesty All fear was swept awaySoon after Xiahou Dun and his staff arrivedXiahou Dun Xu Chu and Dian Wei were presented to the Emperor who graciously addressed themThen one came to say a large army was approaching from the east and at the Emperors command Xiahou Dun went to ascertain who these wereHe soon returned saying they were Cao Caos infantryIn a short time Cao Hong Li Dian and Yue Jin came to the imperial chariot and their names having been duly communicatedCao Hong said When my brother Cao Cao heard of the approach of the rebels he feared that the advance guard he had sent might be too weak so he sent me to march quickly for reinforcement General Cao Cao is indeed a trusty servant said the EmperorOrders were given to advance Cao Hong leading the escortBy and by scouts came to say that the rebels were coming up very quicklyThe Emperor bade Xiahou Dun divide his force into two parts to oppose themXiahou Dun and Cao Hongs armies threw out two wings with cavalry in front and foot behindThey attacked with vigor and beat off the Li Jue and Guo Sis rebels with severe loss of ten thousandThen Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong begged the Emperor to return to Luoyang and Xiahou Dun guarded the cityNext day Cao Cao came with his great army and having got them duly camped he went into the city to audienceHe knelt at the foot of the steps but was called up hither to stand beside the Emperor and be thankedCao Cao replied Having been the recipient of great bounty thy servant owes the state much gratitudeThe measure of evil of the two rebels is full I have two hundred thousand of good soldiers to oppose them and those soldiers are fully equal to securing the safety of Your Majesty and the ThroneThe preservation of the state sacrifice is the matter of real moment High honors were conferred on Cao CaoHe was appointed Commander of Capital District Minister of War and granted Military InsigniaThe two rebels Li Jue and Guo Si wished to attack Cao Caos army while fatigued from its long marchBut their adviser Jia Xu opposed this saying There was no hope of victory He has both strong soldiers and brave leadersSubmission may bring us amnesty Li Jue was angry at the suggestion crying Do you wish to dishearten the army And he drew his sword on Jia Xu But the other officers interceded and saved the adviserThat same night Jia Xu stole out of the camp and quite alone took his way home to his native villageSoon the rebels decided to offer battle In reply Cao Cao sent out Xu Chu Cao Ren and Dian Wei with three hundred horse These three leaders dashed into the rebels army but quickly retiredThis maneuver was repeated and again repeated before the real battle array was formed Then Li Xian and Li Bie nephews of Li Jue rode out At once from Cao Caos side dashed out Xu Chu and cut down Li XianLi Bie was so startled that he fell out of the saddle He too was slain The victor Xu Chu rode back to his own side with the two headsWhen he offered them to the chief Cao Cao patted him on the back crying You are really my Fan Kuai  Next a general move forward was made Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong leading the two wings and Cao Cao in the center They advanced to the roll of the drumThe rebels fell back before them and presently fledThey pursued Cao Cao himself leading sword in hand The slaughter went on till night Ten thousands were killed and many more surrenderedLi Jue and Guo Si went west flying in panic like dogs from a falling houseHaving no place of refuge they took to the hills and hid among the brushwoodCao Caos army returned and camped again near the capitalThen Yang Feng and Han Xian said one to another This Cao Cao has done a great service and he will be the man in powerThere will be no place for us So they represented to the Emperor that they wished to pursue the rebels and under this excuse withdrew their army and camped at DaliangOne day the Emperor sent to summon Cao Cao to audience The messenger was called inCao Cao noticed that the messenger looked remarkably well and could not understand it seeing that everyone else looked hungry and famine strickenSo Cao Cao said You look plump and well Sir how do you manage it Only this I have lived meager for thirty years Cao Cao nodded What office do you hold I am a graduate recommended for filial piety and honestyI had offices under Yuan Shao and Zhang Yang but came here when the Emperor returned Now I am one of the secretariesI am a native of Dingtao and my name is Dong Zhao Cao Cao got up from his place and crossed over saying I have heard of youHow happy I am to meet you Then wine was brought into the tent and Xun Yu was called in and introducedWhile they were talking a man came in to report that a party was moving eastwardCao Cao ordered to find out whose people these were but Dong Zhao knew at onceThey are old leaders under the rebels Yang Feng and the White Wave General Han XianThey are running off because you have come Illustrious Sir Do they mistrust me said Cao Cao They are not worthy of your attentionThey are a poor lot What of this departure of Li Jue and Guo Si Tigers without claws birds without wingsthey will not escape you very longThey are not worth thinking about Cao Cao saw that he and his guest had much in common so he began to talk of affairs of stateSaid Dong Zhao You Illustrious Sir with your noble army have swept away rebellion and have become the mainstay of the Throne an achievement worthy of the ancient Five ProtectorsBut the officials will look at it in very different ways and not all favorably to youI think you would not be wise to remain here and I advise a change of capital to XuchangHowever it must be remembered that the restoration of the capital has been published far and wide and the attention of all the people is concentrated on Luoyang hoping for a period of rest and tranquillityAnother move will displease manyHowever the performance of extraordinary deed may mean the acquisition of extraordinary merit It is for you to decide Exactly my own inclination said Cao Cao seizing his guests hand But are there not dangers Yang Feng at Daliang and the court officials That is easily managedWrite to Yang Feng and set his mind at restThen say to the high officials plainly that there is no food in the capital here and so you are going to another place where there is and where there is no danger of scarcityWhen they hear it they will approve Cao Cao had now decided and as his guest took leave Cao Cao seized his hands once more saying I shall need your advice in future affairs Dong Zhao thanked and leftThereafter Cao Cao and his advisers secretly discussed the change of capital Now as to that Court Counselor Wang Li who was an astrologer said to Liu Ai Chair of the Imperial Office I have been studying the stars Since last spring Venus has been nearing the Guard star in the neighborhood of the Measure and the Cowherd  crossing the River of Heaven Mars has been retrograding and came into conjunction with Venus in the Gate of Heaven so that Metal  are mingled Thence must emerge a new rulerThe aura of the Hans is exhausted and the ancient states of Jin and Wei must increase A secret memorial was presented to the Emperor sayingThe Mandate of Heaven has its course and the five elementsmetal wood water fire and earthare out of proportionEarth attacking Fire is Wei attacking Han and the successor to the empire of Han is in Wei Cao Cao heard of these sayings and memorials and sent a man to the astrologer to say Your loyalty is well known but the ways of Heaven are past finding outThe less said the better Then Cao Cao discussed with Xun YuThe adviser expounded the meaning thus The virtue of Han was fire your element is earthXuchang is under the influence of earth and so your fortune depends on getting thereFire can overcome earth as earth can multiply wood Dong Zhao and Wang Li agree and you have only to hide your time So Cao Cao made up his mindNext day at court he said The capital is deserted and cannot be restored nor can it be supplied easily with foodXuchang is a noble city resourceful and close to Luyang a grain basinIt is everything that a capital should beI venture to request that the court move thither The Emperor dared not oppose and the officials were too overawed to have any independent opinion so they chose a day to set outCao Cao commanded the escort and the officials all followedWhen they had traveled a few stages they saw before them a high mound and from behind this there arose the beating of drumsThen Yang Feng and Han Xian came out and barred the wayIn front of all stood Xu Huang who shouted Cao Cao is stealing away the Emperor Cao Cao rode out and took a good look at this manHe seemed a fine fellow and in his secret soul Cao Cao greatly admired him although he was an enemyThen Cao Cao ordered Xu Chu to go and fight Xu HuangThe combat was battleax against broadsword and the two men fought more than half a hundred bouts without advantage to either side Cao Cao then beat the gongs and drew off his troops In the camp a council was calledCao Cao said The two rebels themselves need not be discussed but Xu Huang is a fine general and I was unwilling to use any great force against himI want to win him over to our side Then stepped out Man Chong replying Do not let that trouble you I will have a word with himI shall disguise myself as a soldier this evening and steal over to the enemys camp to talk to himI shall incline his heart toward you That night Man Chong duly disguised got over to the other side and made his way to the tent of Xu Huang who sat there by the light of a candle Xu Huang was still wearing his coat of mailSuddenly Man Chong ran out in front and saluted saying You have been well since we parted old friend Xu Huang jumped up in surprise gazed into the face of the speaker a long time and presently said What You are Man Chong of ShanyangWhat are you doing here I am an officer in General Cao Caos armySeeing my old friend out in front of the army today I wanted to say a word to himSo I took the risk of stealing in this evening and here I am Xu Huang invited Man Chong in and they sat downThen said Man Chong There are very few as bold as you on the earth why then do you serve such as your present chiefs Yang Feng and Han XianMy master is the most prominent man in the worlda man who delights in wise people and appreciates soldiers as every one knowsYour valor today won his entire admiration and so he took care that the attack was not vigorous enough to sacrifice you Now he has sent me to invite you to join himWill you not leave darkness for light and help him in his magnificent task Xu Huang sat a long time pondering over the offerThen he said with a sigh I know my masters are doomed to failure but I have followed their fortunes a long time and do not like to leave them But you know the prudent bird selects its tree and the wise servant chooses his masterWhen one meets a worthy master and lets him go one is very reckless I am willing to do what you say said Xu Huang risingWhy not put these two to death as an introductory gift said Man ChongIt is very wrong for a servant to slay his masterI will not do that True you are really a good man Then Xu Huang taking only a few horsemen of his own men with him left that night and deserted to Cao CaoSoon some one took the news to Yang Feng who at the head of a thousand strong horsemen set out to capture the deserter As they drew close Yang Feng called out Betrayer Stop there But Yang Feng fell into an ambushSuddenly the whole mountain side was lit up with torches and out sprang Cao Caos troops he himself being in command I have been waiting here a long time do not run away cried Cao CaoYang Feng was completely surprised and tried to draw off but was quickly surroundedThen Han Xian came to his rescue and a confused battle began Yang Feng succeeded in escaping while Cao Cao kept up the attack on the two disordered armiesA great number of the rebels gave in and the leaders found they had too few men left to maintain their independence so they betook themselves to Yuan ShuWhen Cao Cao returned to camp the newly surrendered general was presented and well received Then again the cavalcade set out for the new capitalIn due time they reached Xuchang and they built palaces and halls an ancestral temple and an altar terraces and public offices The walls were repaired storehouses built and all put in order Then came the rewards for Cao Caos adherents and othersDong Cheng and thirteen others were raised to rank of lordshipAll good service was rewarded certain others again who deserved it were punished all according to Cao Caos sole decision He himself was made Prime Minister Regent Marshal and Lord of WupingXun Yu was made Imperial Counselor and Chair of the Secretariat Xun You Minister of War Guo Jia Minister of Rites and Religion Liu Ye Minister of Works Mao Jie Minister of Agriculture and together with Ren Jun they were put over the military stores Cheng Yu was appointed Lord of Dongping Dong Zhao Magistrate of Luoyang Man Chong Magistrate of Xuchang Xiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Cao Ren Cao Hong Lu Qian Li Dian Yue Jin Yu Jin and Xu Huang were made Commanders Xu Chu and Dian Wei Commanders of Capital District All good service received full recognition Cao Cao was then the one man of the courtAll memorials went first to him and were then submitted to the Throne When state matters were in order Cao Cao gave a great banquet in his private quarters to all his advisers and affairs outside the capital were the subject of discussionThen Cao Cao said Liu Bei has his army at Xuzhou and he carries on the administration of the regionLu Bu fled to Liu Bei when defeated and Liu Bei gave Lu Bu Xiaopei to live in If these two agreed to join forces and attack my position would be most seriousWhat precautions can be taken Then rose Xu Chu saying Give me fifty thousand of picked soldiers and I will give the Prime Minister both their heads Xun Yu said O Leader you are brave but we must consider the present circumstanceWe cannot start sudden war just as the capital has been changedHowever there is a certain ruse known as Rival Tigers and One Prey Liu Bei has no decree authorizing him to govern the regionYou Sir Prime Minister can procure one for him and when sending it and so conferring upon him right in addition to his might you can enclose a private note telling him to get rid of Lu BuIf he does then he will have lost a vigorous warrior from his side and he could be dealt with as occasions serveShould he fail then Lu Bu will slay him This is Rival Tigers and One Prey ruse they wrangle and bite each other Cao Cao agreed that this was a good plan so he memorialized for the formal appointment which he sent to Liu BeiLiu Bei was created General Who Conquers the East Lord of Yicheng and Imperial Protector of Xuzhou as wellAt the same time a private note was enclosedIn Xuzhou when Liu Bei heard of the change of capital he began to prepare a congratulatory addressIn the midst of this an imperial messenger was announced and was met which all ceremony outside the gate When the epistle had been reverently received a banquet was prepared for the messengerThe messenger said This decree was obtained for you by Prime Minister Cao Cao Liu Bei thanked himThen the messenger drew forth his secret letter After reading it Liu Bei said This matter can be easily arranged The banquet over and the messenger conducted to his lodging to seek repose Liu Bei before going to rest called in his councilors to consider the letterThere need be no compunction about putting him to death said Zhang Fei Lu Bu is a bad man But he came to me for protection in his weakness how can I put him to death That would be immoral said Liu BeiIf he was a good man it would be difficult replied Zhang Fei Liu Bei would not consentNext day when Lu Bu came to offer congratulations he was received as usualHe said I have come to felicitate you on the receipt of the imperial bounty Liu Bei thanked him in due formBut then he saw Zhang Fei draw his sword and come up the hall as if to slay Lu Bu Liu Bei hastily interfered and stopped Zhang FeiLu Bu was surprised and said Why do you wish to slay me Zhang Fei Cao Cao says you are immoral and tells my brother to kill you shouted Zhang FeiLiu Bei shouted again and again to Zhang Fei to go away and he led Lu Bu into the private apartments out of the wayThen he told Lu Bu the whole story and showed him the secret letterLu Bu wept as he finished reading This is that miscreants scheme for sowing discord between us Be not anxious Elder Brother said Liu BeiI pledge myself not to be guilty of such an infamous crime Lu Bu again and again expressed his gratitude and Liu Bei kept him for a timeThey remained talking and drinking wine till lateSaid Guan Yu and Zhang Fei later Why not kill him Liu Bei said Because Cao Cao fears that Lu Bu and I may attack him he is trying to separate us and get us to swallow each other while he steps in and takes the advantage Is there any other reason Guan Yu nodded assent but Zhang Fei said I want to get him out of the way lest he trouble us later That is not what a noble man should do said his elder brother Soon the messenger was dismissed and returned to the capital with a the reply from Liu BeiThe letter only said the instruction would take time to plan and implementBut the messenger when he saw Cao Cao told him the story of Liu Beis pledge to Lu BuThen said Cao Cao The plan has failed what next Xun Yu replied I have another trick called Tiger against Wolf in which the tiger is made to gobble up the wolf Let us hear it said Cao CaoSend to Yuan Shu to say that Liu Bei has sent up a secret memorial to the Throne that he wishes to subdue the southern regions around the Huai RiverYuan Shu will be angry and attack himThen you will order Liu Bei to dispose of Yuan Shu and so set them destroying each otherLu Bu will certainly think that is his chance and turn traitor This is the Tiger against Wolf trick Cao Cao thought this good and sent the messenger and also sent a false edict to Liu BeiWhen this came the messenger was received with all the ceremonies and the edict ordered the capture of Yuan Shu After the departure of the bearer Liu Bei called Mi Zhu who pronounced it a ruseIt may be said Liu Bei but the royal command is not to be disobeyed So the army was prepared and the day fixedSun Qian said A trusty man must be left on guard of the city And Liu Bei asked which of his brothers would undertake this taskI will guard the city said Guan YuI am constantly in need of your advice so how can we part said Liu BeiI will guard the city said Zhang Fei You will fail said Liu Bei After one of your drinking bouts you will get savage and flog the soldiersBeside you are rash and will not listen to any ones adviceI shall be uneasy all the time Henceforth I drink no more wine I will not beat the soldiers and I will always listen to advice said Zhang FeiI fear the mouth does not correspond to the heart said Mi ZhuI have followed my elder brother these many years and never broken faith why should you be contemptuous said Zhang FeiLiu Bei said Though you say this I do not feel quite satisfiedI will order Adviser Chen Deng to help you and keep you soberThen you will not make any mistake Chen Deng was willing to undertake this duty and the final orders were given The army of thirty thousand horse and foot left Xuzhou and marched toward Nanyang When Yuan Shu heard that a memorial had been presented proposing to take possession of his territories he broke out into abuse of Liu Bei You weaver of mats You plaiter of straw shoes You have been smart enough to get possession of a large region and elbow your way into the ranks of the noblesI was just going to attack you and now you dare to scheme against meHow I detest you So Yuan Shu at once gave orders to prepare an army of one hundred thousand under Ji Ling to attack XuzhouThe two armies met at Xuyi where Liu Bei was encamped in a plain with hills behind and a stream on his flank for his army was smallJi Ling was a native of the East of Huashang He used a very heavy threeedged swordAfter he had made his camp he rode out and began abusing his opponents shouting Liu Bei you rustic bumpkin how dare you invade this land I have a decree ordering me to destroy the Governor who behaves improperlyIf you oppose you will be assuredly punished replied Liu BeiJi Ling angrily rode out brandishing his weaponBut Guan Yu cried Fool do not attempt to fight And Guan Yu rode out to meet himThen they two fought and after thirty bouts neither had an advantageThen Ji Ling cried out for a rest So Guan Yu turned his horse away rode back to his own array and waited for Ji LingWhen the moment came to renew the combat Ji Ling sent out one of his officers Xun Zheng to take his placeBut Guan Yu said Tell Ji Ling to come I must settle with him who shall be tiger and who shall be deer You a reputationless leader and unworthy to fight with our general replied Xun ZhengThis reply angered Guan Yu who made just one attack on Xun Zheng and brought him to the ground At this success Liu Bei urged on the army and Ji Lings troops were defeatedThey retired to the mouth of the River Huaiyin and declined all challengesHowever many of their troops were sent into Liu Beis camp for harassment and many of them were slainThe two armies thus stood facing each other In Xuzhou after Liu Bei had started on his expedition Zhang Fei placed his colleague and helper Chen Deng in charge of the administration of the region keeping military affairs under his own supervisionAfter thinking over the matter or some time he gave a banquet to all the military officers and when they were all seated he made a speech Before my brother left he bade me keep clear of the wine cup for fear of accidentsNow gentlemen you may drink deep today but from tomorrow wine is forbidden for we must keep the city safeSo take your fill And with this he and all his guests rose to drink togetherThe wine bearer came to Cao Bao who declined it saying I never drink as I am forbidden of heaven WhatA fighting man does not drink wine said the hostI want you to take just one cup Cao Bao was afraid to offend so he drankNow Zhang Fei drank huge goblets with all his guests on every hand and so swallowed a huge quantity of liquor He became quite intoxicated Yet he would drink more and insisted on a cup with every guestIt came to the turn of Cao Bao who declined Really I cannot drink said Cao BaoYou drank just now why refuse this time Zhang Fei pressed him but still Cao Bao resistedThen Zhang Fei in his drunken madness lost control of his temper and said If you disobey the orders of your general you shall be beaten one hundred strokes And he called in his guards Here Chen Deng interfered reminding him of the strict injunctions of his brotherYou civilians attend to your civil business and leave us alone said Zhang FeiThe only way of escape for the guest was to beg remission and Cao Bao did so Sir if you saw my soninlaws face you would pardon me Who is your soninlaw Lu Bu I did not mean to have you really beaten but if you think to frighten me with Lu Bu I willI will beat you as if I was beating him said Zhang FeiThe guests interposed to beg him off but their drunken host was obdurate and the unhappy guest received fifty blows Then at the earnest prayers of the others the remainder of the punishment was remittedThe banquet came to an end and the beaten Cao Bao went away burning with resentment That night he sent a letter to Xiaopei relating the insults he had received from Zhang Fei The letter told Lu Bu of Liu Beis absence and proposed that a sudden raid should be made that very night before Zhang Fei had recovered from his drunken fitLu Bu at once summoned Chen Gong and told himXiaopei is only a place to occupy temporarily said Chen GongIf you can seize Xuzhou do soIt is a good chance Lu Bu got ready at once and soon on the way with five hundred cavalrymen ordering Chen Gong and Gao Shun to follow him with the main bodyXiaopei being only about fifteen miles away Lu Bu was under the walls at the fourth watch It was clear moonlight No one on the ramparts saw himLu Bu came up close to the wall and called out Liu Beis secret messenger has arrived The guards on the wall were Cao Baos people and they called himCao Bao came and when he saw who was there he ordered the gates to be openedLu Bu gave the secret signal and the soldiers entered shouting Zhang Fei was in his apartment sleeping off the fumes of wine His servants hastened to arouse him and told him an enemy had got the gates openThey said Lu Bu got in and there is fighting in the city Zhang Fei savagely got into his armor and laid hold of his mighty octaneserpent halberdBut as he was mounting his horse at the gate the attacking soldiers came upHe rushed at them but being still half intoxicated made but a poor fightLu Bu knowing Zhang Feis prowess did not press him hard and Zhang Fei made his way with eighteen leading Guards of Yan to the east gate and there went out leaving Liu Beis family to their fate Cao Bao seeing Zhang Fei had but a very small force and was still half drunk as well came in pursuit Zhang Fei saw who it was and was mad with rage He galloped toward Cao Bao and drove him off after a few passes He followed Cao Bao to the moat and wounded him in the backCao Baos frightened steed carried its master into the moat and he was drownedOnce well outside the city Zhang Fei collected his troops and they rode off toward the south directionLu Bu having surprised the city set himself to restore order He put a guard over the residence of Liu Bei so that no one should disturb the family Zhang Fei with his few followers went to his brothers camp and told his story of treachery and surpriseAll were greatly distressedSuccess is not worth rejoicing over failure is not worth grieving over said Liu Bei with a sighWhere are our sisters asked Guan Yu They shared the fate of the city Liu Bei nodded his head and was silentGuan Yu with an effort controlled his reproaches and said What did you say when you promised to guard the city and what orders did our brother give youNow the city is lost and therewith our sistersinlaw Have you done well Zhang Fei was overwhelmed by remorse He drew his sword to kill himselfHe raised the cup in pledge None might say nay Remorseful drew the sword Himself to slay Zhang Feis fate will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER Taishi Ci Fights With The Little Prince Sun Ce Cuts Short The White Tiger King In the last chapter it was recorded that Zhang Fei was about to end his life with his own weapon in Xuyi But Liu Bei rushed forward and caught Zhang Fei in his arms snatched away the sword and threw it on the earth saying Brothers are as hands and feet wives and children are as clothingYou may mend your torn dress but who can reattach a lost limbWe three by the Oath of the Peach Garden swore to seek the same death dayThe city is lost it is true and my wives and little ones but I could not bear that we should die ere our course be runBeside Xuzhou was not really ours and Lu Bu will not harm my family but will rather seek to preserve themYou made a mistake Worthy Brother but is it one deserving of death And Liu Bei weptHis brothers were much affected and their tears fell in sympathyAs soon as the news of Lu Bus successful seizure of his protectors region reached Yuan Shu Yuan Shu sent promises of valuable presents to Lu Bu to induce him to join in a further attack on Liu Bei The presents are said to have been fifty thousand carts of grain five hundred horses ten thousand ounces of gold and silver and a thousand rolls of colored silkLu Bu swallowed the bait and ordered Gao Shun to lead forth fifty thousand troopsBut Liu Bei heard of the threatened attack so he made inclement weather an excuse to moved his few soldiers out of Xuyi for Guangling before the attacking force came upHowever Gao Shun demanded the promised reward through Ji Ling who put Gao Shun off saying My lord has gone away I will settle this as soon as I can see him and get his decision With this answer Gao Shun returned to Lu Bu who could not decide what to doThen came a letter from Yuan Shu saying Although Gao Shun had gone to attack Liu Bei yet Liu Bei had not been destroyed and no reward could be given till he was actually taken Lu Bu railed at what he called the breach of faith and was inclined to attack Yuan Shu himself However his adviser Chen Gong opposed this course saying You should not Yuan Shu is in possession of Shouchun and has a large army well supplied You are no match for himRather ask Liu Bei to take up his quarters at Xiaopei as one of your wings and when the time comes let him lead the attack both south and northThen Yuan Shu and Yuan Shao will fall before you and you will be very powerful Finding this advice good Lu Bu sent letters to Liu Bei asking him to returnAfter the flight of Liu Bei Yuan Shu attacked Guangling and reduced Liu Beis force by halfWhen the messenger from Lu Bu came Liu Bei read the letter He was quite content with the offer but his brothers were not inclined to trust Lu BuSuch a dishonorable man must have a motive said Guan Yu and Zhang FeiSince he treats me kindly I cannot but trust him replied Liu BeiSo Liu Bei went back to XuzhouLu Bu fearing that Liu Bei might doubt his sincerity restored Liu Beis family and when Lady Gan and Lady Mi saw their lord they told him that they had been kindly treated and guarded by soldiers against any intrusion and provisions had never been wantingI knew he would not harm my family said Liu Bei to Guan Yu and Zhang Fei However Zhang Fei was not pleased and would not accompany his brothers into the city when they went to express their thanksHe went to escort the two ladies to Xiaopei At the interview Lu Bu said I did not wish to take the city but your brother behaved very badly drinking and flogging the soldiers and I came to guard it lest some evil should befall But I had long wished to yield it to you said Liu Bei Thereupon Lu Bu wished to retire in favor of Liu Bei who however would not hear of itLiu Bei returned and took up his quarters in Xiaopei but his two brothers would not take the situation kindly and were very discontentedSaid Liu Bei One must bow to ones lotIt is the will of Heaven and one cannot struggle against fate Lu Bu sent presents of food and stuffs and peace reigned between the two housesIn Shouchun Yuan Shu prepared a great banquet for his soldiers when it was announced that Sun Ce had subdued Lu Kang the Governor of LujiangYuan Shu summoned the victor who made obeisance at the foot of the hall of audienceYuan Shu sitting in state asked for details of the campaign and then invited Sun Ce to the banquetAfter the unhappy death of his father Sun Jian Sun Ce had returned to the lower region of the Great River where he had devoted himself to peaceful ends inviting to his side good people and able scholarsAfterwards when a quarrel broke out between his mothers brother Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang and the late Imperial Protector of Xuzhou Tao Qian Sun Ce removed his mother with all the family to Que he himself taking service under Yuan Shu who admired and loved him greatlyIf I had a son like Sun Ce said Yuan Shu I should die without regret Yuan Shu appointed Sun Ce Commander and sent him on various expeditions all of which were successfulAfter this banquet to celebrate the victory over Lu Kang Sun Ce returned to his camp very bitter over the arrogant and patronizing airs of his patronInstead of retiring to his tent Sun Ce walked up and down by the light of the moonHere am I a mere nobody and yet my father was such a hero And he cried out and wept in spite of himselfThen suddenly appeared one who said laughing loudly What is this Sun CeWhile your noble father enjoyed the light of the sun he made free use of me and if his son has any difficulty to resolve why does he not refer it to me also instead of weeping here alone Looking at the speaker Sun Ce saw it was Zhu Zhi a native of Dangyang who had been in Sun Jians serviceSun Ce then ceased weeping and they two sat down I was weeping from regret at being unable to continue my fathers work said Sun Ce Why stay here bound to the service of a master The Governor of Dangyang is in distressWhy not get command of an army under the pretense of an expedition to relieve Wu JingEscape the shadow of Yuan Shu and take control of Dangyang then you can accomplish great things While these two were talking another man suddenly entered saying I know what you two are planning Noble SirsUnder my hand is a band of one hundred bold fellows ready to help Sun Ce in whatever he wishes to do The speaker was one of Yuan Shus advisers named Lu Fan from RunanThey three then sat and discussed schemesThe one fear is that Yuan Shu will refuse to give you the troops said Lu FanI still have the Imperial Hereditary Seal that my father left me that should be good security Yuan Shu earnestly desires that jewel said Zhu ZhiHe will certainly lend you troops on that pledge The three talked over their plans gradually settling the details and not many days after Sun Ce obtained an interview with his patron Assuming the appearance of deep grief Sun Ce said I have been unable to avenge my fatherNow the Imperial Protector of Yangzhou Liu Yao is opposing my mothers brother and my mother and her family are in danger in QueWherefore I would borrow a few thousands of fighting men to rescue themAs perhaps Illustrious Sir you may lack confidence in me I am willing to deposit the Imperial Hereditary Seal left me by my late father as a pledge Let me see it if you have it said Yuan ShuI do not want the jewel really but you may as well leave it with meI will lend you three thousand troops and five hundred horsesReturn as soon as peace can be madeAs your rank is hardly sufficient for such powers I will memorialize to obtain for you higher rank with the title of General Who Exterminates Brigands and you can soon start Sun Ce thanked his patron most humbly and soon put the army in motion taking with him his two new advisers and his fathers generalsZhu Zhi Lu Fan Cheng Pu Huang Gai Han Dang and othersWhen Sun Ce reached Linyang he saw a body of troops in front of him at their head a dashing leader of handsome and refined mienAs soon as this commander saw Sun Ce he dismounted and made obeisanceIt was Zhou Yu from ShuchengWhen Sun Jian was opposing the tyrant Dong Zhuo he moved his family to Shucheng where the Zhou family had livedAnd as Zhou Yu and Sun Ce were of the same age all but two months they became exceedingly good friends and sworn brothers Sun Ce being the elder in virtue of his two months seniorityZhou Yu was on his way to visit Sun Ces uncle Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang when the happy meeting took placeNaturally Sun Ce confided his projects and inmost ideas to his friend who at once said I shall put my whole life and energy to serve you to reach that grand goal Now that you have come the design is as good as accomplished said Sun CeZhou Yu was introduced to Zhu Zhi and Lu FanZhou Yu said Do you know of the two Zhangs of GuanglingThey would be most useful people in working out your schemes Who are they the two Zhangs said Sun CeThey are men of transcendent genius who are living near here for the sake of tranquillity in these turbulent times Their names are Zhang Zhao and Zhang HongWhy not invite them to help you Brother Sun Ce lost no time in sending letters and gifts but they both declinedThen he visited them in person was greatly pleased with their speech and by dint of large gifts and much persuasion got them to promise to join himSun Ce appointed them both Counselors and Generals The plan of the attack upon Yangzhou was the next matter for discussionThe Imperial Protector Liu Yao was of Donglai a scion of the imperial family and brother of the Imperial Protector of Yanzhou Liu DaiLiu Yao had long ruled in Yangzhou and headquartered in Shouchun But Yuan Shu had forced him to flee to the southeast of the Great River He retired to Que and now was battling with Wu Jing in LinyangHearing of the meditated attack on him Liu Yao summoned his generals to take counselSaid General Zhang Ying I will take an army and entrench at NiuzhuNo army can get past that whatever its strength Zhang Ying was interrupted by another who shouted And let me lead the van All eyes turned to this man it was Taishi Ci who after helping Kong Rong raise the siege of Beihai had come to serve Liu YaoHearing him offer to undertake the hazardous post of van leader Liu Yao said But you are still young and not yet equal to such a chargeRather stay by my side and await my orders Taishi Ci withdrew in disappointmentSoon Zhang Ying led his army to Niuzhu where the stores of grain locatedWhen Sun Ce approached Zhang Ying went to meet him and the two armies faced each other above the Bullock RapidZhang Ying roundly abused his opponent and Huang Gai rode out to attack himBut before the combat had proceeded far there arose an alarm of fire in Zhang Yings campZhang Ying turned back and then Sun Ce advanced in full force compelling the enemy to abandon their possessionThe defeated general fled to the hillsNow the incendiaries who had brought about this result were two named Jiang Qin from Shouchun and Zhou Tai from Jiujiang who in these turbulent times had got together a band of kindred spirits and lived by plundering the country along the Great RiverThey knew Sun Ce by reputation as a man who treated able people very liberally and wished to join him So they came with their band three hundred strong and helped him in this way as an introductionSun Ce welcomed them and gave the leaders rankAfter taking possession of the stores of all kinds abandoned by the runaways and enlisting four thousand of those who surrendered into his own ranks Sun Ce moved forward to attack ShentingAfter his defeat Zhang Ying returned to his master and told his misfortuneLiu Yao was going to punish his failure by death but listened to his advisers who asked for mercy for the unfortunate man and sent him to command the garrison in Lingling Liu Yao himself set out to meet the invadersHe camped south of the Sacred Hills Sun Ce camped on the opposite side of the hillsSun Ce inquired the natives Is there a temple of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter Hans in the vicinity They said There is a temple to the south on the summit of the hills I dreamed last night that Liu Xiu called me so I will go and pray there said Sun CeBut Counselor Zhang Zhao advised My lord you should not go as the enemy is on the other side and you may fall into an ambush The spirit will help me what need I fear So Sun Ce put on his armor took his spear and mounted taking with him twelve of his commanders as an escortThey rode up the hills dismounted burned incense and they all bowed in the shrineThen Sun Ce knelt and made a vow saying If I Sun Ce succeed in my task and restore the authority of my late father then will I restore this temple and order sacrifices at the four seasons When they had remounted Sun Ce said I am going to ride along the ridge and reconnoiter the enemys position His commanders begged him to refrain but he was obstinate and they rode there together noting the villages belowA soldier of the other side going along a bye road quickly reported the presence of horsemen on the ridge and Liu Yao said It is certainly Sun Ce trying to inveigle us to battleBut do not go out Taishi Ci jumped up saying What better chance to capture him So without orders he armed himself and rode through the camp crying If there be any valiant people among you follow me No one moved save a subaltern who said He is a valiant man and I will go with him So he also wentThe others only laughed at the pairNow having seen all he wished Sun Ce thought it time to return and wheeled round his horseBut when he was going over the summit some one shouted Stay Sun Ce Sun Ce turned two horsemen were coming at full speed down the next hillSun Ce halted and drew up his little escort right and left he himself with his spear readyWhich is Sun Ce shouted Taishi CiWho are you was the replyI Taishi Ci of Laihuang come to take him prisoner Then I am he said Sun Ce laughingCome both of you together I am not afraid of youIf I were I should not be Sun Ce You and all your crowd come on and I will not blench cried Taishi Ci putting his horse at a gallop and setting his spearSun Ce braced himself for the shock and the battle beganFifty bouts were fought and still neither combatant had the advantageSun Ces commanders whispered to each other their admiration and amazementTaishi Ci saw that the spearmanship of his opponent showed no weak point whereby he could gain the advantage so he decided to resort to guile Feigning defeat he would lead Sun Ce to pursueTaishi Ci however did not retire along the road by which he had come but took a path leading around the hill instead of over itHis antagonist followed shouting He who retreats is no worthy soldier But Taishi Ci thought within himself He has twelve others at his back and I only one If I capture him the others will retake himI will inveigle him into some secret spot and then try So flying and fighting by turns he led Sun Ce an eager pursuer down to the plainHere Taishi Ci suddenly wheeled about and attackedAgain they exchanged half a hundred bouts without resultThen Sun Ce made a fierce thrust which his opponent evaded by gripping the spear under his arm while he himself did the same with his opponents spearNeither was wounded but each exerting his utmost strength to pull the other out of the saddle they both came to the groundTheir steeds galloped off they knew not whither while the two men each dropping his spear began a hand to hand struggleSoon their fighting robes were in tatters Sun Ce gripped the short lance that Taishi Ci carried at his back while Taishi Ci tore off the Sun Ces helmetSun Ce tried to stab with the short lance but Taishi Ci fended off the blow with the helmet as a shieldThen arose a great shouting Liu Yao had come up with a thousand soldiers Sun Ce seemed now in sore straitsHis twelve followers came up and each combatant let go his holdTaishi Ci quickly found another steed seized a spear and mountedSun Ce whose horse had been caught by Cheng Pu also mounted and a confused battle began between the handful of men on one side and a whole thousand troops on the other It swayed and drifted down the hill sideHowever soon Zhou Yu leading his troops came to the rescue and as evening drew on a tempest put an end to the fight Both sides drew off and returned to campNext day Sun Ce led his army to the front of Liu Yaos camp and the challenge was accepted The armies were drawn upSun Ce hung the short lance he had seized from Taishi Ci at the end of his spear and waved it in front of the line of battle and ordered his soldiers to shout If the owner of this had not fled he would have been stabbed to death On the other side they hung out Sun Ces helmet and the soldiers shouted back Sun Ces head is here already Both sides thus yelled defiance at each other one side boasting the other braggingThen Taishi Ci rode out challenging Sun Ce to a duel to the death and Sun Ce would have accepted but Cheng Pu said My lord should not trouble himself I will take him And Cheng Pu rode forthYou are no antagonist for me said Taishi CiTell your master to come out This incensed Cheng Pu who rode at his opponent and they two fought thirty bouts The duel was stopped by the gongs of Liu Yao Why did you sound the retreat said Taishi CiI was just going to capture the wretch Because I have just heard that Que has been capturedZhou Yu led a surprise force thither and Chen Wu was in league with him to betray the cityWe have no home nowI will hasten to Moling to get the help of Xue Li and Ze Rong to retake the city The army retired Taishi Ci with it without being pursuedOn the other side Zhang Zhao said to Sun Ce Zhou Yus attack is the cause of this move they are in no mood to fightA night raid on their camp would finish them The army was divided into five divisions for the night surprise and hastened toward the camp where they scored a victory Their opponents scattered in all directionsTaishi Ci alone made a determined stand and as he could not withstand a whole army he fled with ten horsemen to Jingxian Now Sun Ce acquired a new adherent in the person of Chen Wu He was a soldier of middle height sallow of complexion and dark eye an odd looking manBut Sun Ce held him in high esteem appointed him Commander and put him in the van of the attack on Xue LiAs Van Leader Chen Wu and a dozen horsemen made a dash into the enemys formation where they slew half a hundred men So Xue Li would not fight but remained within his defensesAs Sun Ce was attacking the city a spy came in with the news that Liu Yao and Ze Rong had gone to attack Niuzhu which made Sun Ce move thither in haste His two opponents were ready for battleI am here said Sun Ce you would better give in A general came out from behind Liu Yao to accept the challenge It was Yu Mi But in the third bout Sun Ce made him prisoner and carried him off to the other sideSeeing his colleague thus captured Fan Neng rode out to the rescue and got quite closeBut just as he was going to thrust all Sun Ces soldiers shouted There is a man behind you going to strike secretly At this Sun Ce turned and shouted so thunderously loud that Fan Neng fell out of his saddle from mere fright He split his skull and diedWhen Sun Ce reached his standard he threw his prisoner to the ground And Yu Mi was also dead crushed to death between the arm and the body of his captorSo in a few moments Sun Ce had disposed of two enemies one crushed to death and one frightened to death Thereafter Sun Ce was called the Little PrinceLiu Yao had a defeat the greater portion of his force surrendered and the number of those slain exceeded ten thousandLiu Yao himself fled to Yuzhang and sought safety with Liu Biao Imperial Protector of Jingzhou An attack on Moling was the next moveAs soon as Sun Ce arrived at the moat he summoned Commander Xue Li to surrenderSome one let fly a furtive arrow from the wall which wounded Sun Ce in the left thigh so severely that he fell from his steed Hastily his officers picked up their wounded chief and returned to the camp where the arrow was pulled out and the wound dressed with the medicines suitable for injuries by metalsBy Sun Ces command the story was spread abroad that the hurt had been fatal and all the soldiers set up cries of lamentationThe camp was broken upXue Li Zhang Ying and Chen Heng made a night sortie but fell into a carefully prepared ambush and presently Sun Ce himself appeared on horseback shoutingSun Ce is here still His sudden appearance created such a panic that the soldiers dropped their weapons and fell on their facesSun Ce gave orders not to kill them But their leaders fellZhang Ying from Chen Wus spear thrust as he turned to run away Chen Heng was killed by Jiang Qins arrow and the Commander Xue Li was slain in the turbulence Thus Sun Ce got possession of MolingHaving calmed the people he sent his soldiers away to Jingxian where Taishi Ci was in commandTaishi Ci had assembled two thousand veterans in addition to his own troops for the purpose of avenging his masterSun Ce and Zhou Yu on the other hand consulted how to capture him aliveZhou Yu planned Attack the city on three sides leaving the east gate free for flightSome distance off an ambush shall be prepared when Taishi Ci his men fatigued and horses spent shall fall an easy victim The latest recruits under Taishi Cis banner were mostly hillmen and unaccustomed to disciplineBeside the walls of the city were pitiably lowOne night Sun Ce ordered Chen Wu to strip off his long dress leave his arms save a dagger clamber up the ramparts and set fire to the citySeeing the flames spreading Taishi Ci made for the east gate and as soon as he got outside Sun Ce followed in pursuitThe pursuit was maintained for some fifteen miles when the pursuers stopped Taishi Ci went on as long as possible finally halting to rest in a spot surrounded by reeds Suddenly a tremendous shouting aroseTaishi Ci was just starting when tripping ropes arose all round his horse was thrown and he found himself a prisoner Taishi Ci was taken back to campAs soon as Sun Ce heard the news he himself rode out to order the guards to leave the prisoner whose bonds he loosened with his own hands Then he took off his own embroidered robe and put it on the captive They entered the camp together I knew you were a real hero said Sun CeThat worm of a Liu Yao had no use for such as you and so he got beaten Taishi Ci overcome by this kindness and good treatment then formally surrenderedSun Ce seized his hand and said laughing If you had taken me at that fight we had near the shrine would you have killed me Who can say said Taishi Ci smilingSun Ce laughed also and they entered his tent where Taishi Ci was placed in the seat of honor at a banquetTaishi Ci said Can you trust me so far as to let me go to muster as many as I can of the soldiers of my late masterUnder the smart of this defeat they will turn against him and they would be a great help to you Exactly what I most desireI will make an agreement with you that at midday tomorrow you will return Taishi Ci agreed and went offAll the generals said he would never returnHe is trustworthy and will not break his word said the chief None of the officers believed he would come backBut the next day they set up a bamboo rod in the gate of the camp and just as the shadow marked noon Taishi Ci returned bringing with him about a thousand troopsSun Ce was pleased and his officers had to confess that he had rightly judged his manSun Ce thus marched his army to the South Land and his enemies fled or surrendered before his force He had now several legions and the southeast of the Great River was his He improved the conditions of the people and maintained order so that his adherents and supporters daily increasedHe was called Sun Ce the BrightWhen his army approached the people used to flee in terror but when it had arrived and they saw that no one was permitted to loot and not the least attempt was made on their houses they rejoiced and presented the soldiers with oxen and wine for which they were in turn duly rewarded Gladness filled the country sideThe soldiers who had followed Liu Yao were kindly treated Those who wished to join Sun Ces army did so those who preferred not to be soldiers were sent home with presentsAnd thus Sun Ce won the respect and praise of every one and became very powerfulSun Ce then settled his mother and the remainder of the family in Que setting his brother Sun Quan and Zhou Tai over the city of XuanchengThen he headed an expedition to the south to reduce WujunAt that time there was a certain Yan Baihu or the White Tiger who styled himself King of Eastern Wu  and ruled over Wujun His armies stationed at Wucheng and JiaxingHearing of Sun Ces approach Yan Baihu sent his brother Yan Yu with an army against Sun Ce and they met at Juniper BridgeYan Yu sword in hand took his stand on the bridge and this was reported to Sun Ce who prepared to accept the challengeZhang Hong tried to dissuade him saying For as much as my lords fate is bound up with that of the army he should not risk a conflict with a mere robberI wish that you should remember your own value Your words O Wise One are as gold and precious stones but I fear that my soldiers will not carry out my commands unless I myself share their dangers However Sun Ce sent forth Han Dang to take up the challengeJust as Han Dang reached the bridge Jiang Qin and Chen Wu who had dropped down the river in a small boat passed under the bridgeThough the arrows fell in clouds on the bank the two men rushed up and fiercely attacked Yan Yu as he stood on the bridgeYan Yu fled and Han Dang went in pursuitBut Yan Yu smote up to the west gate of the city into which he enteredSun Ce laid siege to Wujun both by land and waterFor three days no one came out to offer battleThen at the head of his army Sun Ce came to the west gate and summoned the wardenAn officer of inconsiderable rank came out and stood with one hand resting on a beam while with the other he gave point to his abuse of those belowQuickly Taishi Cis hands sought his bow and an arrow was on the string See me hit that fellows hand said he turning to his companionsEven as the sound of his voice died away the bowstring twanged the arrow sped and lodged in the beam firmly pinning thereto the officers handBoth sides those on the wall and those below it marveled and acclaimed at such marksmanship The wounded man was taken awayWhen Yan Baihu the White Tiger heard of the exploit he said How can we hope to withstand an army with such people as this in it And his thoughts turned toward a peaceHe sent his brother Yan Yu out to see Sun Ce who received him civilly invited him into the tent and set wine before himAnd what does your brother propose said Sun CeHe is willing to share this region with you was the replyThe rat How dare he put himself on a level with me cried Sun CeSun Ce commanded to put the messenger to deathYan Yu started up and drew his sword but out flew Sun Ces blade and the unhappy messenger fell to the ground His head was hacked off and sent into the city to his brother This had its effectYan Baihu saw resistance was hopeless so he abandoned Wujun and fled Sun Ce pressed the attackHuang Gai captured Jiaxing and Taishi Ci took Wucheng Several other southern cities were fallen The territory was quickly subduedYan Baihu rushed off toward Yuhang in the east plundering on all sides till a band of villagers under the leadership of one Ling Cao checked his career of robbery there Yan Baihu then fled toward KuaijiLing Cao and his son then went to meet Sun Ce who took them into his service and appointed them Commanders as a reward for their service and the joint forces crossed the Great RiverThe White Tiger Yan Baihu gathered his scattered forces and took up a position at Western Ford but Cheng Pu attacked him there and scattered the defenders chasing them as far as KuaijiThe Governor of the place Wang Lang was on Yan Baihus side and inclined to support him actively But when Wang Lang proposed this one of his officers stood forth saying NoSun Ce as a leader is humane and upright while the White Tiger is a savage ruffian Rather capture him and offer his person as a peace offering to Sun Ce The Governor turned angrily toward the speaker who was an official named Yu Fan from Kuaiji and bade him be silent Yu Fan withdrew sighing deeplyAnd the Governor went to the help of the White Tiger with whom he joined forces at Shanyin Sun Ce came upWhen both sides were arrayed Sun Ce rode out and addressed Wang Lang saying Mine is an army of good soldiers and my aim is to restore peace to this region but you give your support to a rebel Wang Lang replied Your greed is insatiableHaving got possession of Wujun you want also my territoryI shall revenge for the Yans This response greatly angered Sun CeJust as battle was to be joined Taishi Ci advanced and Wang Lang came toward him waving a swordBefore they had exchanged many passes Zhou Xin dashed out to help Wang Lang Thereupon Huang Gai rode out to make the sides more equalThese latter two were just engaging when the drums rolled on both sides and a general battle beganSuddenly confusion was caused in the rear of Wang Langs army by the sudden onslaught of a small armyWang Lang galloped off to see the attackers were Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu Then an attack was made on his flank so that he was in a hopeless position and he and Yan Baihu and Zhou Xin fighting desperately to cut an arterial alley only just managed to reach the shelter of the city The drawbridges were raised the gates closed and preparations made to sustain a siegeSun Ce followed right up to the walls and then divided his troops so as to attack all four gatesSeeing that the city was being fiercely attacked Wang Lang was for making a sortie but Yan Baihu opposed this as hopeless against so strong a force outsideWe can only strengthen our position and remain behind the shelter of the ramparts until hunger forces the besiegers to retire said Yan Baihu Wang Lang agreed and the siege went onFor several days a vigorous attack was maintained but with little successIn a council Sun Jing who was the uncle of Sun Ce said Since they are holding the city with such resolution it will be difficult to dislodge themBut the bulk of their supplies is stored at Chadu distant only some ten milesOur best plan is to seize this place thus attacking where the enemy is unprepared and doing what they do not expect Sun Ce approved saying My uncles plan is admirable and will crush the rebels So he issued orders to kindle watch fires at all the gates and leave the flags standing to maintain the appearance of soldiers in position while the expedition went southZhou Yu came to utter a warning When you my lord go away the besieged will surely come out and follow youWe might prepare a surprise for them Sun Ce replied My preparations are complete and the city will be captured tonight So the army set outWang Lang heard that the besiegers had gone and he went up to the tower to reconnoiterHe saw the fires blazing the smoke rising and the pennons fluttering in the breeze as usual and hesitatedZhou Xin said He has gone and this is only a strategyLet us go out and smite them Yan Baihu said If he has gone it is to attack ChaduLet us pursue The place is our base of supply said Wang Lang and must be defendedYou two lead the way and I will follow with reserves So Yan Baihu and Zhou Xin went forth with five thousand soldiers and drew near their enemy about the first watch at seven miles from the city The road led through dense forestThen suddenly the drums beat and lighted torches sprang up on all sidesYan Baihu was frightened turned his horse and started to retreat At once a leader appeared in front in whom by the glare of the torches he recognized Sun CeZhou Xin made a rush at him but fell under Sun Ces spearThe men surrenderedHowever Yan Baihu managed to cut his way out and fled to YuhangWang Lang soon heard of the loss and not daring to return to the city fled in all haste to the coastal regionsAnd so Sun Ce got possession of the city of KuaijiHaving restored order a few days later a man came bringing the head of the White Tiger as an offering to Sun Ce This man was a native of the countyHe was of medium height with a square face and wide mouthHe was named Dong XiSun Ce appointed him CommanderAfter this peace reigned in all the southeast Sun Ce placed his uncle Sun Jing in command of the city and made Zhu Zhi Governor of Wujun Then Sun Ce returned to his own place south of the Great RiverWhile Sun Ce was absent a band of brigands suddenly attacked Xuancheng left in the care of his brother Sun Quan and the leader Zhou TaiAs the onslaught was made on all sides at once and in the night the brigands got the upper handZhou Tai took the youth in his arms and mounted a horse but as the robbers came on with swords to attack him he dismounted and though without mail met the robbers on foot and slew them as they came up Then came a horseman armed with a spear but Zhou Tai laid hold of his spear and pulled him to the earth Then Zhou Tai mounted the robbers horse and thrusting this way and that with the spear fought his way out So Sun Quan was preserved but his savior had received more than a dozen woundsHowever the bandits went awayThese wounds being due to metal would not heal but swelled enormously and the brave soldiers life hung in the balance Sun Ce returned and was deeply grievedThen Dong Xi said Once in an engagement with some coastal pirates I received many spear wounds but a certain wise man named Yu Fan recommended a surgeon who cured me in half a month Surely this must be Yu Fan of Kuaiji replied Sun CeThat is he he is so called Yes truly a wise man I would employ him So Sun Ce sent two officers to invite Yu Fan and he came at onceHe was treated in most friendly fashion and appointed an official forthwith Then the question of treating the wounded man was brought upThe surgeon is one Hua Tuo from Qiao who has perfectly marvelous medicine skillI will get him to come said Yu FanShortly the famous Hua Tuo arrived a man with the complexion of a youth and a snowy beard He looked more like a saint who had passed the gates of this lifeHe was treated very warmly and taken to see the sick generals woundsThe case is not difficult said the surgeonAnd he prepared certain drugs that healed the wounds within a month Sun Ce suitably acknowledged his care and skill and he was allowed to leave with rich rewardsNext Sun Ce attacked the brigands and destroyed them so restoring complete tranquillity to the South LandAfter this he set garrisons at all the strategic points in the old state of Wu and this done memorialized what he had achieved to the ThroneHe came to an understanding with Cao Cao and sent letters to Yuan Shu demanding the return of the Imperial Hereditary Seal he had left in pledgeBut Yuan Shu secretly cherishing the most ambitious designs wrote excuses and did not return the state jewelIn his own place Yuan Shu hastily summoned about thirty of his officers to a council Among them were Adviser Yang Dajiang and Generals Zhang Xun Ji Ling Qiao Rui Lei Bo and Chen Lan Yuan Shu said Sun Ce borrowed an army from me and set out on an expedition which has made him master of the South LandNow he says nothing of repayment but demands the token of his pledge Truly he is a boor and what steps can I take to destroy him Yang Dajiang replied You cannot do any thing against him for he is too strongly placed the Great River as the shieldYou must first remove Liu Bei in revenge for having attacked you without cause and then you may think about Sun Ce I have a scheme to put the former into your hands in a very short time Yuan Shu went not to destroy the tiger but instead Against a dragon forth his army ledThe means Yang Dajiang employed will be made plain in the next chapterCHAPTER In The Camp Gate Lu Bu Shoots The Halberd At River Yu Cao Cao Suffers Defeat Adviser Yang Dajiang knew how to remove Liu BeiWhat is your plan of attack on Liu Bei said Yuan ShuYang Dajiang replied Though Liu Bei now camped at Xiaopei could easily be taken yet Lu Bu is strongly posted at the chief city nearAnd I think Lu Bu would help Liu Bei if it was only for the grudge he bears against you for not having given him the gold and studs grain and horses you promisedFirst of all you should send Lu Bu a present whereby to engage his affections and keep him quiet while you deal with Liu BeiYou can see to Lu Bu after this is done and Xuzhou is yours Thereupon two hundred thousand carts of millet was sent with letters by the hand of Han YinThe gift pleased Lu Bu greatly and he treated the messenger with great cordialityFeeling sure of no trouble from that quarter Yuan Shu told off one hundred thousand troops against Xiaopei The army was led by Ji Ling as commanding general and Lei Bo and Chen Lan as generals When Liu Bei heard these things he called his officers to take counselZhang Fei was for open war forthwithBut Sun Qian said Our resources were too small therefore we must lay the position before Lu Bu and ask help Do you think that fellow will do anything said Zhang Fei cynicallyLiu Bei decided in favor of Sun Qians proposal and wrote as followsHumbly I venture to remind you that I am here by your orders and enjoy repose as the result of your kindness extensive as the heavensNow Yuan Shu moved by a desire for revenge is sending a force against this place and its destruction is imminent unless you intervene to save itI trust you will send an army quickly to protect the town and our happiness will be inexpressible Receiving this Lu Bu called in Chen Gong to whom he said I have just received gifts from Yuan Shu and a letter with the intent of restraining me from helping Liu BeiNow comes a letter from Liu Bei asking helpIt seems to me that Liu Bei where he is can do me no harm but if Yuan Shu overcomes Liu Bei and comes to an understanding with the leaders around the Huashang Mountains then the power of the north is so much nearer and I should be unable to resist the attacks of so many leaders and should never sleep secureI will aid Liu Bei that is the better course for me Now Yuan Shus force sent against Xiaopei went thither as quickly as possible and soon the country to the southeast fluttered with pennons by day and blazed with watch fires by night while the rolling of the drums reverberated from heaven to earthThe five thousand troops at Liu Beis disposal were led out of the city and arranged to make a brave show but it was good news to him to hear that Lu Bu had arrived and was quite nearLu Bu camped only half a mile away to the southwestWhen Yuan Shus general Ji Ling heard of his arrival he wrote letters reproaching Lu Bu for his treachery Lu Bu smiled as he read them I know how to make both of them love me said Lu BuSo he sent invitations to both Liu Bei and Ji Ling to come to a banquet Liu Bei was for accepting the invitation and going but his brothers dissuaded him saying There is some treachery in his heart I have treated him too well for him to do me any harm said Liu BeiSo he mounted and rode away the two brothers followingThey came to the campThe host said Now by a special effort I have got you out of danger I hope you will not forget that when you come into your own Liu Bei thanked him heartily and was invited to take a seat Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took up their usual place as guardsBut when Ji Ling was announced Liu Bei felt a spasm of fear and got up to go awayYou two are invited for the particular purpose of a discussion said the host Do not take it amiss Liu Bei being quite ignorant of his intentions was very uneasy Presently his fellow guest enteredSeeing Liu Bei in the tent and in the seat of honor Ji Ling was puzzled hesitated and tried to withdrawBut the attendants prevented this and Lu Bu advancing laid hold of him and drew him into the tent as he had been a childDo you wish to slay me asked Ji LingNot at all replied Lu BuThen you are going to slay LongEars No not that Then what does it mean Liu Bei and I are brothersNow General you are besieging him and so I have come to the rescue Then slay me said Ji Ling There would be no sense in thatAll my life I have disliked fighting and quarrels but have loved making peaceAnd now I want to settle the quarrel between you two May I ask how you think of doing so I have a means and one approved of Heaven itself Then Lu Bu drew Ji Ling within the tent and led him up to Liu BeiThe two men faced each other full of mutual suspicion but their host placed himself between them and they took their seats Liu Bei on the right hand of the hostThe banquet beganAfter a number of courses almost in silence Lu Bu spoke saying I wish you two gentlemen to listen to me and put an end to your strife Liu Bei made no reply but Ji Ling said I have come with an army of one hundred thousand at the express bidding of my master to take Liu Bei How can I cease the strifeI must fight What exclaimed Zhang Fei drawing his swordFew as we are we regard you no more than a lot of childrenWhat are you compared with a million Yellow ScarvesYou dare hurt our brother Guan Yu urged him to be silent saying Let us see what General Lu Bu has to say first after that there will be time to go to our tents and fight I beg you both to come to an understandingI cannot let you fight said Lu BuNow on one side Ji Ling was discontented and angry on the other Zhang Fei was dying for a fight and neither of the two chiefly concerned would signify assentThen suddenly the host turned to his attendants saying Bring my trident halberd They did so and he sat there gripping that graceful but effective weapon in his right hand Both guests felt very ill at ease and turned paleLu Bu went on saying I have tried to persuade you to make peace for that is the command of the Most HighIt shall be put to the test He then bade his servants take the halberd outside beyond the gate and set it upThen speaking to his two guests he said That gate is one hundred and fifty paces distant If I can hit that left branch of the halberdhead with an arrow you will both withdraw your armies If I miss you can go away and prepare for immediate battleI shall stand against either of you who does not abide by what I say Ji Ling thought to himself That small mark at that distance How could any one hit it So he assented thinking he would have plenty of fighting after his host had missed the markOf course Liu Bei was willingThey all sat down again and wine was servedWhen this had been drunk the host called for his bow and arrows Liu Bei silently prayed that he would hit the markLu Bu turned back his sleeves carefully fitted an arrow to the string and pulled the bow to its utmost stretchA slight exclamation escaped him as the bow curved like the harvest moon sailing through the sky Twang went the bowstring and the arrow sped like a falling star And it struck the slender tongue of the halberd head full and squareA roar of acclamation from all sides greeted the exploit The multitude people often hail their praise O Lu Bu was a wonderful archer And the arrow he shot sped straight By hitting the mark he saved his friend That day at his camp gateHou Yi the archer of ancient days Brought down each mocking sun And the apes that gibbered to fright Yang Youji Were slain by him one by oneBut we sing of Lu Bu that drew the bow And his feathered shaft that flew For one hundred thousand soldiers could doff their mails When he hit the mark so true Lu Bu laughed loud at the success of his shot Dropping his bow he seized his guests by the hands saying The command of Heaven indeedAnd now you cease from fighting He ordered the soldier attendants to pour out great goblets of wine and each drank Liu Bei in his inmost heart felt rather lucky his fellow guest sat silent nodding his headPresently he said I cannot disobey your command General but let me departWhat will my master say and will he believe me I will write a letter and confirm it said Lu BuAfter a few more rounds of the wine Ji Ling asked that he might have the letter and after that departed When the brothers took their leave Lu Bu again reminded Liu Bei saying Do not forget I have delivered you today Liu Bei thanked him and departedNext day the leaders broke camps and the soldiers were goneWhen Ji Ling had got back to the South of River Huai and told the story of the feat of archery and the peace making that followed and had presented the letter his lord was very wrothLu Bu repays me for all my grain with this bit of play acting cried Yuan ShuHe has saved Liu Bei but I will lead a large army myself and settle both Liu Bei and him Be careful my lord said Ji LingLu Bu is braver and stronger than most leaders and has wide territoryHe and Liu Bei together make a powerful combination not easy to break But there is another courseI have found out that his wife Lady Yan has a daughter just of marriageable age and as you have a son you could arrange a marriage alliance with Lu BuIf his daughter wedded your son Lu Bu would certainly slay your enemy for you This is called RelativeaboveStranger plan This scheme appealed to Yuan Shu who soon set about its accomplishmentHe sent presents by the hand of Han Yin who was to discuss the questionWhen Han Yin saw Lu Bu he said My master has an immense respect for you Illustrious Sir and he desires to ensure perpetual alliance between the two families by a marriage an alliance such as existed between the ancient states of Qin and Jin Lu Bu was well disposed toward the scheme but went in to consult his wifeNow Lu Bu had two wives and one concubine He first married a lady of the Yan family and she was the legal wifeThen he took Diao Chan as a concubine And while he was living at Xiaopei he had married a secondary wife a daughter of Cao BaoLady Cao had died quite young leaving no issue Neither had Diao Chan borne any children So that Lu Bu had but one child this daughter of whom he was dotingly fondWhen he broached the subject his wife said The Yuans have dominated the regions around the River Huai these many years They have a large army and are very prosperousOne day a Yuan will become emperor and our daughter may hope to be an empressBut how many sons has Yuan Shu Only this one Then we should accept the offerEven if our daughter does not become an Empress Xuzhou has a new ally Lu Bu decided to accept and so treated the messenger with extreme generosityHan Yin went back with a favorable answerThe wedding gifts were then prepared ready for Han Yin to take to the brides familyThey were received and banquets and merrymaking filled all the timeNext day Chen Gong went to see the messenger in his lodging and when the usual ceremonies and greetings had been exchanged the two men sat down to talkWhen the servants had been sent out of earshot Chen Gong said Who originated this scheme by which Yuan Shu and Lu Bu are to become connections by this marriage so that Liu Beis head may fall Han Yin was terrifiedI pray you not to let it get abroad said he I certainly shall keep it secret But if there be any delay some other person will find it out and that spells failure said Chen GongWhat would best be done I will see Lu Bu and get him to send the girl immediately so that the marriage may be concluded quickly If it happened thus my master would indeed hold you in high respect With this Chen Gong took his leave and sought an interview with Lu BuI hear your daughter is to be married to Yuan Shus sonThat is capital but no one knows when That has yet to be considered There were certain fixed rules as to the period between sending presents and consummation of the marriage emperors a year nobles half a year high officers three months and common people one month Lu Bu replied As to Yuan Shu Heaven has already put into his hands the Imperial Hereditary Seal and he will surely arrive at the dignity one daySo I should think the imperial rule would apply No it will not The nobles rule then No nor that The high officers Not even that Lu Bu laughed saying Then you mean me to go by the rule for common people Nor that either Then what do you mean In the midst of the present troubles when there is great rivalry among the nobles do you not see that the others will be exceedingly jealous of your marriage alliance with such a high family as the YuansSuppose you postpone the choice of the day most likely when your fine morning arrives the wedding party will fall into an ambush on the road and the bride be carried off Then what could be doneMy opinion is that you would have done better to refuseBut since you have consented then carry out the plan at once before the lords hear of it and so send the girl over without delay to ShouchunYou can hire a lodging there till you have selected the wedding day and the odds are greatly against any failure What you say is quite to the point replied Lu Bu He went into the private apartments to see his wife and told her the bride elect would set out immediately and the trousseau was to be prepared as far as it could beOn his side he chose some good horses and had a wedding carriage got ready The escort consisted of Han Yin and two of Lu Bus generals Song Xian and Wei XuThe procession went out of the city to the sound of musicNow at this time Chen Gui father of Chen Deng was placidly waiting till the evening of his life passed into night Hearing this burst of music he inquired the occasion and the servants told himThey are working on the RelativeaboveStranger device then said Chen GuiLiu Bei is in danger Thereupon in spite of his many infirmities he went to see Lu BuNoble Sir what brings you here asked Lu BuI heard you were dead and I came to mourn quavered the old manWho said that exclaimed his hostOnce upon a time you received grand presents from Yuan Shu that you might slay Liu Bei but you got out by that clever shot at your halberdNow they suddenly seek a marriage alliance thinking to get hold of your daughter as a pledge The next move will be an attack on Xiaopei and that gone where are youWhatever they ask in future grain or troops or anything else and you yield will bring your own end nearer and make you hated all roundIf you refuse then you are false to the duties of a relative and that will be an excuse to attack you openlyBeside this Yuan Shu intends to call himself emperor which would be rebellion and you would be of the rebels family something abominable which the multitude people would not suffer Lu Bu was much disturbed to hear this I have been misled cried heSo he hurriedly sent Zhang Liao to bring the wedding party which had been ten miles away back to the cityWhen they had come Lu Bu threw Han Yin into prison and sent a reply to Yuan Shu saying curtly that the girls trousseau was not ready and she could not be married till it wasChen Gui wanted Han Yin to be sent to the capital XuchangBut Lu Bu was hesitating what course to adopt when he heard that Liu Bei was enlisting soldiers and buying horses for no apparent reasonHe is simply doing his duty there is nothing to be surprised at said Lu Bu at firstThen came two officers Song Xian and Wei Xu saying As you ordered us we went into the Huashang Mountains to purchase horsesWe had got three hundred when on our way back on the borders of Xiaopei some robbers stole half of themWe hear that the real robbers were Zhang Fei and his soldiers who took on the guise of brigands Lu Bu was very angry at this and began to prepare an expedition against XiaopeiWhen Liu Bei heard that an attack threatened he led out his army to oppose it and the two armies were arrayedLiu Bei rode to the front and said Elder Brother why have you brought an army against me Lu Bu began abusing him saying That shot of mine at the Archery Feast saved you from grave danger why then did you steal my horses I wanted horses and I sent out to buy them Should I dare to take yours said Liu BeiYou stole a hundred and fifty in the person of your brother Zhang FeiYou only used another mans hand Thereupon Zhang Fei with his spear set rode out saying Yes I stole your good horses and what more do you expect Lu Bu replied You goggledeyed thief You are always treating me with contempt Yes I took your horses and you get angryYou did not say any thing when you stole my brothers Xuzhou Lu Bu rode forward to give battle and Zhang Fei advancedA reckless fight began and the two warriors kept it up for a hundred bouts without a decisive strokeThen Liu Bei fearing some accident to his brother hastily beat the gongs as a signal to retire and led his army into the cityLu Bu then invested it Liu Bei called his brother and chided him as the cause of all this misfortuneWhere are the horses said Liu BeiIn some of the temples and courts replied Zhang FeiLiu Bei sent a messenger out to speak softly and offer to restore the stolen horses if hostilities were to ceaseLu Bu was disposed to agree but Chen Gong opposedYou will suffer by and by if you do not remove this Liu Bei Under Chen Gongs influence the request for peace was rejected and the attackers on the city pressed harder Liu Bei called Mi Zhu and Sun Qian to him to ask adviceSaid Sun Qian The one person that Cao Cao detests is Lu BuLet us then abandon the city and take refuge with Cao Cao from whom we may borrow troops to destroy him If we try to get away who will lead the van I will do my best said Zhang Fei So Zhang Fei led the way Guan Yu was rearguard and in the center was Liu Bei with the nonfighting portionThe cavalcade started and went out at the north gate under the bright moonThey met opposition from Song Xian and Wei Xus men but the soldiers were driven off by Zhang Fei and the besieging force was passed without difficultyZhang Liao pursued but was held off by Guan Yus rearguard It seemed Lu Bu was not dissatisfied at the flight for he took no personal trouble to prevent it He made formal entry into the city settled local affairs and appointed Gao Shun as GovernorLiu Bei approached Xuchang and encamped outside the city whence he sent Sun Qian to see Cao Cao and relate the events that brought him thereCao Cao was very friendly and said Liu Bei is as my brother Then Cao Cao invited Liu Bei to enter the city Leaving his brothers at the camp Liu Bei with Sun Qian and Mi Zhu went to Cao Cao who received him with the greatest respectThe story of Lu Bus perfidy was again related He has no sense of right said Cao CaoYou and I my brother will attack him together Liu Bei was very gratefulA banquet was then prepared and it was late evening before the visitor left for his own campXun Yu then had an interview with his master and said If you are not on your guard Liu Bei will be your undoingYou ought to destroy him He is too much of a hero Cao Cao made no reply and his adviser retiredPresently Guo Jia came and Cao Cao said I have been advised to kill Liu Bei what of such a scheme A bad scheme said Guo JiaYou are the popular champion pledged to relieve the people from oppression and only by truth and rectitude can you secure the support of the nobleminded Your only fear is lest they stay away Now Liu Bei is clearly a heroHe has come to you for help and protection and to put him to death would be to alienate all good people and put fear into the hearts of all the able advisersHampered by these difficulties where will you find those whose help you needTo remove the dangers represented by one man and thereby injure yourself in the eyes of all humankind is a sure means of destructionThese conditions need careful consideration What you say exactly fits in with what I think said Cao Cao greatly pleased with these remarksHis next step was to memorialize the Emperor to give Liu Bei the imperial protectorship of YuzhouAgain Cheng Yu said Liu Bei is certain to rise to the top he will never remain in a subordinate position You would better remove him Cao Cao answered Now is just the time to make use of good peopleI will not forfeit the regard of the world for the sake of removing one individualGuo Jia and I both see this in the same light Wherefore Cao Cao rejected all persuasion to work against Liu Bei but sent him three thousand soldiers and ten thousand carts of grain and set him on his way to YuzhouLiu Bei was to march to Xiaopei occupy it call together his former soldiers and attack Lu BuWhen Liu Bei reached Yuzhou he sent to inform Cao Cao who prepared to march an army to subjugate Lu Bu But just then hasty news came that Zhang Ji who had gone to the attack of Nanyang had been wounded by a stray arrow and had diedHis nephew Zhang Xiu had succeeded to the command of his army and with Jia Xu as strategist Zhang Xiu had joined Liu Biao and camped at Wancheng They intended to attack the capital and get possession of the Emperors personCao Cao was placed in a quandary He would go to attack this combination but he feared lest Lu Bu would attack the capital if he left it So he sought the advice of Xun YuSaid the Adviser Lu Bu has no notion of a policyHe is led astray by any little advantage that presents itself to his eyes All you need do is to obtain promotion for him giving him some additional title and tell him to make peace with Liu Bei and he will do it The south is no threat then Good said Cao CaoAnd he acted upon the hint and sent an Imperial Legate Wang Ze to Xuzhou with the official announcement and a letter urging peace while he went on with preparations to meet the other danger from Zhang XiuWhen ready Cao Cao marched out with one hundred fifty thousand troops in three divisionsXiahou Dun was the Van Leader and they went to River Yu and camped there Jia Xu succeeded in persuading Zhang Xiu of the hopelessness of resistanceYou would do well to surrender since Cao Caos army is too large for you to oppose said Jia XuSeeing the truth of this Zhang Xiu sent his adviser to propose sub missionCao Cao was greatly pleased with the messenger admiring his ready and fluent repartee and tried to win him to his serviceI was formerly with Li Jue and was guilty with himNow I am with Zhang Xiu who esteems my advice and I should not like to abandon him said Jia XuJia Xu left and next day conducted his master into Cao Caos presence Cao Cao was very generousThen he entered Wancheng with a small force the greater part of the army being put in camp outside where the lines extended some three milesGreat banquets were given every day by Zhang Xiu and Cao Cao was always being entertainedOne day when Cao Cao returned to his quarters in a more than usual merry mood he asked the attendants if there were any singing girls in the cityHis nephew Cao Amin heard the question and said Peeping through one of the partitions last evening I saw a perfectly beautiful woman in one of the courts They told me she was the wife of Zhang Ji Zhang Xius uncle She is very lovely Cao Cao inflamed by the description given him of the beauty told his nephew to go and bring her to visit him Cao Amin did so supported by an armed escort and very soon the woman stood before Cao CaoShe was a beauty indeed and Cao Cao asked her nameShe replied Thy handmaid was wife to Zhang Ji I was born of the Zhou family Do you know who I am I have known the Prime Minister by reputation a long timeI am happy to see him and be permitted to bow before him said she It was for your sake that I allowed Zhang Xiu to submit otherwise I would have slain him and cut him off root and branch said Cao CaoIndeed then I owe my very life to you I am very grateful said sheTo see you is a glimpse of paradise but there is one thing I should like betterStay here and go with me to the capital where I will see that you are properly cared forWhat do you say to that my lady She could but thank him But Zhang Xiu will greatly wonder at my prolonged absence and gossips will begin to talk said sheIf you like you can leave the city tomorrow She did so but instead of going at once to the capital she stayed with him among the tents where Dian Wei was appointed as a special guard over her apartmentsCao Cao was the only person whom she saw and he passed the days in idle dalliance with the lady quite content to let time flow by But people told Zhang Xiu what had gone amiss and he was angry at the shame brought upon the familyHe confided his trouble to Jia Xu who said Keep this secret wait till he appears again to carry on business and then do so and so A plan was arranged quite secretlyNext day Zhang Xiu went into Cao Caos tent saying Since the surrendered troops are deserting in great number it would be well to camp them in the center of your camp to prevent this Cao Cao gave the permission and Zhang Xiu moved and placed his army in four campsBut Dian Wei the especial guard of Cao Caos tent was a man to be feared being both brave and powerful It was hard to know how to attack him So counsel was taken with Hu Juer the commander of one camp and a man of enormous strength and activityHe could carry a burden of six hundred pounds and two hundred miles in a day Hu Juer proposed a planHe said The fearsome thing about Dian Wei is his double halberdsBut get him to come to a party and make him quite drunk before you send him backI will mingle among his escort and so get into his tent and steal away his weaponsOne need not fear him then So the necessary arms were prepared and orders given in the various campsThis done Zhang Xiu gave a banquet and the intended victim was invited and plied vigorously with wine so that he was quite intoxicated when he left And as arranged Hu Juer mingled with his escort and made away with his weaponsThat night when Cao Cao was at supper with Lady Zhou he heard the voices of men and neighing of horses and sent out to ask what it meantThey told him it was the night patrol going the rounds and he was satisfiedNear the second watch of the night again was heard some noise in the rear of his tent and one of the fodder carts was reported to be burningOne of the soldiers has dropped a spark there is nothing to be alarmed at said Cao CaoBut very soon the fire spread on all sides and became alarming Cao Cao called Dian WeiBut he usually so alert was lying down quite intoxicatedHowever the beating of gongs and rolling of drums mingling with his dreams awoke Dian Wei and he jumped up His trusty halberds had disappearedThe enemy was near He hastily snatched up an infantrymans sword and rushed outAt the gate he saw a crowd of spearmen just bursting inDian Wei rushed at them slashing all around him and twenty or more fell beneath his blows The others drew backBut the spears stood around him like reeds on the river bank Being totally without mail he was soon wounded in several placesHe fought desperately till his sword snapped and was no longer of any use Throwing it aside he seized a couple of soldiers and with their bodies as weapons felled ten of his opponents The others dared not approach but they shot arrows at himThese fell thick as rain but he still maintained the gate against the assailantsHowever the mutineers got in by the rear of the camp and they wounded Dian Wei in the back with spear thrusts Uttering a loud cry he fell The blood gushed from the wound in torrents and he diedEven after he was dead not a man dared to come in by the main gateCao Cao relying on Dian Wei to hold the main gate had fled in haste by the rear gate Cao Amin accompanied him on footThen Cao Cao was wounded by an arrow in the arm and three arrows struck his horseHowever fortunately the horse was a fine Dawan beast full of spirit and in spite of its wounds it bore its master swiftly and well as far as the bank of River YuHere some of the pursuers came up and Cao Amin was hacked to piecesCao Cao dashed into the river and reached the further side but there an arrow struck his steed in the eye and it fellCao Caos eldest son Cao Ang dismounted and yielded his horse to his father who galloped onCao Ang was killed by arrows but Cao Cao himself got awaySoon after he met several of his officers who had rallied a few troopsThe soldiers of Qingzhou under Xiahou Dun seized the occasion to plunder the peopleYu Jin took his army fell upon them and slew many Thus he protected and appeased the people The plunderers meeting Cao Cao on the road knelt down howling and said Yu Jin had mutinied and attacked them Cao Cao was surprised and he gave order to Xiahou Dun Xu Chu Li Dian and Yue Jin to attack Yu JinNow when Yu Jin saw his master and a great company approaching he at once stopped the attack and set his troops to make a campAn officer asked him The Qingzhou soldiers say you have turned traitor why do you not explain now that the Prime Minister has arrived Why first make a camp Yu Jin replied Our enemies are coming up in our rear and are very close It is necessary to prepare for defense or we shall not withstand themExplanation is a small matter but defense is very important Soon after the camp was finished Zhang Xiu fell upon them Yu Jin himself rode out to face them Zhang Xiu drew backThe other generals of Yu Jin seeing he advance thus boldly also attacked and Zhang Xiu was overcomeThey pursued him a great distance until his force was almost annihilatedWith the miserable remnant he finally fled to Liu Biao Cao Caos army reformed and the commanders musteredThen Yu Jin went to see his master and told him of the conduct of the Qingzhou soldiers and their looting and why he had attacked themWhy did you not tell me before you made the camp Yu Jin related what had occurredSaid Cao Cao When the first thought of a leader in the time of greatest stress is to maintain order and to strengthen his defenses giving no thought to slander but shouldering his burdens bravely and when he thereby turns a defeat into a victory who even of the ancient leaders can excel Yu Jin Cao Cao rewarded Yu Jin with a golden armor and the lordship of YishouBut Cao Cao reprimanded Xiahou Dun for the lack of discipline among his soldiers Sacrifices in honor of the dead warrior Dian Wei were instituted Cao Cao himself led the wailing and paid due honorsTurning to his officers he said I have lost my first born son but I grieve not so heavily for him as for Dian Wei I weep for him All were sad at the loss of this generalThen orders were issued to return to the capital When Imperial Legate Wang Ze bearing the imperial decree reached Xuzhou he was met by Lu Bu who conducted him into the residence where the decree was read It conferred Lu Bu the title General Who Pacifies the East and a special seal accompanied the mandateThe private mediating letter was also handed over and the messenger detailed the high appreciation in which Lu Bu was held by the Chief Minister of StateLu Bu was greatly pleasedNext came news that a messenger from Yuan Shu had arrivedWhen he had been introduced he said My masters project of declaring himself emperor is advancing He has already built a palace and will speedily choose Empress and concubines and would come to the South of River HuaiHe is looking forward to receiving the fiancee of the Heir Apparent Has the rebel gone so far cried Lu Bu in a rageHe put the messenger to death and Han Yin into the cage He drafted a memorial of thanks and sent it to the capital at the same time sending too Han Yin the unfortunate agent who had arranged the marriage allianceHe also replied to Cao Caos private meditating letter asking to be confirmed in his protectorship of Xuzhou The letter was sent by the hand of Chen DengCao Cao was pleased to hear of the rupture of the marriage arrangement between the houses of Yuans and Lus and forthwith put Han Yin to death in the market placeHowever Chen Deng secretly told Cao Cao saying Lu Bu is cruel stupid and facileThe longer he remains the worse I know Lu Bu quite well replied Cao Cao He is a wolf with a savage heart and it will be hard to feed him for longIf it had not been for you and your father I should not have known all the circumstances and you must help me to get rid of him Anything the Prime Minister wishes to do shall have my assistance was the replyAs a reward Cao Cao obtained an annually grant of two thousand carts of grain for Chen Gui and the governorship of Guangling for Chen Deng who then took his leaveAs he was saying farewell Cao Cao took him by the hand saying I shall depend upon you in the eastern affairs Chen Deng nodded acquiescenceThen he returned to Lu Bu who asked him how the visit wasChen Deng told him My father received a generous annuity and I was made Governor of Guangling Lu Bu enraged saying You did not ask Xuzhou for me but you got something for yourselfYour father advised me to help Cao Cao by breaking off the marriage and now I get nothing at all of what I asked while you and your father get everythingI have been victimized by your father He threatened Chen Deng with his swordChen Deng only laughed saying O General how unwary you are I unwary When I saw Cao Cao I said that to keep you going was like feeding a tiger The tiger must be kept fully fed or he would eat humansBut Cao Cao laughed and replied No not that One must treat the Commander like a falconNot feed it till the foxes and hares are done Hungry the bird is of use full fed it flies away I asked who were the quarryHe replied Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai Sun Ce of the South Land Yuan Shao of Jizhou Liu Biao of Jingzhou Liu Zhang of Yiazhou and Zhang Lu of Hanzhong these are the foxes and hares Lu Bu threw aside his sword and laughed saying Yes he understands me But just about that time came news of the advance of Yuan Shu on Xuzhou and that frightened Lu BuWhen discord rose between Qin and Jin They were attacked by Yue and Wu And when a promised bride never came An army marched against army to enforce the claimHow all this fell out will be shown in the next chapter CHAPTER Yuan Shu Marches Out An Army Of Seven Divisions Cao Cao And Three Generals Join Forces The south of River Huai was very fruitful and Yuan Shu as governor of such a large territory was very influential He was not a little puffed up The possession of the Imperial Hereditary Seal pledged by Sun Ce added to his pride And he seriously thought of assuming the full style As a preliminary he assembled all his officers and addressed them thusThe Supreme Ancestor the Founder of Han Dynasty was only a very minor official and yet he became ruler of the empireThe dynasty has endured four centuries and its measure of fortune has run out It no longer possesses authority the cauldron is on the point of boiling overMy family has held the highest offices of state for four generations and is universally respectedWherefore I wish in response to the will of Heaven and the desire of the people to assume the Imperial DignityWhat think ye of the proposal my officers Secretary Yan Xiang rose in opposition at once saying You may not do thisPrince Wen the Ancestor of the Zhou was of distinguished virtue and held many offices till the last years of Shang Dynasty he had two thirds of the empire Still he served and was loyal to the ruling houseYour house is honorable but it is not so glorious as that of ZhouThe Hans may be reduced but they are not so abominably cruel as those of the Shang Dynasty that they are to be overthrownIndeed this should not be done Yuan Shu did not hear this with pleasureSaid he We Yuans came from the Chen family the same ancestry with King ShunBy the rule of interpreting the signs of fate the day has come when earth Beside there is an oracle saying One who replaces the Hans must wade through deep mire My name means the high road It fits exactlyFurther than this I possess the Imperial Hereditary Seal and must become lord of all or I turn from Heavens own wayFinally I have made up my mind so if any one says too much that person will simply suffer death Yuan Shu arrogated himself the insignia of royalty and assigned Second Glory the reign titleHe set up officials with titles only given by an emperor and rode in a chariot decorated with the dragon and phoenix and offered sacrifices after the manner of an emperor in the north and south suburbs Also he appointed the daughter of Feng Fang his Empress and his son Heir Apparent and he pressed for the early wedding of Lu Bus daughter with his son so that the palace entourage might be completeBut when Yuan Shu heard of the fate of his marriage ambassador Han Yin who was sent to the capital and was executed Yuan Shu was very angry and began at once to plan for revengeHe made Zhang Xun his Grand Commander and gave Zhang Xun the command of more than two hundred thousand soldiers with the instruction to invade Xuzhou The army consisted of seven divisions under seven commanders Zhang Xun led the Center Army Qiao Rui the First Left Army Lei Bo the Second Left Army Han Xian the Third Left Army Chen Ji First Right Army Chen Lan Second Right Army and Yang Feng the Third Right ArmyEach commander was instructed to make a certain town his objectiveThe Imperial Protector of Yangzhou Jin Shang was ordered to superintend the commissariat but he declined the office And so Yuan Shu put Jin Shang to deathJi Ling was in command of the reserves to help wherever he was requiredYuan Shu led thirty thousand troops and he appointed three generals Li Feng Liang Gang and Yue Jiu to go up and down and coordinate the grand marchLu Bu found out from his scouts that his own Xuzhou City was the objective of Zhang Xun the other towns to be first attacked being Xiaopei Yidu Langye Jieshi Xiapi and Junshan The invading armies were marching twenty miles a day and plundering the countryside as they advancedLu Bu summoned his advisers to a council to which came Chen Gong Chen Deng and Chen GuiWhen all had assembled Chen Gong said This misfortune that has come to us is due to the two Chens who fawned upon the central government in order to obtain rank and appointments Now remove the evil by putting these two to death and sending their heads to Yuan Shu Then he will retire and leave us in peace Lu Bu acquiesced and had the two arrestedBut the son Chen Deng only laughed saying What is this anxiety aboutThese seven armies are no more to me than so many heaps of rotting strawThey are not worth thinking about If you can show us how to overcome them I will spare your life said Lu BuGeneral if you will listen to poor me the region will be perfectly safe Let us hear what you have to say Yuan Shus troops are numerous but they are only a flock of crows they are not an army under a leader There is no mutual confidenceI can keep them at bay with the ordinary guards of the place and could overcome them by some unsuspected stratagemIf I should fail I have another plan by which I can not only protect the region but capture our enemy Let us have it Chen Deng said Han Xian and Yang Feng two of the leaders of our enemies are old servants of the Han Dynasty who fled from fear of Cao Cao and being homeless sought refuge with Yuan ShuHe despises them and they are dissatisfied with his serviceA little letter from the court will secure their help as our allies and with Liu Bei to help us on the outside we can certainly overcome Yuan Shu You shall take the letters yourself said Lu BuChen Deng agreed and a memorial detailing his intentions was sent to the capital letters to Yuzhou to Liu Bei and finally Chen Deng was sent with a small escort to wait for Han Xian on the road to Xiapi When Han Xians army had halted and pitched camp Chen Deng went to see Han Xian who said What are you here forYou belong to Lu Bu I am a noble of the court of the great Hans Why do you call me a Lu Bus manIf you General hitherto a minister of state now serve a traitor you will nullify the grand services you rendered in protecting the Emperor in the flight from ChanganBeside the suspicious Yuan Shu will assuredly do you some harm and you will regret not having taken this opportunity to work against him Han Xian sighed saying I would return to my allegiance if there should be any opportunity Thereupon Chen Deng gave him Lu Bus letter asking for cooperationHan Xian read it and said Yes I knowYou may return to your master and say General Yang Feng and I will turn our weapons and smite Yuan ShuLook out for a signal flare and let your master come to our aid As soon as Chen Deng had got back and reported his success Lu Bu divided his troops into five divisions each of ten thousand and sent them to five threatened towns to meet his enemiesGao Shun led one army to Xiaopei against Qiao Rui Chen Gong to Yidu against Chen Ji Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to Langye against Lei Bo Song Xian and Wei Xu to Jieshi against Chen LanLu Bu himself led against the main body under Zhang Xun leaving a small guard in Xuzhou CityLu Bu camped ten miles from the wallsWhen the enemy came up Zhang Xun thought Lu Bu too strong to attack with the force he had so he retired seven miles to await reinforcementsThat night in the second watch Han Xian and Yang Feng arrived and soon the flare was lighted as arranged Lu Bus troops were admitted to the camp and caused great confusionThen Lu Bu gave a full attack and Zhang Xun was routed and fledLu Bu pursued till daylight when he fell in with one of the other bodies led by Ji LingBoth sides faced each other but at the very beginning of the engagement Yang Feng and Han Xian also attacked and Ji Ling was forced to flyLu Bu went in pursuit but soon another force came out from the rear of some hills These looked very imposing As the ranks opened Lu Bu saw a leaders guard with flags bearing dragons and phoenixes and representations of the sun and moon the stars in the four groups of the Great Bear Constellation the five directions of the Earth golden gourds silver axes yellow halberds white yaks tails all imperial emblems And beneath a yellow silken parasol sat Yuan Shu on horseback clad in silver mail with a sword handle showing at each wristStanding out in front of the array Yuan Shu railed at his opponent calling him traitor and bastardLu Bu said nothing but rode forward ready for battle and Li Feng one of Yuan Shus leaders advanced to take the challengeThey met but at the third bout Li Feng was wounded in the hand whereupon his spear fell to the ground and he fledLu Bu waved on the advance and his men prevailedThe other side fled leaving much spoil clothing mail and horsesYuan Shus defeated troops had not gone far when a strong army led by Guan Yu appeared barring his way TraitorWhy have they not slain you cried Guan YuWhereat Yuan Shu fled in great trepidation and his army melted into fugitives in all directions The new army fell upon them with great slaughterYuan Shu and the remnant of his army retreated into the below regions of River HuaiVictory being now secure Lu Bu in company with Guan Yu Yang Feng and Han Xian returned to Xuzhou where there were banquets and feasting and rewards for the soldiers and generals of five divisionsThese over Guan Yu took his leave and returned to Yuzhou while Han Xian was appointed Governor of Yidu and Yang Feng Governor of LangyeThere had been a question of keeping these two in Xuzhou City but Chen Gui opposed it saying Let them hold those places in Huashang Mountains which will be all yours within a year So Han Xian and Yang Feng were sent to these two cities in the meantime to await ordersWhy not retain them here asked Chen Deng secretly of his fatherThey would be a basis for our conspiracy against Lu Bu But if they helped him on the other hand we should lengthen the tigers claws and teeth said Chen GuiSo Chen Deng could only approve of his fathers precautionsYuan Shu returned home burning to avenge his defeat so he sent to the South Land to ask a loan of troops from Sun CeBut Sun Ce said On the strength of holding the State Seal he secretly calls himself emperor and rebels against the HansI would rather punish such a renegade than help him So Sun Ce refusedThe letter refusing help added to Yuan Shus angerWhat next from this callow youth cried Yuan ShuI will smite him before I deal with the others But his adviser Yang Dajiang dissuaded him from this courseHaving refused help to his powerful rival Sun Ce thought it wise to take measures for his own safety So he stationed an army at JiangkouSoon after came a messenger from Cao Cao bearing Sun Ces appointment as Governor of Kuaiji with orders to raise an army and reduce Yuan Shu Sun Ce was inclined to carry out these orders but he called a council at which Zhang Zhao opposed this courseSaid he Although recently defeated Yuan Shu has large army and ample suppliesHe is not to be attacked lightly You would better write to Cao Cao persuading him to attack the South of River Huai and we will be auxiliaries Between the two armies Yuan Shu must certainly be defeatedIf by the remotest chance we lose we have Cao Cao to come to our rescue This plan was adopted and a messenger was sent to lay it before Cao CaoIn the meantime after the defeat at River Yu Cao Cao had reached Xuchang where his first thought was to institute sacrifices to his beloved lost leader Dian WeiHe conferred rank upon his son Dian Man and took him into his own palace to be cared forPresently arrived Sun Ces messenger with letters and next came a report that Yuan Shu being short of food had made a raid on ChenliuCao Cao thought the moment opportune so he issued orders for the south expedition leaving Cao Ren to hold the capitalThe army marched horse and foot one hundred seventy thousand with commissariat wagons of food to the number of over a thousandMessages were sent to summon Sun Ce Liu Bei and Lu BuLiu Bei was the first to welcome the grand army at his Yuzhou borders and he was called in to the Prime Ministers tentAfter the usual salutations two human heads were produced by Liu BeiWhose are these asked Cao Cao in surpriseThe heads of Han Xian and Yang Feng Why did this happen They were sent to control Yidu and Langye but they allowed their soldiers to plunder the peopleBitter complaints arose so I invited them to a banquet and my brothers dispatched them when I gave the signal by dropping a cup Their armies gave in at onceNow I have to apologize for my fault You have removed an evil which is a grand service why talk of a fault And Cao Cao praised Liu Beis actionWhen the joint army reached Lu Bus Xuzhou borders he came to meet itCao Cao spoke graciously to him and conferred upon him the title of General of the Left Army promising him an official seal as soon as he returned to the capitalLu Bu was very pleasedThen the three armies were made into one force Cao Cao being in the center Lu Bu to the left wing and Liu Bei to the right wingXiahou Dun and Yu Jin were Leaders of the Van On Yuan Shus side General Qiao Rui with fifty thousand troops was appointed Van LeaderThe armies met on the confines of the city of ShouchunQiao Rui and Xiahou Dun rode out and opened battleBut Qiao Rui fell in the third bout and his troops fled into the cityThen came news that Sun Ces fleet was near and would attack on the west The other three land corps took each one faceCao Cao on the north Lu Bu on the east and Liu Bei on the south The city of Shouchun was in a parlous state At this juncture Yuan Shu summoned his officersYang Dajiang explained the case Shouchun has suffered from drought for several years and the people are on the verge of famineSending an army would add to the distress and anger the people and victory would be uncertainI advise not to send any more soldiers there but to hold on till the besiegers are conquered by lack of suppliesMeanwhile Your Highness with regiment of guards will move over to the other side of River Huai which is quite ready and we shall also escape the enemys ferocity So due arrangements was madeOne hundred thousand troops under Li Feng Yue Jiu Liang Gang and Chen Ji were appointed to guard Shouchun Then a general move was made to the other side of the River HuaiNot only the remained army went over but all the accumulated wealth of the Yuan family gold and silver jewels and precious stones were moved alsoCao Caos army of one hundred seventy thousand needed daily no inconsiderable quantity of food and as the country around had been faminestricken for several years nothing could be got there So he tried to hasten the military operations and capture the cityOn the other hand the defenders knew the value of delay and simply held onAfter a months vigorous siege the fall of Shouchun seemed as far off as it was at first and supplies were very short Letters were sent to Sun Ce who sent a hundred thousand carts of grainWhen the usual distribution became impossible the Chief of the Commissariat Ren Jun and the Controller of the Granaries Wang Hou presented a statement asking what was to be doneServe out with a smaller measure said Cao CaoThat will save us for a time But if the soldiers murmur what then I shall have another device As ordered the controller issued grain in a short measureCao Cao sent secretly to find out how the army took this and when he found that complaints were general and the soldiers were saying that the Prime Minister was fooling them he sent a secret summons to the controllerWhen Wang Hou came Cao Cao said I want to ask you to lend me something to pacify the soldiers withYou must not refuse What does the Prime Minister wish I want the loan of your head to expose to the soldiery But I have done nothing wrong exclaimed the unhappy manI know that but if I do not put you to death there will be a mutinyAfter you are gone your wife and children shall be my care So you need not grieve on their account Wang Hou was about to remonstrate further but Cao Cao gave a signalThe executioners hustled Wang Hou out and he was beheaded His head was exposed on a tall pole and a notice said In accordance with military law Wang Hou had been put to death for peculation and the use of a short measure in issuing grain This appeased the discontentNext followed a general order threatening death to all commanders if the city was not taken within three daysCao Cao in person went up to the very walls to superintend the work of filling up the moat The defenders kept up constant showers of stones and arrowsTwo inferior officers who left their stations in fear were slain by Cao Cao himselfThereafter he went on foot to work with his soldiers and to see that work went on continuously and no one dared be a laggardThus encouraged the army became invincible and no defense could withstand their onslaught In a very short time the walls were scaled the gates battered in and the besiegers were in possessionThe officers of the garrisonLi Feng Yue Jiu Liang Gang and Chen Jiwere captured alive and were executed in the market placeAll the paraphernalia of imperial state were burned and the whole city wreckedWhen the question of crossing the river in pursuit of Yuan Shu came up Xun Yu opposed it saying The country has suffered from short crops for years and we should be unable to get grain An advance would weary the army harm the people and possibly end in disasterI advise a return to the capital to wait there till the spring wheat shall have been harvested and we have plenty of food Cao Cao hesitated and before he had made up his mind there came an urgent message Zhang Xiu with the support of Liu Biao was ravaging the country all roundThere were rebellions in Nanyang and Jiangling and Cao Hong could not cope with itCao Hong had been worsted already in several engagements and was in sore straits Cao Cao at once wrote to Sun Ce to command the Great River so as to prevent any move on the part of Liu Biao while he prepared his army to go to deal with Zhang XiuBefore marching Cao Cao directed Liu Bei to station at Xiaopei as he and Lu Bu being as brothers might help each otherWhen Lu Bu had left for Xuzhou Cao Cao said secretly to Liu Bei I am leaving you at Xiaopei to dig a pitfall for the tiger You will only take advice from Chen Deng and Chen Gui and there can be no mishapYou will find so andso your ally when needed So Cao Cao marched to Xuchang where he heard that Duan Wei had slain Li Jue and Wu Xi killed Guo Si and they presented the heads of these twoBeside the whole clan of Li Jue more than two hundred had been arrested and brought to the capitalThey were all put to death at various gates and their heads exposed as warning The people cheered the end of those two rebelsIn the Emperors palace a large number of officials were assembled at a peace banquetThe Emperor rewarded the two successful leaders Duan Wei with the title of General Who Destroys Rebellion and Wu Xi General Who Wrecks Villainy and sent to guard ChanganThey came to audience to express their gratitude and marched awayThen Cao Cao sent in a memorial that Zhang Xiu was in rebellion and an army must be sent against himThe Emperor in person arranged the chariot and escorted Cao Cao out of the city when he went to take command of the expeditionIt was the summer the fourth month of the third year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  Xun Yu was in chief military command in Xuchang The army marched awayIn the course of the march they passed through a wheat region and the grain was ready for harvesting but the peasants had fled for fear and the corn was uncut Cao Cao sent proclamations to all villages and townsI am sent on the expedition by command of the Emperor to capture a rebel and save the peopleI cannot avoid moving in the harvest season but if any one trample down the corn he shall be put to deathMilitary law is strict without exception and the people need fear no damage The people were very pleased and lined the road wishing success to the expeditionWhen the soldiers passed wheat fields they dismounted and pushed aside the stalks so that none were trampled downOne day when Cao Cao was riding through the fields a dove suddenly got up startling the horse so that it swerved into the standing grain and a large patch was trampled downCao Cao at once called the Provost Marshal and bade him decree the sentence for the crime of trampling down cornHow can I deal with your crime asked the Provost Marshal I made the rule and I have broken itCan I otherwise satisfy public opinion Cao Cao laid hold of the sword by his side and made to take his own lifeAll hastened to prevent him and Guo Jia said In ancient days the days of the Spring and Autumn history the laws were not applied to the persons of the most importantYou are the supreme leader of a mighty army and must not wound yourself Cao Cao pondered for a long timeAt last he said Since there exists the reason just quoted I may perhaps escape the death penalty Then with his sword he cut off his hair and threw it on the ground saying I cut off the hair as touching the head Then he sent messengers to exhibit the hair throughout the whole army saying The Prime Minister having trodden down some corn ought to have lost his head by the terms of the order now here is his hair cut off as an attack on the head This deed was a stimulus to discipline all through the army so that not a person dared be disobedient A poet wrote A myriad soldiers march along and all are brave and bold And their myriad inclinations by one leader are controlledThat crafty leader shore his locks when forfeit was his head O full of guile were thou Cao Cao as every one has saidOn the first news of the approach of Cao Cao with an army Zhang Xiu wrote to Liu Biao for helpThen Zhang Xiu led out his troops with his two generals Lei Xu and Zhang Xian When the array was complete Zhang Xiu took his station in front and pointing at Cao Cao railed at him saying O false and pretended supporter of benevolence and justice O shameless oneYou are just a beast of the forest and absolutely devoid of humanity This annoyed Cao Cao who sent out Xu Chu against the insulterZhang Xian came to meet him and fell in the third boutThence Zhang Xius troops fled and were pursued to the very walls of Nanyang only managing to get within just before the pursuit came upThe city was then closely besieged Seeing the moat was so wide and deep that approach to the wall would be difficult Cao Caos commanders began to fill up the ditch with earthThen with sand bags brushwood and bundles of grass they built a great mound near the wall and on this erected steps so that they could look over into the cityCao Cao rode round the city closely inspecting the defensesThree days later he issued an order to make a mound of earth and brushwood at the northwest corner as he would mount the walls at that pointHe was observed from within the city by Jia Xu who went to Zhang Xiu and said I know what Cao Cao intends and I can defeat him by a countermove Even amongst the very foremost There is one who leads the way Some one sees through your devices Be as crafty as ye mayWhat the countermove was will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER  Giving Counsels Jia Xu Directs A Great Victory Braving Battlefield Xiahou Dun Loses An Eye Jia Xu as he had guessed the enemys intention had also devised a countermove So he went to his chief and said I saw Cao Cao very carefully reconnoitering round about the cityHe certainly noticed that the southeast corner of the wall had been lately restored with mud bricks of a different kind and that the fencing barrier is badly out of repair He will try to effect an entrance there Wherefore he is making a feint attack at the opposite point He is piling up straw and making ostentatious preparations whereby to cajole us into withdrawing from the real point of attack to defend the northwest His troops will scale the walls in the darkness and try to enter at the southeast Supposing your surmise correct what do you advise asked Zhang XiuThe countermove is plainYou issue an order for our best and bravest soldiers to fill their bellies to take only the lightest outfit and conceal themselves in the houses near the southeast cornerThen disguise the townspeople as soldiers and send them to pretend to defend the northwestTonight we will let the enemy climb up the walls and enter the city and once they are fairly within give the signal and the concealed soldiers will rush out upon themWe may even capture Cao Cao himself The stratagem was decided uponSoon the scouts told Cao Cao The defenders of the city have moved to the northwest where noisy preparations for defense are going on The opposite corner is left undefended They have fallen into my trap said Cao Cao gleefullyHe ordered his troops to prepare shovels and hooks and all the gear needed for scaling walls and all day they kept up the attack on the northwest angleBut at the second watch they dispatched the veterans to the opposite corner where they climbed the wall broke up the fencing barrier and got into the city apparently without disturbing any of the guards There was no sign of life anywhere as they enteredBut just as they were leaving the wall suddenly a bomb exploded and they found themselves in an ambushThey turned to retire but Zhang Xiu immediately fell on the rear and began a slaughterCao Caos troops were totally defeated and fled out of the gate into the countryZhang Xiu kept up the pursuit till daybreak when he retired into the city againCao Cao then rallied his army and mustered his soldiers He had lost fifty thousand and much baggage while two of his generals Lu Qian and Yu Jin were woundedCao Cao being thus worsted Jia Xu advised Zhang Xiu to write off to Liu Biao to cut off Cao Caos retreat so that he might be utterly destroyedLiu Biao was preparing an army for this purpose when a scout came to say that Sun Ce had encamped in the river at HukouKuai Liang said This move of Sun Ce in the river is part of Cao Caos strategy and there will be neverending regret if Cao Cao is allowed to escapeAn immediate expedition is necessary Wherefore Liu Biao moved out with his army to Anzhong to block Cao Cao leaving Huang Zu to hold Jingzhous points of vantageZhang Xiu having been informed of the movement of Liu Biao went with Jia Xu to smite Cao Cao on the rearIn the meantime Cao Caos army marching very leisurely had arrived at XiangyangWalking one day beside River Yu he suddenly uttered a great cry and when his officers asked the reason thereof he replied I remembered that here only a year ago I lost my great general Dian WeiIs that not a reason to grieve Thereupon Cao Cao gave orders to halt while he should make a great sacrifice and mourn for his lost leaderAt the ceremony he himself burned incense and wailed and prostrated himself The army was much affected by his devotionAfter the sacrifices to the lost hero he sacrificed to the names of his nephew Cao Amin and his eldest son Cao Ang both of whom had died at the same timeHe also sacrificed to his lost soldiers and even to his Dawan steed which had been killed by an arrowNext day Xun Yu wrote to tell Cao Cao that Liu Biao had gone to help Zhang Xiu and was camped at Anzhong thereby cutting his road of retreatCao Cao replied to the letter saying I have been marching only a short distance each day and of course knew of the pursuitBut my plans are laid and as I am near Anzhong my enemy will be brokenYou need not have any fears Then Cao Cao hastened his march till he came near where Liu Biao had taken position Zhang Xiu still shortened the distanceCao Cao ordered his men during the night to open a secret way through a pass where he laid an ambush With the first light of dawn Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu met As Cao Caos force looked small they thought he had retired so they boldly advanced into the pass to smite him Then the ambush was opened and both the attackers forces were cut upThe fighting ended Cao Caos soldiers went outside the pass and encamped The two leaders on the other side restored order among their beaten troops and then held a conferenceHow could we have foreseen such a wicked ruse said Liu BiaoLet us try again said Zhang XiuWherefore they joined forces at AnzhongBut Xun Yu discovered through his spies that Yuan Shao was preparing an attack on Capital Xuchang so he at once wrote to Cao Cao who much disturbed by this news set out homeward right awayWhen Zhang Xiu heard this through his scouts he wished to follow the retreating armyJia Xu opposed it and said It will lead to a defeat However Liu Biao said It is wrong to lose such a chance And so finally pursuit was decided uponThey had not marched more than four miles before they came upon Cao Caos rearguard who fought with great vigor and bravery so that the pursuers were beaten off and went home discomfitedZhang Xiu said to Jia Xu This defeat comes from my not following your advice Now set your army in order and pursue said Jia XuBut we have just suffered defeat cried both leaders Do you now counsel pursuit Yes and the result will be a great victory if you go nowI will venture my head on that said Jia XuZhang Xiu had confidence but Liu Biao was afraid and would not accompany himSo one army only started in pursuit However this was enoughCao Caos rearguard was thoroughly routed and abandoned their wagons and their baggage in their hasty flightZhang Xiu pursued but suddenly a troop came out from the shelter of some hills and checked himFearful to try further he hastened back to AnzhongThe other general Liu Biao asked the adviser to explain his apparent inconsistency saying When our veteran and brave soldiers were going to pursue those who retreated you said our men would lose the day and when defeated men pursued the victors you foretold victoryYou were right in both cases but we wish you would enlighten us It is easy to explainYou Generals although skilled leaders are not a match for our enemyThough Cao Cao had lost a battle he had able generals to keep the rear and guard against pursuitOur soldiers are good but not a match for them That is how I knewFor as much as Cao Caos hurried retreat was due to trouble in the capital and he had beaten off our attack I knew he would retire at his utmost speed and not take his usual precautionsI ventured to take advantage of his laxity Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu could not but affirm his complete understanding of the conditionsOn the advice of Jia Xu then Liu Biao returned to Jingzhou while Zhang Xiu took up his position at Xiangyang so that each strengthened the other as the lips protect the teeth from coldWhen Cao Cao during his retreat heard that his army was being pursued he hastily turned back to support the rearguard Then he saw the pursuing army draw offThe soldiers of the beaten rearguard said Had it not been for the troops that came out of the hills we should all have been lost What troops asked Cao Cao in surprise The leader of the troops then advanced slung his spear and dismounting made a low obeisanceHe was Li Tong Imperial Commander from JiangxiaCao Cao asked him why he had comeLi Tong replied I was in command at Runan when I heard of the struggle going on so I came to lend you any help I could To show his gratitude Cao Cao conferred upon Li Tong the title Lord Who Renders High Services and confirmed him in his command as the defense of Runan against Liu Biao and Zhang XiuThen Li Tong expressed his thanks and took his leaveOn his return to the capital Cao Cao presented a memorial on the good services rendered by Sun Ce and the Emperor made him Lord of Wu  with the title General Who Destroys Rebels The messenger bearing the decree bore also the order to repress Liu BiaoCao Cao went to his palace and there received the ceremonial calls of congratulation These finished Xun Yu asked saying You Sir marched very leisurely to Anzhong how came it that you felt certain of victory Cao Cao replied My soldiers who retire and find their retreat cut off fight vigorously and desperatelyI retired slowly to entice the enemy into following whereby I could do as I wished with them Basing my movements on these considerations I felt secure Xun Yu bowed his head in admirationWhen Guo Jia entered Cao Cao said Why so late Sir The visitor drew a letter from his sleeve saying to his master Yuan Shao sends this expressing he desires to send an army to attack Gongsun Zan and wishes you to lend provisions and troops I heard Yuan Shao was going to attack Xuchang I suppose my return has made him change his intention said Cao CaoThen he opened the letter and read it It was couched in very arrogant terms Yuan Shao is so exceedingly rude that I will attack him said Cao Cao Only I think I am not quite strong enoughWhat should be done Guo Jia said My lord you know well who lost and why in the conflict between Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor and Xiang Yu his rival the former won only by superior wisdomXiang Yu was the stronger but in the end he was overcomeYour rival has ten weak points whereas you have ten strong ones and though his army is large it is not terrible Then Guo Jia continued Yuan Shao is overmuch devoted to ceremony and deportment while you are sympathetic and natural this is an excellence in conductHe is antagonistic and drives you are conciliatory and lead so you have the advantage of popular approvalFor many years the government has been lax and he makes it more so you strive vigorously after efficiency this is the excellence of able administrationHe is outwardly liberal but grudging at heart and too given to nepotism you appear exacting but you understand and use people after their ability this is the advantage of correct appreciationHe is a visionary but lacking in decision you are a man of prompt decision and direct action this is an advantage in policyHe loves to gather about him people of renown you treat people as you find them regardless of their reputation this is where you excel in moral virtueHe is compassionate to those at hand but careless about those out of sight your care is allembracing this is where you excel in humanityHe lends a ready ear to calumny and is misled you may be flooded with evil counsel but you preserve independence this is where you excel in perspicacityHis sense of right and wrong is confused your appreciation is accurate and clear this is where you excel in administrative capacityHe loves the makebelieve force but is ignorant of military essentials you would overcome with far inferior numbers as you possess military genius this is where you excel in warWith your ten superiorities you will have no difficulty in overcoming Yuan Shao How can I be worth as much as you say said Cao Cao smilingWhat Guo Jia has said about the ten points in your favor agrees exactly with what I think said Xun YuYuan Shaos army is not formidable in spite of its size The real and dangerous enemy is Lu Bu said Guo JiaWhen Yuan Shao has gone north to destroy Gongsun Zan we ought to sweep away Lu Bu and so clear away our danger from that side for if this is not done our attack on Yuan Shao will be the signal for an attempt on the capitalThat would be most serious Cao Cao saw things in the same light as his advisers and began to discuss plans for an attack on Lu BuXun Yu was of opinion that they should first secure the fidelity and aid of Liu BeiSo letters were written and they waited his assurance before moving a soldier Then in order to reassure Yuan Shao his emissary was treated with great kindness and a memorial presented to the Emperor asking extra honors for him Yuan Shao was made Imperial Protector of the four northern regionsJizhou Qingzhou Youzhou and BingzhouWith all this a private letter was written by Cao Cao urging upon him to attack Gongsun Zan and promising assistance So Yuan Shaos army started In the meantime the two Chen Deng and Chen Gui were playing their gameAt every feast and gathering in Xuzhou they uttered the most fulsome praises of Lu BuChen Gong was greatly displeased and took an opportunity to talk about them to his master They flatter you to your face but what is in their hearts You ought to be most carefully on your guard Hold your tongue was the angry reply You are simply slandering them without the slightest excuseYou want to harm good people No ears for loyal words said Chen Gong as he went away sad at heart and we shall suffer He thought seriously of abandoning Lu Bu but that would be too painful a wrenchBeside he feared people would laugh at himSo the days passed sorrowfully for himOne day with a few horsemen he rode out to the country near Xiaopei to hunt On the high road he saw a messenger galloping along in hot haste and began to wonder what it might mean He left the hunt rode across country and intercepted the rider Where are you from Who sent you asked Chen GongThe messenger made no reply for he knew to what party his captors belongedBut they searched him and found a letter the secret reply to Cao Caos letter from Liu BeiThe messenger and the letter were both taken straight to Lu Bu He questioned the man who said The Prime Minister sent me to bear a letter to Imperial Protector Liu BeiI was now taking back the replyI know nothing more and I am ignorant of the contents of the letters So Lu Bu tore it open and readI have received your commands concerning the destruction of Lu Bu and dare I for a moment venture to disregard themBut my force is weak and I must act with extreme circumspection If you move your main body then I will hasten forward and in the meantime my army shall be got ready and weapons preparedI await your command Lu Bu was really alarmedThe wretches cried he To dare to act thus The unhappy messenger was put to death and countermoves plannedChen Gong and Zang Ba went to enlist the help of the Taishan Mountains banditsSun Guan Wu Dun Yin Li and Chang Xiso that they would take Yanzhou in the east of Huashang MountainsGao Shun and Zhang Liao went to attack Liu Bei in XiaopeiSong Xian and Wei Xu went west to attack Runan and YingchuanAnd Lu Bu took command of a large body of troops ready to afford help wherever neededThe departure of the army under Gao Shun against Xiaopei was reported to Liu Bei who assembled his officers at a councilSun Qian advised sending a message to the capital to inform Cao Cao of their dangerIn response to the chiefs call Jian Yong a fellow townsman of Liu Bei offered to take the message Up to that moment Jian Yong had served as a secretarySo a letter was written and Jian Yong set out at once on his journeyThen preparations were made for defense Liu Bei commanding at the south gate Sun Qian at the north gate Guan Yu at the west gate and Zhang Fei at the east gate Mi Zhu and his brother Mi Fang commanded the family guard in the centerThe two Mis were put in command of the house guard because they were Liu Beis brothersinlaw he had taken a sister of Mi Zhu as a second wife Hence they were suitable men to guard the family In due course Gao Shun came to the south gateLiu Bei ascended the tower and said I have no quarrel with your master why do you come here with an army You have plotted with Cao Cao to injure my master as we know now why should I not bind you So saying Gao Shun gave the signal to attackBut Liu Bei did not go out to repulse Gao Shun he only kept the gate fast closedSoon after Zhang Liao led an attack on the west gate then kept by Guan Yu who addressed Zhang Liao from the wall You are too good a man to waste yourself on rebels said Guan YuZhang Liao hung his head and made no replyGuan Yu knew that Zhang Liao had a sound heart and high principles and said no more as he was unwilling to wound Zhang Liao Nor did he go out to attackZhang Liao then drew off and proceeded to the east gate and Zhang Fei went out to give battle Soon it was told Guan Yu who came over quicklyHe saw Zhang Fei going out but Zhang Liao was already withdrawing Zhang Fei wished to pursue but his brother held him backHe is afraid and so has gone away it would be best to pursue said Zhang Fei No said Guan YuAs a warrior he is not inferior to either of us but I have spoken a few straight words and he has sunk deepHe is repentant and that is why he will not meet us So Zhang Fei understood and the gates were shut and orders given for careful defenseWhen Jian Yong Liu Beis messenger reached the capital he saw Cao Cao and told him what had happened The advisers were called to discuss a planCao Cao said I wish to attack Lu Bu I fear not Yuan Shao but Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu may attack me in the rear Xun You the nephew of Xun Yu replied Both these latter have been too recently defeated to do anything so rashBut Lu Bu is a bold fighting man and if he joined forces with Yuan Shu and they set themselves to conquer River Huai and River Si the problem would he difficult Then spoke Guo Jia Let us take advantage of the moment before they have fully made up their mindSmite before they are fully prepared And Cao Cao did so An army of fifty thousand were sent in advance with four commandersXiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Lu Qian and Li Dian Cao Cao commanded the center army which marched by divisions and Jian Yong brought up the rearSoon the scouts informed Gao ShunHe sent flying messengers to Lu Bu who detached two hundred horse with Hou Cheng Cao Xing and He Meng to assist him Gao Shun posted this reinforcement and his army about ten miles from Xiaopei to meet Cao Caos army Lu Bu and the main army also followed close When Liu Bei saw the enemy retiring from the city he knew Cao Caos army was close at hand So making arrangements for guarding the city within he and his two brothers marched their troops out of the city and made a camp that they might be ready to assistNow the division of Cao Caos army under Xiahou Dun having marched out in advance first came into touch with Gao Shun Xiahou Dun at once rode out with spear set and offered a challenge It was accepted and the two leaders fought half a hundred bouts Then Gao Shun began to weaken and had to turn backHe rode round to the rear of his arrayXiahou Dun was not the man to quail so he followed right into the enemys countryThen Cao Xing one of Lu Bus generals secretly strung his bow fitted an arrow and when Xiahou Dun had come quite near shot at him The arrow hit Xiahou Dun full in the left eyeHe shrieked and putting up his head pulled out the arrow and with it the eye Essence of my father blood of my mother I cannot throw this away cried Xiahou Dun and he put the eye into his mouth and swallowed itThen resuming his firm grip of his spear Xiahou Dun went after this new enemy There was no escape for Cao XingHe was overtaken and fell with a fatal spear wound full in the faceBoth sides were stricken dumb with amazementHaving thus slain the man who had wounded him Xiahou Dun rode back toward his own sideGao Shun went in pursuit and waving on his army attacked so vigorously that he won the dayXiahou Yuan defended for his elder brother as they fledLu Qian and Li Dian led various divisions back to Jibei and made a campGao Shun having scored this victory returned to attack Liu Bei and as Lu Bu opportunely arrived with Zhang Liao these three arranged their forces so that each attacked one of the brothers Dauntless was Xiahou Dun that warrior bold His courage had been proved of old But smitten sore one hapless day He might not in the battle stay The fate of Liu Bei will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER Cao Cao Fights At Xiapi Lu Bu Perishes At The White Gate Tower As was stated before Gao Shun and Zhang Liao together went to smite Guan Yu while Lu Bu attacked Zhang Fei Both brothers went out to give battle while Liu Bei force was held in reserveBut then Lu Bu attacked both Guan Yu and Zhang Fei from the rear and the brothers were forced to fleeLiu Bei with a few score of horsemen rushed back to XiaopeiAs he approached the gate with Lu Bu pressing him close he shouted to the soldiers on the wall to lower the drawbridgeLu Bu was so close behind that the archers on the wall feared to shoot lest they should wound their lord and so Lu Bu got into the gate The gate guards could not force him back so they scattered in all directionsLu Bu led his force into the cityLiu Bei saw the position was too desperate for him to reach his residence and he must abandon all his family So he hastened through the city and left by the west gate out at which he and his scanty following fled for very life When Lu Bu reached the residence he was met by Mi Zhu who said The hero does not destroy a persons familyYour rival for the empire is Cao Cao and my master always mindful of the good turn you did him at the Archery Feast would not be ungratefulBut he could not help going to Cao Cao and I think you will pity him Lu Bu replied We two are old friends how could I bear to harm his wives and children Whereupon he sent the family to Xuzhou with Mi Zhu to take care of themNext Lu Bu led his army into Huashang Mountains to Yanzhou leaving Gao Shun and Zhang Liao to guard XiaopeiDuring these troubles Sun Qian had also fled out of the city Guan Yu and Zhang Fei each with a handful of soldiers had got away to the hillsAs Liu Bei with his few horsemen was making the best of their way from the scene of his defeat he heard some one coming up behind him When he got closer the person proved to be Sun QianI know not the fate of my brothers whether they be alive or dead and my wife and children are lost to me What can I do said Liu BeiSun Qian replied I see nothing better than getting away to Cao Cao whence we may be able to plan our future moves Liu Bei had no better plan to propose and the two men directed their way to Xuchang choosing byroads rather than highwaysWhen their small supplies ran out they entered a village to begBut when the people of any place heard that Liu Bei of Yuzhou was the man who needed help they vied with each other in offering all that was requiredOne day they sought shelter at a house whence a youth came out and made a low obeisance They asked his name and he gave it as Liu An of a well known family of huntersHearing who the visitor was the hunter wished to lay before him a dish of game but though he sought for a long time nothing could be found for the table So Liu An came home killed his wife and prepared a portion for his guestWhile eating Liu Bei asked What flesh is it Liu An told himWolf Liu Bei knew no better and ate his fillNext day at daylight just as Liu Bei was leaving he went to the stables in the rear to get his horse and passing through the kitchen he saw the dead body of a woman lying on the table The flesh of one arm had been cut awayQuite startled he asked what this meant and then he knew what he had eaten the night beforeHe was deeply sorry at this proof of his hosts regard and the tears rained down as he mounted his steed at the gateI wish I could go with you said Liu An but as my mother still lives I cannot go so far from home Liu Bei thanked him and went his wayThe party took the road by Liangcheng and as they were going out they saw not far off a thick cloud of dustWhen the troop came nearer they found the troops were of Cao Caos army and with them they traveled to the main camp where they found Cao Cao himself Cao Cao shed tears at the sad story of Liu Beis distress the loss of the city his brothers and wives and childrenWhen Liu Bei him of the hunter who had sacrificed his wife to feed them Cao Cao sent the hunter a present of a hundred ounces of silver as a reward The march then was continued to Jibei where Xiahou Yuan welcomed them They heard that his brother Xiahou Dun was still ill from the wound he had received in the eyeCao Cao went to the sick mans bedside to see him and had him removed to Xuchang for skilled treatmentPresently scouts sent out particularly for tidings of Lu Bu returned saying Lu Bu has allied himself with the bandits in the east and they are attacking Yanzhou At this Cao Cao dispatched Cao Ren with three thousand soldiers to take Xiaopei while he in conjunction with Liu Bei moved against Lu BuThey went east As they reached the Mangdang Hills near Xiao Pass they met the a band of thirty thousand Taishan Mountains brigands barring their road The chieftains of the bandits were Sun Guan Wu Dun Yin Li and Chang Xi who rode out with their spears setHowever Xu Chu plunged into the battle and easily beat them back and chased them right up to the passThe scouts told Lu Bu who was then in Xuzhou whither he had gone to start an expedition to save Xiaopei He left the protection of Xuzhou to Chen Gui and set out with Chen DengAs this latter was starting Chen Gui said to him Remember the words of Cao Cao that the business of the east is in our handsNow is our moment for Lu Bu is about to suffer defeat Father I can look after the outside But when Lu Bu returns beaten you must arrange with Mi Zhu to keep him out of the cityI shall find a means of escape said Chen Deng His family is here and he has many friends How about them I also have a scheme to settle them Then Chen Deng went to see Lu Bu to whom he said Xuzhou is surrounded and this city will be fiercely attacked We ought to provide for possible retreat and I advise storing grain and money in XiapiWe could retreat there if the day went adversely Why not see about this in good time Your words are indeed wise I will also send my wives and little ones thither said Lu BuThe family left under escort of Wei Xu and Song Xian and with them was sent much grain and treasures and coins And then the soldiers marched to the relief of the passAbout half way there Chen Deng said Let me go first to reconnoiter so that you my lord may advance with confidence Thus Chen Deng parted company with his chief and preceded him to the pass where he was received by Chen Gong Chen Deng said The General greatly wonders why you do not advanceHe is going to inquire into it The enemy is in great force and we cannot be too careful said Chen GongWe are holding the pass and you should persuade our master to take steps to guard Xiaopei Chen Deng said Your words are true That evening he went up to the heights from which he could see Cao Caos army which was quite close to the passThen he wrote three notes tied them to arrows and shot them into Cao Caos campNext day he left and hastened back to Lu Bu and said Those bandits are about to give up the pass to the enemy but I have left Chen Gong to hold itYou would better make an attack tonight and hold him Had it not been for you the pass would have been lost said Lu BuThen he sent Chen Deng back to arrange a fire signal with Chen Gong for simultaneous actionSo Chen Deng returned to Chen Gong to whom he said Cao Caos troops have found a secret way through the pass and I fear Xuzhou is already lostYou ought to go back at once At this the pass was abandoned and Chen Gong began to retreat Then Chen Deng gave the prearranged signalLu Bu saw the fire and advanced in the darkness to the relief of the passPresently he met Chen Gongs army and as neither recognized the other in the darkness a fierce battle ensued Nor was the trick discovered till daylight came While these things were going on Cao Cao had noted the signal and advanced as fast as possibleThe bandits who alone remained to hold the pass were easily driven out and scattered in all directionsWhen daylight came and the trick was discovered Lu Bu and Chen Gong set off together for XuzhouBut when they arrived and summoned the gate instead of opening the doors the guards on the wall saluted them with a thick flight of arrowsAt the same time Mi Zhu appeared on the defense tower and shouted You stole our masters city and now we are going to give it back to himYou will not enter here again Where is Chen Gui cried Lu Bu angrilyWe have slain him was the replyWhere is Chen Deng said Lu Bu turning to Chen GongDo you still hold to your delusion General that you ask where this specious rogue is Lu Bu bade them search through all the ranks but Chen Deng was not to be foundThen they decided to go to XiaopeiBut ere they had got half way there suddenly appeared the troops under the command of Gao Shun and Zhang LiaoThey said Chen Deng came to us saying you General was surrounded and wanted help so we came at once Another trick of that false rogue said Lu BuSurely he shall die for this They went with all speed to Xiaopei only to see as they drew near the ensigns of the enemy displayed all along the walls for the city had been taken by Cao RenWhile Lu Bu stood at the foot of the rampart reviling the traitor Chen Deng himself appeared on the wall and pointing to Lu Bu cried Did you think that I a minister of the dynasty would serve a rebel like you Lu Bu in his wrath was about to make a desperate attack but suddenly a great noise was heard and an army came up behind him It was led by no other than Zhang FeiGao Shun went to engage him but he had no chance of successLu Bu then joined in the frayThen another army appeared and the leader this time was Cao Cao himself and his army rushed to the attackSeeing that he had no hope of victory Lu Bu went away toward the east with Cao Cao in pursuitLu Bus army marched till they were worn outThen appeared a new force under Guan Yu Holding his sword ready to strike Guan Yu called out Do not flee O Lu BuGuan Yu is waiting for you Lu Bu joined battle he was flurried and scarcely knew what was happeningAnd soon Zhang Fei came up once moreBy desperate efforts Lu Bu and his troops cut an arterial alley through the press and got freeAfter this they started for Xiapi as fast as they could travel and Hou Cheng helped to keep the pursuers at bay and welcomed them into the city So the two brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were together again after their separationBoth shed tears of joy as they told each other what they had seen and sufferedI was on the Haizhou Road when I heard of you said Guan YuI lost no time in starting And I had been camped in the Mangdang Hills for a long time It is happiness to be together again So they talked Then they marched off together to find their elder brother and made their salutations with tears In Liu Beis heart sadness and joy intermingledNext they were presented to Cao Cao and with him they went into the captured Xuzhou CityMi Zhu soon came with the welcome news of the safety of the familyAnd Chen Gui and Chen Deng came to present their salutationsA grand banquet was prepared for the officers at which Cao Cao presided as host and Chen Gui and Liu Bei occupied the seats of honor to his right and leftAt the close of the banquet Cao Cao paid the two Chens the highest compliments on their success and rewarded them with the revenues of ten counties beside giving the son the title of General Who Quells the WavesCao Cao was very pleased with his success and at once began to scheme for the taking of Xiapi the sole place now left to Lu Bu where he had taken refuge Cheng Yu said the course was inadvisable If Lu Bu be pressed too hard he may get clear by a desperate effort and throw himself into the arms of our especial enemy Yuan ShuThese two as allies would be difficult to overcomeRather send a capable man to guard the South of River Huai one able to secure you against Lu Bu on one hand and to hold Yuan Shu on the otherMoreover the bandits are in Huashang Mountains and still our enemiesThey must be watched Cao Cao replied I can keep the whole of Huashang Mountains and I will request Liu Bei to take the south Could I dare withstand your command said Liu BeiSo forthwith Liu Bei leaving Mi Zhu and Jian Yong at Xuzhou went south taking in his train Guan Yu Zhang Fei and Sun QianAnd Cao Cao led his army to XiapiLu Bu felt very secure in his refuge He had good store of grain and he had the protection of River Si so he sat quiet satisfied that he could maintain his defense So he allowed Cao Caos army to approach without molestationYou ought to attack Cao Caos army as they come up before they have time to make camps and defensesThey will only have a fatigued army to oppose to your fresh troops and you will certainly defeat them So said Chen Gong but Lu Bu replied I have suffered too many defeats lately to take any riskWait till they actually attack and you will see them floating away on the waters So Lu Bu neglected the confidants advice and waited till the enemy had settled into their campThis done the attackers advanced against the city From the foot of the wall Cao Cao called to Lu Bu to listen while he spoke Lu Bu ascended to the wall where he stood Cao Cao addressed him saying When I heard that your family and that of Yuan Shu were likely to be united by marriage I sent an army against youYuan Shu was guilty of treason while you had to your credit on the destruction of Dong Zhuo For what reason have you sacrificed all your merits to throw in your lot with a rebelIt will be over late to regret when this city shall have fallenBut if you surrender and help me to support the ruling house you shall not lose your rank Lu Bu replied If the Prime Minister will retire we may be able to discuss the matter But Chen Gong standing near his master began to rail at Cao Cao for a rebel and shot an arrow that struck his plumed helmetMy oath but I will slay you at least cried Cao Cao pointing his finger at Chen GongThen the attack on the walls beganThey have come from far and cannot maintain this for long said Chen GongGeneral go out with your horse and foot and take up a position outside leaving me to maintain the defense with the remainder of our troopsIf he engages you I will come out and strike at his rear ranks if he attacks the city you can come to our aidIn ten days their stores will fail and we can beat them offThis will place them between the oxhorns The advice seems good said Lu BuLu Bu went back to his palace and prepared his weaponsAs it was the depth of winter he made his army take plenty of wadded clothing to keep them warm Lady Yan his wife heard of it and came to ask whither he was goingHe told her of Chen Gongs planShe said My lord you are leaving an undamaged city abandoning your wife and little ones and going with a paltry forceShould any untoward event happen will your handmaid and her lord ever meet again Lu Bu hesitated and for three days made no moveThen Chen Gong came to see him again and said The enemy are all round the city and unless you go out soon you will be quite hemmed in I am thinking it would be better to maintain a stubborn defense said Lu Bu Our enemies are short of food and have sent for supplies to XuchangThese will soon arrive and you should go out with some veterans and intercept the convoyThat loss would be a heavy blow Lu Bu agreed and went in to tell his wife the new planShe wept saying If you go do you think Chen Gong and others equal to the defense of the cityShould anything go wrong you would be very sorryYou abandoned me at Changan and it was only through the fortunate kindness of Pang Shu that I was hidden from our enemies and rejoined youWho would have thought you would leave me againBut go go your way as far as you wish and do not mind your wife And she wept bitterlyLu Bu very sadly went to take leave of Diao Chan who said You are my lord and my life you must not be careless and ride out alone You need not fear with my mighty trident halberd and RedHare who dare come near me He went outBut when he met Chen Gong he said That story about supplies for Cao Cao is all false one of his many rusesI am not going to stir Chen Gong sighed he felt all was lostWe shall die and no person shall know our burial place said heThereupon Lu Bu remained in his own quarters with his ladies drinking freely to dissipate his sorrowsTwo of his advisers Xu Si and Wang Kai went in and proposed Yuan Shu in the South of River Huai is very powerfulWhy not write to him to renew the marriage allianceYuan Shu can hardly refuse to rescue the affianced bride of his son So Lu Bu wrote and bade these two take the letterXu Si said You ought to send a strong escort with us to force a way through So Lu Bu told off one thousand troops and two of his generals Zhang Liao and He Meng to conduct his messenger beyond the passThey started that same night at the second watch Zhang Liao leading and He Meng bringing up the rearThey got out of the city crept past Liu Beis camp and got beyond the danger zoneThen half the escort went on and Zhang Liao led the remainder back toward the city At the pass he found Guan Yu waitingHowever at that moment Gao Shun came to his help and they all returned and reentered the gates The two messengers presently reached Shouchun saw Yuan Shu and presented the letter How is this said Yuan ShuFormerly he slew my messenger and repudiated the marriage now he sends to ask for it It is all due to the vile plans of that monster Cao Cao If pray you Illustrious Sir consider it carefully replied Xu SiBut if your master was not hemmed in by his enemy and in imminent danger he would never have thought of renewing this proposal of marriage The messengers said You may decide not to help him but the teeth are cold when the lips are goneIt will not make for your happiness and comfort Said Yuan Shu Lu Bu is unreliable tell him that I will send soldiers after the girl has arrived here This was final and the two messengers took leave and headed back to XiapiWhen the party reached Liu Beis camp Xu Si decided We must wait the night falls and Wang Kai and I will try to get through in the darkness the escort of He Meng remaining behind to protect our rear They tried that very night and the two messengers crept across without discoveryBut the escort found them selves faced by Zhang FeiHe Meng tried to fight but was captured in the very first bout and the five hundred troops of his half company were either killed or they fled The prisoner was taken to Liu Bei who forwarded him to the main campThere he told the story of the marriage and the scheme to save the city Cao Cao was angry and ordered the execution of He Meng at the main gateThen Cao Cao sent orders to each camp to exercise the greatest diligence with threats of rigorous punishment of the officers of any corps that permitted any communication between the besieged and the outer worldEvery soldier felt mightily afraidLiu Bei returned to camp and cautioned his brothers saying We are in the most important place with regard to the South of River Huai and you must be very careful not to allow any breach of this command Zhang Fei was inclined to grumble saying We have just captured one of the enemys leaders and there is no word of praise or reward for us nothing but new orders and threats What do you make of that You are wrong to complain said Liu BeiThese are orders of the CommanderinChief and what would happen were there no ordersDo not disobey them Brother They promised obedience and withdrewIn the meantime Xu Si and Wang Kai had got back to Lu Bu and told him what Yuan Shu had said that if the girl came the soldiers should goBut how can she be sent said Lu Bu Xu Si said That is the difficulty He Mengs capture means that Cao Cao knows the whole plan of getting help from the South of River HuaiI do not see how any one but you yourself could hope to get through the close siege Suppose we tried today said Lu BuThis is an illomened day you must not try todayTomorrow is a very lucky day especially in the evening for any military action Then Lu Bu ordered Zhang Liao and Gao Shun Get ready three thousand troops for the venture and prepare a light carriageI will lead the first seventy miles thence you can escort the brideelect the remainder of the way to her new home Next evening toward the second watch Lu Bu wrapped up his daughter in soft wadded garments bound her about with a mailed coat and took her on his back Then with his mighty trident halberd in hand he mounted RedHare and rode at the head of the cavalcade out of the city gate Zhang Liao and Gao Shun followed In this order they approached Liu Beis campThe drums at once beat the alarm and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei barred the way Stop they shoutedLu Bu had no desire to fight all he wished was to get through so he made for a side road Liu Bei came in pursuit and the two parties engagedBrave as he might be Lu Bu was almost helpless now that he was hampered by a girl on his shoulders whom he was desperately anxious to preserve from hurtBeside other parties came up all shouting and attacking and he had no alternative but to give up his project and return into the city of Xiapi He reached his palace very sad at heartThe besiegers returned to camp well pleased that no one had got beyond their linesLu Bu found consolation in the wine cupThe siege had gone on for two months and still the city stoodThen they heard that Zhang Yang Governor of Henei had been inclined to come to the help of Lu BuBut one of his subordinates Yang Chou had assassinated him and was bringing his head as an offering to Cao Cao when he also had been slain by Kui Gu one of the Governors adherents Kui Gu had then led the force to QuanIn the camp of the besiegers there now arose much murmuring Cao Cao sent Shi Huan to intercept and kill Kui GuThen he called a counsel saying Though Zhang Yang who meant to hurt us is happily no more yet we are threatened on the north by Yuan Shao and on the east Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu are a menace Here we meet with no success against the city of Xiapi We are for leaving Lu Bu to his fate and returning home What do you think Among them Xun You fought against the idea saying You must not act like thisLu Bu has lost much and his spirit is broken The spirit of the leader expresses that of his army and when the leader fails his soldiers do not fightChen Gong is clever but nothing is doneLu Bu broken Chen Gong without decision it only needs a sharp attack and we shall succeed I have a plan to propose said Guo Jia a plan to overcome the city at once it is better than two hundred thousand troops I suppose you mean drowning the city by River Si and River Yi said Xun YuThat is it said Guo Jia smilingCao Cao accepted the suggestion with joy and set his troops to cut the banks of River Yi and River Si and moved his army to the high ground whence they watched the drowning out of XiapiOnly the east gate remained clear of water The besieged soldiers hastened to their leaderLu Bu said Why should I fear My good horse can go as well through the water as over the land And he again returned to the wine cup for consolation drinking deeply with his wife and concubineThe continual drinking bouts told at last and Lu Bu began to look dissipatedSeeing himself in a mirror one day he was startled at the change and said to himself I am injuring myself with wine no more from this day forward He then issued an order that no one should drink wine under penalty of deathNow one of his generals Hou Cheng lost fifteen horses stolen by one of his subordinates Hou Cao who intended to resell them to Liu BeiHou Cheng found out where the horses were went out after them and recovered them after killing Hou CaoAnd Hou Chengs colleagues congratulated him on his successTo celebrate the occasion Hou Cheng brewed a few barrels of wine to be drunk at the feast But thinking his chief might find him in fault Hou Cheng sent the bottles of wine to Lu Bus palace with a petition explaining By your virtue of warlike renown I have recovered my horses and as my comrades come with their congratulations I brew some bottles of wine first to offer Your Lordship and second to ask your permission to have a little wine at the feast Lu Bu took it very angrily saying When I have forbidden all wine you brew some and begin to give feasts you are simply defying me Whereupon he ordered the officer to instant executionHowever Song Xian Wei Xu and other officers came in and interceded and after a time Lu Bu softenedYou ought to lose your head for this disobedience but for the sake of your colleagues the punishment shall be reduced to a hundred strokes They tried to beg him off this but only succeeded in reducing the number of blows to one halfWhen the sentence had been carried out and Hou Cheng was permitted to return home his colleagues came sadly to console him Had it not been for you I should have been put to death said Hou ChengSong Xian replied All Lu Bu cares for is his family there is no pity for any one elseWe are no more than the weeds by the roadside Wei Xu said The city is besieged the water is drowning us out There will not be much more of this for we may die any day He is a beast with neither a sense of humanity nor of right Let us leave him said Song Xian He is not worth fighting forThe best we could do would be to seize him and hand him over to Cao Cao said Wei XuI was punished because I got my horses back again yet all he trusts in is his own RedHareIf you two will betray the gate and seize Lu Bu I will steal the horse and go out to Cao Caos camp They settled how to carry out the plot and that very night Hou Cheng sneaked into the stables and got RedHare awayHe hastened to the east gate which was opened to let him through The guard made a pretense of pursuing him but only a pretenseHou Cheng reached the besiegers camp presented the horse and told Cao Cao what had been arranged They would show a white flag and open the gates to his armyHearing this Cao Cao had a few notifications written out which were attached to arrows and shot over the wallsThis is one of them Regent Marshal Cao Cao has received a command from the Emperor to destroy Lu BuThose who interfere with the operations of his grand army whatever their rank shall be put to death in the gate on the day that the city shall be capturedShould any one capture Lu Bu or bring his head he shall be well rewardedLet all take note of this Next day at daylight a tremendous hubbub was heard without the city and Lu Bu halberd in hand hasted to the wall to see what it meant As he went from gate to gate inspecting the defenses and guards he censured Wei Xu for letting Hou Cheng escape and get away with his horseLu Bu threatened to punish Wei XuBut just then the besiegers began a fierce attack as the white flag had just appeared and Lu Bu had to turn all his energies to defenseThe assault lasted till noon when the attacking force drew off for a timeLu Bu was taking a rest in the tower and fell asleep in his chairSong Xian sent away Lu Bus attendants and when they had gone he stole Lu Bus weapon the trident halberd in which he trusted Then Song Xian and Wei Xu fell upon Lu Bu together and before he was well awake had bound him with cords trussing him so that he could not moveLu Bu shouted for his guards but they were driven off by the two traitor generals and could not come near Then a white flag was shown and the besiegers again approached the cityThe traitors shouted out Lu Bu has been captured alive But Xiahou Yuan could hardly believe it till they threw down the famous halberd The gates were flung open and the enemy entered the cityGao Shun and Zhang Liao who were at the opposite gate were surrounded and cut off by the water and helplessThey were captured Chen Gong made a dash to the south gate but was also taken by Xu HuangPresently Cao Cao entered and at once gave orders to turn the streams back into their usual courses He put out proclamations soothing the peopleCao Cao and Liu Bei with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei behind seated themselves side by side in the White Gate TowerThe captives to the number of a thousand were brought before them Lu Bu looked a pitiable objectAlthough a very tall man he was tied up in a veritable ballThe bonds are very tight cried he I beseech you to loosen them Bindings a tiger must binding tight of course replied Cao CaoSeeing Hou Cheng Song Xian and Wei Xu standing there looking pleased at their success Lu Bu said I treated you all well enough how could you turn against me Said Song Xian You listened to the words of your women but rejected the advice of your generalsWas not that mean Lu Bu was silentThen Gao Shun was brought forwardWhat have you to say asked Cao CaoGao Shun sulkily held his tongue and was ordered out to executionNext Chen Gong was led in I hope you have been well since we last saw each other Chen Gong said Cao CaoYour ways were crooked and so I left you said Chen GongYou say I was crooked and what of your serving Lu Bu Though he was a fool he did not resemble you in deceit and wickedness You say you are able enough and clever but what about your position today Turning toward Lu Bu Chen Gong said This man would not follow my adviceHad he done so he would not now be a captive What think you ought to be done about this days work said Cao CaoThere is death for me today and that is the end said Chen Gong undauntedlyVery well for you but what of your mother and wife and children It is said that one who rules with due regard to filial piety does not harm a persons family one who would show benevolence does not cut off the sacrifices at a persons tomb My mother and wife and children are in your handsBut since I am your prisoner I pray you slay me quickly and not to try to harrow my feelings Cao Caos heart still leaned toward mercy but Chen Gong turned and walked away repulsing the attendants who would stop himCao Cao rose from his place and walked with Chen Gong the tears falling from his eyesChen Gong never looked at himTurning to his guards Cao Cao said Let his mother and family be taken to Xuchang and looked after immediatelyAny postponement will be punished The condemned man heard him but uttered no word He stretched out his neck for the blowTears sprang to the eyes of all presentHis remains were honorably coffined and buried in Xuchang A poem pitying Chen Gongs fate says Neither hope of life nor fear of death moved him How brave was he a hero indeed But his lord heeded not his words Wherefore in vain possessed he great talentsNevertheless in that he stood by his masterTo parting with wife and mother He merits our pity and profound respectWho would resemble Chen Gong That day he died at the White Gate TowerWhile Cao Cao sadly escorted Chen Gong on the way to death Lu Bu appealed to Liu Bei Noble Sir you sit there an honored guest while poor I lie bound at your feet Will you not utter one word to alleviate my lot Liu Bei noddedAs Cao Cao returned to his place Lu Bu called out Your only trouble Illustrious Sir is myself and I am on your side nowYou take the lead I will help you and together the world is at our feet What do you think said Cao Cao turning to Liu Bei You are willing to forget the episodes of Ding Yuan and Dong Zhuo Truly the lout is not to be trusted said Lu Bu looking at Liu BeiStrangle and expose said Cao CaoAs he was led away Lu Bu turned once more to Liu Bei You longeared lout you forget now the service I rendered you that day at my camp gate when my arrow hit the mark Just then some one shouted Lu Bu O foolDeath is but death and why are you scared at it Every one turned to look the guards were hustling Zhang Liao to the place of judgmentCao Cao ordered Lu Bus execution A poet has written upon the death of Lu Bu The flood spreads wide the city drowns Its lord is captive Nought avails His coursers speed or halberds thrustThe tiger erstwhile fierce now whines For mercy Cao Cao had meted him Full well a falcon flown at will And hungry kept Poor foolHe let Chen Gongs advice be overborne By harem tattle vainly now He rails against the LongEars faith And another poem saysRound is the hungry tiger eater of men for whom is no pity Since the blood of his victims is fresh and not yet dry Liu Bei spoke no word in favor of Lu Bu To whom even a fathers life was not sacredIt was recorded earlier that the executioners were hustling Zhang Liao forwardPointing to him from above Cao Cao said He has a familiar face You were not likely to forget me you saw me before in Puyang said Zhang LiaoO so you remember me eh Yes more is the pity Pity for what That the fire that day was not fierce enough to burn you up rebel that you are Cao Cao began to get angryHow dare you insult me cried he and lifted his sword to kill the bold speakerThe undaunted Zhang Liao never changed color but stretched out his neck for the blowThen a man behind Cao Cao caught his arm and in front of him another dropped on his knees saying O Prime Minister I pray thee stay thy hand Lu Bu whining was not spared Railing Zhang Liao far better faredWho was it that saved Zhang Liao The next chapter will show CHAPTER Cao Cao Organizes A Hunting Expedition In Xutian Dong Cheng Receives A Secret Command In The Palace The last chapter said that Cao Cao was checked in his angry attack upon Zhang Liao They were Liu Bei who held his arm and Guan Yu who knelt before himA man as generoushearted as he is should be saved said Liu BeiGuan Yu said I know him well as loyal and righteous I will vouch for him with my own life Cao Cao threw aside his sword and smiledI also know Zhang Liao to be loyal and good I was just testing him said heCao Cao loosed the prisoners bonds with his own hands had a change of dress brought in and clothed him therewithThen he was led to a seat of honor This kindly treatment sank deep into Zhang Liaos heart and he hastened to declare formally that he yielded And then he was given the rank of Imperial Commander and the title of LordshipZhang Liao was sent on a mission to win over the bandit leader Zang Ba who hearing what had happened came forthwith and gave in his submissionHe was graciously received and his former colleaguesSun Guan Wu Dun and Yin Lialso yielded with the exception of Chang Xi who remained obdurate All these former enemies who came over were kindly treated and given posts of responsibility wherein they might prove the reality of their conversionLu Bus family were sent to the capitalAfter the soldiers had been rewarded with feasting the camp was broken up and the army moved away to XuchangPassing through Xuzhou the people lined the roads and burned incense in honor of the victors They also petitioned that Liu Bei should be their protectorCao Cao replied Liu Bei has rendered great services You must wait till he has been received in audience and obtained his rewardAfter that he shall be sent here The people bowed low to the ground to express their thanksChe Zhou General of the Flying Cavalry was given command of Xuzhou for the moment After the army had arrived at the capital rewards were granted to all the officers who had been in the expedition Liu Bei was retained in the capital lodging in an annex to the Prime Ministers palaceNext day a court was held and Cao Cao memorialized the services of Liu Bei who was presented to Emperor XianDressed in court robes Liu Bei bowed at the lower end of the audience arenaThe Emperor called him to the Hall and asked his ancestryLiu Bei replied Thy servant is the son of Liu Hong grandson of Liu Xiong who was a direct descendant of Prince Faubus of Zhongshan who was the son of His Majesty the Emperor Myers  The Emperor bade them bring forth the Books of the Genealogies and therefrom a secretary readLiu Jing the Filial Emperor begot fourteen sons of whom the seventh was Liu Sheng Prince of Zhongshan Sheng begot Liu Zhen Lord of Luchang Zhen begot Liu Ang Lord of Pei  Lu begot Liu Lian Lord of Yishui Lian begot Liu Ying Lord of Qinyang Ying begot Liu Jian Lord of Anguo Jian begot Liu Ai Lord of Guangling Ai begot Liu Xian Lord of Jiaoshui Xian begot Liu Shu Lord of Zuyi Shu begot Liu Ziyang Lord of Qiyang Ziyang begot Liu Bi Lord of Yuanze Bi begot Liu Da Lord of Yingchuan Da begot Liu Buyi Lord of Fengling Buyi begot Liu Hui Lord of Jichuan Hui begot Liu Xiong Governor of Zhuo Xiong begot Liu Hong who held no office or rank and Liu Bei is his son The Emperor compared this with the registers of the Imperial House and found by them that Liu Bei was his uncle by descentThe Emperor seemed greatly pleased and requested Liu Bei to go into one of the side chambers where he might perform the ceremonial obeisance prescribed for a nephew to his uncleIn his heart he rejoiced to have this heroic warrior uncle as a powerful supporter against Cao Cao who really held all the power in his own handsThe Emperor knew himself to be a mere puppet He conferred upon his uncle the rank of General of the Left Army and the title of Lord of YichengWhen the banquet was concluded Liu Bei thanked the Emperor and went out of the palaceAnd from this time he was very generally styled the Imperial Uncle When Cao Cao returned to his palace Xun Yu and his fellow advisers went in to see himXun Yu said It is no advantage to you Illustrious Sir that the Emperor recognizes Liu Bei as an uncle Liu Bei may be recognized as uncle but he is under my orders since I control the decrees of the Throne He will be all the more ready to obeyBeside I will keep him here under the pretense of having him near his sovereign and he will be entirely in my handsI have nothing to fear The man I fear is Yang Biao who is a relative of the two Yuan brothers Should Yang Biao conspire with them he is an enemy within and might do much harmHe will have to be removed Hence Cao Cao sent a secret emissary to say that Yang Biao was intriguing with Yuan Shu and on this charge Yang Biao was arrested and imprisoned And his death would have been compassed had his enemy daredBut just then the Governor of Beihai Kong Rong was at the capital and he remonstrated with Cao Cao saying Yang Biao comes from a family famed for virtue for at least four generations you cannot trump up so foolish a charge as that against him It is the wish of His Majesty retorted Cao CaoIf the child Emperor Cheng of Zhou Dynasty had put Duke Chao to death could the people have believed Duke Zhou the Regent Marshal had nothing to do with it So Cao Cao had to relinquish the attempt but he took away Yang Biaos offices and banished him to his family estate in the countryCourt Counselor Zhao Yan an opponent of the Prime Minister sent up a memorial impeaching Cao Cao for having removed a minister of state from office without a decreeCao Caos reply to this was the arrest of Zhao Yan and his execution a bold stroke which terrified the bulk of officers and reduced them to silenceCheng Yu advised Cao Cao to assume a more definite position He said Illustrious Sir your prestige grows daily why not seize the opportunity to take the position of Chief of the Feudatory Princes There are still too many supporters of the court was the replyI must be carefulI am going to propose a royal hunt to try to find out the best line to follow This expedition being decided upon they got together fleet horses famous falcons and pedigree hounds and prepared bows and arrows in readiness They mustered a strong force of guards outside the cityWhen the Prime Minister proposed the hunting expedition the Emperor said he feared it was an improper thing to doCao Cao replied In ancient times rulers made four expeditions yearly at each of the four seasons in order to show their strength They were called Sou Miao Xien and Shou in the order of spring summer autumn and winterNow that the whole country is in confusion it would be wise to inaugurate a hunt in order to train the armyI am sure Your Majesty will approve So the Emperor with the full paraphernalia for an imperial hunt joined the expedition He rode a saddled horse carried an inlaid bow and his quiver was filled with goldtipped arrows His chariot followed behind Liu Bei and his brothers were in the imperial train each with his bow and quiver Each party member wore a breastplate under the outer robe and held his especial weapon while their escort followed themCao Cao rode a dun horse called FlyingLightning and the army was one hundred thousand strongThe hunt took place in Xutian and the legions spread out as guards round the hunting arena which extended over some one hundred square milesCao Cao rode even with the Emperor the horses heads alternating in the leadThe imperial attendants immediately following were all in Cao Caos confidenceThe other officers civil and military lagged behind for they dared not press forward into the midst of Cao Caos partisansOne day the Emperor was riding toward the hunting grounds and noticed his newly found uncle respectfully standing by the roadsideI should like to see my uncle display his hunting skill said the Emperor Liu Bei mounted his steed at onceJust then a hare started from its form Liu Bei shot and hit it with the first arrow The Emperor much struck by this display rode away over a slopeSuddenly a deer broke out of the thicketHe shot three arrows at it but all missed You try said the Emperor turning to Cao CaoLend me Your Majestys bow Cao Cao replied and taking the inlaid bow and the goldentipped arrows he pulled the bow and hit the deer in the shoulder at the first shot It fell in the grass and could not runNow the crowd of officers seeing the goldenbarbed arrow sticking in the wound concluded at once that the shot was the Emperors so they rushed up and shouted O King live forever Cao Cao rode out pushing past the Emperor and acknowledged the congratulationsThey all turned pale Guan Yu who was behind Liu Bei was especially angryThe silkworm eyebrows stood up fiercely and the red phoenix eyes glared as sword in hand he rode hastily forth to cut down the audacious Prime Minister for his impertinenceHowever Liu Bei hastily waved him back and shot at him a meaning glance so that Guan Yu stopped and made no further move Liu Bei bowing toward Cao Cao said Most sincere felicitationsA truly supernatural shot such as few have achieved It is only the enormous good fortune of the Son of Heaven said Cao Cao with a smileThen he turned his steed and felicitated the Emperor But he did not return the bow he hung it over his own shoulder insteadThe hunt finished with banqueting and when the entertainments were over they returned to the capital all glad of some repose after the expedition Guan Yu was still angry of the Prime Ministers breach of decorumOne day Guan Yu said to Liu Bei Brother why did you prevent me from killing that rebel and so ridding the world of a scoundrelHe insults the Emperor and ignores everybody else When you throw stones at a rat beware of the vase quoted Liu BeiCao Cao was only a horses head away from Our Lord and in the midst of a crowd of his partisansIn that momentary burst of anger if you had struck and failed and harm had come to the Emperor what an awful crime would have been laid to us If we do not rid the world of him today a worse evil will come of it said Guan Yu But be discreet my brotherSuch matters cannot be lightly discussed The Emperor sadly returned to his palace With tears in his eyes he related what had occurred in the hunt to his consort Empress Fu Alas for me said he From the first days of my accession one vicious minister has succeeded another I was the victim of Dong Zhuos evil machinations then followed the rebellion of Li Jue and Guo SiYou and I had to bear sorrows such as no others have borneThen came this Cao Cao as one who would maintain the imperial dignity but he has seized upon all real authority and does as he wishesHe works continually for his own glorification and I never see him but my back pricksThese last few days in the hunting field he went in front of me and acknowledged the cheers of the crowd He is so extremely rude that I feel sure he has sinister designs against meAlas my wife we know not when our end may come In a whole court full of nobles who have eaten the bread of Han is there not one who will save his country said sheThus spoke the Empress and at the same moment there stepped in a man who said Grieve not O Imperial PairI can find a savior for the country It was none other than the father of the Empress Fu WanHave you heard of Cao Caos wanton and perverse behavior said the Emperor drying his eyesYou mean the deer shooting Who did not see that indeedBut the whole court is full of his clan or his creaturesWith the exception of the relatives of your Consort there is not one loyal enough to deal with a rebelI have no authority and can do nothing but there is General Dong Cheng the State Uncle who could do it Could Uncle Dong Cheng come in to consult about thisI know he has had much experience of state troubles Fu Wan replied Every one of your attendants is a partisan of Cao Cao and this sort of thing must be kept most profoundly secret or the consequence will be most serious Then what can be done said the EmperorThe only plan I can think of is to send gifts of a robe and a jade girdle to Dong Cheng and in the lining of the girdle hide a secret edict authorizing him to take certain stepsWhen he gets home and has read the edict he can elaborate plans as quickly as possible and neither the spirits above nor the demons below will know anything about them The Emperor approved and Fu Wan went outThe Emperor then with his own hand drew up a decree writing it with blood drawn by biting his finger He gave the document to Empress Fu to sew into the purple lining of the girdle When all was done he put on the robe and girded it with the girdle Next he bade one of the attendants summon State Uncle Dong Cheng to the PalaceDong Cheng came and after the ceremonies were finished the Emperor said A few nights ago I was talking with the Empress of the terrible days of the rebellion and we thought of your good services then therefore we have called you in to reward you The minister bowed his head in thanksThen the Emperor led Dong Cheng out of the Reception Hall to the Temple of Ancestors and they went to the gallery of Worthy Ministers where the Emperor burned incense and performed the usual ceremoniesAfter this they went to see the portraits and among them was one of the founder of the dynasty Liu Bang the Supreme AncestorWhence sprang our great ancestor and how did he begin his great achievement said the EmperorYour Majesty is pleased to joke with thy servant said Dong Cheng rather startled at the questionWho does not know the deeds of the Sacred Ancestor He began life as a minor official in Sishang There gripping his sword he slew a white serpent the beginning of his struggle for the rightSpeedily he mastered the empire in three years had destroyed Qin and in five also ChuThus he set up a dynasty that shall endure forever Such heroic forefathers Such weakling descendants How sad it is said the EmperorPointing to the portraits right and left he continued Are not these two Zhang Liang Lord of Liu and Xiao He Lord of Cuo CertainlyThe Supreme Ancestor was greatly assisted by these two The Emperor glanced right and leftHis attendants were rather far away Then he whispered to Dong Cheng You like these two must stand by me My poor services are of no worth I do not compare with those men said the UncleI remember that you saved me at the western capital ChanganI have never forgotten and I could never reward you properly Then pointing to his own robe the Emperor continued You must wear this robe of mine girded with my own girdle and it will be as though you are always near your Emperor Dong Cheng bowed his gratitude while the Emperor taking off the robe presented it to his faithful ministerAt the same time he whispered Examine it closely when you get home and help your Emperor carry out his intention Dong Cheng understood He put on the robe and the girdle took leave and left the chamberThe news of the audience for Dong Cheng had been taken to the Prime Minister who at once went to the Palace and arrived as Dong Cheng was passing out at the Donghua Gate They met face to face and Dong Cheng could in nowise avoid himDong Cheng went to the side of the road and made his obeisanceWhere are you from State Uncle asked Cao CaoHis Majesty summoned me into the Palace and has given me this robe and beautiful girdle Why did he give you these He had not forgotten that I saved his life in the old days Take it off and let me see it Dong Cheng who knew that a secret decree was hidden away somewhere in the garments was afraid Cao Cao would notice a breach somewhere in the material so he hesitated and did not obeyBut Cao Cao called his guards and they took off the girdle Then Cao Cao looked it over carefully It certainly is a very handsome girdle said heNow take off the robe and let me look at that Dong Chengs heart was melting with fear but he dared not disobey So he handed over the robeCao Cao took it and held it up against the sun with his own hand and minutely examined every part of itWhen he had done this he put it on girded it with the girdle and turning to his attendants said How is it for length Beautiful they chorusedTurning to Dong Cheng he said Will you give these to me My Princes presents to me I dare not give to anotherLet me give you another robe in its stead said Dong ChengIs there not some intrigue connected with these presents I am sure there is said Cao Cao How could I dare said Dong Cheng tremblingIf you are so set upon it then I must give it up How could I take away what your Prince has given youIt was all a joke said the Prime MinisterCao Cao returned both robe and girdle and their owner made the best of his way homeWhen night came and he was alone in his library he took out the robe and looked over every inch of it most carefully He found nothingHe gave me a robe and a girdle and bade me look at them carefullyThat means there is something to be looked for but I can find no trace of it What does it mean he soliloquizedThen he lifted the girdle and examined that The jade plates were carved into the semblance of small dragons interlaced among flowers The lining was of purple silk All was sewn together most carefully and neatly and he could find nothing out of the common He was puzzled He laid the belt on the table Presently he picked it up and looked at it againHe spent long hours over it but in vainHe leaned over on the small table his head resting on his hands and was almost asleep when a candle snuff fell down upon the girdle and burned a hole in the liningHe hastily shook it off but the mischief was done a small hole had been burned in the silken lining and through this there appeared something white with blood red marksHe hastily ripped it open and drew out the decree written by the hand of the Emperor himself in characters of blood It readOf human relationships that between parents and children stands first of the various social ties that between prince and minister stands highestToday Cao Cao the wicked is a real tyrant treating even his Prince with indignityWith the support of his faction and his army he has destroyed the principles of governmentBy conferring rewards and inflicting punishments he has reduced the Emperor to a nonentityI have grieved over this day and night I have feared the empire would be ruinedYou are a high minister of state and my own relative You must recall the difficulties of the great Founders early days and draw together the loyal and rightminded to destroy this evil faction and restore the prerogatives of the Throne Such a deed would be indeed an extreme joy to the spirits of my ancestorsThis decree written in blood drawn from my own veins is confided to a noble who is to be most careful not to fail in executing his Emperors designGiven in the era of Rebuilt Tranquillity fourth year and the third month of spring  So ran the decree and Dong Cheng read it with streaming eyes There was no sleep for him that nightEarly in the morning he returned to his library and reread it No plan suggested itselfHe laid the decree down on the table and sought in the depths of his mind for some scheme to destroy Cao Cao but could not decide upon anyAnd he fell asleep leaning over his tableIt happened that Minister Wang Zifu with whom Dong Cheng was on terms of great intimacy came to visit him and as usual walked into the house unannounced and went straight to the libraryHis host did not wake and Wang Zifu noticed hardly hidden by his sleeve the Emperors writingWondering what this might be Wang Zifu drew it out read it and put it in his own sleeve Then he called out loud Uncle Dong Cheng are you not wellWhy are you asleep at this time of day Dong Cheng started up and at once missed the decree He was aghast he almost fell to the groundSo you want to make away with Cao Cao I shall have to tell him said Wang ZifuThen Brother that is the end of the Hans said his host with tearsI was joking said Wang ZifuMy forefathers also served the Hans and ate of their bounty Am I devoid of loyaltyI would help you Brother as far as lies in my power It is well for the country that you think like this said Dong ChengBut we ought to have a more private place than this to talk over such plans and pledge ourselves to sacrifice all in the cause of Han Dong Cheng began to feel very satisfiedHe produced a roll of white silk and wrote his own name at the top and signed it and Wang Zifu followed suitThen the visitor said General Wu Zilan is one of my best friends he ought to be allowed to come in Dong Cheng replied Of all the officials of the court Commander Chong Ji and Court Counselor Wu Shi are my best friends Certainly they would back me up So the discussion proceededPresently a servant announced no other than these very two men Dong Cheng just mentionedThis is providential said Dong Cheng and he told Wang Zifu to hide behind a screenThe two guests were led into the library and after the exchange of the ordinary civilities and a cup of tea Chong Ji referred to the incident at the hunt and the shooting of the stagWere you not angry at that said Chong JiDong Cheng answered Though we be angry what can we do Wu Shi struck in saying I would slay this fellow I swear but I cannot get any one to back me up One should perish for ones country one should not mind said Chong JiAt this moment Wang Zifu appeared from behind the screen saying You two want to kill Cao Cao I shall have to let him know thisAnd Uncle Dong Cheng is my witness A loyal minister does not mind deathIf we are killed we will be Han ghosts which is better than being sycophants of a traitor said Chong Ji angrilyDong Cheng said We were just saying we wanted to see you two on this matterWang Zifu is only joking Then he drew forth the decree and showed it to the two newcomers who also wept as they read itThey were asked to add their names to the silk rollWang Zifu said Wait here a few moments till I get Wu Zilan to come He left the room and very soon returned with his friend who also wrote his name in the presence of all the othersAfter this they went into one of the inner chambers to drink success to the new plotWhile there a new visitor Ma Teng Governor of Xiliang was announcedSay I am indisposed said the host and cannot receive visitors The doorkeeper took the message whereat Ma Teng angrily said Last night at the Donghua Gate I saw him come out in robe and girdle How can he pretend illness todayI am not come from mere idleness why does he refuse to see me The doorkeeper went in again and told his master what the visitor had said and that he was very angryThen Dong Cheng rose excused himself saying he would soon return and went to receive Ma TengAfter the visitor had saluted and they were both seated Ma Teng said I have just come from a farewell audience and wished to bid you adieuWhy did you want to put me off My poor body was taken suddenly ill that is why I was not waiting to welcome you said Dong ChengYou do not look as if you were ill your face wears the very bloom of health said Ma Teng bluntly His host could say no more and was silent The visitor shook out his sleeves and rose to departHe sighed deeply as he walked down the steps saying to himself Not one of them is any good there is no one to save the country This speech sank deeply into Dong Chengs heartHe stopped his guest saying Who is no good to save the country Whom do you mean That incident at the hunt the other day the shooting of the stag filled my breast with angerBut if you a near relative of the Emperor can pass your time in wine and idle dalliance without a thought of doing away with rebellion where can any one be found who will save the dynasty However Dong Cheng doubts were not set at restPretending great surprise he replied The Prime Minister is of high rank and has the confidence of the court why then do you utter such things So you find that wretch Cao Cao a good man eh Pray speak lower there are eyes and ears very near us The sort of people who covet life and fear death are not those to discuss any great undertaking So saying Ma Teng rose to go sway By this time his hosts doubts were set at rest he felt that Ma Teng was loyal and patrioticSo Dong Cheng said Do not be angry any moreI will show you something Whereupon he invited Ma Teng to go into the room where the others were seated and then showed him the decreeAs Ma Teng read it his hair stood on end he ground his teeth and bit his lips till the blood came When you move remember the whole force of my army is ready to help said Ma TengDong Cheng introduced him to the other conspirators and then the pledge was produced and Ma Teng was told to sign his nameHe did so at the same time smearing the blood as a sign of the oath and saying I swear to die rather than betray this pledge Pointing to the five he said We require ten for this business and we can accomplish our design We cannot get many true and loyal peopleOne of the wrong sort will spoil all said Dong ChengMa Teng told them to bring in the list of officialsHe read on till he came to the name Liu of the imperial clan when clapping his hands he cried Why not consult him Whom cried they altogetherMa Teng very slowly and deliberately spoke his nameTo a very trusty servant comes an Emperors decree And a scion of the ruling house can prove his loyaltyIf the readers turns to the next chapter they will see whom Ma Teng talked about CHAPTER In A Plum Garden Cao Cao Discusses Heroes Using The Hosts Forces Guan Yu Takes Xuzhou Who is it was the question on the lips of the conspiratorsMa Tengs reply was The Imperial Protector of Yuzhou Liu BeiHe is here and we will ask him to help Though he is an uncle of the Emperor he is at present a partisan of our enemy and he will not join said Dong Cheng But I saw something at the hunt said Ma Teng When Cao Cao advanced to acknowledge the congratulations due to the Emperor Liu Beis sworn brother Guan Yu was behind him and grasped his sword as if to cut down Cao Cao However Liu Bei signed to him to hold his hand and he didLiu Bei would willingly destroy Cao Cao only he thinks Cao Caos teeth and claws are too manyYou must ask Liu Bei and he will surely consent Here Wu Shi urged caution saying Do not go too fast Let us consider the thing most carefully They dispersedNext day after dark Dong Cheng went to Liu Beis lodging taking with him the decreeAs soon as Dong Cheng was announced Liu Bei came to greet him and led him into a private room where they could talk freely The two younger brothers were there as wellIt must be something unusually important that has brought Uncle Dong Cheng here tonight said Liu BeiIf I had ridden forth by daylight Cao Cao might have suspected something so I came by night Wine was brought in and while they were drinking Dong Cheng said Why did you check your brother the other day at the hunt when he was going to attack Cao Cao Liu Bei was startled and said How did you know Nobody noticed but I saw Liu Bei could not prevaricate and said It was the presumption of the man that made my brother so angry Guan Yu could not help it The visitor covered his face and weptAh said he if all the court ministers were like Guan Yu there would be no sighs for lack of tranquillity Now Liu Bei felt that possibly Cao Cao had sent his visitor to try him so he cautiously replied Where are the sighs for lack of tranquillity while Cao Cao is at the head of affairs Dong Cheng changed color and rose from his seatYou Sir are a relative of His Majesty and so I showed you my inmost feelingsWhy did you mislead me But Liu Bei said Because I feared you might be misleading me and I wanted to find out At this Dong Cheng drew out the decree he had received and showed it His host was deeply movedThen Dong Cheng produced the pledgeThere were only six names to it and these were Dong Cheng Wang Zifu Chong Ji Wu Shi Wu Zilan and Ma TengSince you have a decree like this I cannot but do my share said Liu Bei and at Dong Chengs request he added his name and signature to the others and handed it backNow let us but get three more which will make ten and we shall be ready to act But you must move with great caution and not let this get abroad said Liu BeiThe two remained talking till an early hour in the morning when the visitor leftNow in order to put Cao Cao quite off the scent that any plot against him was in progress Liu Bei began to devote himself to gardening planting vegetables and watering them with his own hands Guan Yu and Zhang Fei ventured to remonstrate with him for taking to such an occupation when great matters needed attentionThe reason for this you may not know replied heAnd they said no more One day when the two brothers were absent and Liu Bei was busy in his garden two generals of Cao Cao Xu Chu and Zhang Liao with an escort came from Cao Cao saying The command of the Prime Minister is that you come at once What important affair is afoot asked Liu Bei nervously We know nothing we were ordered to come and request your presence All he could do was to followWhen he arrived Cao Cao met him and laughingly said That is a big business you have in hand at home This remark made Liu Bei turn the color of clayCao Cao took him by the hand and led him straight to the private garden saying The growth of vegetables that you are trying to learn is very difficult Liu Bei breathed againHe said That is hardly a business it is only a solace Cao Cao said I happened to notice the green plums on the trees today and suddenly my thoughts went back to a year ago when we were thrashing Zhang Xiu We were marching through a parched county and every one was suffering from thirstSuddenly I lifted my whip and pointing at something in the distance I said Look at those fruitful plum trees in the forest ahead The soldiers heard it and it made their mouths waterSeeing the plums kindles my appreciation I owe something to the plums and we will repay it todayI ordered the servants to heat some wine very hot and sent to invite you to share it Liu Bei was quite composed by this time and no longer suspected any sinister designHe went with his host to a small spring pavilion in a plum garden where the wine cups were already laid out and green plums filled the dishesThey sat down to a confidential talk and free enjoyment of their wineAs they drank the weather gradually changed clouds gathering and threatening rainThe servants pointed out a mass of cloud that looked like a dragon hung in the sky Both host and guest leaned over the balcony looking at itDo you understand the evolution of dragons asked Cao Cao of the guestNot in detail A dragon can assume any size can rise in glory or hide from sightBulky it generates clouds and evolves mist attenuated it can scarcely hide a mustard stalk or conceal a shadowMounting it can soar to the empyrean subsiding it lurks in the uttermost depths of the oceanThis is the midspring season and the dragon chooses this moment for its transformations like a person realizing own desires and overrunning the worldThe dragon among animals compares with the hero among humans You General have traveled all lakes and rivers you must know who are the heroes of the present day and I wish you would say who they are I am just a common dullard how can I know such things Do not be so modest Thanks to your kindly protection I have a post at courtBut as to heroes I really do not know who they are You may not have looked upon their faces but you have heard their names Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai with his strong army and abundant resources is he one His host laughed A rotting skeleton in a graveyard I shall put him out of the way shortly Well Yuan Shao thenThe highest offices of state have been held in his family for four generations and his clients are many in the empireHe is firmly posted in Jizhou and he commands the services of many able people Surely he is one A bully but a coward he is fond of grandiose schemes but is devoid of decision he makes for great things but grudges the necessary sacrificeHe loses sight of everything else in view of a little present advantageHe is not one There is Liu Biao of Jingzhou He is renowned as a man of perfection whose fame has spread on all sidesSurely he is a hero He is a mere semblance a man of vain reputation No not he Sun Ce is a sturdy sort the chief of all in the South LandIs he a hero He has profited by the reputation of his father Sun Jian he is not a real hero What of Liu Zhang of Yiazhou Though he is of the reigning family he is nothing more than a watch dogHow could you make a hero of him What about Zhang Xiu Zhang Lu Han Sui and all those leaders Cao Cao clapped his hands and laughed very loudly saying Paltry people like them are not worth mentioning With these exceptions I really know none Now heroes are the ones who cherish lofty designs in their bosoms and have plans to achieve them they have allembracing schemes and the whole world is at their mercy Who is such a person said Liu BeiCao Cao pointed his finger first at his guest and then at himself saying The only heroes in the world are you and I Liu Bei gasped and the spoon and chopsticks rattled to the floorNow just at that moment the storm burst with a tremendous peal of thunder and rush of rain Liu Bei stooped down to recover the fallen articles saying What a shock And it was quite close WhatAre you afraid of thunder said Cao CaoLiu Bei replied The Sage One paled at a sudden peal of thunder or fierce gust of windWhy should one not fear Thus he glossed over the real fact that it was the words he had heard that had so startled himConstrained to lodge in a tigers lair He played a waiting part But when Cao Cao talked of breaking humans Then terror gripped his heartBut he cleverly used the thunder peal As excuse for turning pale O quick to seize occasions thus He surely must prevailThe shower had passed and there appeared two men rushing through the garden both armedIn spite of the attendants they forced their way to the pavilion where sat the two friends They were Guan Yu and Zhang FeiThe two brothers had been outside the city at archery practice when Cao Caos invitation had come so peremptorily On their return they heard that two officers had arrived and led away Liu Bei to the Prime MinisterThey hastened to his palace and were told their brother was with his host in the grounds and they feared something had happened So they rushed inNow when they saw their brother quietly talking with Cao Cao and enjoying a cup of wine they took up their usual places and meekly stood waitingWhy did you come said Cao CaoWe heard that you Sir had invited our brother to a wine party and we came to amuse you with a little sword play said theyThis is not a Hongmen Banquet replied Cao Cao What use have we for Xiang Chang and Xiang Ba of old Liu Bei smiledThe host ordered wine to be served to the two Fan Kuais to allay their anxiety and soon after the three took their leave and returned homeward We were nearly frightened to death said Guan YuThe story of the dropped chopsticks was toldThe two asked what their brother intended by his actions My learning gardening was to convince Cao Cao of my perfect simplicity and the absence of any ambitionBut when he suddenly pointed to me as one of the heroes I was startled for I thought he had some suspicionsHappily the thunder at that moment supplied the excuse I wanted Really you are very clever said theyNext day Cao Cao again invited Liu Bei and while the two were drinking Man Chong who had been dispatched to find out what Yuan Shao was doing came to present his reportHe said Gongsun Zan has been completely defeated by Yuan Shao Do you know the detailsI should like to know how interrupted Liu BeiThey were at war and Gongsun Zan got the worst of it so he acted on the defensive building a high wall about his army and on that erecting a high tower which he called the Yijing Tower Therein he placed all his grain one hundred thousand carts total and took up his own quartersHis fighting troops passed in and out without ceasing some going out to give battle others returning to rest One of them was surrounded and sent to ask Gongsun Zan to rescue himGongsun Zan said If I rescue him hereafter every one will want to be helped and will not exert himself So Gongsun Zan did not goThis disgusted his soldiers and many deserted to the enemy so that his army diminishedHe sent letters to the capital to crave help but the messenger was capturedHe sent to Zhang Yan to arrange with him for a twopronged joint attack and those letters with the plans also fell into Yuan Shaos hands and the plans were adopted by Yuan Shao who gave the signals agreed uponThus Gongsun Zan fell into an ambush lost heavily and retreated into the cityThere he was besieged and a subterranean passage was pierced into the tower where he lodged The tower was set on fire and Gongsun Zan could not escape So he slew his wife and little ones and hanged himselfThe flames destroyed the bodies of the whole familyYuan Shao has added the remnants of the vanquished army to his own and so become yet strongerHis brother Yuan Shu in the South of River Huai however has become so arrogant and cruel that the people have turned against himThen Yuan Shu had sent to say he would yield the title of Emperor which he had assumed in favor of Yuan ShaoYuan Shao demanded the Imperial Hereditary Seal also and Yuan Shu promised to bring it in person Now Yuan Shu has abandoned River Huai and is about to move to the North of Yellow RiverIf he succeeded the two brothers will control adjoining regions and be dangerous It was a sad story and Liu Bei remembered with sorrow that in the days of success and prosperity the dead chieftain Gongsun Zan had pushed his interest and shown him much kindnessMoreover he was anxious to know the fate of Zhao YunIn his heart he thought What better chance am I likely to get of setting myself free So Liu Bei rose and said to Cao Cao If Yuan Shu goes over to join his brother he will surely pass through Xuzhou I beg you to give me an army with which to smite him on the wayThat will finish Yuan Shu Memorialize the Emperor tomorrow and I will give you an army said Cao CaoSo next day Liu Bei went to an audience and Cao Cao gave him command of fifty thousand horse and foot and sent Generals Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao with himAt parting with Liu Bei the Emperor shed tearsAs soon as Liu Bei reached his lodging he set about preparations for immediate departure taking his seal as General and preparing his weaponsDong Cheng went three miles away from the city to bid him farewellYou must not mind my going this journey will assuredly help on the scheme said Liu BeiKeep your mind fixed on that said Dong Cheng and never forget what His Majesty requires of us They partedPresently his brothers asked him why he was in such a hurry to get away Liu Bei replied I have been a bird in a cage a fish in a netThis is like the fish regaining the open sea and the bird soaring into the blue skyI suffered much from the confinement Then he ordered Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao to march the troops faster Now Guo Jia and Cheng Yu had been absent inspecting stores and supplies when Liu Bei left As soon as they heard of his expedition they went in to see their master asking him why he had let Liu Bei go in command of an armyHe is going to cut off Yuan Shu replied Cao CaoFormerly when he was Imperial Protector of Yuzhou we recommended that he should be put to death but you would not hear of itNow you have given him an army You have allowed the dragon to reach the sea the tiger to return to the mountainsWhat control will you have in future So spoke Cheng Yu and Guo Jia followed in the same strain saying Even if you would not put him to death you need not have let him goAs the proverb says Relax opposition for one day and agelong harm ensues You must admit the truth of this Cao Cao recognized that these were prudent counsels so he sent Xu Chu with five hundred horsemen and imperative orders to bring Liu Bei back againLiu Bei was marching as rapidly as possible when he noticed a cloud of dust in the rear and remarked to his brothers Surely they are pursuing us He halted and made a stockade and ordered his brothers to be in readiness one on each flankPresently the messenger arrived and found himself in the midst of an army ready for battle Xu Chu dismounted and entered the camp to speak with Liu BeiSir on what business have you come asked Liu BeiThe Prime Minister has sent me to request you to return as he has further matters to discuss with you When a general has once taken the field even the royal command is of no effectI bade farewell to the Emperor I received the Prime Ministers commands and there can be nothing further to talk aboutYou may return forthwith and take that as my reply Xu Chu was undecided what action to takeHe thought The Prime Minister cherishes a friendship with Liu Bei and I have no orders to killI can only return with this reply and ask further instructions So Xu Chu leftWhen he related what had occurred Cao Cao still hesitated to take any actionThis refusal to return means enmity said Cheng Yu and Guo JiaStill two of my people are with him said Cao CaoHe will not dare do anything unfriendly I think Beside I sent him and I cannot go back on my own orders So Liu Bei was not pursuedHe took his arms he fed his steed And fared forth willingly Intent to accomplish his Kings behest Deep graven on his memoryAt least he had broken out of his cage He heard not the tigers roar He had shaken the shackles from his feet As a dragon on high could soarAs soon as Ma Teng heard that Liu Bei had set forth he reported that pressing business called him and marched back to his own region XiliangWhen Liu Bei reached Xuzhou the Imperial Protector Deputy Che Zhou came to meet himWhen the official banquet was over Sun Qian and Mi Zhu paid their visit to Che Zhou Then Liu Bei proceeded to his residence to greet his familyScouts were sent out to see what Yuan Shu was doing They came back with the intelligenceYuan Shus arrogance had driven away his generals Lei Bo and Chen Lan who had returned to their mountain fastness in Mount SongHis forces thus reduced he wrote resigning the imperial style he had assumed in favor of his brother Yuan Shao who at once commanded his presenceThereupon he packed up the palace fittings he had made got the remnants of his army in order and marched west When Yuan Shu neared Xuzhou Liu Bei led out his force of fifty thousand soldiers and four generalsGuan Yu Zhang Fei Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao Yuan Shu sent out Ji Ling to force a way throughBut Zhang Fei opposed him and attacked without a parley In the tenth bout Zhang Fei cut down Ji LingThe defeated troops fled in all directionsThen Yuan Shu came up with his own armyLiu Bei placed Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao in command of the left wing Guan Yu and Zhang Fei the right wing and himself in the center and so met Yuan Shu As soon as the enemy came near Liu Bei began to abuse him crying O rebellious one and wicked I have a command to destroy youYield then with good grace and so escape your punishment Base weaver of mats and mean maker of straw sandalsHow dare you make light of me replied Yuan Shu and he gave the signal for an attack Liu Bei retired and his generals from the flanks closed inThey smote the army of Yuan Shu till corpses littered the plain and blood flowed in streams At the same time Yuan Shus former generals Lei Bo and Chen Lan from Mount Song attacked the baggage train and completed the destructionYuan Shu tried to retreat to Shouchun but Lei Bo and Chen Lan barred the roadYuan Shu sought refuge in Jiangling with one thousand troops left of all his army And these were the weakly ones able neither to fight nor fleeIt was then the height of summer and their food was nearly exhausted The whole provision consisted of thirty carts of wheatThis was made over to the soldiers and the members of his household went hungry Many died of actual starvationYuan Shu could not swallow the coarse food that the soldiers lived on One day he bade his cook bring him some honeyed water to quench his thirstThere is no water save that tainted with blood replied the cook Where can I get honeyed water This was the last strawYuan Shu sat up on his couch and rolled out on the floor with a loud cry Blood gushed from his mouth and thus he diedIt was the sixth month of the fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity The last days of Han approached and weapons clashed in every quarter The misguided Yuan Shu lost to all sense of honor Forgetful of his forefathers who had filled the states highest offices Madly aspired to become himself Emperor Resting his outrageous claim on the possession of the Seal And arrogantly boasting that thus he fulfilled the design of HeavenSick unto death he vainly begged for a little honeyed water He died aloneYuan Shu being dead his nephew Yuan Yin taking his coffin and his wife and children sought shelter in Lujiang There the Magistrate Xu Liu slew all the survivorsAmong the possessions Xu Liu found the Imperial Hereditary Seal which he at once took to the capital and presented to Cao Cao for which service he was made Governor of GaolingSince then the Imperial Hereditary Seal belonged to Cao CaoWhen Liu Bei heard that Yuan Shu was dead he prepared a report to the Throne and sent it to Cao Cao He sent the two generals deputed by Cao Cao Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao back to the capital keeping the army to defend XuzhouHe also personally went through the countryside commanding the people to resume their ordinary avocationsCao Cao was angry when his two officers returned without their man and was going to put them to death Xun Yu reasoned with himThe power was in Liu Beis hands and so these two had no alternative said Xun YuSo they were pardonedYou should instruct Che Zhou the Imperial Protector Deputy to try to destroy him said Xun YuAccordingly he sent secret orders to Che Zhou who took Chen Deng into his confidence and asked his adviceChen Deng said That is easyLiu Bei is outside the city and an ambush in the city gate to attack him on his return from the country will be final I will attack the escort with arrows from the city walls Che Zhou agreed to try thisThen Chen Deng went to his father to tell him Chen Gui bade him go and warn the intended victimChen Deng at once rode away to do soBefore long he met Guan Yu and Zhang Fei to whom he told his story Now Liu Bei was following some distance behindAs soon as Zhang Fei heard of the plot he wanted to attack the ambush but Guan Yu proposed another planSaid he Attacking the ambush will be a failure since we are without the walls And I think we can compass the death of Che ZhouIn the night we will pretend to be some of Cao Caos soldiers and entice him out to meet us We will slay him Zhang Fei approved of the planNow the soldiers still had some of Cao Caos army banners and wore similar armorAbout the third watch they came to the city wall and hailed the gateThose on guard asked who they were The men replied that they were Zhang Liaos troops sent from the capitalThis was told Che Zhou who sent hastily for Chen Deng to ask his advice If I do not receive them they will suspect my loyalty said Che ZhouYet if I go out I may be victim of a ruse So he went up on the wall and said It is too dark to distinguish friends from foesYou must wait till daylight If Liu Bei know our presence he will attack shouted back the soldiers And they begged him to let them in Still Che Zhou hesitatedThey shouted louder than ever to open the gatePresently Che Zhou girded on his armor placed himself at the head of one thousand cavalry and went outHe galloped over the bridge shouting Where is Zhang Liao Then lights blazed around and he recognized Guan Yu with his sword drawn Wretch cried Guan Yu You would plot to slay my brother would you Che Zhou was too frightened to make good defense and he turned to reenter the gateBut as he reached the drawbridge Chen Deng shot out flights of arrows wherefore Che Zhou turned aside and galloped along under the wall But Guan Yu came quickly in pursuitHis sword was raised aloft and as it came down Che Zhou fell to the earthGuan Yu cut off his head and returned shouting I have slain the traitor You others need not fear if you only surrender They threw aside their spears and gave in As soon as the excitement had calmed Guan Yu took the head to show Liu Bei and told him the story of the plot But what will Cao Cao think of this said Liu BeiAnd he may come If he does we can meet him said Guan Yu But Liu Bei was grieved beyond measureWhen he entered the city the elders of the people knelt in the road to welcome himWhen he reached his residence he found that Zhang Fei had already exterminated the family of Che ZhouLiu Bei said We have slain one of Cao Caos best officers and how will he stand that Never mind cried Chen DengI have a plan Just from grave danger extricated A looming war must be placatedThe plan proposed by Chen Deng will be disclosed next CHAPTER Yuan Shao And Cao Cao Both Take The Field Guan Yu And Zhang Fei Captures Two Generals This was the plan proposed to Liu Bei Yuan Shao is Cao Caos terrorHe is strongly posted in an extensive territory of four regionsJizhou Qingzhou Youzhou and Bingzhouwith one million fighting soldiers and numerous able officersWrite letters and pray him rescue you Liu Bei replied But we have never had any dealings with each other and he is unlikely to do such a thing for one who has just destroyed his brother There is some one here whose family have been on intimate terms with the Yuans for a hundred yearsYuan Shao would surely come if he wrote And who is this A man you know well and respect greatly can you not guess You surely mean Zheng Xuan said Liu Bei suddenlyThat is he said Chen Deng smilingNow Zheng Xuan was a student and a man of great talent who had long studied under the famed teacher Ma Rong whose knowledge of the Book of Odes was universally recognizedWhenever Ma Rong lectured he let fall a curtain behind which were a circle of singing girls The students were assembled in front of this curtainZheng Xuan attended these lectures for three years and never once let his eyes wander to the curtain Naturally the master admired his pupilAfter Zheng Xuan had finished his studies and gone home Ma Rong praised him to the others saying Only one man has penetrated the inner meaning of my instructions and that one is Zheng Xuan In Zheng Xuans household the waiting maids were familiar with the Book of OdesOnce one of the maids opposed Zheng Xuans wishes so as punishment she was made to kneel in front of the steps Another girl made fun of her quoting from an odeWhat are you doing there in the mire The kneeling girl capped the verse from another ode quoted sheThat was but a simple word I said Yet brought it wrath upon my head Such was the family in which Zheng Xuan had been bornIn the reign of the Emperor Huan he rose to the rank of Chair of the SecretariatBut when the Ten Eunuchs began to control the government he gave up office and retired into the country to XuzhouLiu Bei had known him before had consulted him on many occasions and greatly respected himLiu Bei was glad that he had remembered this man and without loss of time in company with Chen Deng he went to Zheng Xuans house to ask him to draft this letter which Zheng Xuan generously consented to doSun Qian was entrusted with the task of delivery and set out at once Yuan Shao read it and considered the matter long before speakingLiu Bei destroyed my brother and I ought not to help him but out of consideration for the writer of this letter I must Thereupon Yuan Shao assembled his officers to consider an attack upon Cao CaoAdviser Tian Feng said Do not raise an army The people are worn out and the granaries are empty with these constant wars Let us rather report the recent victory of Gongsun Zan to the ThroneIf that does not reach the Emperor then memorialize that Cao Cao is hindering the government Then raise an armyoccupy Liyang assemble a Yellow River fleet in Henan prepare weapons send out your various divisions and within three years you will win all round Adviser Shen Pei replied I do not agreeThe military genius of our illustrious lord having overcome the hordes of the north to dispose of Cao Cao is as simple as turning ones hand it is not a matter of months Adviser Ju Shou said Victory is not always to the manyCao Caos discipline is excellent his soldiers are brave and well drilled He will not sit down quietly waiting to be surrounded as Gongsun Zan didNow you abandon the intention to inform the Throne of our success which I find a good plan but you intend to send out an army without any valid excuseOur lord should not do that Then followed adviser Guo Tu saying You are wrongNo expedition against Cao Cao can lack excuseBut if our master would take the chance now offering itself of coming into his own he will accede to the request in the letter of Zheng Xuan and ally himself with Liu Bei for the destruction of Cao CaoThis would win the approval of Heaven and the affections of the people a double blessing Thus the four advisers differed and wrangled and Yuan Shao could not decide which to followThen there came two others Xu You and Xun Shen and seeing them Yuan Shao said You two have wide experience how would you decide The two made their obeisance and Yuan Shao said A letter from Zheng Xuan the Chair has arrived counseling me to support Liu Bei in an attack on Cao CaoNow am I to send an army or not send an army They both cried with one voice SendYour armies are numerous enough and strong enough you will destroy a traitor and help the dynasty Your words just express my desire said Yuan Shao and thenceforward the discussion turned on the expeditionFirst Liu Beis legate Sun Qian was sent back with Yuan Shaos consent and instructions for Liu Bei to make ready to cooperateSecond Yuan Shao assigned Shen Pei and Peng Ji as Commanding Generals Tian Feng Xun Shen and Xu You as Military Advisers Yan Liang and Wen Chou as Generals The army was to be composed of three hundred thousand horse and foot in equal numbers They were to march on LiyangWhen the arrangements were complete Guo Tu went to his chief saying In order to manifest the righteousness of your attack on Cao Cao it would be well to issue a manifesto with a summary of his various crimes Yuan Shao approved of this and Chen Lin well known as a scholar was entrusted to compose such a documentChen Lin had been the Court Secretary in the reign of the late Emperor LingWhen Dong Zhuo unseated Regent Marshal He Jin Chen Lin sought safety in Jizhou This is the manifestoA perspicacious ruler wisely provides against political vicissitudes a loyal minister carefully foresees the difficulties in the assertion of authorityWherefore a person of unusual parts precedes an extraordinary situation and of such a person the achievements will be extraordinaryFor indeed the ordinary person is quite unequal to an extraordinary situationIn former days after having gained ascendancy over a weakling emperor of the powerful Qin Dynasty Prime Minister Zhao Gao wielded the whole authority of the Throne overruling the governmentAll dignity and fortune came through him and his contemporaries were restrained so that none dared to speak openlySlowly but surely evolved the tragedy of the Wangyi Palace when the Emperor was slain and the Imperial Tablets perished in the flames Zhao Gao the author of these crimes has ever since been held up to obloquy as the arch example of an evil doer In the later days of Empress Lu of the Hans after the death of the Supreme Ancestor the world saw Lu Chan and Lu Lu brothers of the Empress and fellows in wickedness monopolizing the powers of governmentWithin the capital they commanded two armies and without they ruled the feudal states of Liang and ZhaoThey arbitrarily controlled all state affairs and decided all questions in the council chamber and the courtThis dominance of the base and declension of the noble continued till the hearts of the people grew cold within themThereupon Zhou Bo Lord of Jiang and Liu Zhang Lord of Zhuxu asserted their dignity and let loose their wrath They destroyed the contumacious ministers and restored their ruler to his royal state Thus they enabled the kingly way to be reestablished and the glory to be manifested Here are two instances where ministers asserted their authorityThis Cao Cao now Minister of Works forsooth had for ancestor a certain eunuch named Cao Teng fitting companion of Xu Huang and Zuo Guan All three were prodigies of wickedness and insatiably avaricious and let loose on the world they hindered ethical progress and preyed upon the populaceThis Cao Teng begged for and adopted Cao Caos father who by wholesale bribery wagons of gold and cartloads of jewels presented at the gates of the influential contrived to sneak his way into considerable office where he could subvert authorityThus Cao Cao is the depraved bantling of a monstrous excrescence devoid of all virtue in himself ferocious and cunning delighting in disorder and reveling in public calamityNow I Yuan Shao a man of war have mustered my armies and displayed my might that I may sweep away and destroy the evil opponents of governmentI have already had to deal with Dong Zhuo the ruffian who invaded the official circle and wrested the governmentAt that time I grasped my sword and beat the drums to restore order in the east I assembled warriors selected the best and took them into my serviceIn this matter I came into relations with this Cao Cao and conferred with him to further my scheme I gave him command of a subordinate force and looked to him to render such petty service as he was equal toI suffered his stupidities and condoned his shortcomings his rash attacks and facile retreats his losses and shameful defeats his repeated destruction of whole armies Again and again I sent him more troops and filled the gaps in his depleted ranks I even addressed a memorial to the Throne for him to be appointed Imperial Protector of Yanzhou I made him feel as he were a tiger I added to his honors and increased his authority hoping that eventually he would justify himself by a victory against Dong Zhuo such as Qin used Meng Ming against JinBut Cao Cao availed himself of the opportunity to overstep all bounds to give free rein to violence and evil He stripped the common people outraged the good and injured the virtuousBian Rang Governor of Jiujiang was a man of conspicuous talent and of worldwide reputationHe was honest in speech and correct in demeanor He spoke without flatteryCao Cao put him to death and his head was exposed and his family utterly destroyedFrom that day to this scholars have deeply mourned and popular resentment has steadily grownOne person raised his arm in anger and the whole countryside followed himWhereupon Cao Cao was smitten at Xuzhou and his territory was snatched by Lu BuHe fled eastward without shelter or refugeMy policy is a strong trunk and weak branches a commanding central government and obedient feudal lords Also I am no partisan Therefore I again raised my banners donned my armor and moved forward to attack My drums rolled for an assault on Lu Bu and his multitudes incontinently fledI saved Cao Cao from destruction and restored him to a position of authorityWherein I must confess to showing no kindness to the people of Yanzhou although it was a great matter for Cao Cao Later it happened that the imperial cortege moved west and a horde of rebels of Dong Zhuos faction rose and attacked The course of government was hindered At that moment my territory was threatened from the north and I could not leave itWherefore I sent one of my officers Xu Xun to Cao Cao to see to the repair of the dynastic temples and the protection of the youthful sovereign Thereupon Cao Cao gave the rein to his inclinationsHe arbitrarily ordered the removal of the courtHe brought shame upon the Ruling House and subverted the lawsHe engrossed the chairmanship of the three highest offices and monopolized the control of the administrationOffices and rewards were conferred according to his will punishment was at his wordHe glorified whole families of those he loved he exterminated whole clans of those he hatedOpen critics were executed secret opponents were assassinatedOfficials locked their lips wayfarers only exchanged glancesChairs of boards recorded levies and every government official held a sinecureThe late Yang Biao a man who had filled two of the highest offices of state as Chairs of two boards because of some petty grudge was though guiltless charged with a crime He was beaten and suffered every form of crueltyThis arbitrary and impulsive act was a flagrant disregard of constitutional rulesAnother victim was the Counselor Zhao Yan He was faithful in remonstrance honest in speech endowed with the highest principles of rectitude He was listened to at court His words carried enough weight with the Emperor to cause him to modify his intention and confer reward for outspokennessDesirous of diverting all power into his own hands and stifle all criticism Cao Cao presumed to arrest and put to death this censor in defiance of all legal proceduresAnother evil deed was the destruction of the tomb of Prince Xiao of Liang the brother of the late EmperorHis tomb should certainly have been respected even its mulberries and sweetgum trees its cypresses and its pinesCao Cao led soldiers to the cemetery and stood by while it was desecrated the coffin destroyed and the poor corpse exposed They stole the gold and jewels of the deadThis deed brought tears to the eyes of the Emperor and rent the hearts of all peopleCao Cao also appointed new officesCommander Who Opens Grave Mounds and General Who Seeks for Goldwhose tracks were marked by desecrated graves and exhumed bodiesIndeed while assuming the position of the highest officer of state he indulged the inclination of a bandit polluting the empire oppressing the people a bane to gods and humansHe added to this by setting up minute and vexatious prohibitions so that there were nets and snares spread in every pathway traps and pitfalls laid in every roadA hand raised was caught in a net a foot advanced was taken in an entanglement Wherefore the people of his regions Yanzhou and Yuzhou waxed desperate and the inhabitants of the metropolis groaned and murmured in angerRead down the names through all the years Of ministers that all humans curse For greed and cruelty and lust Than Cao Cao you will not find a worseI have investigated the cases of evil deeds in the regions but I have been unable to reform himI have given him repeated opportunities hoping that he would repentBut he has the heart of a wolf the nature of a wild beast He nourishes evil in his bosom and desires to pull down the pillars of the state to weaken the House of Han to destroy the loyal and true and to stand himself conspicuous as the chiefest of criminalsFormerly when I attacked the north Gongsun Zan that obstinate bandit and perverse brave resisted my might for a yearBefore Gongsun Zan could be destroyed this Cao Cao wrote to him that under the pretense of assisting my loyal armies he would covertly lead them to destruction The plot was discovered through his messengers and Gongsun Zan also perishedThis blunted Cao Caos ardor and his plans failedNow he is camped at the Ao Granaries with the Yellow River to strengthen his position Like the mantis in the story who threatened the chariot with its forelegs he thinks himself terribleBut with the dignity and prestige of Han to support me I confront the whole worldI have spearmen by millions horsemen by hundreds of thousands fierce and vigorous warriors strong as Chong Huang and Wu Huo those heroes of antiquityI have enlisted expert archers and strong bowmenIn Bingzhou my armies have crossed the Taihang Range and in Qingzhou they have forded River Ji and River TaThey have coasted down the Yellow River to attack his van and from Jingzhou the armies of Liu Biao have descended to Wancheng and Wangye to smite his rearguard Thunderlike in the weight of their march tigerlike in the alertness of their advance they are as flames let loose among light grass as the blue ocean poured on glowing embers Is there any hope that he escape destructionOf the hordes of Cao Cao those who can fight are from the north or from other camps and they all desire to return home They weep whenever they look to the northThe others belong to Yanzhou or Yuzhou being remnants of the armies of Lu Bu and Zhang Yang Beaten stern necessity forced them to accept service but they take it only as a temporary expedientThey who have been wounded hate each otherIf I give the signal to return and send my drums to the mountain tops and wave the white flag to show them they may surrender they will melt away like dew before the sun and no blood will be shed The victory will be mineNow the Hans are failing and the bonds of empire are relaxedThe sacred dynasty has no supporter the ministers are not strong enough to cope with the difficultiesWithin the capital the responsible ministers are crestfallen and helpless There is no one to rely uponSuch loyal and high principled people as are left are browbeaten by a tyrannical minister How can they manifest their virtueCao Cao has surrounded the Palace with seven hundred veterans the ostensible object being to guard the Emperor but the covert design being to hold him prisonerI fear this is but the first step in usurpation and so I take my partNow is the time for loyal ministers to sacrifice their lives the opportunity for officers to perform meritorious deedsCan I fail to urge you Cao Cao has forged commands to himself to undertake the control of government affairs and in the name of the state sends out calls for military assistanceI fear lest distant regions may obey his behest and send troops to help him to the detriment of the multitude and their everlasting shame No wise person will do soThe forces of four regionsBingzhou Jizhou Qingzhou and Youzhou are moving out simultaneouslyWhen this call reaches Jingzhou you will see their forces cooperate with those of Liu BiaoAll regions and counties ought to organize volunteers and set them along their borders to demonstrate their force and prove their loyal support of the dynastyWill not this be rendering extraordinary service The rank of lordship with feudal rights over five thousand households and a money reward of five millions will be the reward of the one who brings the head of Cao CaoNo questions will be asked of those who surrenderI publish abroad this notice of my bounty and the rewards offered that you may realize that the dynasty is in real danger Yuan Shao read this effusion with great joyHe at once ordered copies to be posted everywhere in towns and cities at gates tax stations ferries and passesCopies found their way to the capital and one got into Cao Caos palace That day he happened to be in bed with a bad headacheThe servants took the paper to the sick mans room He read it and was frightened from the tips of his hair to the marrow of his very bones He broke out into a cold perspiration and his headache vanished He bounded out of bed and said to Cao Hong Who wrote this They say it is Chen Lins brush replied heCao Cao laughed They have the literary gift they would rather have the military too to back it upThis fellow may be a very elegant writer but what if Yuan Shaos fighting capacity falls short Cao Cao called his advisers together to consider the next moveKong Rong heard of the summons and went to Cao Cao saying You should not fight with Yuan Shao he is too strongMake peace Xun Yu said He is despicable do not make peace Kong Rong replied His land is wide and his people strongHe has many skillful strategists like Guo Tu Xu You Peng Ji and Shen Pei loyal leaders like Tian Feng and Ju Shou and formidable generals like Yan Liang and Wen Chou able commanders like Gao Lan Zhang He Han Meng and Chunyu QiongYou cannot say he is despicable Xun Yu laughed saying His army is a rabbleOne general Tian Feng is bold but treacherous another Xu You is greedy and ignorant Shen Pei is devoted but stupid Peng Ji is steady but useless And these four of such different temperaments mutually incompatible will make for confusion rather than efficiency The brave Yan Liang and Wen Chou are worthless and can be disposed of in the first battle and the others such as Gao Lan Zhang He Han Meng and Chunyu Qiong are poor rough stuffWhat is the use even of their hundred thousands Kong Rong was silent and Cao Cao smiled They are even as Xun Yu describes said Cao CaoThen Cao Cao issued orders Generals Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were to lead an army of fifty thousand troops displaying the Prime Ministers banners and march against Xuzhou to attack Liu BeiThis Liu Dai had been Imperial Protector of Yanzhou but had surrendered to Cao Cao and entered Cao Caos service after the fall of the region Cao Cao had given him a rank as Supernumerary Leader and now was disposed to make use of himCao Cao himself took command of a large army of two hundred thousand troops for a simultaneous attack on Yuan Shao at LiyangAdviser Cheng Yu said The two Liu Dai and Wang Zhong sent against Liu Bei are unequal to their task I know said Cao CaoThey are not meant to fight Liu Bei it is merely a feintThey have orders not to make any real attack till I have overcome Yuan ShaoThen Liu Bei will be next Liu Dai and Wang Zhong went their way and Cao Cao marched out his grand army which came into touch with the enemy then thirty miles distant at Liyang Both sides made fortified camps and waited watching each otherThis went on for two months of the autumnThere was dissension in Yuan Shaos camp Xu You was at enmity with his colleague Shen Pei who was in commanding position and the strategist Ju Shou resented the rejection of his plan So they would not attack Yuan Shao also could not make up his mind Tired of this state of inaction Cao Cao then gave orders to his commandersZang Ba was to continue the pressure on Qingzhou and Xuzhou Yu Jin and Li Dian to deploy troops along the Yellow River Cao Ren to quarter the main force at GuanduThen Cao Cao with an army marched back to Capital XuchangThe five legions sent against Liu Bei went into camp thirtyfive miles from Xuzhou The camp made an imposing display of the banners of the Prime Minister but no attacks followed Their spies were very busy north of the river to get news of Cao Caos movement On the defensive side Liu Bei as he was uncertain of the strength of the force against him dared not moveSuddenly orders came for the Cao Caos army to attack and then discord showed itselfLiu Dai said The Prime Minister orders an attack you advance Wang Zhong replied You were named first I am the CommanderinChief it is not my place to go first I will go with you in joint command said Wang ZhongLet us cast lots and he upon whom the lot falls must go said Liu DaiThey drew lots and it fell to Wang Zhong who advanced toward Xuzhou with half the forceWhen Liu Bei heard of the threatened attack he called Chen Deng to consult Liu Bei said There is dissension in Yuan Shaos camp at Liyang so they do not advanceWe do not know where Cao Cao is but his own banner is not displayed in his Liyangs camp Why then is it shown here Chen Deng replied His tricks take a hundred forms It must be that he regards the north as more important and has gone there to look after its defenseHe dares not show his flag there and I feel sure it is only meant to mislead usHe is not here Liu Bei then asked whether one of his brothers would find out the truth and Zhang Fei volunteered to go I fear you are unsuited for this said Liu BeiYou are too impetuous If Cao Cao is there I will haul him over here said Zhang FeiLet me go first and find out said Guan YuIf you go I shall feel more at ease said Liu BeiSo Guan Yu set out with three thousand soldiers to reconnoiterIt was then early winter and snow was falling from a gloomy sky They marched regardless of the snow and came near Wang Zhongs camp with arms all ready to attackGuan Yu summoned Wang Zhong to a parleyThe Prime Minister is here why do you not surrender said Wang ZhongBeg him to come to the front for I would speak with him replied Guan YuIs he likely to come out to see such as you said Wang ZhongGuan Yu angrily dashed forward and Wang Zhong set his spear to meet himGuan Yu rode till he came close to his antagonist then suddenly wheeled awayWang Zhong went after him and followed up a slopeJust as they passed the crest Guan Yu suddenly wheeled again shouted and came on flourishing the mighty swordWang Zhong could not withstand that and fled But Guan Yu changing the huge sword to his left hand with his right laid hold of his victim by the straps of his breastplate lifted him out of the saddle and rode away to his own lines with the captive laid across the pommel of his saddleWang Zhongs army scatteredThe captive was sent to Xuzhou where he was summoned into the presence of Liu BeiWho are youWhat office do you holdHow dare you falsely display the ensigns of the Prime Minister said Liu BeiWhat do you mean by falsely when I simply obeyed my orders said Wang ZhongMy master wanted to produce the impression that he was presentReally he was not there Liu Bei treated him kindly giving him food and clothing but put him in prison till his colleague could be capturedGuan Yu said to Liu Bei I knew you had peaceful intentions in your mind therefore I captured Wang Zhong instead of slaying him I was afraid of Zhang Feis hasty and impulsive temper said Liu Bei He would have slain this man So I could not send himThere is no advantage in killing persons of this sort and while alive they are often useful in amicable settlements Here Zhang Fei said You have got this Wang Zhong now I will go and get the other man Be careful said Liu BeiLiu Dai was once Imperial Protector of Yanzhou and he was one of the nobles who met at Tiger Trap Pass to destroy Dong Zhuo He is not to be despised I do not think him worth talking about so muchI will bring him in alive just as Second Brother did this other I fear that if his life be lost it may upset our designs said Liu BeiIf I kill him I will forfeit my own life said Zhang FeiSo he was given three thousand soldiers and went off quicklyThe capture of his colleague made Liu Dai careful He strengthened his defenses and kept behind themHe took no notice of the daily challenges and continual insults which began with Zhang Feis arrivalAfter some days Zhang Fei evolved a ruseHe issued orders to prepare to rush the enemys camp at night but he himself spent the day drinking Pretending to be very intoxicated he held a courtmartial and one soldier was severely flogged for a breach of discipline The man was left bound in the midst of the camp Zhang Fei saying Wait till I am ready to start tonight you shall be sacrificed to the flag At the same time he gave secret orders to the custodians to let the man escapeThe man found his opportunity crept out of camp and went over to the enemy to whom he betrayed the plan of a night attackAs the man bore signs of savage punishment Liu Dai was the more disposed to credit his desertion and tale and Liu Dai made his arrangements putting the greater part of his troops in ambush outside his camp so that it was emptyThat night having divided his army into three parties Zhang Fei went to attack the camp A few men were ordered to advance directly dash in and set fire goingTwo larger bodies of troops were to go round to the rear of the camp and attack when they saw the fire well startedAt the third watch Zhang Fei with his veterans went to cut off Liu Dais road to the rearThe thirty men told off to start a conflagration made their way into the camp and were successfulWhen the flames arose the ambushing troops rushed out but only to find themselves attacked on both sidesThis confused them and as they knew nothing of the number of their assailants they were panic stricken and scatteredLiu Dai with a company of footmen got clear of the fight and fled but he went straight toward Zhang Fei Escape was impossible and the two men rode up each to attack the other Zhang Fei captured his opponent and the men surrendered Zhang Fei sent news of this success to his brothersLiu Bei said Hitherto Zhang Fei has been rather violent but this time he has acted wisely and I am very pleased They rode out to welcome Zhang FeiYou said I was too rough how now said Zhang Fei to his brothers If I had not put you on your mettle you would not have evolved this stratagem said Liu BeiZhang Fei laughedThen appeared the captive Liu Dai in bonds Liu Bei at once dismounted and loosed the cords saying My young brother was rather hasty but you must pardon him So Liu Dai was freedHe was taken into the city his colleague was released and both were cared for Liu Bei said to them I could not help putting Imperial Protector Deputy Che Zhou to death when he tried to kill me but Cao Cao took it as disaffection and sent you two generals to punish meI have received much kindness from him and certainly would not show ingratitude by killing youI wish you to speak for me and explain when you get back We are deeply grateful that you spare our lives and we will certainly do so in gratitude for what our wives and children owe you Next day the two leaders and their army were allowed to depart unscathed But before they had got three miles from the boundary they heard a mighty shouting and there appeared Zhang Fei barring the road My brother made a mistake in letting you go he did not understandHow could he give freedom to two rebels This made the two men quake with fear but as the fierce eyed warrior with uplifted sword was bearing down upon them they heard another man galloping up and shouting Do not behave so disgracefully The newcomer was Guan Yu and his appearance relieved the unhappy men of all fearWhy do you stop them since our brother set them free cried Guan YuIf they are let go today they will surely come back cried Zhang FeiWait till they do then you may kill them replied Guan YuThe two leaders with one voice cried Even if the Prime Minister slay our whole clans we will never come againWe pray you pardon us Said Zhang Fei If Cao Cao himself had come I would have slain him Not a breastplate should have gone backBut for this time I leave you your heads Clapping their hands to their heads the two men scuttled off while the two brothers returned to the cityCao Cao will certainly come said Guan Yu and Zhang FeiSun Qian said This is not a city that can hold out for longWe should send part of our forces to Xiaopei and guard Xiapi as a corner stone of our position Liu Bei agreed and told off Guan Yu to guard Xiapi whither he also sent his two wives Lady Gan and Lady MiThe former was a native of Xiapi the latter was Mi Zhus younger sisterSun Qian Jian Yong Mi Zhu and Mi Fang were left to defend Xuzhou and Liu Bei with Zhang Fei went to XiaopeiThe two released leaders Liu Dai and Wang Zhong hastened home to Cao Cao and explained to him that Liu Bei was not disaffectedBut their master was exceeding angry with them crying You shameful traitors what use are you He roared to the guards to take them away to instant executionHow can a hare or a deer expect To conquer in tiger strife Minnows and shrimps that with dragons contend Already have done with lifeThe fate of the two leaders will be told in the next chapter CHAPTER  Mi Heng Slips His Garment And Rails At Traitors Ji Ping Pledges To Kill The Prime MinisterAt the close of the last chapter the two unsuccessful leaders Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were in danger of deathHowever Kong Rong remonstrated with Cao Cao saying You knew these two were no match for Liu Bei and if you put them to death because they failed you will lose the hearts of your people Wherefore the death sentence was not executed but they were deprived of rank and status Cao Cao next proposed to lead an army himself to attack Liu Bei but Kong Rong advised The weather is too inclement We must wait the return of springIn the interval we better use the time to arrange peace with Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao before launching an expedition against Xuzhou Wherefore Liu Ye was sent to Zhang Xiu and in due time reached XiangyangHe first had an interview with Jia Xu Zhang Xius adviser whereat he dwelt upon Cao Caos virtues so that Jia Xu was impressed kept him as a guest and undertook to smooth his waySoon after Liu Ye saw Zhang Xiu and spoke of the advantages of coming to terms with Cao CaoWhile the discussion was in progress a messenger from Yuan Shao was announced and he was called inHe presented letters and when they also proposed terms of peace Jia Xu asked what their success had been lately against Cao CaoThe war had ceased for the moment on account of the winter replied the messengerAs you General and Liu Biao are both well reputed officers of the state I have been sent to request your help Jia Xu laughed You can return to your master and say that as he could not brook rivalry of his brother he certainly would be sorely put to it with that of all the officers of the state The letter was torn into fragments before the messengers face and he was angrily bidden be gone But his master Yuan Shao is stronger than Cao Cao protested Zhang XiuYou have torn up his letter and are dismissing his manWhat shall we say about such an insult should Yuan Shao come Better join hands with Cao Cao said Jia XuBut there is still between us an unavenged enmity we could not suffer each other Jia Xu said There are three advantages in joining hands with Cao Cao First he has a command from the Emperor to restore peaceSecond as Yuan Shao is so strong our little help to him will be despised while we shall loom large and be well treated by Cao CaoThird Cao Cao is going to be Chief of the Feudal Lords and he will ignore all private feuds in order to show his magnanimity to all the worldI hope General you will see these things clearly and hesitate no longer Zhang Xiu now convinced became more reasonable and recalled Liu Ye who at the interview extolled the many virtues of his masterIf the Prime Minister had any thought of the old quarrel he would hardly have sent me to make friendly engagements would he said Liu Ye at the lastSo Zhang Xiu and his adviser proceeded to the capital where formal submission was madeAt the interview Zhang Xiu bowed low at the steps but Cao Cao hastening forward took him by the hand and raised him saying Forget that little fault of mine I pray you General Zhang Xiu received the title of General Who Possesses Prowess and Jia Xu was appointed CounselorCao Cao then directed his secretaries to draft letters inviting the support of Liu BiaoJia Xu said Liu Biao loves to have to do with famous peopleIf some famous scholar should be sent to him he would submit forthwith So Cao Cao inquired of Xun You who was the best person to go as a messenger and he recommended Kong Rong Cao Cao agreed and sent Xun You to speak with this officerSo he went to Kong Rong saying A scholar of reputation is required to aid as a messenger of state can you undertake this task Kong Rong replied I have a certain friend Mi Heng whose talents are ten times mineHe ought to be constantly at the court of the Emperor and not merely be sent as a state messengerI will recommend him to the Emperor So Kong Rong wrote the following memorialIn ancient days when the great waters were abroad the emperor pondered over their regulation and he sought out people of talent from all directionsIn old time when Emperor Wu of the Hans desired to enlarge his borders crowds of scholars responded to his callIntelligent and holy Your Majesty ascended the throneYou have fallen upon evil days but have been diligent modest and untiring in your effortsNow the great mountains have sent forth spirits and people of genius appearI your humble servant know of a certain simple scholar Mi Heng by name of Pingyuan a young man of twentyfour His moral character is excellent his talents eminent As a youth he took a high place in study and penetrated the most secret arcane of learningWhat he glanced at he could repeat what he heard once he never forgotHe is naturally high principled and his thoughts are divineSang Hongyangs mental calculations and Zhang Anshis memorial feats compared with Mi Hengs powers are no longer wonderfulLoyal sincere correct and straightforward his ambition is unsulliedHe regards the good with trembling respect he detests the evil with uncompromising hatredRen Zuo in unflinching candor Shi Yu in severe rectitude never surpassed himHundreds of hawks are not worth one ospreyIf Mi Heng be given a court appointment notable results must followReady in debate rapid in utterance his overwhelming intelligence wells up in profusion in the solution of doubts and the unraveling of difficulties he has no peerIn former days of Han Jia Yi begged to be sent on trial to a vassal state for the control of the Xiongnu tribespeople Zhong Jun offered to bring back the Prince of Nanyue to do homage to the emperorThe generous conduct of these youths has been much admiredIn our day Lu Cui and Yan Xiang remarkable for their talents have been appointed among the secretariesAnd Mi Heng is no less capableShould he be got then all possibilities may be realized the dragon may curvet through the celestial streets and soar along the Milky Way fame will extend to the poles of the universe and hang in the firmament with rainbow gloryHe would be the glory of all the present Ministers and enhance the majesty of the Palace itselfThe Music will acquire new beauties and the Palace will contain an excellent treasurePeople like Mi Heng are but fewAs in the recitation of Ji Chu Songs and the singing of Yang E Poems the most skillful performers are sought and such fleet horses as Fei Tu Broncos and Yao Miao Mustangs were looked for by the famous judges of horses Wang Liang and Bo Le so I the humble one dare not conceal this manYour Majesty is careful in the selection of servants and should try himLet him be summoned as he is simply clad in his serge dress and should he not appear worthy then may I be punished for the fault of deception The Emperor read the memorial and passed it to his Prime Minister who duly summoned Mi HengHe came but after his formal salutations were over he was left standing and not invited to sit downLooking up to heaven he sighed deeply saying Wide as is the universe it cannot produce the person Under my orders are scores of people whom the world call heroes What do you mean by saying there is not the person said Cao CaoI should be glad to hear who they are said Mi HengXun Yu Xun You Guo Jia and Cheng Yu are all people of profound skill and long views superior to Xiao He and Chen PingZhang Liao Xu Chu Li Dian and Yue Jin are bravest of the brave better than Cen Peng and Ma WuLu Qian and Man Chong are my secretaries Yu Jin and Xu Huang are my van leaders Xiahou Dun is one of the worlds marvels Cao Ren is the most successful leader of the ageNow say you there are not the people Sir you are quite mistaken said Mi Heng with a smile I know all these things you call peopleXun Yu is qualified to pose at a funeral or ask after a sick man Xun You is fit to be a tomb guardian Cheng Yu might be sent to shut doors and bolt windows and Guo Jia is a reciter of poems Zhang Liao might beat drums and clang gongs Xu Chu might lead cattle to pasture Yue Jin would make a fair reader of elegy Li Dian could carry dispatches and notices Lu Qian would be a fair armorer Man Chong could be sent to drink wine and eat brewers grains Yu Jin might be of use to carry planks and build walls Xu Huang might be employed to kill pigs and slay dogs Xiahou Dun should be styled Whole Body General and Cao Ren should be called Moneygrubbing Governor As for the remainder they are mere clothes shelves rice sacks wine vases flesh bags And what special gifts have you said Cao Cao angrily I know everything in heaven above and the earth beneathI am conversant with the Three Religions and the Nine Systems of Philosophy I could make my prince the rival of Kings Yao and Shun Can I discuss on even terms with common people Now Zhang Liao was present and he raised his sword to strike down the impudent visitor who spoke thus to his master but Cao Cao said I want another drummer boy to play on occasions of congratulation in the courtI will confer this office upon him Instead of indignantly declining this Mi Heng accepted the position and went outHe spoke very impertinently said Zhang Liao why did you not put him to death He has something of a reputation empty but people have heard of him and so if I put him to death they would say I was intolerantAs he thinks he has ability I have made him a drummer to mortify him Soon after Cao Cao instituted a banquet in the capital at which the guests were manyThe drums were to be played and the old drummers were ordered to wear new clothesBut the new drummer Mi Heng took his place with the other musicians clad in old and worn garmentsThe piece chosen was the Tolling of Yuyang and from the earliest taps on the drum the effect was exquisite profound as the notes from metal and stoneThe performance stirred deeply the emotions of every guest some even shed tearsSeeing all eyes turned on the shabby performer the attendants said Why did you not put on your new uniform Mi Heng turned to them slipped off his frayed and torn robe and stood there in full view naked as he was bornThe assembled guests covered their faces Then the drummer composedly drew on his nether garmentsWhy do you behave so rudely at court said Cao CaoTo flout ones prince and insult ones superiors is the real rudeness cried Mi HengI bare my natural body as an emblem of my purity So you are pureAnd who is foul You do not distinguish between the wise and the foolish which is to have foul visionYou have never read the Odes or the Histories which is to have foul speechYou are deaf to honest words which is to have foul earsYou are unable to reconcile antiquity with today which is to be foul withoutYou cannot tolerate the nobles which is to be foul withinYou harbor thoughts of rebellion which is to have a foul heartI am one of the most famous scholars in the empire and you make me a drummer boy that is as Yang Huo belittling Confucius or Zang Cang vilifying MenciusYou desire to be chief and arbitrator of the great nobles yet you treat me thus Now Kong Rong who had recommended Mi Heng for employment was among the guests and he feared for the life of his friend Wherefore he tried to calm the stormMi Heng is only guilty of a misdemeanor like Fu Yue cried Kong RongHe is not a man likely to disturb your dreams Illustrious Sir Pointing to Mi Heng the Prime Minister said I will send you to Jingzhou as my messenger and if Liu Biao surrender to me I will give you a post at court But Mi Heng was unwilling to goSo Cao Cao bade two of his men prepare three horses and they set Mi Heng on the middle one and dragged him along the road between themIt is also related that a great number of officers of all ranks assembled at the East Fritillary Gate to see the messenger startXun Yu said When Mi Heng comes we will not rise to salute him So when Mi Heng came dismounted and entered the waiting room they all sat stiff and silentMi Heng uttered a loud cryWhat is that for said Xun YuShould not one cry out when one enters a coffin said Mi HengWe may be corpses shouted they altogether but you are a wandering headless ghost I am a minister of Han and not a partisan of Cao Caos cried Mi HengYou cannot say I have no head They were angry enough to kill him but Xun Yu checked them saying He is a paltry fellow it is not worth soiling your blades with his blood I am paltry and yet I have the soul of a man and you are mere worms said Mi HengThey went their ways all very angryMi Heng went on his journey and presently reached Jingzhou where he saw Liu BiaoAfter that under pretense of extolling Liu Biaos virtue he lampooned Liu Biao who was annoyed and sent him to Jiangxia to see Huang ZuWhy did you not put the fellow to death for lampooning you said one to Liu BiaoYou see he shamed Cao Cao but Cao Cao did not kill him as Cao Cao feared to lose popular favorSo Cao Cao sent him to me thinking to borrow my hand to slay him and so suffer the loss of my good nameI have sent him on to Huang Zu to let Cao Cao see that I understood Liu Biaos clever caution met with general praise At that time a messenger from Yuan Shao was also there with certain proposals for an alliance and it was necessary to decide which aide to espouseAll the advisers came together to consider the question Then Commander Han Song said As you have now two offers you can please yourself and choose your own way to destroy your enemies for if one refuses you can follow the other Now Cao Cao is an able general and has many capable officers in his trainIt looks as though he may destroy Yuan Shao and then move his armies across the river I fear my lord you would be unable then to withstand himThat being so it would be wise to support Cao Cao who will treat you with respect Liu Biao replied You go to the capital and see how things tendThat will help me to decide Han Song said The positions of master and servant are clearly definedNow I am your man prepared to go all lengths for you and obey you to the last whether in serving the Emperor or in following Cao CaoBut lest there should be any doubt you must remember that if the Emperor gives me any office then I shall become his servant and shall not be ready to face death for you You go and find out what you canI have ideas in my mind So Han Song took his leave and went to the capital where he saw Cao CaoCao Cao gave him rank and made him Governor of LinglingAdviser Xun Yu remonstrated saying This man came to spy out how things were moving He has done nothing to deserve reward and yet you give him an office like this There were no such suspicious rumors connected with poor Mi Heng and yet you sent him off and would never test his power Mi Heng shamed me too deeply before all the world I am going to borrow Liu Biaos hand to remove him And you need say no more said Cao CaoThen Cao Cao sent Han Song back to his former master to tell him what had happenedHan Song came and was full of praise for the virtues of the court and was keen on persuading Liu Biao to espouse that side Then Liu Biao suddenly turned angry charged him with treachery put him in prison and threatened him with death You turn your back on me cried Han SongI did not betray you Kuai Liang remarked Han Song had foretold this possibility before he left it is only what he expected Liu Biao who was just and reasonable went no furtherPresently came the news that Mi Heng had been put to death by Huang Zu on account of a quarrel begun over the wine cups Both being worse for liquor they had begun to discuss the worth of peopleYou were in Xuchang said Huang ZuWho was there of worth The big boy was Kong Rong and the little one Yang XiuThere was no one else to count What am I like said Huang ZuYou are like a god in a temple you sit still and receive sacrifice but the lack of intelligence is pitiful Do you regard me as a mere image cried Huang Zu angrily So Huang Zu put the impudent speaker to deathEven at the very point of death Mi Heng never ceased his railing and abuse Alas sighed Liu Biao when he heard Mi Hengs fate Then Liu Biao had the victim honorably interred near Yingwu on Parrot Island And a later poet wrote of Mi Heng Huang Zu could brook no rival at his word Mi Heng met death beneath the cruel swordHis grave on Parrot Isle may yet be seen The river flowing past it coldly greenCao Cao heard of the young mans death with pleasure The putrid bookworm has just cut himself up with his own sharp tongue said heAs there was no sign of Liu Biao coming to join him Cao Cao began to think of coercion Xun Yu dissuaded him from this courseSaid he Yuan Shao is not subjugated Liu Bei is not destroyed To attack Liu Biao would be to neglect the vital to care for the immaterialDestroy the two chief enemies first and the Han River is yours at one blow And Cao Cao took the adviceAfter the departure of Liu Bei Dong Cheng and his fellow conspirators did nothing else day or night but try to evolve plans for the destruction of Cao Cao But they could see no chance to attackAt the new year audience Cao Cao was odiously arrogant and overweening and the chief conspirators disgust was so intense that he fell illHearing of the State Uncles indisposition the Emperor sent the Court Physician to see himThe Court Physician at this time was a native of Luoyang named Ji Ping A very famous physician Ji Ping devoted himself wholly to the treatment of his court patientLiving in Dong Chengs palace and seeing Dong Cheng at all times Ji Ping soon found that some secret grief was sorely troubling him But Ji Ping dared not ask questionsOne evening of the full moon festival when the physician was just taking his leave Dong Cheng kept him and the two men had supper togetherThey eat talking for some time and Dong Cheng by and by dropped off to sleep dressed as he was Presently Wang Zifu and the others were announcedAs they were coming in Wang Zifu cried Our business is settled I should be glad to hear how said Dong ChengLiu Biao has joined Yuan Shao and five hundred thousand troops in fifty legions are on their way here by different routesMore than this Ma Teng and Han Sui are coming from the northwest with seven hundred thousand Xiliang troopsCao Cao has moved every soldier outside Xuchang to meet the combined armiesThere is a great banquet in the Palace tonight and if we get together our young men and servants we can muster more than a thousand and we can surround the Palace while Cao Cao is at the banquet and finish him off We must not miss this Dong Cheng was more than delightedHe called his servants and armed them put on his own armor and mounted his horse The conspirators met as they had arranged just at the inner gate of the Prime Ministers palace It was the first watch The small army marched straight in Dong Cheng leading with his treasured sword drawn His intended victim was at table in one of the private roomsDong Cheng rushed in crying Cao Cao you rebel stay and dashed at Cao Cao who fell at the first blowAnd just then he woke up and found it was all a dream but his mouth was still full of cursesDo you really wish to destroy Cao Cao said Ji Ping going forward to his half awakened patient This brought Dong Cheng to his sensesHe stopped terror stricken and made no replyDo not be frightened O Uncle said the doctorAlthough I am a physician I am also a man and I never forget my emperorYou have seemed sad for many days but I have never ventured to ask the reasonNow you have shown it in your dream and I know your real feelingsIf I can be of any use I will helpNothing can daunt me Dong Cheng covered his face and wept I fear you may not be true to me cried heJi Ping at once bit off a finger as a pledge of his faithAnd then his host and patient brought forth the decree he had received in the girdle I am afraid our schemes will come to nought said Dong ChengLiu Bei and Ma Teng are gone and there is nothing we can doThat was the real reason I fell ill It is not worth troubling you gentlemen with for Cao Caos life lies in these hands of mine said Ji PingHow can that be Because he is often ill with deepseated pain in his head When this comes on he sends for meWhen next he calls me I only have to give him one dose and he will certainly die We do not want any weapons If only you could do itYou would be the savior of the dynasty it depends upon you Then Ji Ping went away leaving his late patient a happy manDong Cheng strolled into the garden and there he saw one of his servants Quin Quington whispering with one of the concubines Yun Ying in a dark cornerThis annoyed him and he called his attendants to seize themHe would have put them to death but for the intervention of his wife At her request he spared their lives but both were beaten forty canes and the lad was thrown into a dungeonSulky at this treatment Quin Quington broke out of the cell in the night climbed over the wall and went straight to Cao Caos palace where he betrayed the conspiracyCao Cao at once had him taken into a secret chamber and questioned himQuin Quington gave the names of the conspirators saying Wang Zifu Wu Zilan Chong Ji Wu Shi Ma Teng and my master have been meeting secretlyMy master has a roll of white silk with writing on it but I do not know what it meansYesterday Ji Ping bit off one of his fingers as a pledge of fidelityI saw that Quin Quington was kept in a secret part of the palace while his late master Dong Cheng only knowing that he had run away took no special means to find himSoon after this Cao Cao feigned a headache and sent for Ji Ping as usualThe rebel is done for thought Ji Ping and he made a secret package of poison which he took with him to the palace of the Prime MinisterHe found Cao Cao in bed The patient bade the doctor prepare a potion for himOne draught will cure this disease said Ji PingHe bade them bring him a pot and he prepared the potion in the roomWhen it had simmered for some time and was half finished the poison was added and soon after the physician presented the draughtCao Cao knowing it was poisoned made excuses and would not swallow itYou should take it hot said the doctor Then there will be a gentle perspiration and you will be better You are a scholar said Cao Cao sitting up and know what is the correct thing to doWhen the master is ill and takes drugs the attendant first tastes them when a man is ill his son first tastes the medicineYou are my confidant and should drink firstThen I will swallow the remainder Medicine is to treat disease what is the use of any ones tasting it said Ji PingBut he guessed now the conspiracy had been discovered so he dashed forward seized Cao Cao by the ear and tried to pour the potion down his throat Cao Cao pushed it away and it spiltThe bricks upon which it fell were split asunderBefore Cao Cao could speak his servants had already seized the assailantSaid Cao Cao I am not ill I only wanted to test youSo you really thought to poison me He sent for a score of sturdy gaolers who carried off the prisoner to the inner apartments to be interrogatedCao Cao took his seat in a pavilion and the hapless physician tightly bound was thrown to the ground before him The prisoner maintained a bold frontCao Cao said I thought you were a physician how dared you try to poison me Some one incited you to this crime and if you tell me I will pardon you You are a rebel you flout your Prince and injure your bettersThe whole empire wishes to kill you Do you think I am the only one Cao Cao again and again pressed the prisoner to tell what he knew but he only replied that no one had sent him it was his own desireI have failed and I can but die added Ji PingCao Cao angrily bade the gaolers give him a severe beating and they dogged him for two watchesHis skin hung in tatters the flesh was battered and the blood from his wounds ran down the stepsThen fearing he might die and his evidence be lost Cao Cao bade them cease and remove him They took him off to a quiet place where he might recover somewhatHaving issued orders to prepare a banquet for next day Cao Cao invited all the courtiers theretoDong Cheng was the only one who excused himself saying he was unwellThe other conspirators dared not stay away as they felt they would be suspected Tables were laid in the private apartments and after several courses the host said There is not much to amuse us today but I have a man to show you that will sober you Bring him in Cao Cao said turning to the gaolers and the hapless Ji Ping appeared securely fastened in a wooden collarHe was placed where all could see himYou officials do not know that this man is connected with a gang of evil doers who desire to overturn the government and even injure meHowever Heaven has defeated their plans but I desire that you should hear his evidence Then Cao Cao ordered the gaolers to beat their prisonerThey did so till Ji Ping lay unconscious when they revived him by spraying water over his faceAs soon as he came to he glared at his oppressor and ground his teeth Cao Cao you rebel What are you waiting forWhy not kill me cried Ji PingCao Cao replied The conspirators were only six at first you made the seventhIs that true Here the prisoner broke in with more abuse while Wang Zifu and the other three conspirators exchanged glances looking as though they were sitting on a rug full of needlesCao Cao continued his torture of the prisoner beating him into unconsciousness and reviving him with cold water the victim disdaining to ask mercyFinally Cao Cao realized he would incriminate none of his accomplices and so he told the gaolers to remove Ji PingAt the close of the banquet when the guests were dispersing four of them the four conspirators were invited to remain behind to supperThey were terrified so that their souls seemed no longer to inhabit their bodies but there was no saying nay to the invitationPresently Cao Cao said Still there is something I want to speak about so I have asked you to stay for a time longerI do not know what you four have been arranging with Dong Cheng Nothing at all said Wang ZifuAnd what is written on the white silk asked Cao Cao They all said they knew nothing about itThen Cao Cao ordered the runaway servant to be brought inAs soon as Quin Quington came Wang Zifu said Well what have you seen and where Quin Quington replied You five very carefully chose retired places to talk in and you secretly signed a white rollYou cannot deny that Wang Zifu replied This miserable creature was punished for misbehavior with one of Uncle Dong Chengs maids and now because of that he slanders his master You must not listen to him Ji Ping tried to pour poison down my throatWho told him to do that if it was not Dong Cheng said Cao CaoThey all said they knew nothing about who it wasSo far said Cao Cao matters are only beginning and there is a chance of forgiveness But if the thing grows it will be difficult not to take notice of it The whole four vigorously denied that any plot existedHowever Cao Cao called up his henchmen and the four men were put into confinementNext day Cao Cao with a large following went to the State Uncles palace to ask after his healthDong Cheng came out to receive his visitor who at once said Why did you not come last night I am not quite well yet and have to be very careful about going out replied Dong ChengOne might say you were suffering from national sorrow eh said Cao CaoDong Cheng startedCao Cao continued Have you heard of the Ji Ping affair No what is it Cao Cao smiled coldly saying How can it be you do not know He turned to his attendants and told them to bring in the prisoner while he went on talking to his host about national illness Dong Cheng was much put about and knew not what to doSoon the gaolers led in the physician to the steps of the hallAt once the bound man began to rail at Cao Cao as rebel and traitorThis man said Cao Cao pointing to Ji Ping has implicated Wang Zifu and three others all of whom are now under arrestThere is one more whom I have not caught yet Who sent you to poison me continued Cao Cao turning toward the physicianQuick tell me Heaven sent me to slay a traitor Cao Cao angrily ordered them to beat Ji Ping again but there was no part of his body that could be beatenDong Cheng sat looking at him his heart feeling as if transfixed with a daggerYou were born with ten fingers how is it you have now only nine Ji Ping replied I bit off one as a pledge when I swore to slay a traitor Cao Cao told them to bring a knife and they lopped off his other nine fingersNow they are all off that will teach you to make pledges Still I have a mouth that can swallow a traitor and a tongue that can curse him said Ji PingCao Cao told them to cut out his tongueJi Ping said Do notI cannot endure any more punishment I shall have to speak outLoosen my bonds Loose them There is no reason why not said Cao CaoThey loosed himAs soon as he was free Ji Ping stood up turned his face toward the Emperors palace and bowed saying It is Heavens will that thy servant has been unable to remove the evil Then he turned and smashed his head into the steps and diedHis body was quartered and exposedThis happened in the first month of the fifth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity  and a certain historian wrote a poem There lived in Han a simple physician No warrior yet brave Enough to risk his very life His Emperor to saveHe failed but lasting fame Is his he feared not death He cursed the traitorous Prime Minister Unto his latest breathSeeing his victim had passed beyond the realm of punishment Cao Cao had Quin Quington led inDo you know this man Uncle Yes cried Dong ChengSo the runaway servant is here he ought to be put to death He just told me of your treachery he is my witness said Cao CaoWho would dare kill him How can you the First Minister of State heed the unsupported tale of an absconding servant But I have Wang Zifu and the others in prison said Cao CaoAnd how can you rebut their evidence He then called in the remainder of his followers and ordered them to search Dong Chengs bedroom They did so and found the decree that had been given him in the girdle and the pledge signed by the conspirators You mean rat cried Cao Cao You dared do this He gave orders to arrest the whole household without exceptionThen he returned to his palace with the incriminating documents and called all his advisers together to discuss the dethronement of the Emperor and the setting up of a successorMany decrees blood written have issued accomplishing nothing One inscribed pledge was fraught with mountains of sorrowThe reader who wishes to how the fate of the Emperor must read the next chapter CHAPTER Cao Cao Murdered The Consort Dong Liu Bei Flees To Yuan Shao The last chapter closed with the discovery of the girdle decree and the assembly of Cao Caos advisers to consider the deposition of Emperor Xian Cheng Yu spoke strongly against this saying Illustrious Sir the means by which you impress the world and direct the government is the command of the House of Han In these times of turmoil and rivalry among the nobles such a step as the deposition of the ruler will certainly bring about civil war and is much to be deprecated After reflection Cao Cao abandoned the project But Dong Chengs plot was not to go unpunishedAll five of the conspirators with every member of their households seven hundred at least were taken and put to death at one or another of the gates of the cityThe people wept at such merciless and wholesale slaughterA secret decree in a girdle sewn In red blood written the Emperors own To the staunch and faithful Dong Cheng addressed Who had saved him once when enemies pressedAnd who sore grieved at his Sovereigns fate Expressed in dreams his ceaseless hate Carried misfortune and death in its train But glory to him who died in vain Another poet wrote of the sad fate of Wang Zifu and his friendsGreatheartedly these signed the silken roll And pledged themselves to save their king from shameBlack death of them took heavy toll To write their names upon the roll of fameBut the slaughter of the conspirators and their whole households did not appease the wrath of the Prime Minister The Emperors consort was a sister of Dong Cheng and sword in hand Cao Cao went into the Palace determined to slay her alsoThe Emperor cherished her tenderly the more so as she was then in the fifth month of pregnancyThat day as they often did the Emperor Consort Dong and Empress Fu were sitting in their private apartment secretly talking of the decree entrusted to Dong Cheng and asking each other why nothing seemed to have been doneThe sudden appearance of the angry Prime Minister armed as he was frightened them greatlyDoes Your Majesty know that Dong Cheng conspired against me said heDong Zhuo died long ago replied the EmperorNot Dong ZhuoDong Cheng roared Cao CaoThe Emperors heart trembled but he gasped out Really I did not know So the cut finger and the blood written decree are all forgotten eh The Emperor was silentCao Cao bade his lictors seize Consort DongThe Emperor interposed asking pity for her conditionIf Heaven had not interposed and defeated the plot I should be a dead manHow could I leave this woman to work evil to me by and by Said the Emperor Immure her in one of the palaces till her confinementDo not harm her now Do you wish me to spare her offspring to avenge the mother said Cao Cao I pray that my body may be spared mutilation and not put to shame said Consort DongCao Cao bade his men show her the white silk cordThe Emperor wept bitterly Do not hate me in the below realms of the Nine Golden Springs said the Emperor to herHis tears fell like rainEmpress Fu also joined in the lament but Cao Cao said You are behaving like a lot of children And he told the lictors to take Consort Dong away and strangle her in the courtyard In vain had the fair girl found favor in the sight of her lord She died and the fruit of her womb perishedStern and calm her lord sat powerless to save Hiding his face while tears gushed forthWhen leaving the Palace Cao Cao gave strict orders to the keepers saying Any one of the imperial relatives by marriage who enter the Palace will be put to death and the guards will share the same punishment for lack of zeal To make more sure he appointed three thousand Imperial Guards from his own troops and appointed Cao Hong to the commandThen said Cao Cao to his counselor Cheng Yu The conspirators in the capital have been removed it is true but there are yet two others Ma Teng and Liu BeiThese must not be left Cheng Yu replied Ma Teng is strong in the west and would not be easily capturedHe might be enticed to the capital by suave words and kindly praises when he would be at your mercyLiu Bei is at Xuzhou strongly posted in an oxhorn formation and not to be lightly attackedMore than this Yuan Shao is at Guandu and his one desire is to attack youAny attempt on the east will send Liu Bei to Yuan Shao for help and Yuan Shao will come here at onceThen what will you do You are at fault replied Cao CaoLiu Bei is a bold warrior and if we wait till he is fully fledged and winged he will be more difficult to deal withYuan Shao may be strong but he is not to be fearedHe is too undeciding to act As they were discussing these things Guo Jia came in and Cao Cao suddenly referred the matter to himIf I attack Liu Bei then Yuan Shao is to be feared what do you think of it Guo Jia said Yuan Shao by nature is dilatory and hesitating and his various advisers are jealous of each other He is not to be fearedLiu Bei is getting together a new army and has not yet won their hearts You could settle the east in one battle This advice is in harmony with my thinking said Cao CaoAnd he prepared an army of two hundred thousand troops to move in five divisions against XuzhouScouts took the news of these preparations to Xuzhou Sun Qian first went to Xiapi to tell Guan Yu and then went to Xiaopei to tell Liu Bei The two discussed the position and decided that help must be soughtSo letters were written to Yuan Shao and given to Sun Qian who went north sought Tian Feng and asked him to arrange an interview with Yuan ShaoSun Qian was introduced and presented his lettersBut Yuan Shao was of melancholy countenance and his dress was all awryTian Feng said Why this disarray my lord I am about to die replied Yuan ShaoBut why do you utter such words I have three sons but only the youngest is clever enough to understand my ideasNow he is suffering from scabies which places his life in jeopardy Think you that I have any heart to talk over any other affairs But said Tian Feng the present combination of circumstances is unparalleled Cao Cao is going to attack the east and Xuchang will be emptyYou can enter it with a few volunteers and so perform good service to the Emperor and save the people from sorrowYou have only to make up your mind to act I know the chance is excellent but I am worried and distressed and fear failure What are you distressed about said Tian FengAmong my sons only this special one is remarkable and if anything happens I am done Thus it became evident that no army would be dispatchedIn confirmation of this Yuan Shao said to Sun Qian Go home and tell Liu Bei the real reason and say that if anything untoward happen he can come over to me and I will find some means of helping him Tian Feng struck the ground with his staffIt is such a pity cried heJust as a unique opportunity presents itself everything is spoiled by the illness of a child He went outSun Qian saw that no help could be hoped for and set out to return When he had arrived and related what he had seen Liu Bei was quite alarmed and asked what could be doneDo not be troubled Brother said Zhang FeiWe can destroy Cao Cao merely by a sudden attack before his army shall have time to camp That would be according to the rules of war said Liu BeiYou have always been a bold warrior and that move against Liu Dai shows that you are becoming a strategist too So Liu Bei gave Zhang Fei command of enough soldiers to carry out this planNow while Cao Cao was in the midst of his march toward Xiaopei a tornado sprang up and the howling gale tore down one of the banners and broke the staffCao Cao called together his advisers and leaders to ask them what this portendedXun Yu said From what direction was the wind at the time and what was the color of the flag The wind was from the southeast and the flag was blue and red There is only one interpretationA raid on the camp will occur tonight Cao Cao noddedAt that moment Mao Jie entered and reported a similar incident Cao Cao asked him the portentMy thinking tells me it means a night raid replied he Alas for the weakness of this descendant of kings He placed his faith on a night raidBut the broken staff of a banner warned his enemy Why should the ancient of days favor the wickedThis is evidently providence said Cao CaoAnd he began to make preparations He told off nine bodies of troops to take stations leaving only one of them as if camped while he placed the others in ambush at eight points There was but little moonlight as Liu Bei and Zhang Fei marched their respective armies toward Cao Caos campThey had left Sun Qian to guard XiaopeiZhang Fei since he was the originator of the stratagem led the way with some light horse As they drew near everything seemed very quiet and no one seemed moving Then suddenly lights flashed out all about them and Zhang Fei saw he had fallen into a trapAt once from all the eight directions came out the ambushing troops From east west north south were Zhang Liao Xu Chu Li Dian and Yu Jin From northeast northwest southeast southwest were Xiahou Dun Xiahou Yuan Xu Huang and Yue Jin Zhang Fei dashing this way and rushing that guarding his van and protecting his rear vainly tried to clear himselfThe soldiers he had being originally Cao Caos troops soon gave in and returned to their old leader The position became very desperateZhang Fei met Xu Huang and engaged him but his rear was also attacked by Yue Jin At length he cut an arterial alley out and with a half score of his troops started to return to Xiaopei The retreat was cut offHe thought to make for Xuzhou but felt certain that way was also barredNo other way seemed open and so he made for the Mangdang Hills As Liu Bei drew near the camp he intended to attack when he heard the din of battle Then he was attacked in the rear and very soon had lost half his forceNext Xiahou Dun came to attack Thereupon Liu Bei boltedHe was pursued by Xiahou YuanPresently Liu Bei looked about him and found he had less than half a hundred soldiers following him He set his face in the direction of Xiaopei But before long Liu Bei saw that place was in flames So he changed his plan and went toward Xiapi However he found the whole countryside full of the enemy and he could not get throughSo he bethought himself of the promise of Yuan Shao that he would find refuge if things went unfavorable and determined to go to Yuan Shao till he could form some other planWherefore he took the Qingzhou roadBut it also was blocked and he went into the open country and made his way north not without being pursued and losing the remainder of his few followersHe hastened toward Qingzhou City traveling one hundred miles a dayWhen he reached the city and summoned the gate the guards asked who he was and they told the Governor who was Yuan Shaos eldest son Yuan TanYuan Tan was greatly surprised but he opened the gates and went to meet Liu Bei whom he treated with due considerationLiu Bei told the story of his defeat and said he wished for harborHe was given suitable quarters and hospitably entertained while the young man wrote to inform his fatherThen Yuan Tan provided an escort and sent Liu Bei on his journey as far as the boundary of Pingyuan At the city of Yejun Liu Bei was met by Yuan Shao in person ten miles outside the city with a great escortLiu Bei made a humble obeisance which Yuan Shao hastened to return and said I have been very distressed that on account of my sons illness I did not come to your aidIt is a great joy to see you the one desire of my life is satisfied Liu Bei replied The poor Liu Bei you see here has long desired to take refuge with you but fate has hitherto denied him that privilegeNow attacked by Cao Cao my family lost I remembered that you General would receive good people from all sidesWherefore I put my pride in my pocket I trust that I may be found worthy and one day I will prove my gratitude Yuan Shao received him with much pleasure and treated him exceedingly wellAnd they both lived in Yuan Shaos home region JizhouAfter the capture of Xiaopei Cao Cao pressed on toward Xuzhou City which after a short defense and the flight of Mi Zhu and Jian Yong was surrendered by Chen DengCao Cao led his army into the city restored order and pacified the people Next he wanted to press on to Xiapi where Guan Yu was holding out and keeping guard of Liu Beis familyXun Yu said Guan Yu is there in charge of his brothers family and he will defend the city to the lastIf you do not take it quickly Yuan Shao will get it Cao Cao said I have always loved Guan Yu both for his warlike abilities and his principles I would engage him to enter my serviceI would rather send some one to talk him into surrender He will not do that said Guo Jia his sense of right is too solidI fear any one who went to speak with him would suffer Then suddenly a man stepped out saying I know him slightly and I will go The speaker was Zhang LiaoCheng Yu looked at him and said Though you are an old acquaintance I do not think you are equal to talking over Guan YuBut I have a scheme that will so entangle him that he will have no alternative he will have to enter the service of the Prime Minister They set the fatal spring beside the lordly tigers trail They hide the hook with fragrant bait to catch the mighty whaleHow Guan Yu was to be entrapped will be told in the next chapterCHAPTER  Besieged In Tushan Mountains Guan Yu Makes Three Conditions The Rescue At Baima Cao Cao Is Released The plan to seduce Guan Yu from allegiance to his brothers was now announced by Cheng Yu Since Guan Yu is far braver than ordinary warriors he can only be overreached by superior cunningNow send some of the captured soldiers who have lately been of Liu Beis army into Xiapi where they shall say they have come back They shall thus be our allies on the inside Then an attack and a feigned defeat will entice Guan Yu to a distance from the cityAnd his return road shall be cut Cao Cao accepted the scheme and a few score of the troops who had lately been in Xuzhou were sent to the city Guan Yu believed the story they told and trusted them So they were suffered to remainAfter this part of the game had been played Xiahou Dun led forward five thousand troops against the cityAt first Guan Yu would not accept the challenge but provoked by men sent to hurl insults at him from the foot of the wall his wrath got the better of him and he moved out with three thousand troopsAfter the leaders had exchanged some ten bouts Xiahou Dun made to run away Guan Yu pursuedXiahou Dun stopped and made a stand then he fled again Thus alternately fighting and retiring he enticed Guan Yu seven miles from XiapiThen Guan Yu suddenly remembering the risk to the city drew off his army to return homewardSoon at the sound of a signal bomb from the left and right out moved two bodies of troops led by Xu Huang and Xu Chu who barred his way Guan Yu hastened along a road that seemed to offer retreat but from both sides his ambushing enemies shot their crossbows and the arrows flew like locusts on the wing No way past was found and he turned back Then both bodies joined in attacking himHe drove them off and got into the road to his own city but soon Xiahou Dun came up again and attacked fiercely as beforeEvening came and still Guan Yu was hemmed in so he went up on a low hill of Tushan Mountains upon which he encamped for a restGuan Yu was surrounded on all sides by enemies By and by looking toward his city he saw the glow of fire It meant that the traitors who had come in to surrender had opened the gate and the enemy had gone in forceThey had made the fires in order to perplex and distress Guan Yu and indeed the sight saddened him In the night he made efforts to escape from the hill but every attempt was checked by flights of arrowsAt daybreak he prepared for one more effort but before moving he saw a horseman riding up at full speed and presently discerned Zhang LiaoWhen within speaking distance Guan Yu said Are you come to fight me Zhang Liao No replied Zhang LiaoI am come to see you because of our old friendship Wherefore Zhang Liao threw aside his sword dismounted and came forward saluting And the two sat downThen naturally you have come to talk me over said Guan YuNot so said Zhang LiaoSometime ago you saved me can I help saving you Then you desire to help me Not exactly that replied Zhang LiaoThen what are you doing here if you have not come to help me Nothing is known of the fate of your elder brother nor whether your younger brother is alive or deadLast night your city fell into the hands of Cao Cao but neither soldiers nor people were harmed and a special guard was set over the family of Liu Bei lest they should be alarmedI came to tell you how well they had been treated This is certainly talking me over said Guan Yu Though escape is impossible yet I am not perturbedI look upon death as going homeYou would better depart quickly and let me go down and begin the struggle again Surely you must know everybody will ridicule you when they hear of this said Zhang LiaoI shall die for loyalty and righteousness Who will laugh said Guan YuYou would be guilty of three faults if you died Tell me them said Guan Yu First of all you and your elder brother pledged yourselves in the Peach Garden to die or to live togetherNow your brother has been defeated and you want to fight to the death Therefore if your brother appear again by and by and wants your help he will seek it in vain Is this anything else than betraying the Peach Garden OathSecondly you are in charge of your brothers family and if you fought and died the two women would be left forlorn and without a protector That would be a betrayal of trust Thirdly your military skill stands out conspicuous and will go down in historyIf you do not aid your brother in his noble attempt to maintain the dynasty then all your labors and sufferings will have been spent to win a worthless reputation as a valiant fool Where is the sense in thatI feel it my duty to point out these three faults to you Guan Yu remained silent and thought for some timeThen he said You have spoken of my three faults What do you desire You are surrounded with the certainty of death if you do not yieldThere is no advantage in a useless deathWherefore your best course is to yield to Cao Cao till you hear news of Liu Bei and can rejoin himThus you will ensure the safety of the two ladies and also keep inviolate the Peach Garden compact You will preserve a useful lifeBrother you must reflect on these things Brother you have spoken of three advantages now I have three conditionsIf the Prime Minister concede these then will I doff my armorIf he refuses then I prefer to be guilty of the three faults and die Why should the Prime Minister not concede them He is most liberal and large mindedI pray you let me hear your conditions The first is that as I and the Imperial Uncle have sworn to support the Hans I now submit to the Emperor and not to His Prime Minister Cao CaoThe second condition is that suitable provision be made for the two ladies under my care and that no one shall be allowed to approach themThe third is that I shall be allowed to set off to rejoin Uncle Liu Bei so soon as I shall hear where he is whether it be far or near I require all these to be satisfied failing a single one I will not submitWherefore Zhang Liao I pray you hasten back and announce them Zhang Liao lost no time but rode back to Cao CaoWhen he spoke of Guan Yus intention to submit to the Hans but not to Cao Cao the latter laughed saying As I am the Minister of Han so am I HanI grant that Zhang Liao then spoke of provision due to their rank and security from molestation for the ladies to which Cao Cao replied I will give them twice the regular amount for an Uncle of the Emperor as for securing them from molestation that is simpleThe ordinary domestic law is enoughWhy should there be any doubt Then said Zhang Liao Whenever he shall get news of the whereabouts of Liu Bei he must go to him At this Cao Cao shook his head saying Then I am merely to feed Guan Yu what is the use of thisI cannot consent Zhang Liao replied You must know of Yu Rangs saying the difference in behavior brought about by difference of treatmentLiu Bei treats Guan Yu just kindly and liberally you can surely engage Guan Yus heart and support by being kinder and more liberal What you say is much to the pointI will grant the three conditions said Cao CaoWhereupon Zhang Liao left to carry the news to Guan Yu still on the summit of the Tushan MountainsNow I expect the army to withdraw so that I may enter the city to tell the two ladies what has been arrangedAfter that I submit at once Zhang Liao rode back once more with this request and the order was given for the army to retire three milesDo not do this said Xun Yu I fear treachery He will certainly not break faith said Cao CaoHe is too high principled The army retired and Guan Yu with his force reentered the city of Xiapi where he saw that the people were following their ordinary avocations in tranquillityHe came to the palace and went in to see the two ladies who hastened to meet himHe bowed to them below the steps and said I apologize for having caused you to feel alarmed Where is the Uncle asked theyI know not whither he has gone What do you intend to do BrotherinLaw I went out of the city to try a last battleI was surrounded on a hill top and Zhang Liao has urged me to yield I proposed three conditions all of which were conceded and the enemy drew off to allow me to return to the cityUnless I have your decision SistersinLaw I scarcely dare to take any final step They asked what were the conditions and were toldLady Gan said When Cao Caos army came in we took it to mean certain deathBut it is scarcely credible that not a hair of our heads has been disturbed not a soldier has dared enter our doorsYou have accepted the conditions BrotherinLaw and there is no need to ask our consentOur only fear is that he will not let you go by and by to search for the Uncle SistersinLaw you need not be anxiousI will see to that You must decide everything and need not ask us Guan Yu withdrew and then with a small escort went to his interview with Cao CaoCao Cao came to the outermost gate to welcome him and Guan Yu dismounted and made obeisanceCao Cao returned his salute with the greatest cordialityThe leader of a defeated army is grateful for the graciousness that has preserved his life said Guan YuI have so long admired your loyalty and high principles that this happy meeting gratifies the desire of my whole life replied Cao CaoAs the Prime Minister has granted the three requests which my friend petitioned for on my behalf there is now but little to discuss said Guan YuAs I have spoken so be it I could not break faith replied Cao CaoWhenever I hear where Uncle Liu Bei is I must certainly go to him even if through fire and water It may be that there will be no time nor opportunity of saying farewellI trust you will understand the reason If Liu Bei should prove to be alive you must certainly be allowed to go to himBut I fear that in the confusion he may have lost his lifeYou may set your mind at rest and let me make inquiries Guan Yu thanked him Then a banquet was prepared in Guan Yus honorNext day the army started on its homeward marchFor the journey to the capital a carriage was prepared for the two ladies and Guan Yu was its guardOn the road they rested at a certain post station and Cao Cao anxious to compromise Guan Yu by beguiling him into forgetfulness of his duty assigned Guan Yu to the same apartment as his sistersinlawGuan Yu stood the whole night before the door with a lighted candle in his hand Not once did he yield to fatigueCao Caos respect for him could not but increaseAt the capital the Prime Minister assigned a dignified residence to Guan Yu which he immediately divided into two enclosures the inner one for the two ladies and the other for himself He placed a guard of eighteen of his veterans over the womens quartersGuan Yu was presented to Emperor Xian who conferred upon him the rank of General Who Serves the HansGuan Yu expressed his thanks to the EmperorNext day Cao Cao made a great banquet inviting all his advisers and officers solely in honor of Guan Yu who sat in the seat of honorBeside this Guan Yu received presents of silks and gold and silver vessels all of which Guan Yu sent into the ladies quarters for their use and keepingIn fact from the day of arrival in the capital Guan Yu was treated with marked respect and distinction small banquets following each other in each three days and large banquets held in each five daysCao Cao also presented him with ten most lovely serving girls Guan Yu sent these also within to wait upon his two sistersinlawEvery third day Guan Yu went to the door of the womens quarters to inquire after their welfare and then they asked if any news of the wanderer had come This ceremony closed with the wordsBrotherinLaw you may retire when you wish Cao Cao heard of this extremely correct behavior and thought all the more of the man for itOne day Cao Cao noticed that the robe Guan Yu was wearing was old and frayed Taking his measurements Cao Cao had a new one made of fine brocade and presented it to himGuan Yu took it and put it on under the old robe so that the latter covered itWhy so very thrifty laughed Cao CaoIt is not thrift was his replyThe old robe was a gift from my brother and I wear it because it reminds me of himI could not allow the new gift to eclipse his old one How very high principled said Cao Cao sighingOne day when Guan Yu was at home there came a messenger to say that the two women had thrown themselves on the ground and were weeping They would not say whyGuan Yu set his dress in order went over and knelt by the door saying Why this grief SistersinLaw Lady Gan replied In the night I dreamed that the Uncle had fallen into a pit I woke up and told Lady Mi and we think he must be deadSo we weep Dreams are not to be credited he repliedYou dreamed of him because you were thinking of himPray do not grieve Just then Guan Yu was invited to another banquet so he took leave of the ladies and wentSeeing Guan Yu looked sad and tearful his host asked the reasonMy sistersinlaw have been weeping for my brother and I cannot help being sad in sympathy Cao Cao smiled and tried to cheer up his guestCao Cao plied Guan Yu with wine so that Guan Yu became quite intoxicated and sat stroking his beard and saying What a useless thing am II could do no service for my country and I have parted from my elder brother How many hairs in your beard suddenly asked his hostSome hundreds perhapsIn the autumn a few fall out but in the winter it is fullest Then I use a black silk bag to keep the hairs from being broken replied Guan YuCao Cao had a bag made for him to protect his beard
