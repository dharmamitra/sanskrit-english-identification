Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my selfThis is the sort of view I haveSo householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressYou thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stressVenerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my selfHaving seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present I also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is presentWhen this was said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for wordsAnathapindika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashedat a loss for words got up  went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entirety of his conversation with the wanderersWell done householderWell doneThat is how you should periodically  righteously refute those foolish men Then he instructed urged roused and encouraged Anathapindika the householder with a talk on DhammaWhen Anathapindika the householder had been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on Dhamma he got up from his seat and having bowed down to the Blessed One left keeping the Blessed One on his right sideNot long afterward the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks even a monk who has long penetrated the Dhamma in this Dhamma  Vinaya would do well periodically  righteously to refute the wanderers of other persuasions in just the way Anathapindika the householder has doneMany of the passages describing the rewards of stream entry focus on the streamenterers fate after death Heshe will never be reborn on a plane lower than the human and will tend to experience exceptional happiness wherever rebornAs for the number of rebirths remaining for the streamenterer before total Unbinding the texts distinguish three levels of attainment with the wasting away of the three fetters are oneseeders After taking rebirth only one more time on the human plane they will put an end to stressOr not breaking through to that not penetrating that with the wasting away of the three fetters they are familytofamilyers After transmigrating  wandering on through two or three more families they will put an end to stressOr not breaking through to that not penetrating that with the wasting away of the three fetters they are seventimesatmosters After transmigrating  wandering on among devas  human beings they will put an end to stressA disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is a streamwinner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningFurthermore a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is linked with long life human or divine is linked with beauty human or divine is linked with happiness human or divine is linked with status human or divine is linked with influence human or divineI tell you this Nandaka not having heard it from any other contemplative or brahmanInstead I tell you this having known seen and realized it for myselfWhen this was said a certain man said to Nandaka the chief minister of the Licchavis It is now time for your bath sirEnough I say with this external bathI am satisfied with this internal bath confidence in the Blessed OneThe Canon often places great importance on the power of the last mental state before death in determining ones future plane of existenceHowever the power of stream entry is so great that it can overcome even a muddled state of mind at death ensuring that the next rebirth will be a good oneAs he was sitting there Mahanama the Sakyan said to the Blessed One Lord this Kapilavatthu is rich  prosperous populous  crowded its alleys congestedSometimes when I enter Kapilavatthu in the evening after visiting with the Blessed One or with the monks who inspire the mind I meet up with a runaway elephant a runaway horse a runaway chariot a runaway cart or a runaway personAt times like that my mindfulness with regard to the Blessed One gets muddled my mindfulness with regard to the Dhamma the Sangha gets muddledThe thought occurs to me If I were to die at this moment what would be my destinationWhat would be my future course Have no fear MahanamaHave no fearYour death will not be a bad one your demise will not be badIf ones mind has long been nurtured with conviction nurtured with virtue nurtured with learning nurtured with generosity nurtured with discernment then when the body  endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother  father nourished with rice  porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution  dispersion  is eaten by crows vultures hawks dogs hyenas or all sorts of creatures nevertheless the mind  long nurtured with conviction nurtured with virtue learning generosity  discernment  rises upward and separates outSuppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water where it would breakThere the shards  jarfragments would go down while the ghee or oil would rise upward and separate outIn the same way if ones mind has long been nurtured with conviction nurtured with virtue nurtured with learning nurtured with generosity nurtured with discernment then when the body is eaten by crows vultures hawks dogs hyenas or all sorts of creatures nevertheless the mind rises upward and separates outA wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones when endowed with these four qualities has no terror no trepidation no fear at death with regard to the next lifeThen there is the case of the person who has no doubt or perplexity who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True DhammaThen he comes down with a serious diseaseAs he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him I have no doubt or perplexityI have arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma He doesnt grieve isnt tormented doesnt weep beat his breast or grow deliriousThis too is a person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathJust as its not easy to take the measure of the water in the great ocean as just this many pails of water or hundreds of pails of water or thousands of pails of water or hundreds of thousands of pails of water Its reckoned simply as a great mass of water that is unreckonable immeasurableIn the same way when a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with these four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness its not easy to take the measure of the merit as just this much bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss heavenly ripening in bliss leading to heaven leading to what is agreeable pleasing charming happy  beneficial Its reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that is unreckonable immeasurableMonks even though a wheelturning emperor having exercised sovereign lordship over the four continents on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the good destination the heavenly world in the company of the devas of the Thirtythree and enjoys himself there in the Nandana grove surrounded by a consort of nymphs supplied and endowed with the five strings of heavenly sensual pleasure still  because he is not endowed with four qualities  he is not freed from hell not freed from the animal womb not freed from the realm of hungry ghosts not freed from the plane of deprivation the bad destinations the lower realmsAnd even though a disciple of the noble ones lives off lumps of almsfood and wears ragrobes still  because he is endowed with four qualities  he is freed from hell freed from the animal womb freed from the realm of hungry ghosts freed from the plane of deprivation the bad destinations the lower realmsAnd what are the fourThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One unwavering confidence in the Dhamma unwavering confidence in the Sangha Heshe is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones Heshe is endowed with these four qualitiesAnd between the gaining of the four continents and the gaining of these four qualities the gaining of the four continents is not equal to one sixteenth of the gaining of these four qualitiesThen the Blessed One picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks What do you think monksWhich is greater the little bit of dust I have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earthThe great earth is far greater lordThe little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothingIts not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  this little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail  when compared with the great earthIn the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering  stress totally ended  extinguished is far greaterThat which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing its not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of sufferingThats how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monksThats how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eyeSuppose monks that there were a pond fifty leagues wide fifty leagues long  fifty leagues deep filled to overflowing with water so that a crow could drink from it and a man would draw some water out of it with the tip of a blade of grassWhat do you thinkWhich would be greater the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass or the water in the pondThe water in the pond would be far greater lordThe water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass would be next to nothingIt wouldnt be a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass  when compared with the water in the pondSuppose monks that the great ocean were to go to extinction to its total end except for two or three drops of waterWhat do you thinkWhich would be greater the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total end or the two or three remaining drops of waterLord the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total end would be far greaterThe two or three remaining drops of water would be next to nothingThey wouldnt be a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  the two or three remaining drops of water  when compared with the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total endIn the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering  stress totally ended  extinguished is far greaterThat which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing its not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of sufferingThats how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monksThats how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eyeNot all of the rewards of stream entry concern ones fate at deathMany of them pertain also to the hereandnowThen Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him When for a disciple of the noble ones five forms of fear  animosity are stilled when he is endowed with the four factors of stream entry and when through discernment he has rightly seen  rightly ferreted out the noble method then if he wants he may state about himself Hell is ended animal wombs are ended the state of the hungry ghosts is ended states of deprivation destitution the bad bourns are endedI am a streamwinner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningNow which five forms of danger  animosity are stilledWhen a person takes life then with the taking of life as a requisite condition he produces fear  animosity in the here  now produces fear  animosity in future lives experiences mental concomitants of pain  despair but when he refrains from taking life he neither produces fear  animosity in the here  now nor does he produce fear  animosity in future lives nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain  despair for one who refrains from taking life that fear  animosity is thus stilledWhen a person steals engages in illicit sex tells liesWhen a person drinks distilled  fermented drinks that cause heedlessness then with the drinking of distilled  fermented drinks that cause heedlessness as a requisite condition he produces fear  animosity in the here  now produces fear  animosity in future lives experiences mental concomitants of pain  despair but when he refrains from drinking distilled  fermented drinks that cause heedlessness he neither produces fear  animosity in the here  now nor does he produce fear  animosity in future lives nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain  despair for one who refrains from drinking distilled  fermented drinks that cause heedlessness that fear  animosity is thus stilledThese are the five forms of fear  animosity that are stilledThese are the five rewards of conviction in a lay personWhich fiveWhen the truly good people in the world show compassion they will first show compassion to people of conviction and not to people without convictionWhen visiting they first visit people of conviction and not people without convictionWhen accepting gifts they will first accept those from people with conviction and not from people without convictionWhen teaching the Dhamma they will first teach those with conviction and not those without convictionA person of conviction on the breakup of the body after death will arise in a good destination the heavenly worldThese are the five rewards of conviction in a lay personJust as a large banyan tree on level ground where four roads meet is a haven for the birds all around even so a lay person of conviction is a haven for many people monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followersAlthough it would be pleasant to conclude this study guide with the above passages of encouragement we would probably do better to follow the example of the Buddha who directed his last words to his streamenterer disciples encouraging them not to rest content with the rewards awaiting them but to maintain instead an attitude of heedfulnessThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Now then monks I exhort you All fabrications are subject to decayBring about completion through heedfulness Those were the Tathagatas last wordsAnd what is heedfulnessThere is the case where a monk guards his mind with regard to effluents and qualities accompanied by effluentsWhen his mind is guarded with regard to effluents and qualities accompanied by effluents the faculty of conviction goes to the culmination of its developmentThe faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment goes to the culmination of its developmentAnd how Nandiya does a disciple of the noble ones live heedlesslyThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One Content with that unwavering confidence in the Awakened One he does not exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by nightFor him living thus heedlessly there is no joyThere being no joy there is no raptureThere being no rapture there is no serenityThere being no serenity he dwells in painWhen pained the mind does not become concentratedWhen the mind is unconcentrated phenomena do not become manifestWhen phenomena are not manifest he is reckoned simply as one who dwells heedlesslyFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma unwavering confidence in the Sangha virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentrationContent with those virtues pleasing to the noble ones he does not exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by nightFor him living thus heedlessly there is no joyThere being no joy there is no raptureThere being no rapture there is no serenityThere being no serenity he dwells in painWhen pained the mind does not become concentratedWhen the mind is unconcentrated phenomena do not become manifestWhen phenomena are not manifest he is reckoned simply as one who dwells heedlesslyAnd how Nandiya does a disciple of the noble ones live heedfullyThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One Not content with that unwavering confidence in the Awakened One he exerts himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by nightFor him living thus heedfully joy arisesIn one who has joy rapture arisesIn one who has rapture the body becomes sereneWhen the body is serene one feels pleasureFeeling pleasure the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind is concentrated phenomena become manifestWhen phenomena are manifest he is reckoned as one who dwells heedfullyFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma unwavering confidence in the Sangha virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentrationNot content with those virtues pleasing to the noble ones he exerts himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by nightFor him living thus heedfully joy arisesIn one who has joy rapture arisesIn one who has rapture the body becomes sereneWhen the body is serene one feels pleasureFeeling pleasure the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind is concentrated phenomena become manifestWhen phenomena are manifest he is reckoned as one who dwells heedfullyAnd what is the individual attained to viewThere is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless but  having seen with discernment  some of his fermentations are ended and he has reviewed  examined with discernment the qualities proclaimed by the TathagataThis is called an individual who is attained to viewRegarding this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulnessWhy is thatPerhaps this venerable one when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing his faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulnessMahanama a discerning lay follower who is diseased in pain severely ill should be reassured by another discerning lay follower with four reassurances Be reassured friend that you are endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One verified confidence in the Dhamma verified confidence in the Sangha virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentrationMahanama when a discerning lay follower who is diseased in pain severely ill has been reassured by another discerning lay follower with these four reassurances he should be asked Friend are you concerned for your mother  father If he should say I am he should be told You my dear friend are subject to deathIf you feel concern for your mother  father youre still going to dieIf you dont feel concern for your mother  father youre still going to dieIt would be good if you abandoned concern for your mother  fatherIf he should say My concern for my mother  father has been abandoned he should be asked Friend are you concerned for your wife  children If he should say I am he should be told You my dear friend are subject to deathIf you feel concern for your wife  children youre still going to dieIf you dont feel concern for your wife  children youre still going to dieIt would be good if you abandoned concern for your wife  childrenIf he should say My concern for my wife  children has been abandoned he should be asked Friend are you concerned for the five strings of human sensuality If he should say I am he should be told Friend divine sensual pleasures are more splendid  more refined than human sensual pleasuresIt would be good if having raised your mind above human sensual pleasures you set it on the Devas of the Four Great KingsIf he should say My mind is raised above human sensual pleasures and is set on the Devas of the Four Great Kings he should be told Friend the Devas of the Thirtythree are more splendid  more refined than the Devas of the Four Great KingsIt would be good if having raised your mind above the Devas of the Four Great Kings you set it on the Devas of the ThirtythreeIf he should say My mind is raised above the Devas of the Four Great Kings and is set on the Devas of the Thirtythree he should be told Friend the Devas of the Hours are more splendid  more refined than the Devas of the Thirtythree the Contented Devas are more splendid  more refined than the Devas of the Hours the Devas Delighting in Creation are more splendid  more refined than the Contented Devas the Devas Wielding Power over the Creations of Others are more splendid  more refined than the Devas Delighting in Creation the Brahma world is more splendid and more refined than the Devas Wielding Power over the Creations of OthersIt would be good if having raised your mind above the Devas Wielding Power over the Creations of Others you set it on the Brahma worldIf he should say My mind is raised above the Devas Wielding Power over the Creations of Others and is set on the Brahma world he should be told Friend even the Brahma world is inconstant impermanent included in selfidentityIt would be good if having raised your mind above the Brahma world you brought it to the cessation of identityIf he should say My mind is raised above the Brahma worlds and is brought to the cessation of identity then I tell you Mahanama there is no difference  in terms of release  between the release of that lay follower whose mind is released and the release of a monk whose mind is releasedTherefore Dighavu when you are established in these four factors of stream entry you should further develop six qualities conducive to clear knowingRemain focused on inconstancy in all fabrications percipient of stress in what is inconstant percipient of notself in what is stressful percipient of abandoning percipient of dispassion percipient of cessationThats how you should train yourselfThe sixteen talks translated here are actually reconstructions of Ajaan Lees talks made by one of his followers  a nun Arun Abhivanna  based on notes she made while listening to him teachWith a few exceptions  the talks dated and which were printed after Ajaan Lees death  all were checked and approved by Ajaan Lee and printed in a volume entitled The Way to Practice Insight Meditation Collected from Four Years Sermons or Four Years Sermons for shortThe entire volume runs to more than pages in the Thai original the first half consisting of aphorisms and short passages the second half of reconstructions some fairly fragmentary others more completeThe selection here consists of all the reconstructions in Four Years Sermons that deal directly with the techniques of breath meditation plus a number of passages dealing with the values underlying its practiceTo read these talks is in effect to eavesdrop on Ajaan Lee while he is teaching other peopleThis point is worth bearing in mindAjaan Lees remarks are directed at people whose background preconceptions and experiences in the practice may or may not coincide with our ownFor this reason his comments should be read selectivelyIn particular his descriptions of the breath sensations in the body and how to deal with them touch on a matter very subjective and subject to changeThe way these sensations are experienced varies widely from person to person and even with the same person can change radically with timeFor a someone with a Western background Ajaan Lees explanations of these sensations will sound strangeThey are based partly on Thai physiology which unlike Western physiology describes physical processes as they feel from the inside in terms of their four basic properties rather than as they can be measured from the outsideSince in meditation we are exploring the body and mind from the inside we would do well to familiarize ourselves with this approach and not dismiss it for its strangenessIn any event Ajaan Lees comments are best read as food for thought  pointing out an area to be explored suggesting various ways to understand and deal with it  and not as hard and fast rulesMeditation is an art and a skill to be mastered by using ones own powers of discernment sensitivity and observation while practicing it and not by adhering blindly to any set system of instructionsAnother aspect of these talks that deserves comment is the frequent use of Pali words and phrasesFor many readers they will be unfamiliar for Ajaan Lees listeners though they were notThey come mostly from chants that many Thai Buddhists  lay and ordained  repeat daily or that monks chant at ceremonies in monasteries and homesFor many Thai Buddhists the chants and the terms are Buddhism and so Ajaan Lee makes reference to them to show that they reveal their true meanings only when related to the experience of the practiceFor the reader unfamiliar with these terms I have provided a glossary explaining the more important ones at the end of the collectionThe remaining terms can be adequately understood from their context or if not passed over as stylistic devices  of interest to people already acquainted with them but by no means necessary for understanding the meaning of what is being saidI hope that these obstacles to eavesdropping on Ajaan Lee will not be deterrent for the talks included here are among those that I personally have found most useful and inspiring my own practice and my hope is that others will find them useful in theirsOn February Khun Nai Thawngmuan Siasakun invited Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo to deliver a sermon for Khun Thao Satyanurak in Nekkhamma House Wat BoromnivasThis sermon  which Khun Thao Satya listened to quietly with her hands folded in respect as she lay on her sickbed  was the last sermon she ever heardWhen it was over I approached her and said If you die Id like to jot down this sermon and have it printed to distribute at your funeral She smiled with her eyes nodded slightly to show her approval and asked Can you remember it all Not all of it  I answered but at least some of it So she reviewed a few of the points for meShe seemed delighted and moved by the taste of the Dhamma all the while she spokeThus I have written out this summary of what I can remember of the sermon Now I will discuss a point from the Buddhas teachings for you to listen to briefly as a means of fostering strength of body and strength of mindAll of us live in dependence on strength of body and strength of mindWithout these two things life couldnt lastStrength of body no matter how much we may foster it with the four necessities and with worldly wealth cant help but waste away and vanish by its very natureIt cant escape from aging illness and deathAnd for strength of body to exist it needs help from strength of mindBut strength of mind doesnt need to depend on the four necessities or worldly wealth and it doesnt need to depend on strength of body at allIt can get along solely on Noble Wealth So strength of mind is more important than strength of bodyPeople who dont have enough strength of their own have to start out by hoping to depend on others until they reach the point where they can stand on their ownIn depending on others we have to be careful in choosing a good mainstay in line with the Pali phrase asevana ca balanam panditanañca sevana We have to choose good people to associate withIf we associate with wise people and sages theyll teach us to be goodIf we associate with fools well suffer for itSo searching for a mainstay of this sort doesnt rank as being really good because its like shooting a bird We might hit it on the wing or on the tailIf we really want to be right on target we have to depend on another sort of mainstay atta hi attano natho we have to depend on ourselvesThis sort of mainstay the Lord Buddha praised as being the highest because it will teach us to have a sense of our own good and bad actions  kammassakomhi  and we wont need to go pinning our hopes on other people any moreTo create this sort of mainstay we have to develop five qualities  conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  which are called bala or strengths that will help give us the strength of mind to stride toward the goodAll five of these qualities can be gathered under the headings of virtue concentration and discernmentConviction comes under virtue persistence mindfulness and concentration come under concentration and discernment is discernmentTo have conviction is tantamount to having wealthVirtue is like a white cloth that enwraps the body and makes it beautiful just as the petals of a lotus enwrap the scent of its pollenVirtue is the act of abandoning that cuts away evil and corruption from our deeds so that our deeds will be honest and uprightThis is virtue but its not the ultimate goodWhen our body has virtue our mind needs rectitude to go with itPersistence means diligence determination perseverance being audacious and unrelenting in what we do so as to be strong in progressing toward what is goodMindfulness means care and restraint to make sure that our thoughts words and deeds dont go off the mark being conscious of good and evil so that our behavior doesnt fall into ways that are bad and unwiseConcentration means keeping the mind firmly centered in a single object  the direct path  not letting it tip lean or waver under the influence of its preoccupations whether good or bad past or future keeping the mind honest and uprightAll three of these qualities form the rectitude of the mind that abstains from thoughts of sensuality illwill and harmThis is termed the intention of renunciation The mind isnt pleased or displeased with sensual moods or sensual objects whether good or badThis is a mind gone forth from the home lifeWhether or not we ordain whether we live at home or in a monastery were classed as having gone forthThe next quality which the Buddha classed as the highest good is discernmentOnce we have virtue and concentration discernment will arise from the mind in the first second third and fourth levels of jhanaThis is the light of discernment that enables us to see the Dhamma both within us and withoutWe can see ourself from both sidesWe can see that the aspect that takes birth takes birth and that there is also an aspect that doesnt take birthThe aspect that ages ages and there is also an aspect that doesnt ageThe aspect thats ill is ill and there is also an aspect that isnt illThe aspect that dies dies and the aspect that doesnt die doesnt dieThis is changeoflineage knowledge which sees both sides like having two eyesWhichever side we look at we can see but we arent stuck on either sideWe simply know things in line with their nature as fashionings that they have to take birth age grow ill and dieThese four facts have made arahants of the many people who have contemplated them and seen their true nature clearly to the point of working free from unawarenessThe nature of the body is that it flows in one direction  toward decay  but the mind wont flow along with itThe mind is sure to progress in line with its strengthWhoever has a lot of strength will go farWhoever gets stuck on birth will have to take birthWhoever gets stuck on aging will have to ageWhoever gets stuck on illness will have to be illWhoever gets stuck on dying will have to dieBut whoever isnt stuck on birth aging illness and death is bound for a state that doesnt take birth doesnt age doesnt grow ill and doesnt dieWhen we can do this were said to have found a hunk of Noble Wealth in birth aging illness and deathWe neednt fear povertyEven though the body may age our mind doesnt ageIf the body is going to grow ill and die let it grow ill and die but our mind doesnt grow ill our mind doesnt dieThe mind of an arahant is such that even if someone were to break his head open his mind wouldnt be painedWhen the mind is involved with the world its bound to meet with collisions and once it collides it will be shaken and roll back and forth just as round stones in a large pile roll back and forthSo no matter how good or bad other people may be we dont store it up in our mind to give rise to feelings of like or dislikeDismiss it completely as being their business and none of oursThe five Hindrances are five diseases that fasten on and eat into the mind leaving it thin and famishedWhoever has concentration reaching deep into the heart will be able to kill off all five of these diseasesSuch a person is sure to be full in body and mind  free from hunger poverty and want  and wont have to go asking for goodness from anyoneThe results well receive are Well make ourselves rich in Noble WealthIf the Buddha were still alive hed be sure to be pleased just as a parent whose child is wealthy and selfsufficient can stop being anxious and thus sleep in peaceTo summarize Worldly wealth is what fosters strength of body Noble Wealth is what fosters strength of mindSo I ask that we all put this teaching into practice training ourselves and polishing our thoughts words and deeds so that theyre worthy and pure reaching the stage of Noble Wealth which is the path to the highest happiness nibbanaThe mind the Buddha said is like goldAn impure mind is like gold adulterated with various minerals that will make it hard and unmalleableBefore it can be put to use in any way it first has to be melted down and its impurities  the various adulterations  removed completelyOnly then will it be genuine gold soft and malleableOur mind which is adulterated with various preoccupations first has to be put into shape and its impurities  its various defilements  completely removedOnly then will it be a pure mind becoming a thing of supreme power and usefulness like genuine gold malleable enough to be melted and poured into anything at allA pure mind can pour around the world without getting snagged and can roll all around itself like a bead of water on a lotus leaf which will roll around without seeping into the leafThis is what is meant by a mind that is DhammaOr you might compare a pure mind to genuine beeswax which doesnt need fire in order to meltNo matter how large or small a lump it may be all it needs is a little sunlight or just the warmth of your hand and it will be soft and malleable enough for you to form it into any shape at allA pure mind can be put to every sort of use in line with your aspirations in just the same wayThis is why the Buddha taught that every sort of achievement depends completely on the power of the mindThings that are genuine or pure even though they may be small can give rise to enormous results just as a piece of genuine paper money  a tiny little slip of paper with the state seal  can be put to use in all sorts of waysBut if its newsprint even a bushel of it wouldnt be able to buy a thingIn the same way a pure mind  even if we can make it pure for only a little while  can give results way in excess of its sizePeople who are really intent on purifying the mind may even lift themselves over and beyond the worldSo were taught that people whose minds arent pure  regardless of whether theyve given donations or observed precepts by the tens or hundreds of thousands  may not escape going to hellAt best they may make it back only as human beingsA mind adulterated with bad preoccupations will have to go to a bad bournA mind adulterated with good preoccupations is bound for a good bourn as a heavenly beingA pure mind though will go above and beyond all thisFor this reason you should focus on watching only your mindDont let your attention go leaking out your ears eyes nose tongue or bodyIf the mind is murky make it clearKeep trying to chase away its various preoccupations until theyre completely gone leaving only the genuine gold a pure mindSet your heart on doing it right nowJust as we have to give rise to goodness in our actions we have to give rise to goodness in our minds by letting go of physical and mental phenomena which are a heavy loadThis is why the Buddha taught bhara have pañcakkhandha The five khandhas are truly a burden The body is heavier than rockHow is it heavyIts bigWeightyEnormousIts mouth can eat cattle by the herd rice by the ton and yet never be full for a secondYou have to keep finding things to stuff in it all the time which is a burden to the heartWeve been shoring up this body ever since we were little and red so that it will stay with us and yet it wont stayWhat does stay is nothing more than scrapsWhats good leaves us completelyDont go thinking that itll stayThe part thats left loads us down creating stress and painSo were taught to let goCaga Relinquish whats outside ie the body and let go of whats in the mind ie its various preoccupations that follow along with the worldIf we can let go of these things well be light in body and mindAnd when were light in this way we can be at our easeThen we can consider further that all these things fall under the truths of the worldThat is theyre inconstant stressful and notselfThey make us misconstrue everything just as when we let ourselves get duped into spending our moneyThere are people for instance who make sugar water with various colors for us to drink at or cents a glassActually its no different from the ordinary water we drink but we have it all misconstrued and think that its something special  so well come back to spend more money to drink it againThis is inconstancyIts like waves that keep rising and falling causing us to waver keeping us from being still and at peaceWhen we see this we should incline our hearts toward being trained in the DhammaA person who lets the mind be defiled is like someone who lets his children play in the mud Theyre bound to cause hardships for their parents and not only that theyre bound to cause hardships for themselves because they have no livelihood no basis for setting themselves up in lifeSo we should train our hearts to be adults in order to outgrow our defilements and corruptionsWe shouldnt let ourselves get tied up in worldly affairs because theyre good only from age toFrom that point on our mouth gets smaller and smaller our eyes get so small we can scarcely open themWhatever we say doesnt get past our lipsOur hands get so small that we have to give them a onemeter extension called a cane Our back gets crooked  and with the body sure to run down like this what are we going to want out of itIts enough to make you heartsickSo we should develop whats good and becoming within ourselvesDevelop goodness into a Noble TreasureIn other words relinquishment and virtue are two things we should foster in our hearts so that we can begin to grow up unfold and go beyond being childrenOnce weve reached the middle of life things start getting shorter and shorter so were taught not to be complacentWhatever will give rise to knowledge we should stir ourselves to pursue like a child who studies math without playing truant or thinking only of fun and gamesSuch a child is sure to have a high level of knowledge in the futurePeople in this world  even though they may be years old  if they stay sunk in worldly matters are still childrenRelinquishment and virtue Once we give rise to these things were headed for adulthoodOtherwise were still childrenSo we shouldnt let the heart settle on things that arent good for itSometimes there are both good and bad thingsThe good things are hard to latch onto the bad are easyIf we give our children free rein to go playing theyll for the most part bring us nothing but troubleSometimes they hang around doing nothing at all and yet come back with other peoples belongings in their pocketsIn other words sometimes other people do something and yet we let it get stuck in our heartsThis is being infantileOur minds are a mess of defilements which is why were said to be childrenSo we should consider things carefullyWhatever will benefit us we should take an interest inIf a poor person wanders shiftlessly about nobody pays any mind but if a rich person behaves that way people really despise itIn other words we shouldnt let our hearts go lurking about in shoddy or unwise preoccupationsWe have to practice tranquillity meditation to make the mind stillThats when well begin to enter adulthoodWhen the mind is still it gradually gives rise to discernment just as a kerosene lantern we keep looking after  adding kerosene making sure that nothing disturbs the flame  is bound to grow brightThe wick is the breath the theme of our meditationThe effort we make is like the keroseneWe keep looking after the mind making sure that the various preoccupations coming in by way of the eyes ears nose and so forth dont collide with the heartThe mind will become bright and dazzling like the wick of a kerosene lantern that we keep fed with fuel and whose burnt parts we keep scraping awayIf liberating insight arises well see the absolute truth  that all our preoccupations are inconstant stressful and notself  appearing in our heartWhen we can see things clearly in this way well be able to let go of our various preoccupationsThe mind will give rise to a brilliant radiance  termed dhammo pajjoto the light of the Dhamma  and well attain to the transcendency of the mindWhen we reach this point thats when were said to have grown upWe can go wherever we like for no one will be able to pull the wool over our eyes Wat BoromnivasThe Dhamma in one sense is a means of nourishing the heart to make it pureIn another sense the Dhamma is ourselfEvery part of our body is a piece of the world and the world is an affair of the DhammaBut its not the essence of the DhammaThe essence of the Dhamma lies with the heartThe development of all that is good and worthwhile comes from our own thoughts words and deedsThe good that comes from our words and deeds such as the development of charity and virtue is goodness on the crude and intermediate levelsThe refined level goodness developed by means of the heart is meditationFor this reason the issues of the heart are the most important things we must learn to understandThere are two issues to the heart the aspect of the heart that takes birth and dies and the aspect of the heart that doesnt take birth and doesnt dieIf the heart falls for fashionings its bound to take birth and die repeatedlyBut the heart that truly sees and clearly knows all fashionings can then let go of them and thus wont take birth and wont dieIf we want to go beyond suffering and stress  not to take birth and not to die  then we first have to learn the true nature of fashionings so that we can understand themFashionings as they appear in actuality are of two sorts fashionings on the level of the world and fashionings on the level of the DhammaBoth sorts have their reality but theyre things that arise and then decayThis is why the Buddha said anicca vata sankhara  which means All fashionings are inconstant  because both sorts of these fashionings begin by arising then change and finally disbandWhoever can focus in to know clearly and truly see this condition curb the mind and become wise to all fashionings is sure to gain release from all suffering and stressFashionings on the level of the world are things that people create and conjure into being such as wealth status pleasure and praiseAs for fashionings on the level of the Dhamma whether or not we dress them up we all have them in equal measure  in other words properties khandhas and sense mediaFashionings on the level of the world and of the Dhamma are like the changing colors on a movie screenThey flicker and flash GreenRedYellowWhiteChanging back and forthWhen we watch our eyes have to change along with them to follow them  and this is what gives rise to misunderstandingsWhen the mind fastens on tight to these fashionings it gives rise to feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfactionWhen they change for good or bad our mind changes along with them  and so it falls into the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfFrom another point of view fashionings can be divided into two sorts those with a mind in possession such as people or animals and those without a mind in possession such as treesBut though this may be the standard interpretation of fashionings without a mind in possession I dont agree with itTake the stairway to this hall If you say that it doesnt have a mind in possession of it try smashing it and see whether or not therell be an uproarThe same holds true with fields  try planting rice in someone elses field  or with banana and other fruit trees planted in an orchard Try hacking them with a knife to see whether or not their owner will have you thrown in jailEverything in the world to which attachment extends has to have a mind in possessionOnly the planet Mars to which the sphere of attachment doesnt yet extend doesnt have a mind in possessionEvery sort of fashioning has a mind in possession  except for arahants who dont have a mind in possession because they arent attached to any fashionings at allAttachment to fashionings is the source of stress because fashionings are inconstant as weve already explainedSo only if we can let go and not be attached to fashionings will we meet with happiness and ease  ease in the sense of the Dhamma ease that is cool quiet solid and unchangingEase in the worldly sense isnt any different from sitting in a chair Only if the chair doesnt wobble will we have any easeThe wobbling of the mind is of two sorts wobbling naturally and wobbling under the influence of intention and its fruitHow many times does the mind wobble in a daySometimes it wobbles from intentions in the present sometimes from intentions in the past but how its wobbling we dont knowThis is avijja the unawareness that causes fashionings  thoughts  to ariseThe other side to all this is nonfashioningWhat is nonfashioningNo wobbling no changing no disbanding Thats nonfashioningFashionings change but our mind doesnt changeFashionings are stress but our mind isnt stressedFashionings are notself but our mind isnt notselfFashionings without a mind in possession Thats nonfashioningMost of us by and large are aware only of the knowledge offered by the Six Teachers  the senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation  which are sources of change uncertainty stress unawareness and fashioningsSo we should close off these senses because fashionings cant see other fashioningsOnly if we get on the other side will we be able to seeThe purpose of sitting and meditating is to cut away the various thoughts that preoccupy our mindsThe more preoccupations we can cut away the lighter well feelAll of the various burdens that weigh down our hearts  all the stresses and strains we feel  will lessen and disappearGoodness doesnt come from conceptsConcepts of past and future are what obstruct and destroy our goodnessThe Buddha saidIf we dont go conceiving the past or the future leaving only the present well come to see the truth of the DhammaConcepts even if they deal with the Dhamma are fashionings because they fall in the area of mental concoctionThere are three types of mental fashionings If we think in ways that are good theyre called meritorious concoctionsIf we think in ways that are evil theyre called demeritorious concoctionsIf we think in ways that are neither good nor evil theyre called impassive concoctions or avyakata  neutral and indeterminateActually aneñjabhisankhara has a higher meaning because it refers to the four levels of absorption in formlessnessAvyakata refers to such things as thinking about eating a meal or taking a bath things that are completely unrelated to good and evilAll of these fashionings come from unawareness and ignoranceIf were really intelligent and aware we shouldnt go conceiving themTo cut off concepts means to let our mental fashionings disband to let our trains of thought disbandWe sit in meditation making the body and mind quietWhen the body is still the mind stays with the stillnessWhen the heart is at peace the mind stays with the peaceConcentration developsThe mind comes up to the forefrontMental fashionings disappear but the mind is still thereGoodness is still thereIn nibbana nothing disappears anywhere or gets annihilated except for unawarenessWhen mental fashionings and unawareness disband awareness arisesFor example knowledge of past lives We see the minds ancestry  its past lifetimesKnowledge of death and rebirth We know the good and bad actions of our fellow beings how they die and are rebornA mind trained to maturity in concentration develops quality like a mature mango seed thats capable of containing all its ancestry its parents and children in itselfIf anyone plants it itll break out into roots stems branches leaves flowers and more fruits just like beforeA mind not yet trained to maturity is like the seed of an unripe mango thats fallen from the treeIf you plant it it wont growItll just rot there in the dirtSince its not yet ripe it isnt capable of containing its ancestry and descendantsPeople aware of their own birth and death in this way are said not to be lackingNot lacking in whatNot lacking in birthTheyre acquainted with the births theyve experienced through many lives and states of being in the past  so many that theyre weary of it all to the point where they dont want to take birth againAs for people who dont know who dont have this awareness they feel that theyre lackingThey want to take birth again and so they keep on creating birth over and over againAs for those who do have awareness theyve had enoughTheyre smart enoughThey wont give rise to any more births or states of beingWhatever is good they keep within themselves like putting a ripe mango seed in a showcase to look at or peeling off its hard outer shell and then putting it in a storeroomNo one will be able to plant it again and we can take it out for a look whenever we wantTo train the mind to a higher level is the apex of all that is good and worthwhileTo raise the level of our heart is like coming up and sitting here in the meditation hallOnce weve gotten up off the level of the ground weve escaped from the rain the heat of the sun and from all sorts of dangersDogs for instance cant jump up to claw us or bite usOr we can make a comparison with a tall mountain topNothing filthy or dirty can stay on a mountain topWhether its rain dew or fog when it comes into contact with the summit it all has to flow down to the lowlands and into the seaIt cant stay and form puddles on the summitAt the same time fresh breezes come blowing from all four directions keeping the mountain top dry and free from dampnessOr we can make a comparison with a tall treetopOrdinarily nobody  human or animal  can urinate or defecate or splash anything dirty on a tall treetopAnd since the treetop is tall its flowers and fruits are born tallAnyone who wants to pick the topmost leaves or destroy the fruits and flowers will have a hard time of it because the height of the tree makes it hard to climbIn the same way once weve fed our heart full with whats good and worthwhile then no matter if people praise or condemn us we wont want anything of what they have to sayIf they say were not good it flows right back to themAs for whats really good within us it stays as it always wasA person whose heart is fed full with whats good and worthwhile is like a person whose stomach is full of food and so is bound to be satisfied and not want to eat anything more free from hunger and cravingNo matter what fantastic food other people may bring him he wont want any of itOr if anyone brings him poison he wont take itIn other words we arent interested in the goodness or evil that comes from other peopleWe want only the goodness that we build up within ourselvesIgnorant people think that good and evil are things we have to get from other people and not that they come from within us  and so they close their eyes and keep on gropingThey have no sense of the good that lies within them like the person who goes groping for a mango tree without realizing that the mango tree lies in its seedOnce we realize this though all we have to do is take the seed and plant it and soon itll sprout roots and become a tree with leaves and branches flowers and fruits that will keep on multiplying into hundreds of treesIn no time at all well be millionaires because mangoes even when theyve grown only to the size of a thumb already begin to fetch a pricePeople buy and sell mangoes from the time theyre still unripe until theyre halfripe fully ripe and even overripeSometimes mangoes that are halfrotten can still get a price although not as much as mangoes that are still goodPeople whose minds havent yet really reached a high level when they meet with criticism will usually keep it and brood over itBy and large we like to think that were intelligent and yet we let our minds feed on bad moods and preoccupationsBad moods are like scraps and bones that other people have spit outIf were really poor and starving to the point where we have to beg others for food we should feed on the good moods they have to offer us which are like food that hasnt been spit out by anyoneBut even then were still counted as poor as stupid and ignorant because even though we have genuine goodness within us we still go running off to gather good and evil from other peopleThis has to be wrongThe right way is that no matter what anyone else may say we let it passWe should view what they say as their property and as none of oursAs for the goodness were developing its bound to stay with usLike eating a wormy mango An intelligent person will eat only the good flesh and leave the spoiled part to the wormsIn other words dont go moving in with the wormsTo be intelligent in this way is to qualify as a human being  which means a highminded being  just as when we come up the stairs to the meditation hall we escape the cats and dogs that would otherwise bother usHere they cant jump up and pounce on usBut if we sit on the ground were exposed to the sun and rain and all sorts of disturbancesWere mixed up with sages and foolsWhen wise people practice the Dhamma they have to be selective and choose only whats goodThey wont let their minds feed on anything spoiled because spoiled things when we feed on them can be toxic and harmfulAs for good things when we eat them they dont cause any harmThey can only benefit usGoodness evil purity  all come from within usThe Buddha thus taught that each of us has his or her own kammaWhat he said on this point is absolutely trueTheres no way you can argue with itKamma means the good and bad actions that come from intentionsIntentions are thoughts that come from the mind so the mind lies at the essence of intention and kamma because the mind is what thinks and gives the ordersWhen an intention is shoddy or dishonest the resulting action is bad kamma and will result in sufferingWhen an intention is good proper and honest the action will be good kamma and will result in pleasureSo whether were to suffer or to experience pleasure to be good or shoddy pure or impure depends on our own actions and intentions not on anything anyone else may do for usOnce we realize this theres no more confusionThe sermon this afternoon was on the theme vijjacaranasampanno sugato lokavidu I didnt listen to the beginningAll I can remember is this The real nature of the Dhamma isnt all that difficult for people who have awareness but it is hard for people who dontIts hard because it goes against our wishesIf it followed our wishes itd be easyThe genuine Dhamma is something that goes against our wishes because good things ordinarily are bound to be that wayIts the nature of things that are beneficial and useful to us that theyre hard and require effortEven worldly things are this wayThings actually beneficial are usually hard to obtainBut as for things of no real use to us theres no need to go to any great trouble to search for themThere are heaps of them right in our own back yardIm referring here to unawareness  ignorance of whats realBut this ignorance of whats real is the wellspring that can give rise to awareness or knowledge of whats realThis knowledge of whats real exists everywhere like water vapor that rises into the atmosphereWhoever has the ingenuity to find it and bring it inwards will feel cool content and refreshedThis is called vijjacaranasampanno which is the opposite of unawarenessSo Id like to explain one more point in the theme vijjacaranasampanno which means Those who really search for the Dhamma are sure to be always giving rise to knowledge within themselvesHere we first have to explain the word dhamma Dhamma is something that exists in each and every one of usIt can be divided into three sorts skillful unskillful and neutralSkillfulness means the goodness that exists naturally whether or not theres a Buddha to point it outThis dhamma is what gives comfort and benefit to living beings in proportion to how much they practice itDont go thinking that goodness comes from having been formulated by the Buddha or that it comes from his teachingsGoodness has been in the world ever since long before the time of the Buddha but no one was really acquainted with it because no sage had been able to identify itBut when the Buddha came and ferreted out awareness itself he was able to see the dhamma that has existed in the world from time immemorialThis sort of dhamma didnt arise from anything he said or taughtIts the goodness that exists naturally in the worldIf this sort of goodness didnt exist as a normal part of the world the human race would have died out long agoThe fact that we have any peace and wellbeing at all comes from our having imbued our hearts with this goodness as we have been able to discover itOtherwise we wouldnt be able to withstand all the fires of worldlinessUnskillfulness The same holds true with evilIt doesnt come from anything the Buddha said or taughtIt exists on its own in the world by its natureBut people who havent thought about it or observed it misunderstand thingsThey think that evil comes from what the Buddha taught and so they dont pay it any attention because they think good and evil were made up by the BuddhaIn this way good and evil get all mixed up together without anyone knowing their truthBut the Buddha was endowed with supreme intelligence and so was able to tell what was unhusked rice what was husked rice what was bran and what was chaffHe then sorted them into separate lots so that people could choose whichever they prefer with the realization that each of us is responsible for his or her own kamma Whoever does good will have to meet with good whoever does evil will have to meet with evilAll dhammas  the good and evil that exist naturally  ultimately come down to the mind right here in this very bodyIts not the case that we have to go searching for them anywhere outsideIf we were to ask where it all came from the Buddha would probably be able to answer us but itd be like hitting the earth with your fistIf we were to ask where the mind comes from wed have to answer that it comes from usAnd where do we come fromFrom our parentsThats as far as wed getIf we were to answer on a different level  one thats more difficult to see and that only people of awareness can manage  wed say that the mind comes from unawarenessAnd what does unawareness come fromFrom mental fashioningsAnd what do mental fashionings come fromFrom unawarenessIts like the old question where does the chicken come fromThe eggAnd the eggFrom the chickenIf we keep asking and answering we simply go around in circles without ever coming to the end of itThis is how things are on the level of the worldThe issues of the mind all boil down to two minds one that likes to do good and one that likes to do evilOne mind but theres two of itSometimes an inclination to do good takes hold of us and so we want to do goodThis is called being possessed by skillfulnessSometimes an inclination to do evil takes hold of us and so we want to do evilThis is called being possessed by unskillfulnessIn this way our mind is kept always unsettled and unsureSo the Buddha taught us to develop our awareness in order to know whats good and worthwhile and whats evil and worthlessIf unawareness obscures our mind we cant see anything clearly just as when haze obscures our eyesightIf our knowledge gets really far up away from the world well have even less chance of seeing anything just as a person who goes up high in an airplane and then looks down below wont be able to see houses or other objects as clearly as when hes standing on the groundThe higher he goes the more everything becomes a hazeHe wont be able to see any sign of human life at allThis is why the Buddha taught us to fill ourselves with as much awareness as possible so that our ears and eyes will be bright and clear unobscured by fog or hazeAwareness of the sort taught by the Buddha can arise in three waysSutamayapañña This is the awareness in which we study and listen to what other people say so that we can understand what evil things will lead us in the direction of suffering and stress and what good things will lead us in the direction of wellbeing and easeOnce we know we can then ask ourselves Do we want to go in the direction of suffering If we answer No we dont because its a hardshipWed rather go in the direction of wellbeing we have to set our hearts on giving rise to goodnessThat goodness is then sure to lead us in the direction of wellbeingFor example some people are born way out in the sticks and yet they train and educate themselves to the point where they end up important and influentialThe same holds true with usIf we train and educate ourselves were all bound to end up as good peopleThis is education on the elementary level  our ABCs  called sutamayapaññaCintamayapañña Once weve learned that certain things are good we should try each of them until we see good results arising within usDont go jumping to any fixed conclusions that this or that has to be good or rightFor example some things may be correct in terms of the Dhamma youve learned but when you try them out they may be wrong in terms of other peoples feelingsSo when were taught something that seems right we should remember itWhen were taught something that seems wrong we should remember itWe then take these things and evaluate them on our own until we give rise to an understandingOnly then can we be called intelligentIn other words we dont simply believe whats in books what other people say or what our teachers tell usBefore we do anything we should consider it carefully until its certain and clear to usOnly then should we go ahead and do itThis is called believing in our own sense of reasonThis is the second level of awareness but its not the highestIt can eliminate only some of the unawareness that exists within usBoth of the levels mentioned so far are awareness on the low levelThe truly high level of awareness is called bhavanamayapaññaThis level of awareness arises in a trained mindThis is what is meant by vijjacaranasampanno sugato lokaviduThe awareness here includes knowledge of ones past lives knowledge of death and rebirth  knowing the mental stream of other people what sort of good and evil theyve done and where they will go after death and knowledge of the end of mental fermentation Whoever develops the mind to the point of Right Concentration giving rise to intuitive insight will be able to let go ofSelfidentificationTheyll see that the body isnt really theirsUncertaintyTheir doubts about the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will be gone for goodTheyll have no more doubts about the paths and their fruitionsThe paths their fruitions and nibbana will have to exist for whoever is true in practicing the Dhamma no matter what the time or seasonThis is termed akaliko The Dhamma gives results no matter what the time or seasonOpanayiko People who give rise to virtue concentration and discernment within themselves are sure to see that the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha can actually ward off insecurity and dreadSuch people will also let go ofAttachment to the formalities of virtueThe virtues of the five precepts will be firmly established in their heartsTo let go in this way is called knowledge of the end of mental fermentation or vijjacaranasampanno  being consummate in knowledge and conductIn addition to these three primary forms of awareness we may also develop clairvoyance clairaudience and psychic powersBut unless we can still our mind in concentration we wont be able to gain any of these forms of awareness even if we study all divisions of the Canon because all of these forms of awareness depend on the stillness of concentrationThe ability to put away all forms of evil depends on the stillness of concentrationWhen awareness arises within us we are sure to see the truth of whats good and whats evilAs long as this awareness doesnt arise were still deluded and gropingFor example we may latch on to the body as being our own or to the five khandhas  sense data feelings labels mental fashionings and consciousness  as being our ownSome people identify themselves with greed anger or delusionFor example when greed arises they identify with the greedWhen anger arises they identify with the angerWhen delusion arises they identify with the delusionBut these things arise only at certain timesSometimes when lack of anger arises these people identify themselves with the lack of angerAnd when lack of greed or delusion arises they identify with the lack of greed or delusion  and so these things get all mixed up because of unawareness or ignorance of the truthBut once weve developed awareness then when greed arises we wont identify with itThe same holds true with anger and delusionThis is a step we have to master so that we can catch sight of how these three defilements actually come and goIn other words when greed comes we sit and keep watch on the greed until it dies of its own accordWell then be able to know exactly what ugly features it has when it comes and exactly how good it is when it goesWe just sit there and watch it until it disbands and well feel an immediate sense of reliefWhen anger or delusion comes we sit and keep watch on the anger or delusion  dont go running off anywhere else  and well be able to see exactly how bad anger is when it comes and how good it is when it goesWhat delusion is like when it comes  no matter which side its going to be deluded about  we make a point of keeping our gaze fixed on itWhen we can hold ourselves in check this way thats awarenessBut if when greed comes we get carried along with the greed or when anger or delusion comes we get carried along with the anger or delusion thats unawarenessIf were constantly on the lookout for these three defilements the day is sure to come when they grow ashamed of themselvesWell know how they arise well see how they take a stance well perceive how they disbandThis is the awareness that comes from unawarenessWhen we can contemplate things in this way well be able to gain all eight forms of cognitive skillIf we can hold ourselves in check in the midst of our defilements without feeling obliged to let them come out in our actions well give rise to awareness withinThis is what is meant by vijjacaranasampannoOur hearts will be pure free from greed anger and delusionSugato lokavidu Well fare well whether we come or go and wherever we stayThis sort of awareness is the real thingIts the awareness that will bring us success in the sphere of the DhammaThere are three important parts to meditating thinking awareness and the breathAll three of these parts have to be kept right together at all timesDont let any one of them come loose from the othersThinking refers to thinking buddho together with the breathAwareness means knowing the breath as it goes in and outOnly when thinking and awareness are kept fastened constantly with the breath can you say that youre meditatingThe inandout breath is the most important part of the bodyIn other words its like the earth which acts as the support for all the various things in the worldIts like the joists or girders that hold up a floor and keep it sturdyIts like a board or a sheet of paper When we think bud with an inbreath its as if we rubbed our hand once across a board and when we think dho with an outbreath its as if we rubbed the board once againEach time we rub the board some of the dust is bound to stick to our hand so if we keep rubbing it back and forth the board is going to become glossyWhen its very glossy itll be so clear that we can see our reflection in itThese are the results that come from our thinkingBut if we go rubbing hitormiss we wont be able to see our reflection even in a mirror much less in a boardIn another sense the breath is like a piece of paperWhen we think bud in with the breath its as if we took a pencil and wrote a letter of the alphabet on a piece of paperIf we keep doing this eventually well be able to read what weve writtenBut if our mind doesnt stay constantly with the breath its as if we wrote sometimes right and sometimes wrongThe letters wed write would be a mess and wouldnt even be lettersNo matter how large our piece of paper might be the whole thing would be a messWe wouldnt be able to read what letters we had written or what they were supposed to sayIf were intent though and think of the breath as a piece of paper well write down whatever message we want on the paper and know for ourselves what weve writtenFor example thinking bud is like taking a pen to our paperItll give us knowledgeEven after weve stopped writing well still benefitBut if were not really intent on our writing our letters wont be lettersIf we draw a picture of a person it wont be a personIf we draw an animal it wont be an animalWhen we start learning to write we have to use chalk because its big easy to write with and easy to eraseThis is like thinking buddho Once we advance in our studies we start using a pencil because its mark is clear and longerlastingFor example the sentence Wheres Dad is a piece of knowledgeIf we can only read the separate letters W or D it doesnt really count as knowledgeSo we then throw away our chalkIn other words we dont have to repeat buddho We use our powers of evaluation to see as were breathing Is the inbreath goodIs the outbreath goodWhat kind of breathing is comfortableWhat kind of breathing isntThen we correct and adjust the breathPick out whichever way of breathing seems good and then observe it to see if it gives comfort to the bodyIf it does keep that sense of comfort steady and put it to useWhen its really good benefits will arise perfecting our knowledgeOnce weve obtained knowledge we can erase the pencil marks in our notebooks because weve seen the benefits that come from what weve doneWhen we go back home we can take our knowledge with us and make it our homeworkWe can do it on our own at home and when we stay at the monastery we can keep at it constantlySo the breath is like a piece of paper the mind is like a person knowledge is like a note Even just this much can serve as our standardIf were intent on just these three things  thinking awareness and the breath  well give rise to knowledge within ourselves that has no fixed limits and cant possibly be told to anyone elseEvery person has both awareness and unawareness like a doctor who has studied various diseases Hes knowledgeable about the diseases hes studied but not about the ones he hasntWe human beings have both darkness and brightnessThe darkness is unawareness the brightness awarenessThe affairs of the world keep spinning around like a wheelWe who live in the world thus have both pleasure and pain in line with worldly conditions  the wheel of rebirthWhenever we spin around and run into the cycle of pain we feel that the world is really narrow and confiningWhenever we spin around and run into the cycle of pleasure we feel that the world is wide and refreshing an inviting place to liveThis happens because we spin along with the world and so we dont really know the world as it actually isOnce we stop spinning though well come to know the ways of the world and the true nature of the DhammaWhenever we run along after the world we cant see the world easilyFor this reason we first have to stop runningThen well see it clearlyIf the world is spinning and were spinning too how can we expect to see itIts like two persons running Theyll have a hard time seeing each others facesIf one stops but the other is running they can see each other somewhat but not clearlyIf theyre both running theyll see each other even less clearlyFor example if were sitting or standing still and someone sneaks up hits us over the head and then runs off well have a hard time catching himIn the same way if we spin around or get involved in the spinning of the world well have even less chance of knowing or seeing anythingThe Dhamma thus teaches us to stop spinning the wheel of rebirth so that we can know the world clearlyWhen an airplane propeller or any bladed wheel is spinning we cant see how many blades it has what shape they are or how fine they areThe faster it spins the less we can see its shapeOnly when it slows down or stops spinning can we see clearly what shape it hasThis is an analogy for the spinning of the currents of the world  the outer world  and for our own spinning we who live in the worldThe outer world refers to the earth in which we liveThe world of fashionings refers to ourself our body and mind which are separate things but have to depend on each other just as the world and people which are separate things have to depend on each otherIf we had a body but not a mind we wouldnt be able to accomplish anythingThe same would be true if we had a mind without a bodySo the mind is like a person dwelling in the worldThe mind is the craftsman the body its work of artThe mind is what creates the bodyIts what creates the worldThe world is something broad and always spinning something hard to see clearlyThis is why the Buddha teaches us to stop spinning after the world and to look only at ourselfThats when well be able to see the worldWe ourself are something small  a fathom long a span thick a cubit wide  except that our belly is bigNo matter how much we eat were never fullWe never have enoughThis stands for the greed of the mind which causes us to suffer from our lack of enough our desires our hungerTo see ourself or to see the world the Buddha teaches us to survey ourself from the head to the feet from the feet to the head just as if were going to plant a tree We have to survey things from the ground on up to the tips of the branchesThe ground stands for the purity of our livelihoodWe have to examine the ground to see if it has any termites or other pests that will destroy the roots of our treeThen we have to add the right amount of fertilizer  not too little not too muchWe have to care for it correctly in line with its sizeFor example how do we observe the five precepts so that theyre pureHow do we observe the eight the ten and the precepts so that theyre pureWhat things should we abstain from doingWhat things should we doThis is called Right LivelihoodIf we attend too much to our physical pleasure we tend not to give rise to virtue like certain kinds of trees that are very healthy with large branches and lush foliage but tend not to bear fruitIf a person eats a lot and sleeps a lot if hes concerned only with matters of eating and sleeping his body will be large and hefty like a tree with a large trunk large branches large leaves but hardly any fruitWe human beings  once our bodies are wellnourished with food  if we then listen to a sermon or sit in meditation tend to get drowsy because were too well nourishedIf we sit for a long time we feel uncomfortableIf we listen to a sermon we dont know whats being said because were sleepyThis ruins our chance to do goodPeople who are too well nourished tend to get lazy sloppy and addicted to pleasureIf they sit in meditation they tend to get numb tired and drowsyThis is why were taught to observe the eight uposatha precepts as a middle pathWe eat only during half of the day only half fullThats enoughThis is called having a sense of moderation with regard to foodWe dont have to load up or compensate for missing the evening mealWe eat just enoughI abstain from eating at the wrong time After noon we dont have to turn to another meal so that the heart wont turn after the worldThis is like giving just enough fertilizer to our treeI abstain from dancing singing and ornamenting the body The Buddha doesnt have us beautify the body with cosmetics and perfumes or ornament it with jewelryThis is like giving our tree just the right amount of waterDont let the soil get waterloggedOtherwise the roots will rotIn other words if we get attached to scents and to beauty of this sort itll make us so infatuated that our virtue will sufferThis is like taking scraps of food and pouring them around the foot of our treeDogs will come to trample over the tree chickens will peck at the leaves and flowers and fire ants will eat into the roots causing our tree to wither or dieAll sorts of complications will come to hassle usI abstain from high and large beds When we lie down to sleep the Buddha doesnt have us use soft mattresses or cushions that are too comfortable because if we have a lot of comfort well sleep a lot and not want to get up to do goodThe results of our concentration practice will be meager and our laziness will grow rampantThis is like caterpillars and worms that burrow throughout the soil Theyll keep whispering to us teaching us all sorts of things until ultimately they tell us to stop doing good  and so we stopThis is like insects crawling up from the ground and eating into our tree climbing higher and higher up until they reach the tiptop branches the mindUltimately when they eat the tips of the branches the tree wont bear flowersWhen it has no flowers it wont bear fruitIn the same way if we lack a sense of moderation in caring for ourself we wont be practicing Right LivelihoodIf we dont have a proper sense of how to nourish and care for the body our conduct will have to degenerateBut if we have a proper sense of how to nourish and care for the body our conduct will have to develop in the direction of purity and the mind will have to develop along with it step by stepThe world has its highs and lows its good and evil and were just like the worldOur body  no matter how much we care for it to make it strong and healthy beautiful and comfortable  will have to be good in some ways and to malfunction in othersWhats important is that we dont let the mind malfunctionDont let it go branching out after its various preoccupationsIf we let the mind go around thinking good and evil in line with its preoccupations it wont be able to advance to a higher levelSo we have to make our tree have a single tip We have to center the mind firmly in a single preoccupationDont let your moods hold sway over the mindWe have to cut off the mind from its preoccupations with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations leaving only a single mental preoccupationLet a preoccupation with whats good and worthwhile arise in the mindDont let any of the forms of mental corruption ariseMental corruption refers to greed for sights sounds smells tastes etc ill will  focusing on this matter or that person as bad and going from there to a desire for retribution leading to a confrontation or to violence wrong views  seeing that doing good doesnt lead to good results for example seeing that being generous observing the precepts or practicing meditation doesnt make a person rich or happy so that we stop doing goodWe have to rid the heart of these three forms of mental corruptionWhen the heart is freed from corruption it will have to enter mental rectitude becoming a worthwhile mind pursuing Right Undertaking in other words meditationIn practicing meditation we really have to be true in our work if we want resultsWe have to be true in our body true in our speech true in our heartOur body has to sit straight and unmoving in a halflotus positionOur speech has to be silent not saying a thingOur heart has to be set straight and still not flitting out after allusions to past or futureIf we can be true in our work in this way well have to succeed and see resultsIf were slipshod and desultory our work wont succeedThis is why were taughtUndertakings that are not left unfinished are a supreme good omenIn practicing meditation the mind is what gives the ordersIn other words we should have a base or a frame of reference contemplating the breath so that it becomes refined  because the more refined something is the higher its valueOur breath sensations are of five sortsThe first are the breath sensations that flow from the head down to the tips of our feetThe second are those that flow from the tips of the feet to the headThese two sorts take turns running back and forth like a rope over a pulley that we pull up and downThe third sort are the breath sensations that flow throughout the bodyThese are the sensations that help ventilate the body receiving our guests  the breath permeating in through the skin  and expelling the inner breath keeping the pure beneficial breath in the body and expelling the harmful breath out through the poresThe fourth sort is the breath in the upper abdomen guarding between the heart lungs and liver on the one hand and the stomach and intestines on the otherIt supports the upper organs so that they dont press down on the lower ones and keeps the lower organs down so that they dont push up and crowd the upper onesThis sort of breath we have to observe in order to see in what way its heavy on the left or right sideThe fifth sort are the breath sensations flowing in the intestines helping to warm the fires of digestion just as if we were steaming fish or other foods to keep them from spoilingWhen our food is cooked it can be of use  like the steam condensing on the lid of a pot  to enrich the blood that nourishes the various parts of the bodyWhichever kind of nourishment should become hair nails teeth skin etc the blood sends to those partsThese breath sensations are always flowing in waves through the intestines to disperse the heat of digestionWhen we eat its like putting food in a pot on the stove and then closing the lidIf theres no ventilation in the pot at all and we simply add fire it wont be long before our stomach is wrecked and our intestines ruined because weve closed the lid so tightly that no air can pass in or out until the heat becomes too strong and burns our food to a crispOur body wont get any benefit from itOn the other hand if the heat is too low our food wont cook throughItll spoil well get an upset stomach and again our body wont get any benefitThese sorts of breath sensations help keep our digestive fires just right for the bodyIf we look at these five sorts of breath sensations in the correct way were sure to reap two sorts of results In terms of the body those of us with many diseases will have fewer diseases those of us with few diseases may recover completelyDiseases that havent yet arisen will have a hard time arisingIn terms of the mind well become contented happy and refreshedAt the same time meditation can help free us from bad kamma because unskillful mental states wont have a chance to infiltrate the mindOur life will be long our body healthyIf we keep developing our meditation to higher and higher levels the four properties of the body will become clear and pureIf we practice meditation by keeping the breath in mind until the breath is refined and the mind is refined the breath settles down to a stop and the mind settles down to be still then well be able to see our body and mind clearlyThe body and mind will separate from each other each existing independently  just as when outsiders dont come entering in and insiders dont go outAwareness will arise within us as to how the body is functioning how the mind is functioningHow has our body come into beingWell knowAnd where will it go from hereWell know where it came from where its going  well know it completelyWhat actions we did in our past lives that caused us to be born in this state well knowThis is called knowledge of past livesThe people and other living beings whove been our parents brothers sisters relatives and friends Where have they come fromWhen they die what sorts of pleasures and pains will they meet withAnd whereWe might be able to make contact with them and send streams of mental energy to help themThis is called knowledge of death and rebirthWell see that the body and mind are inconstant stressful and notself to the point where we become disenchanted with themThis will cause us to let go of the body and will free us from the fetters of attachmentThese fetters include such things as attachment to worldly phenomena When we let ourselves get pleased with gain status pleasure and praise its no different from the King of Death tying our hands up tightThen when he gives a single lash with his whip  ie we suffer loss disgrace pain and censure  we come tumbling right downAnother kind of fetter is selfidentification  attachment to the body seeing it as us or as an entity which gives rise to misconceptionsAnother fetter is uncertainty  doubts and hesitation running back and forth not knowing which way to go and ending up spinning around along with the worldOnce we know the ways of the body and mind well be released from these fettersThe mind will gain release from the body and shed the fermentations of defilementThis is called knowledge of the end of mental fermentationThe mind will gain liberating insight and flow into the current of Dhamma leading ultimately to nibbanaWhen we stop spinning along with the world well be able to see the world  our body  clearlyOnce the mind stops we can then see the bodyFor this reason we should slow down the spinning of the body by distilling and filtering its properties making them more and more refined slow down the spinning of our words by keeping silent and slow down the spinning of the mind making it firm and still by centering it in concentration thinking about and evaluating the breathWhen the mind stops spinning after its various concepts and preoccupations our words and body will stop along with itWhen each one has stopped we can see them all clearlyThe mind will know the affairs of the body through and through giving rise to liberating insight that will slow down the spinning of the wheel of rebirthOur births will become less and less until ultimately we wont have to come back to live in a world ever againTo practice meditation is one sort of food for the heartFood for the body is not anything lastingWe eat in the morning and are hungry by noonWe eat at noon and are hungry again in the eveningIf were full today tomorrow morning well be hungry againWe keep eating and defecating like this and the day will never come when weve had enoughWell have to keep looking for more and more things to eatAs for food for the heart if we prepare it really well even for a little space of time well be full for the rest of our lifeTry to be mindful as you keep track of the breath going in and outDont let yourself forget or be distractedTry to let go of all concepts of past or futureSilently repeat buddho in your mind  bud in with every inbreath and dho out with every out  until the mind settles down and is stillThen you can stop your mental repetition and begin observing the inandout breath to see how fast or slow long or short heavy or light broad or narrow crude or subtle it isStick with whichever way of breathing is comfortableAdjust whichever way of breathing isnt comfortable or easy until its just right using your own discrimination  dhammavicayasambojjhanga  as your standard of judgmentYou have to keep an eye on your mind to make sure that it doesnt wander waver or fly out after any external conceptsKeep the mind still indifferent and unconcerned as if there were only you sitting alone in the worldLet the breath spread throughout every part of the body from the head to the tips of the fingers and toes in front in back in the middle of the stomach all the way through the intestines along the blood vessels and out through every poreBreathe long and deep until the body feels fullThe body will feel light open and spacious just like a sponge full of water When we squeeze the water out it all comes out easily without any interferenceAt this point the body will feel light and at easeThe mind will feel as cool as the water that permeates the soil seeping into the roots of trees keeping them nourished and freshThe mind will be set straight and upright not leaning to the left or right forward or backIn other words it doesnt stretch out to any concepts or outside preoccupations at allConcepts lie at the essence of mental fashioningThe mind thinks of matters either past or future and then starts elaborating on them as good or bad liking or disliking themIf we see them as good we get pleased and taken with them This is delusionIf we see them as bad we get displeased which clouds and defiles the mind making it irritated restless and annoyed This is ill willThe things that give rise to unrest and disturbance in the mind are all classed as Hindrances  fashionings that fashion the mind destroying whatever is good in our practice of concentrationSo we have to do away with them allMental fashionings if we think in terms of the world are worldfashioningsIf we think in terms of dhamma theyre dhammafashioningsBoth sorts come from avijja unawarenessIf this unawareness disbands awareness will arise in its steadSo we have to try to increase the strength of our concentration to the point where fashionings disband  and at that point unawareness will disband as well leaving only awarenessThis awareness is identical with discernment but its a discernment that arises from withinIt doesnt come from anything our teachers have taught usIt comes from the stillness of mind focused on events in the presentIts an awareness thats very profound but its still mundane  not transcendent  discernment because it comes from labels and conceptsIts still tied up with affairs of being and birthPerhaps we may become aware of matters of the past knowing and seeing the states of being and birth weve been throughThis is called knowledge of past livesPerhaps we may become aware of the future knowing the affairs of other people how they die and are rebornThis is called knowledge of death and rebirthBoth these forms of knowledge still have attachment infiltrating them causing the mind to waver in line with its likes and dislikesThis is what corrupts our insightSome people when they learn of the good states of being and birth in their past get engrossed pleased and elated with the various things they seeIf they meet up with things that arent so good they feel disgruntled or upsetThis is simply because the mind still has attachment to its states of being and birthTo like the things that strike us as good or satisfying is indulgence in pleasureTo dislike the things that strike us as bad or dissatisfying is selfafflictionBoth of these attitudes are classed as wrong paths that deviate from the right path or Right ViewMatters of the past or future even if they deal with the Dhamma are still fashionings and so are wide of the markThus the next step is to use the power of our concentration to make the mind even stronger to the point where it can snuff out these mundane forms of discernmentThe mind will then progress to transcendent discernment  a higher form of discernment an awareness that can be used to free the mind from attachment  Right Mindfulness the right pathEven though we may learn good or bad things about ourself or others we dont become pleased or upsetWe feel nothing but disenchantment disinclination and dismay over the way living beings in the world are born and dieWe see it as something meaningless without any substanceWere through with feelings of liking and dislikingWeve run out of attachment for ourself and everything elseThe mind has moderationIts neutralEvenThis is called sixfactored equanimityWe let go of the things that happen that we know or see letting them follow their own regular course without our feeling caught up in themThe mind will then move up to liberating insightAt this point make your strength of mind even more powerful to the point where it is freed from attachment even to the realizations it has come toKnowing is simply knowing seeing is simply seeingKeep the mind as something separateDont let it flow out after its knowingWe know and then leave it at thatWe see and then leave it at thatWe dont latch onto these things as being oursThe mind will then gain full power and grow still of its own accord  not involved not dependent on anything at allFashionings disappear completely leaving just a pure condition of dhamma voidnessThis is the phenomenon of nonfashioningReleaseThe mind is free from the world  exclusively within the current of the Dhamma without going up or down forward or back progressing or regressingThe mind is a stake driven firmly in placeJust as when a tree is attached to a stake by a rope When the tree is cut down the rope snaps in two but the stake stays putThe mind stays put unaffected by any objects or preoccupationsThis is the mind of a Noble Disciple a person free from the fermentations of defilementWhoever trains his or her heart in line with what has been mentioned here will meet with security contentment and peace free from every sort of trouble or stressWhat we have discussed briefly here is enough to be used as a guide in the practice of training the mind to gain release from suffering and stress in this lifetimeTo take an interest in these things will be to our advantage in the times to comeIn fixing our attention on the breath the important point is to use our powers of observation and evaluation and to gain a sense of how to alter and adjust the breath so that we can keep it going just rightOnly then will we get results that are agreeable to body and mindObserve how the breath runs along its entire length from the tip of the nose on down past the Adams apple windpipe heart lungs down to the stomach and intestinesObserve it as it goes from the head down past your shoulders ribs spine and tail boneObserve the breath going out the ends of your fingers and toes and out the entire body through every poreImagine that your body is like a candle or a Coleman lanternThe breath is the mantle of the lantern mindfulness the fuel that gives off lightYour body from the skeleton out to the skin is like the wax of the candle surrounding the wickWe have to try make the mind bright and radiant like a candle if we want to get good resultsEverything in the world has its pair Theres dark and so there has to be brightTheres the sun and theres the moonTheres appearing and theres disappearingThere are causes and there are resultsThus in dealing with the breath the mind is the cause and mindfulness the resultIn other words the mind is what acts mindfulness is what knows so mindfulness is the result of the mindAs for the properties of the body  earth water fire and wind  the breath is the causeWhen the mind makes the cause good the physical result is that all the properties become radiantThe body is comfortableStrongFree from diseaseThe results that arise by way of the body and mind are caused by the act of adjustingThe result is that we notice and observeWhen we sit and meditate we have to observe the breath as it goes in and out to see what it feels like as it comes in how it moves or exerts pressure on the different parts of the body and in what ways it gives rise to a sense of comfortIs breathing in long and out long easy and comfortable or is breathing in short and out long easy and comfortableIs breathing in fast and out fast comfortable or is breathing in slow and out slowIs heavy breathing comfortable or is light breathing comfortableWe have to use our own powers of observation and evaluation and gain a sense of how to correct adjust and ease the breath so that its stable balanced and just rightIf for example slow breathing is uncomfortable adjust it so that its fasterIf long breathing is uncomfortable change to short breathingIf the breath is too gentle or weak  making you drowsy or your mind drift  breathe more heavily and stronglyThis is like adjusting the air pressure on a Coleman lanternAs soon as the air and the kerosene are mixed in the right proportions the lantern will give off light at full strength  white and dazzling  able to spread its radiance farIn the same way as long as mindfulness is firmly wedded to the breath and we have a sense of how to care for the breath so that its just right for the various parts of the body the mind will be stable and one not flying out after any thoughts or conceptsIt will develop a power a radiance called discernment  or to call it by its result knowledgeThis knowledge is a special form of awareness that doesnt come from anything our teachers have taught us or anyone has told usInstead its a special form of understanding praised by the Buddha as Right ViewThis form of understanding is coupled with mindfulness and alertnessIt ranks as Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration as wellWhen a mind rightly concentrated gains increased strength the results can lead to intuitive insight direct realization purity of knowledge and ultimately to release free from any sort of doubtThe mind will be independent quiet light and at ease  selfcontained like a flame in a glass lanternEven though insects may come and swarm around the lantern they cant put out the flame and at the same time the flame cant lick out to burn the hand of the person carrying itA mind that has mindfulness constantly watching over it is bound to be incapable of stretching or reaching out to take up with any preoccupations at allIt wont lick out in front or flicker back behind and external preoccupations wont be able to come barging into the heartOur eyes  the eyes of our discernment  will be clear and farseeing just as if we were sitting in the interstices of a net able to see clearly in whichever direction we lookedWhat does discernment come fromYou might compare it with learning to become a potter a tailor or a basket weaverThe teacher will start out by telling you how to make a pot sew a shirt or a pair of pants or weave different patterns but the proportions and beauty of the object you make will have to depend on your own powers of observationSuppose you weave a basket and then take a good look at its proportions to see if its too short or too tallIf its too short weave another one a little taller and then take a good look at it to see if theres anything that still needs improving to see if its too thin or too fatThen weave another one betterlooking than the lastKeep this up until you have one thats as beautiful and wellproportioned as possible one with nothing to criticize from any angleThis last basket you can take as your standardYou can now set yourself up in businessWhat youve done is to learn from your own actionsAs for your previous efforts you neednt concern yourself with them any longerThrow them outThis is a sense of discernment that arises of its own accord an ingenuity and sense of judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught you but from observing and evaluating on your own the object that you yourself have madeThe same holds true in practicing meditationFor discernment to arise you have to be observant as you keep track of the breath and to gain a sense of how to adjust and improve it so that its wellproportioned throughout the body  to the point where it flows evenly without faltering so that it s comfortable in slow and out slow in fast and out fast long short heavy or refinedGet so that both the inbreath and the outbreath are comfortable no matter what way you breathe so that  no matter when  you immediately feel a sense of ease the moment you focus on the breathWhen you can do this physical results will appear a sense of ease and lightness open and spaciousThe body will be strong the breath and blood will flow unobstructed and wont form an opening for disease to step inThe body will be healthy and awakeAs for the mind when mindfulness and alertness are the causes a still mind is the resultWhen negligence is the cause a mind distracted and restless is the resultSo we must try to make the causes good in order to give rise to the good results weve referred toIf we use our powers of observation and evaluation in caring for the breath and are constantly correcting and improving it well develop awareness on our own the fruit of having developed our concentration higher step by stepWhen the mind is focused with full circumspection it can let go of concepts of the pastIt sees the true nature of its old preoccupations that theres nothing lasting or certain about themAs for the future lying ahead of us its like having to sail a small boat across the great wide sea There are bound to be dangers on all sidesSo the mind lets go of concepts of the future and comes into the present seeing and knowing the presentKnowledge arises for an instant and then disappears so that you can know that there in the present is a voidYou dont latch on to worldfashionings of the past worldfashionings of the future or dhammafashionings of the presentFashionings disappearAvijja  counterfeit untrue awareness  disappearsTrue disappearsAll that remains is awareness buddha buddhaThe factor that fashions the body ie the breath the factors that fashion speech ie thoughts that formulate words and the factor that fashions the mind ie thinking all disappearBut awareness doesnt disappearWhen the factor that fashions the body moves youre aware of itWhen the factor that fashions speech moves youre aware of itWhen the factor that fashions the mind moves youre aware of it but awareness isnt attached to anything it knowsIn other words no fashionings can affect itTheres simply awarenessAt a thought the mind appears fashionings appearIf you want to use them there they areIf not they disappear on their own by their very natureAwareness is above everything elseThis is releaseMeditators have to reach this sort of awareness if theyre to get good resultsIn training the mind this is all there isComplications are a lot of fuss and bother and tend to bog down without ever getting to the real pointWhen we sit in meditation the important point is to be observant of the levels of the breathThe breath in the body has three levels common refined and profoundThe common breath is the breath we breathe into the bodyIt comes in two sortsThat which is mixed with impure or polluted air When it goes into the lungs it doesnt all come outThe dregs hang on in the bodyAnd when these dregs mix with the blood in the heart they can cause the blood to be harmful to the body giving rise to diseasesBut these diseases dont need to be treated with medicineIf we treat them using the breath theyll go awayThe other sort of common breath is that which is beneficial  the breath mixed with pure airWhen it mixes with the blood in the heart its beneficial to the bodyThe refined breath is gentle and softIts the delicate breath sensations derived from the inandout breath that permeate between the blood vessels and nervesThis breath is what gives rise to our sense of feeling throughout the bodyThe profound breath lies deeper than the refined breathIts cool spacious empty and whiteThe refined breath that spreads to nourish the body is the important level of breath to use as a basis for observing all three levels of the breathWhen this refined breath is spread fully throughout every part of the body the body will feel light empty and quiet  but were still mindful and alertThe mind is stable and so is the sense of the bodyWhen this is the case were constantly mindful and alertAt this point a bright light will appear in our sensation of the breathEven though our eyes are closed its as if they were openWell feel as if the breath in our body had a white glow like the mantle of a Coleman lantern bathed with lightThis is the profound breathThe mind becomes serene and still the body becomes serene and stillThe mind at this point is said to be in Right Concentration which can lead to liberating insightLiberating insight can cut away all concepts dealing with past and futureIn other words the mind is content to stay with the profound breath the spacious and empty breathAs long as the mind hasnt penetrated to this level of the breath it isnt free from HindrancesIt doesnt give rise to discernment it has no true awarenessBut when the awareness that comes from stillness gains power it gives rise to strength and lightThe mind and breath are both brightWhen every aspect of the breath is equally strong the profound breath becomes apparent quiet and smooth free from waves motionless and resilientThe breath at this point isnt affected by the inandout breathThe body is quiet with no feelings of painIt feels buoyant saturated and full like the mantle of a Coleman lantern Theres no need to pump theres no sound the air inside seems still and yet the light is dazzlingAll thats needed is the vapor of the kerosene and the lantern will give off lightThe body is quiet with no ups or downs highs or lowsWhen the breath is smooth and level in this way it makes the body feel light empty and quietThis is called kayapassaddhi physical serenityThe mind which stays with the quiet body is termed cittapassaddhi a serene mindWhen the mind stays with this stillness it becomes brightThis brightness comes from the minds being firmly centeredWhen the mind is firmly centered it leads to insightWhen insight arises we can be aware on the level of physical sensations and mental acts that arise from the inandout breathWere aware of the common breath the refined breath and the profound breathWe can keep tabs on all three levels of the breathWhen our awareness reaches this point we can be said to know the breath or to know sensationThen we observe how these things affect the mindThis is called knowing mental actsOnce we can know both sensation and mental acts well know This is true awarenessThis is how true awareness goes about knowing As long as we cant make the mind behave in this way we cant knowAnd when we cant know thats avijja unawarenessUnawareness is darknessThe common breath is dark the refined breath is dark the profound breath is darkHow harmful this darkness is for the body and mind we dont know more darknessUnawarenessUnawareness is like putting tar oil in a Coleman lanternAvijja has all the bad features of tar oilIt gives rise to nothing but trouble  darkness  for other people at the same time being destructive to our own heart and mind just as a fire fed with tar oil will give off nothing but black smokeThe more tar oil we feed it the blacker the smoke  and then we go around thinking that our black smoke is something special but actually its unawareness ie unaware of the fact that its unawarenessSo we get more and more wrapped up in our unawareness until were covered thick with sootSoot is a form of filth that gives rise to harmWhen a fire gives off black smoke its light is bad the fire is bad the smoke is badBad smoke is the nature of unawareness and since its bad the knowledge it gives rise to is bad the results it gives rise to are badThese are all things that give rise to suffering and stressThis is the sort of harm that comes from unawarenessThe harm caused by unawareness is like a woodfireA woodfire makes us sweat and  as if that werent enough  its light is red and fierce like the light of the sunWhatever its focused on will go up in flamesAny place a woodfire burns for a long time will become black with soot in the same way that a person who builds a woodfire gets himself all dirtyHis face and arms get black his clothes get black but since he sees this blackness as his own he doesnt take offence at itJust like an infected sore on his body No matter how dirty or smelly it may be he can still touch it without feeling any revulsionBut if he saw the same sore on someone else hed be so repulsed that he couldnt stand to look at it and wouldnt even want to go anywhere nearAnyone whose mind is wrapped up in unawareness is like a person covered with open sores who feels no embarrassment or disgust at himselfOr like soot on our own kitchen walls Even though we see it we simply see it without any sense that its ugly disgusting or embarrassingBut if we saw it in someone elses kitchen wed want to run awayUnawareness is what kills peopleUnawareness is a trapBut ordinarily a trap can catch only dullwitted animalsSharpwitted animals usually dont let themselves get caughtIf were stupid unawareness will catch us and eat us all upIf we live under the sway of ignorance  if we arent acquainted with the three levels of breath in the body  well have to reap harmTo know them though is to have Right MindfulnessWell know the causes of our actions and their resultsTo know this is to be mindful and alertOur body and actions will be clear to us like a fire thats bright in and of itselfWhere does its brightness come fromFrom the energy in the keroseneSo it is with the profound breathIts quiet in the body like a Coleman lantern glowing dazzlingly bright Its quiet as if no air had been pumped into it at allThis is kayapassaddhi physical serenityAs for the mind its crystal clear all aroundAnd like the glow coming off the mantle of the lantern its of use to people and other living beingsThis is whats meant by pabhassaram idam cittam  the mind is radiantWhen we can keep the mind pure in this way it gains the power to see what lies deeper still  but as of yet we cant know clearlyWell have to make our strength of mind even more powerful than this Thats vipassana clearseeing insightWhen vipassana arises its as if we put kerosene directly on the mantle of a lantern The fire will flame up instantly the light will dazzle in a single flashThe concepts that label sensations will disappear the concepts that label mental acts will disappearAll labeling and naming of things will disappear in a single mental instantSensations are still there as always mental acts are still there as always but the labels that take hold of them are cut just like a telegraph line The transmitter is there the receiver is there the line is there but theres no connection  the current isnt runningWhoever wants to send a message can go ahead and try but everything is quietSo it is with the heart When we cut through labels and concepts then no matter what anyone may say to us the heart is quietThis is vipassana an awareness beyond the sway of unawareness free from clinging and attachmentThe mind rises to the transcendent released from this worldIt dwells in a world higher than the ordinary worlds higher than the human world the heavenly and the Brahma worldsThis is why when the Buddha gained the knowledge of unsurpassed right selfawakening a tremor went through the entire universe from the lowest reaches of hell up through the human world to the worlds of the BrahmasWhyBecause his mind had gained full power so that it could part its way up above the Brahma worldsFor this reason we should reflect on the common breath were breathing right nowIt gives rise to benefits mixed with harmThe refined breath nourishes the blood vessels and nervesThe profound breath adjusts the breath sensations throughout the body so that the breath is selfsufficient in its own affairsThe earth property the fire property and the water property all become selfsufficient in their own affairsAnd when all four properties are selfsufficient they become equal and balanced so theres no turmoil in the bodyThe mind is selfsufficient the body is selfsufficient and we can stop worrying about them just like a child weve raised to maturityThe body and mind each become mature and independent in their own affairsThis is termed paccattam We see on our own and become responsible for ourselvesSanditthiko We can see clearly for ourselvesAkaliko No matter when as soon as we reflect on the three levels of the breath we immediately gain comfort and easeTo speak in legal terms weve come of ageWere no longer minors and have full rights to our parents legacy in accordance with the lawTo speak in terms of the monastic discipline we no longer have to stay under our teachers because were fully able to look after ourselvesAnd to speak in terms of the Dhamma we no longer have to depend on teachers or textsWhat Ive been saying here is aimed at giving us a sense of how to apply our powers of observation to the three levels of the breathWe should attend to them until we gain understandingIf were observant in keeping tabs on the three levels of the breath at all times well reap results  ease of body and mind  like an employer who constantly keeps tabs on the workers in his factoryThe workers wont have a chance to shirk their duties and will have to set their minds on doing their work as theyre supposed toThe result is that our work is sure to be finished quickly or to make steady progressWhen you fix your attention on the breath you must try to cut away all outside preoccupationsOtherwise if you let yourself be distracted you wont be able to observe the subtleties of the breath and mindThe breath energy in the body can be divided into three parts one in the heart and lungs another in the stomach and intestines and a third in the blood vessels throughout the bodyAll three are breaths that are always moving but theres another breath  a still breath light and empty  centered in the diaphragm between the heart and lungs on the one hand and the stomach and intestines on the otherThis breath is motionless unlike the breath distilled in the heart and lungsIt exerts no pressure on any part of the body at allAs for the moving breath when it strikes the blood vessels it feels warm or hot and sometimes causes excretions in your noseIf the breath is predominant over the fire property it causes the blood to be coolIf the fire property is predominant over the breath property it causes the blood to be hotIf these properties are combined in the right proportions they give rise to a feeling of comfort and ease  relaxed spacious and still  like having an unobstructed view of the open skySometimes theres a feeling of ease  relaxed spacious but moving This is called piti or raptureThe best breath to focus on is the empty spacious breathTo make use of the breath means to use whichever feeling is most predominant as when you feel very relaxed very empty or very comfortableIf theres a feeling of motion dont use itUse just the feelings of emptiness relaxation or lightnessTo use them means to expand their range so that you feel empty in every part of the bodyThis is called having a sense of how to make use of the feelings you already haveBut in using these feelings you have to be completely mindful and alertOtherwise when you start feeling empty or light you might go thinking that your body has disappearedIn letting these sensations expand you can let them spread either one at a time or all together at onceThe important point is that you keep them balanced and that you focus on the whole body all at once as the single object of your awarenessThis is called ekayanamagga the direct pathIf you can master this its like having a white cloth that you can either keep hidden in your fist or spread out for two metersYour body although it may weigh kilograms may feel as light as a single kilogramThis is called mahasatipatthana  the great frame of referenceWhen mindfulness saturates the body the way flame saturates every thread in the mantle of a Coleman lantern the elements throughout the body work together like a group of people working together on a job Each person helps a little here and there and in no time at all almost effortlessly the job is doneJust as the mantle of a Coleman lantern whose every thread is soaked in flame becomes light brilliant and white in the same way if you soak your mind in mindfulness and alertness so that its conscious of the entire body both body and mind will become buoyantWhen you think using the power of mindfulness your sense of the body will immediately become thoroughly bright helping to develop both body and mindYoull be able to sit or stand for long periods of time without feeling tired to walk for great distances without getting fatigued to go for unusually long periods of time on just a little food without getting hungry or to go without food and sleep altogether for several days running without losing energyAs for the heart it will become pure open and free from blemishThe mind will become bright fearless and strongSaddhabalam Your sense of conviction will run like a car running without stop along the roadViriyabalam Your persistence will accelerate and advanceSatibalam Your mindfulness and alertness will be robust capable of knowing both past and futureFor instance knowledge of past lives and knowledge of other beings death and rebirth These two kinds of intuition are essentially forms of mindfulnessOnce your mindfulness is fully developed it can give you knowledge of peoples past actions and livesSamadhibalam Your concentration will become unwavering and strongNo activity will be able to kill itIn other words no matter what youre doing  sitting standing talking walking whatever  as soon as you think of practicing concentration your mind will immediately be centeredWhenever you want it just think of it and youve got itWhen your concentration is this strong insight meditation is no problemPaññabalam Your insight will be like a doubleedged swordYour insight into whats outside will be sharp your insight into whats inside will be sharpWhen these five strengths appear in the heart the heart will be fully matureSaddhindriyam viriyindriyam satindriyam samadhindriyam paññindriyam Your conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment will be mature and preeminent in their own spheresIts the nature of mature adults that they cooperateWhen they work together on a job they finish itSo it is when you have these five adults working together for you Youll be able to complete any taskYour mind will have the power to demolish every defilement in the heart just as a nuclear bomb can demolish anything anywhere in the worldWhen your mind has this sort of power liberating insight will arise like a lance with sharp edges on all four sides or a power saw whose blade has teeth all the way aroundThe body is like the stand on which the saw rests the mind is the circular blade Wherever it spins it can cut through whatever is fed into itThis is the nature of liberating insightThese are some of the results that come from knowing how to refine the breath and how to expand the still breath so that it benefits both body and mindWe should take these matters to heart and put them into practice as we are able so as to share in these benefitsThe parts of the body that ache that are tense painful or sore  think of them as hoodlums or foolsAs for the parts that are relaxed and comfortable think of them as sagesAsk yourself Do you want to live with sages or foolsIts not the case that the body will be painful in every part all at the same timeSometimes our hand hurts but our arm doesnt hurt our stomach aches but our back doesnt ache our legs hurt but our feet are fine or our eyes hurt but our head doesnt hurtWhen this is the case we should choose to stay with the good partsIf we take up company with more and more good people theyll reach the point where they can drive out all the hoodlumsIn the same way when the mind is very still the sense of comfort will become so great that well forget about aches and painsThe breath energy in the body is like a messengerWhen we expand the breath  this is whats meant by vicara  mindfulness will spread throughout the body as if it were going along an electric wireBeing mindful is like sending electricity along a wire alertness is like the heat of the electricity that energizes us and wakes us upWhen the body is energized no pains will overcome itIn other words we wake up the properties of earth water wind and fire so that they get to workThe properties of the body will become strong and healthy making the body feel comfortable and wellThis is termed mahabhutarupaWhen this sense of mahabhutarupa is nourished with breath and mindfulness in this way it will grow and matureThe properties will grow quiet and mature and become mahasatipatthana the great frame of referenceThis is threshold concentration or vicara  spreading the breathIn centering the mind we have to put it on the middle path cutting away all thoughts of past and futureAs for worldly phenomena  gain and loss status and disgrace praise and censure pleasure and pain  no matter how bad they may be or how fantastically good we arent interested  because even when they really have been good theyve left us long ago and as for the good lying ahead it hasnt reached us yetTo feed on moods that are past is like eating things that other people have spit outThings that other people have spit out we shouldnt gather up and eatWhoever does so the Buddha said is like a hungry ghostIn other words the mind is a slave to craving which is like salivaWe dont get to eat any food and so we sit swallowing nothing but salivaThe mind isnt in the middle wayTo think of the future is like licking the rim of tomorrows soup pot which doesnt yet have even a drop of soupTo think about the past is like licking the bottom of yesterdays soup pot when there isnt any leftThis is why the Buddha became disenchanted with past and future because theyre so undependableSometimes they put us in a good mood which is indulgence in pleasureSometimes they get us in a bad mood which is indulgence in selfafflictionWhen you know that this sort of thing isnt the path of the practice dont go near itThe Buddha thus taught us to shield the mind so that its quiet and still by developing concentrationWhen a person likes to lick his or her preoccupations if theyre bad its really heavyIf theyre good preoccupations its not so bad but its still on the mundane levelFor this reason were taught to take our stance in the presentWhen the mind isnt involved in the past or the future it enters the Noble Path  and then we realize how meaningless the things of the past are This is the essence of the knowledge of past livesOld things come back and turn into new new things come back and turn into oldOr as people say the future becomes the past and the past becomes the futureWhen you can dispose with past and future the mind becomes even more steadfastThis is called Right MindfulnessThe mind develops strength of conviction ie your convictions become more settled in the truth of the presentViriyabalam Your persistence becomes fearlessSatibalam Mindfulness develops into great mindfulnessSamadhibalam The mind becomes firm and unshakingPaññabalam Discernment becomes acute to the point where it can see the true nature of the khandhas becoming dispassionate and letting go of the body and self so that the mind is released from the power of attachmentThis according to the wise is knowledge of the end of mental fermentationTo know where beings go and take birth is termed knowledge of death and rebirthWe become disenchanted with states of beingOnce we know enough to feel disenchantment our states of being and birth lessenOur burdens and concerns lightenThe minds cycling through states of being slows downJust like a wheel when we put thorns in the tire and place logs in the way It slows downWhen the mind turns more slowly you can count the stages in its cycleThis is called knowing the moments of the mindTo know in this way is liberating insightIts awarenessTo know past future and present is awarenessThe Noble Ones arent attached to activities  to acting speaking or thinking  in any wayWhen the processes of action fall silent their minds are empty and clear like spaceBut we ordinary people hold on to speaking standing walking sitting lying down everything  and how can it help but be heavyThe Noble Ones let go of it all and so are at easeIf they walk a long time they dont get wearyIf they sit a long time they dont acheThey can do anything without being weighed downThe people who are weighed down are those who hold onStress for ordinary people is pain and sufferingThe stress of sages is the wavering of pleasureThe breath of birth or of life is the inbreathThe outbreath when theres no inbreath is the breath of deathWhether a person is to have the potential for a short or a long life depends on the inandout breathThus the breath is termed kayasankhara the factor that fashions the bodyIts the crucial factor in lifeWhen you can catch hold of the breath you can keep tabs on your own birth and dyingThis is birth and dying on the obscured levelAs for birth and dying on the open level even fools and children can know it Birth means breathing sitting lying down standing walking and so onDeath means to stop breathing and to get hauled off and crematedBut birth and dying on the obscured level can be known only withinAnd not everyone can know them Only those who still their minds canTo focus on the breath this way is at the same time mindfulness of death mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness immersed in the bodyOr you can call it ekayanamagga  unifying the sense of the body into a single direct pathVitakka is to bring the topic of meditation to the mind to bring the mind to the topic of meditationVicara means to spread adjust and improve the breath carefullyThe longer you keep at this the more comfortable your going will be just as when we work at clearing a roadThe sense of the body will benefit in three ways feeling light cool and comfortableAt this point our meditation theme becomes even stronger and the mind feels even greater ease and detachment termed cittaviveka or mental solitudeThe sense of the body becomes more quiet and detached termed kayaviveka or physical solitudeThe breath energy in the body falls into two classesOne class is called the feminine breath the gentle flow of energy from below the navel up to the head and out the noseThe other class is called the masculine breath the solid flow of energy from the ends of the feet up through the spineOnce you can focus on these breaths dont go against their basic natureBe conscious of them when you go in to coordinate and connect them and observe the results that come from spreading and adjusting the breathAs soon as things feel smooth and easy focus in on the breath in the stomach and intestines and the breath energy that acts as a sentinel between them keeping them from rubbing against each other like the cotton wool used to pack a stack of glassware to keep the glasses from striking against one anotherWhen the breath is quiet and the mind at ease this is goodness in its greater formWhen the mind is at ease but the body in turmoil this is goodness in a lesser formLet the mind settle wherever theres a sense of comfort in the body in the same way that we go to look for food in places where in the past weve found enough to eat our fillOnce the mind is full rapture arisesPleasure saturates the heart just as salt saturates pickled fishThe mind will take on valueThe sense of the body will become bright clear and coolKnowledge will begin to see bit by bit so that we can come to see the nature of our own body and mindWhen this state of mind becomes stronger it turns into ñanadassana  knowledge and visionKnowledge on this level comes from mindfulness and vision from alertnessWhen the wavering of the mind stops then craving for sensuality for becoming and for no becoming all stopPain and pleasure let go of themDont give them a second thoughtThink of them as words that people speak only in jestAs for the truth its there in the heartIf the mind still wavers and strays there will have to be more states of being and birthIf sensual craving moves it leads to a gross state of beingIf craving for becoming moves it leads to an intermediate state of beingIf craving for no becoming moves the mind will latch onto a subtle state of beingOnly when we see this happening can we be said to know past future and presentWhen this awareness is clear and full the mind becomes dispassionate and loosens its attachments coming to a full stop the stopping of unawareness the stopping of birthThis is why the Buddha felt no attachment for home or family for wealth servants or material pleasures of any kindWhen you close your eyes while sitting in meditation simply close your eyelidsDont try to close off your eyes like a person sleepingYou have to keep your optic nerves awake and workingOtherwise youll put yourself to sleepThink of your internal meditation object  the inandout breath  and then think of bringing your external meditation object  buddho awake which is one of the virtues of the Lord Buddha  in with the breathOnce you can focus comfortably on the breath let the breath spread throughout the body until you feel light supple and at easeThis is called maintaining the proper quality in practicing concentrationTo keep the mind fixed so that it doesnt slip away from the breath is called maintaining the proper objectBeing firmly mindful of your meditation word without any lapses is called maintaining the proper intentionWhen you can keep your mind fixed in these three component factors you can say that youre practicing meditationOnce we set our mind on doing good in this way things that arent good  nivarana or Hindrances  are bound to come stealing into the mindIf we call the Hindrances by name there are five of themBut here we arent going to talk about their names well just talk about what they are Hindrances are things that defile and adulterate the mindThey make the mind dark and murkyTheyre obstacles that prevent the mind from staying firmly with the component factors of its meditationHindrances come from external preoccupations and external preoccupations arise because our internal preoccupation is weakTo say that our internal preoccupation is weak means that our mind doesnt stay firmly with its objectLike floating a dipper in a barrel of water If it doesnt have anything to weigh it down its bound to wobble and tipThe wobbling of the mind is what creates an opening for the various Hindrances to come pouring in and make the mind lose its balanceWe should make ourself aware that when the mind starts tipping it can tip in either of two directions It may go toward thoughts of the past matters that happened two hours ago or all the way back to our very first breathDistractions of this sort can carry two kinds of meaning for us Either they deal in terms of worldly matters  our own affairs or those of other people good or bad  or else they deal in terms of the Dhamma things good or bad that have happened and that weve taken note ofOr else our mind may tip toward thoughts of the future which are the same sort of thing  our own affairs or those of others dealing in terms of the world or the Dhamma good or badWhen our mind starts drifting in this way were bound to receive one of two sorts of results contentment or discontentment moods that indulge either in pleasure or in self afflictionFor this reason we have to catch hold of the mind constantly and bring it into the present so that these Hindrances cant come seeping inBut even then the mind isnt really at equilibriumIts still apt to waver to some extentBut this wavering isnt really wrong because the mind when it wavers is looking for a place to stayIn Pali this is called sambhavesinSo were taught to find a meditation theme to act as a focal point for the mind in the same way that a movie screen acts as a reflector for images so that they appear sharp and clearThis is to keep external preoccupations from barging inIn other words were taught to meditate by focusing the mind in one place on the breathWhen we think of the breath thats called vitakka  as when we think bud in and dho out like were doing right nowAs for the wavering of the mind thats called vicaraWhen we bring vicara into the picture we can let go of part of vitakkaIn other words stop repeating buddho and then start observing how much the body is affected by each inandout breathWhen the breath goes out does it feel easy and naturalWhen it comes in does it feel comfortableIf not improve itWhen we direct the mind in this way we dont have to use buddhoThe inbreath will permeate and spread throughout the body along with our sense of mindfulness and alertnessWhen we let go of part of vitakka  as when we stop repeating buddho so that theres only the act of keeping track of the breath  the act of evaluating increasesThe wavering of the mind becomes part of our concentrationOutside preoccupations fall stillFalling still doesnt mean that our ears go deafFalling still means that we dont stir the mind to go out after external objects either past or futureWe let it stay solely in the presentWhen the mind is centered in this way it develops sensitivity and knowledgeThis knowledge isnt the sort that comes from studying or from booksIt comes from doing  as when we make clay tilesWhen we first start out we know only how to mix the clay with sand and how to make plain flat tilesBut as we keep doing it well start knowing more how to make them attractive how to make them strong durable and not brittleAnd then well think of making them different colors and different shapesAs we keep making them better and more attractive the objects we make will in turn become our teachersSo it is when we focus on the breathAs we keep observing how the breath flows well come to know what the inbreath is like whether or not its comfortable how to breathe in so that we feel comfortable how to breathe out so that we feel comfortable what way of breathing makes us feel tense and constricted what way makes us feel tired  because the breath has up to four varietiesSometimes it comes in long and out long sometimes in long and out short sometimes in short and out long sometimes in short and out shortSo we should observe each of these four types of breath as they flow in the body to see how much they benefit the heart lungs and other parts of the bodyWhen we keep surveying and evaluating in this way mindfulness and alertness will take charge within usConcentration will arise discernment will arise awareness will arise within usA person who develops this sort of skill may even become able to breathe without using the nose by breathing through the eyes or the ears insteadBut when were starting out we have to make use of the breath through the nose because its the obvious breathWe first have to learn how to observe the obvious breath before we can become aware of the more refined breath sensations in the bodyThe breath energy in the body taken as a whole is of five sorts The sojourning breath continually flowing in and outThe breath energy that stays within the body but can permeate through the various partsThe breath energy that spins around in placeThe breath energy that moves and can flow back and forthThe breath energy that nourishes the nerves and blood vessels throughout the bodyOnce we know the various kinds of breath energy how to make use of them and how to improve them so that they feel agreeable to the body well develop expertiseWell become more adept with our sense of the bodyResults will arise a feeling of fullness and satisfaction pervading the entire body just as kerosene pervades every thread in the mantle of a Coleman lantern causing it to give off a bright white glowVitakka is like putting sand into a sifterVicara is like sifting the sandWhen we first put sand into a sifter its still coarse and lumpyBut as we keep sifting the sand will become more and more refined until we have nothing but fine particlesSo it is when we fix the mind on the breathIn the first stages the breath is still coarse but as we keep using more and more vitakka and vicara the breath becomes more and more refined until it permeates to every poreOlarikarupa All sorts of comfortable sensations will appear  a sense of lightness spaciousness respite freedom from aches and pains etc and well feel nothing but refreshment and pleasure in the sense of the Dhamma constantly cool and relaxedSukhumalarupa This sense of pleasure will appear to be like tiny particles like the mist of atoms that forms the air but cant be seen with the naked eyeBut even though we feel comfortable and relaxed at this point this mist of pleasure pervading the body can form a birthplace for the mind so we cant say that weve gone beyond stress and painThis is one of the forms of awareness we can develop in concentrationWhoever develops it will give rise to a sense of inner refreshment a feeling of lightness like cotton woolThis lightness is powerful in all sorts of waysHinam va The blatant sense of the body will disappear  panitam va  and will turn into a more refined sense of the body subtle and beautifulThe beauty here isnt the sort that comes from art or decorationInstead its beauty in the sense of being bright clear and freshRefreshingSoothingPeacefulThese qualities will give rise to a sense of splendor within the body termed sobhana a sense of rapture and exhilaration that fills every part of the bodyThe properties of earth water fire and wind in the body are all balanced and fullThe body seems beautiful but again this isnt beauty in the sense of artAll of this is termed panitarupaWhen the body grows full and complete to this extent all four of the elementary properties become mature and responsible in their own spheres and can be termed mahabhutarupaEarth is responsible in its own earth affairs water in its own water affairs wind in its own wind affairs and fire in its own fire affairsWhen all four properties become more responsible and mature in their own affairs this is termed olarikarupaThe properties of space and consciousness also become matureIts as if they all become mature adultsThe nature of mature adults when they live together is that they hardly ever quarrel or disputeChildren when they live with children tend to be squabbling all the timeSo when all six properties are mature earth wont conflict with water water wont conflict with wind wind wont conflict with fire fire wont conflict with space space wont conflict with consciousnessAll will live in harmony and unityThis is what is meant by ekayano ayam maggo sattanam visuddhiya This is the unified path for the purification of beingsAll four physical properties become mature in the unified sense of the body fourinoneWhen the mind enters into this unified path its able to become wellacquainted with the affairs of the bodyIt comes to feel that this body is like its child the mind is like a parentWhen parents see that their child has grown and matured theyre bound to feel proudAnd when they see that their child can care for itself they can put down the burden of having to care for itWhen the mind can let go of the body in this way well feel an inner glow in both body and mind a glow in the sense of a calm pleasure unlike the pleasures of the world  for instance the body feels relaxed and at ease with no aches or fatigue  and a glow in the sense of radianceAs for the mind it feels the glow of a restful sense of calm and the glow of an inner radianceThis calm glow is the essence of inner worthIts like the water vapor rising from icecold objects and gathering to form clouds that fall as rain or ride high and freeIn the same way this cool sense of calm explodes into a mist of radianceThe properties of earth water wind fire space and consciousness all become a mistThis is where the sixfold radiance arisesThe sense of the body will seem radiant and glowing like a ripe peachThe power of this glow is called the light of the DhammaWhen weve developed this quality the body is secure and the mind wide awakeA mist of radiance  a power  appears within usThis radiance as it becomes more and more powerful is where intuitive insight will appear the means for knowing the four Noble TruthsAs this sense of intuition becomes stronger it will turn into knowledge and awareness a knowledge we havent learned from anywhere else but have gained from the practiceWhoever can do this will find that the mind attains the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha which will enter to bathe the heartSuch a person can be said to have truly reached the refuge of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaWhoever can do even just this much is capable of reaching Awakening without having to go and do much of anything elseIf were careful circumspect persistent mindful and discerning well be able to open our eyes and ears so that we can know all kinds of things  and we may not even have to be reborn to come back and practice concentration ever againBut if were complacent  careless inattentive and lazy  well have to come back and go through the practice all over againThe reason we practice concentration is to disband the Hindrances from the heartWhen the Hindrances are absolutely quiet the mind can reach viharadhamma  the inner quality that can form its homeWell then be able to gain complete freedom from the HindrancesOur future states of rebirth will be no lower than the human levelWe wont be forced to gain rebirth in the four realms of deprivationOnce the mind reaches its inner home its capable of raising itself to the transcendent level to the stream flowing to nibbanaIf were not lazy or complacent if we keep persevering with our meditation well be able to gain release from the mundane levelIf our mind gains the quality of streamentry we will never again have to be born in the realms of deprivationStreamwinners if we were to explain them in really simple terms are people whose minds are certain and sure but who still have some forms of shoddy thoughts  although they would never dare let that shoddiness show in their actionsAs for ordinary runofthemill people once they have a shoddy thought its bound to appear in their words and deeds  killing stealing etcAlthough streamwinners may still have some forms of shoddiness to them they dont act shoddy at all like a person who has a knife in his hand when hes angry but who doesnt use it to cut off anyones headOrdinary people usually cant say no to their defilementsThey usually have to act in line with their defilements as they ariseFor example when they feel strong anger they cant bear itThey have to let it show to the point where they can get really ugly and do things that fly right in the face of moralityStreamwinners although they do have defilements can say no to themWhyBecause they have the discipline of mindfulness embedded within them enabling them to tell right from wrongWhen the mind wavers in a good direction theyre aware of itWhen it wavers in a bad direction theyre aware of itThey see hear smell aromas taste flavors feel tactile sensations just like ordinary people but they dont let these things make inroads on the heartThey have the selfcontrol that enables them to withstand their defilements like a person who is able to carry a bowlful of water while running without spilling a single dropEven though streamwinners may be riding a bicycle  ie sitting standing walking lying down speaking thinking eating opening or closing their eyes  the permanent quality of their hearts never gets overturnedThis is a quality that never disappears although it may waver sometimesThat wavering is what can cause them to be rebornBut even though they may be reborn theyre reborn in good states of being as human or heavenly beingsAs for ordinary people they take birth without any real rhyme or reason and they keep doing it over and over againStreamwinners however understand birthAlthough they experience birth they let it disbandIn other words they have no use for shoddy impulsesThey respond weakly to shoddy impulses and strongly to good onesOrdinary people respond strongly to bad impulses and weakly to good onesFor example a person who decides to go do good at a monastery  if someone then makes fun of him saying that people who go to the monastery are oldfashioned or have hit rockbottom  will hardly feel like going at allBut no matter how other people may try to talk him into doing good he hardly respondsThis is because the level of the mind has fallen very lowAs for streamwinners no matter how many times shoddy impulses may occur to them the goodness of nibbana acts as a magnet on their heartsThis is what draws them to keep on practicing until they reach the end pointWhen they reach the end point there can be no more birth no more aging no more illness no more deathSensations stop feelings stop concepts stop fashionings stop consciousness stopsAs for the six properties they also stopEarth stops water stops wind stops fire stops space stops consciousness stopsThe properties khandhas and sense media all stopTheres no mental label alluding to any of the khandhasMental labels are the media that let the khandhas come running inWhen mental labels stop theres nobody runningAnd when everyone has stopped running theres no pushing and shoving no colliding no conversingThe heart looks after itself in line with its dutiesAs for the properties khandhas and sense media each is independent in its own area each is in charge of its own affairsTheres no trespassing on anyone elses propertyAnd once theres no trespassing what troubles will there beLike a match left lying alone in a match box What fires can it causeAs long as its head isnt struck on anything abrasive fire wont have a chance to ariseThis doesnt mean that theres no fire in the matchIts there as it always was but as long as it doesnt latch onto anything combustible it wont flare upThe same is true of a mind that no longer latches on to the defilementsThis is what is meant by nibbanaIts the ultimate good the ultimate point of the religion and our own ultimate point as wellIf we dont progress in the threefold training  virtue concentration and discernment  we wont have any chance to reach the ultimateBut if we gather these practices within ourselves and advance in them our minds will develop the knowledge and awareness that will be capable of pushing us on to an advanced point to nibbanaNoble disciples are like people who realize that rain water is the vapor that heat sucks up from the salt water of the ocean and then falls down as rain  and so that rain water is ocean water and ocean water is rain waterOrdinary runofthemill people are like people who dont know what rain water comes fromThey assume that rain water is up there in the sky and so they deludedly wait to drink nothing but rain waterIf no rain comes theyre sure to dieThe reason for their ignorance is their own stupidityThey dont know enough to search for new resources  the qualities of the Noble Ones  and so will have to keep gathering up the same old things to eat over and over againThey keep spinning around in the cycle of rebirth in this way with no thought of searching for a way out of this mass of suffering and stressTheyre like a red ant that keeps probing its way around and around the rim of a bushel basket  whose circumference isnt even two meters  all because it doesnt realize that the rim of the basket is roundThis is why we keep experiencing birth aging illness and death without endAs for the Noble Ones they see that everything in the world is the same old stuff coming over and over againWealth and poverty good and bad pleasure and pain praise and censure etc keep trading places around and around in circlesThis is the cycle of defilement which causes ignorant people to misunderstandThe world itself spins  Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and then back to the same old Sunday all over againJanuary February March April May etc up to November and December and then back to JanuaryThe year of the rat the ox the tiger all the way up to the year of the pig and then back to the same old year of the rat all over againEverything is like this night following day day following nightNighttime isnt for sure Our daytime is other peoples nighttime their daytime is our nighttimeThings keep changing like thisThis is called the wheel of the world which causes people with only partial knowledge to misunderstand and to quarrelWhen Noble Ones see in this way they develop a sense of dispassion and dont ever want to be born in a world again  for there are all sorts of worldsSome worlds have nothing but cold others nothing but heat  no living beings can be born thereSome have only sunlight others only moonlight still others neither sunlight nor moonlightThis is what is meant by lokaviduFor this reason once weve learned this we should take it to think over carefullyWhatever we see as worthy of credence we should then use to train our hearts so that the paths and their fruitions will arise within usDont be heedless or complacent in anything you do for life is like dew on the grassAs soon as its touched by the light of the sun it vanishes in no time without leaving a traceWe die with every inandout breathIf were the least bit careless we are sure to die for death is something that happens very easilyIts lying in wait for us at every momentSome people die from sleeping too much or eating too much or eating too little of being too cold too hot too happy too sadSome people die from pain others die without any painSometimes even when were sitting around perfectly normal we can still dieSee that death has you surrounded on all sides  and so be earnest in developing as much goodness as you can both in the area of the world and in the DhammaThe Dhamma of attainment is something cool clean and clearIt doesnt take birth age grow ill or dieWhoever works earnestly at the Dhamma of study and practice will give rise to the Dhamma of attainment without a doubtThe Dhamma of attainment is paccattam You have to know it for yourselfWe should make a point of searching for whatever will give rise to discernmentSutamayapañña Listen to things that are worth listening toCintamayapañña Once youve listened evaluate what youve learnedDont accept it or reject it right off handBhavanamayapañña Once youve put what youve learned to the test practice in line with itThis is the highest perfection of discernment  liberating insightYou know what kinds of stress and pain should be remedied and so you remedy themYou know what kinds shouldnt be remedied and so you dontFor the most part were really ignorantWe try to remedy the things that shouldnt be remedied and it just doesnt work  because theres one kind of stress that should simply be observed and shouldnt be fiddled with at allLike a rusty watch Dont polish away any more rust than you shouldIf you go taking it apart the whole thing will stop running for goodWhat this means is that once youve seen natural conditions for what they truly are you have to let them beIf you see something that should be fixed you fix itWhatever shouldnt be fixed you dontThis takes a load off the heartIgnorant people are like the old woman who lit a fire to cook her rice and when her rice was cooked had her mealWhen she had finished her meal she sat back and had a cigarIt so happened that when she lit her cigar with one of the embers of the fire it burned her mouthDamned fire she thoughtIt burned my mouth So she put all her matches in a pile and poured water all over them so that there wouldnt be any more fire in the house  just like a fool with no sense at allThe next day when she wanted fire to cook her meal there wasnt any leftAt night when she wanted light she had to go pestering her neighbors asking this person and that and yet still she hated fireWe have to learn how to make use of things and to have a sense of how much is enoughIf you light only a little fire itll be three hours before your rice is cookedThe fire isnt enough for your foodSo it is with us We see stress as something bad and so try to remedy it  keeping at it with our eyes closed as if we were blindNo matter how much we treat it we never get anywhere at allPeople with discernment will see that stress is of two kinds physical stress or the inherent stress of natural conditions and mental stress or the stress of defilementOnce theres birth there has to be aging illness and deathWhoever tries to remedy aging can keep at it till theyre withered and grayWhen we try to remedy illness were usually like the old woman pouring water all over her matchesSometimes we treat things just right sometimes we dont  as when the front step gets cracked and we dismantle the house right up to the roofIllness is something that everyone has in other words the diseases that appear in the various parts of the bodyOnce weve treated the disease in our eyes itll go appear in our ears nose in front in back in our arm our hand our foot etc and then itll sneak insideLike a person trying to catch hold of an eel The more you try to catch it the more it slips off every which wayAnd so we keep on treating our diseases till we dieSome kinds of disease will go away whether we treat them or notIf its a disease that goes away with treatment then take medicineIf its one that goes away whether we treat it or not why botherThis is what it means to have discernmentIgnorant people dont know which kinds of stress should be treated and which kinds shouldnt and so they put their time and money to wasteAs for intelligent people they see what should be treated and they treat it using their own discernmentAll diseases arise either from an imbalance in the physical elements or from kammaIf its a disease that arises from the physical elements we should treat it with food medicine etcIf it arises from kamma we have to treat it with the Buddhas medicineIn other words stress and pain that arise from the heart if we treat them with food and medicine wont respondWe have to treat them with the DhammaWhoever knows how to manage this is said to have a sense of how to observe and diagnose stressIf we look at it in another way well see that aging illness and death are simply the shadows of stress and not its true substancePeople lacking discernment will try to do away with the shadows which leads only to more suffering and stressThis is because they arent acquainted with what the shadows and substance of stress come fromThe essence of stress lies with the mindAging illness and death are its shadows or effects that show by way of the bodyWhen we want to kill our enemy and so take a knife to stab his shadow how is he going to dieIn the same way ignorant people try to destroy the shadows of stress and dont get anywhereAs for the essence of stress in the heart they dont think of remedying it at allThis ignorance of theirs is one form of avijja or unawarenessTo look at it in still another way both the shadows and the real thing come from tanha cravingWere like a person who has amassed a huge fortune and then when thieves come to break in goes killing the thievesHe doesnt see his own wrongdoing and sees only the wrongdoing of othersActually once hes piled his house full in this way thieves cant help but break inIn the same way people suffer from stress and so they hate it and yet they dont make the effort to straighten themselves outStress comes from the three forms of craving so we should kill off craving for sensuality craving for becoming and craving for no becomingThese things are fabricated in our own heart and we have to know them with our own mindfulness and discernmentOnce weve contemplated them until we see well know This sort of mental state is craving for sensuality this sort is craving for becoming and this sort craving for no becomingPeople with discernment will see that these things exist in the heart in subtle intermediate and blatant stages just as a person has three stages in a lifetime youth middle age and old ageYouth is craving for sensualityOnce this thirst arises in the heart it wavers and moves  this is craving for becoming  and then takes shape as craving for no further becoming  a sambhavesin with its neck stretched out looking for its object causing itself stress and painIn other words we take a liking to various sights sounds smells flavors etc and so fix on them which brings us stressSo we shouldnt preoccupy ourselves with sights sounds etc that provoke greed anger or delusion causing the mind to waver and whisk out with conceptsWhen we gain discernment we should destroy these forms of craving with anulomikañana knowledge in accordance with the four Noble Truths knowing exactly how much ease and pleasure the mind has when cravings for sensuality becoming and no becoming all disappearThis is called knowing the reality of disbandingAs for the cause of stress and the path to the disbanding of stress well know them as wellIgnorant people will go ride in the shadow of a car  and theyll end up with their heads bashed inPeople who dont realize what the shadows of virtue are will end up riding only the shadowsWords and deeds are the shadows of virtueActual virtue is in the heartThe heart at normalcy is the substance of virtueThe substance of concentration is the mind firmly centered in a single preoccupation without any interference from concepts or mental labelsThe bodily side to concentration  when our mouth eyes ears nose and tongue are quiet  is just the shadow as when the body sits still its mouth closed and not speaking with anyone its nose not interested in any smells its eyes closed and not interested in any objects etcIf the mind is firmly centered to the level of fixed penetration then whether we sit stand walk or lie down the mind doesnt waverOnce the mind is trained to the level of fixed penetration discernment will arise without our having to search for it just like an imperial sword When its drawn for use its sharp and flashingWhen its no longer needed it goes back in the scabbardThis is why we are taughtThe mind is the most extraordinary thing there isThe mind is the source of the DhammaThis is what it means to know stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbandingThis is the substance of virtue concentration and discernmentWhoever can do this will reach release nibbanaWhoever can give rise to the Dhamma of study and practice within themselves will meet with the Dhamma of attainment without a doubtThis is why its said to be sanditthiko visible in the present akaliko bearing fruit no matter what the time or seasonKeep working at it alwaysFor the heart to go and do harm to other people we first have to open the way for itIn other words we start out by doing harm to ourselves and this clears the way from inside the house for us to go out and do harm to people outsideThe intention to do harm is a heavy form of selfharmAt the very least it uses up our time and destroys our opportunity to do goodWe have to wipe it out with the intention not to do harm  or in other words with concentrationThis is like seeing that theres plenty of unused space in our property and that we arent making enough for our livingWell have to leap out into the open field so as to give ourself the momentum for doing our full measure of goodness as the opportunity arisesNekkhammasankappo ie being at ease in quiet solitary placesAbyapadasankappo We dont have to think about our own bad points or the bad points of othersAvihinsasankappo not creating trouble or doing harm to ourselves ie not thinking about our own shortcomings which would depress us if we think about our own shortcomings itll spread like wildfire to the shortcomings of othersFor this reason wise people lift their thoughts to the level of goodness so that they can feel love and good will for themselves and so that they can then feel love and good will for others as wellWhen our mind has these three forms of energy its like a table with three legs that can spin in all directionsTo put it another way once our mind has spun up to this high a level we can take pictures of everything above and below usWell develop discernment like a bright light or like binoculars that can magnify every detailThis is called ñana  intuitive awareness that can know everything in the world LokaviduThe discernment here isnt ordinary knowledge or insightIts a special cognitive skill the skill of the Noble PathWell give rise to three eyes in the heart so as to see the reds and greens the highs and lows of the mundane world a sport for those with wisdomOur internal eyes will look at the Dhamma in front and behind above and below and all around us so as to know all the ins and outs of goodness and evilThis is discernmentWell be at our ease feeling pleasure with no pain interfering at allThis is called vijjacaranasampanno  being fully equipped with cognitive skillA person whose heart has discernment is capable of helping the nation and the religion just as a farmer who grows rice that can be sold both inside and outside the country strengthens the nations economyA person without discernment will make the religion degenerateWhen he brings disaster on himself the disaster will have to spread to others as wellIn other words a single solitary person with no goodness to him  nothing but defilements and craving  can do evil to the point where he wipes himself out and it will spread to wipe out people all over the countryBut when a person has the three above virtues in his or her heart they will turn into the strength of concentrationThe heart will be as clear as crystal or a diamondThe whole world will become transparentDiscernment will arise the skill of liberating insight and intuitive understanding all at onceWhoever sees the world as having highs and lows doesnt yet have true intuitive discernmentWhoever has the eye of intuition will see that there are no highs no lows no rich no poorEverything is equal in terms of the three common characteristics inconstant stressful and notselfIts like the equality of democracyTheir home is the same as our home with no differences at allPeople commit burglaries and robberies these days because they dont see equalityThey think that this person is good that person isnt this house is a good place to eat that house isnt this house is a good place to sleep that house isnt etcIts because they dont have insight the eye of discernment that theres all this confusion and turmoilKeep your attention focused exclusively on the body  a cubit wide a fathom long a span thickThis is the middle pathIf you make your awareness of the breath too narrow youll end up sitting stock stiff with no alertness at allIf you make your awareness too broad  all the way to heaven and hell  you can end up falling for aberrant perceptionsSo neither extreme is goodYou have to keep things moderate and just right if you want to be on the right trackIf you dont have a sense of how to practice correctly then even if you ordain until you die buried in heaps of yellow robes you wont succeed in the practiceYou lay people can sit in concentration till your hair turns white your teeth fall out and your backs get all crooked and bent but youll never get to see nibbanaIf we can get our practice on the Noble Path though well enter nibbanaVirtue will disband concentration will disband discernment will disbandIn other words we wont dwell on our knowledge or discernmentIf were intelligent enough to know we simply know without taking intelligence as being an essential part of ourselvesOn the lower level were not stuck on virtue concentration or discernmentOn a higher level were not stuck on the stages of streamentry oncereturning or nonreturningNibbana isnt stuck on the world the world isnt stuck on nibbanaOnly at this point can we use the term arahantThis is where we can relaxThey can say inconstant but its just what they sayThey can say stress but its just what they sayThey can say notself but its just what they sayWhatever they say thats the way it isIts true for them and theyre completely right  but completely wrongAs for us only if we can get ourselves beyond right and wrong will we be doing fineRoads are built for people to walk on but dogs and cats can walk on them as wellSane people and crazy people will use the roads They didnt build the roads for crazy people but crazy people have every right to use themAs for the precepts even fools and idiots can observe themThe same with concentration Crazy or sane they can come and sitAnd discernment We all have the right to come and talk our heads off but its simply a question of being right or wrongNone of the valuables of the mundane world give any real pleasureTheyre nothing but stressTheyre good as far as the world is concerned but nibbana doesnt have any need for themRight views and wrong views are an affair of the worldNibbana doesnt have any right views or wrong viewsFor this reason whatever is a wrong view we should abandonWhatever is a right view we should develop  until the day it can fall from our graspThats when we can be at our easeAsokaram the night of April After we had gathered at the meditation hall and said our chants Ajaan Lee delivered a sermonAt first all I heard was the opening phrase namo tassa etc without hearing what Pali stanza he was going to take as his theme as his voice was very weak and the wind outside so strong that my ears were ringingSo I tried to still my mind and keep listening even though I couldnt make out a word he said until the sermon was almost over when I was able to catch the following To purify the heart we have to disentangle our attachments to self to the body to mental phenomena and to all the objects that come passing in through the sensesKeep the mind intent on concentrationKeep it one at all timesDont let it become two three four five etc because once youve made the mind one its easy to make it zeroSimply cut off the little head and pull the two ends togetherBut if you let the mind become many its a long difficult job to make it zeroAnd another thing If you put the zero after other numbers they become ten twenty thirty forty fifty hundreds thousands on to infinityBut if you put the zeros first even if you have ten thousand of them they dont countSo it is with the heart Once weve turned it from one to zero and put the zero first then other people can praise or criticize us as they like but it wont countGood doesnt count bad doesnt countThis is something that cant be written cant be read that we can understand only for ourselvesWhen theres no more counting like this the heart attains purity and the highest happiness as in the Pali stanzawhich means Nibbana is the ultimate void emptiness zeroNibbana is the ultimate easeThis is why were taught to make the mind one at all times  so that we can easily erase it into zeroOnce we can make it zero were bound to loosen our attachments to all thingsOur heart will reach purity which is nibbanaThe definitions given here are based on the meanings these words have in Ajaan Lees writings and sermonsTerms marked with a single asterisk are taken from the standard chant of the qualities of the Buddha those with a double asterisk from the chant of the qualities of the DhammaIf anything in this translation is inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their wayAs for whatever may be accurate I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain the truth to which it pointsMy alms bowl is central to my lifeA symbol of the Theravada Buddhist monastic tradition in which I trained it is the soul of my mendicancy  coming emptyhanded before the laity to receive material nourishment and responding to their generositySometimes that means reciprocating with a teaching from the Buddha sometimes with a blessing chant or simply an expression of gratitude and kindnessI am a beggar and I must also be trueIt is not easy to be a true beggarI have to be worthy to be fed by the kindness of others and have all my needs providedThis way is rare and precious as are acts of generosity in a world so driven by greed and selfishnessCultivating the spiritual path with integrity demands much of a beggar primarily a faithful allegiance to the Vinaya the code by which I live as well as a sincere appreciation and respect for my supporters their devotion and hard work to obtain prepare and bring offerings even at considerable sacrificeIt also calls for contentment with little  a simplicity of being and a commitment to renounce on many levelsThese qualities develop through a vigilance of heart that is difficult to practise in a large wellfunded institutionIn those days when my monastic requisites especially meals were complete assured and generally abundant I used selfabstinence to remind myself of the value of all that was given to usOn occasion we also went on tudong or walked for alms in the nearby villages accepting whatever we received as our meal for the dayBut these were temporary privations  not a sustained way of lifeThey bore the flavor of heroic adventure but could hardly reflect the daily grind of spiritual endeavourIt was only after I left the mother monastery to live on my own in New Zealand a nonBuddhist country that I came to know true choicelessness at times facing physical hunger or a powerless isolationThis propelled me into a level of faith not demanded of me before especially on days when I received very little if anything that would serve as a mealAnd so I learnt to meditate on the emptiness of my bowl  consciously relinquishing desire for food and accepting hungerBearing hunger with faith led me beyond despair to a gratitude and joy for what I did receive  a feeling of fullness that was not borne of foodThese hardships ripened meI have gone hungryBut I have been able to keep going because every part of my body is made up of the lovingkindness from generous people who have cared for me for years and years and my life is composed of pure kindness and thanksgivingNow in my passage through Malaysia I have again taken the opportunity to walk pindapat in the local market of Penang where it is surprisingly easy to begI knew I would be wellfedWith my bowl secure in its harness around my shoulder and cradling it in my palms I stood between the main fruit and vegetable vendors and rows of flimsy stalls that display a collage of baby clothes ladies handbags jewellery household items and colourful trinketsI chanted for each person who stopped to make offeringsWithin minutes my bowl was weighed down with fruits biscuits pancakes rice and coconut delicacies and fried noodles  each wrapped in a colourful plastic bagThe early Sunday morning shoppers primarily local Chinese know what to do when they meet someone in robes going for almsIn this society Buddhist nuns rarely go pindapat and the monks who beg often accept moneyToday they saw a nun  a foreigner  receiving only offerings of food into her bowlWord spreadWhenever people tried to give money I had to be quick to cover my bowl with my handAmazed they returned with sweetmeats sticky rice or fruitsMore came and when my bowl was brimming they piled their offerings into a growing collection of pink plastic bags at my feetWith all this attention I was distracted from my normal practice of focusing on the bowl and meditating on emptinessThe first time someone knelt and made anjali I quickly removed my sandals before chanting a blessing Sukhi hotu avera hotu abhayapaja hotuI had not wandered out barefoot as the Buddha would have done because of the rubbish everywhere but it felt wrong to receive her respect wearing shoesRemembering how I had thrown off my sandals and walked the filthy streets of Yangon last year to beg for alms inspired me to be barefoot againI continued to stand softly chanting the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta to myself and giving blessings each time someone placed more food in my bowlI felt the turning of the wheel of Dharma and reflected on the thousands of years that this way of begging and receiving has nurtured the faithfulAnd here again it was being upheld by simple acts of kindness  now a child with a bag of fried rolls now a woman with jackfruit now an Indian man curious to know from which country I hailedSome asked whether to place their offerings directly into the bags at my feet when they saw the bowl overflowingI wanted at least to accept each offering in my hand if I could not with my bowl and so create a sense of connection and relationship chant a blessing and bear witness to their kindnessIt was in one of these moments between the overflow of the bowl and the rush of generosity that I suddenly felt a hypocriteI was wellfed staying with my devotee lacking nothing and the bags were spilling out beside meWhat right did I have to stand there and begHow could I dare hold my bowl out to be filled again and again when so much had already been givenWhat right did I have even to begin to begStifling and sweating in my robes these questions crowded my mindI remembered the story of the Sorcerers Apprentice who tried to clean while the brooms multiplied and kept bringing more water It seemed absurd to be juggling so many bags of food when I had no hunger in my bellyNot even half an hour had elapsedEmbarrassed anxious and feeling unworthy of receiving the tide of generosity I fretfully looked about hoping my devotee would return soon to collect meAnd then to calm my mind I began to chant more loudlyContemplating the Four Noble Truths with eyes downcast I watched the feet of all who passed me  sandals of every colour and style high heels and broken shoes human beings of all ages shuffling hobbling or brisk in paceLooking at their faces I saw the bent disabled and healthy the dishevelled and welldressed the shrivelled and overweight smiles and grimaces distracted expressions and downturned mouths mothers infants a father grasping the hand of his small son bicycles and litter traders shouting and the smells of the market the world  the WorldMy heart grew bright with compassionI knew that I was standing there to let my bowl be filled again and again by those who love TruthHungry or not I had every right to receive what they freely gaveI was not abusing that beauty because it was not for me that they filled the bowlI was a beggar for love of that blessedness and the filling and emptying of my bowl was the natural process of each of our lives being remembered and honoured in random acts of kindnessI receive and I give backNewcomers to Buddhism are usually impressed by the clarity directness and earthy practicality of the Dhamma as embodied in such basic teachings as the Four Noble Truths the Noble Eightfold Path and the threefold trainingThese teachings as clear as daylight are accessible to any serious seeker looking for a way beyond sufferingWhen however these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth they often balk convinced it just doesnt make senseAt this point they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculationEven modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriouslySome dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage ancient Indian metaphysics that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his ageOthers interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypesA few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth arguing that they must be interpolationsA quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substanceThe teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tattersMoreover when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms  the hells the animal world the spirit realm the human world and the heavens  they never hint that these terms are meant symbolicallyTo the contrary they even say that rebirth occurs with the breakup of the body after death which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literallyIn this essay I wont be arguing the case for the scientific validity of rebirthInstead I wish to show that the idea of rebirth makes senseI will be contending that it makes sense in two ways first in that it is intelligible having meaning both intrinsically and in relation to the Dhamma as a whole and second in that it helps us to make sense to understand our own place in the worldI will try to establish this in relation to three domains of discourse the ethical the ontological and the soteriologicalDont be frightened by the big words the meaning will become clear as we go alongFirst the teaching of rebirth makes sense in relation to ethicsFor early Buddhism the conception of rebirth is an essential plank of its ethical theory providing an incentive for avoiding evil and doing goodIn this context the doctrine of rebirth is correlated with the principle of kamma which asserts that all our morally determinate actions our wholesome and unwholesome deeds have an inherent power to bring forth fruits that correspond to the moral quality of those deedsRead together the twin teachings of rebirth and kamma show that a principle of moral equilibrium obtains between our actions and the felt quality of our lives such that morally good deeds bring agreeable results bad deeds disagreeable resultsIt is only too obvious that such moral equilibrium cannot be found within the limits of a single lifeWe can observe often poignantly that morally unscrupulous people might enjoy happiness esteem and success while people who lead lives of the highest integrity are bowed down beneath pain and miseryFor the principle of moral equilibrium to work some type of survival beyond the present life is required for kamma can bring its due retribution only if our individual stream of consciousness does not terminate with deathTwo different forms of survival are possible on the one hand an eternal afterlife in heaven or hell on the other a sequence of rebirthsOf these alternatives the hypothesis of rebirth seems far more compatible with moral justice than an eternal afterlife for any finite good action it seems must eventually exhaust its potency and no finite bad action no matter how bad should warrant eternal damnationIt may be the case that this insistence on some kind of moral equity is an illusion an unrealistic demand we superimpose on a universe cold and indifferent to our hopesThere is no logical way to prove the validity of rebirth and kammaThe naturalist might just be right in holding that personal existence comes to an end at death and with it all prospects for moral justiceNevertheless I believe such a thesis flies in the face of one of our deepest moral intuitions a sense that some kind of moral justice must ultimately prevailTo show that this is so let us consider two limiting cases of ethically decisive actionAs the limiting case of immoral action let us take Hitler who was directly responsible for the dehumanizing deaths of perhaps ten million peopleAs the limiting case of moral action let us consider a man who sacrifices his own life to save the lives of total strangersNow if there is not survival beyond death both men reap the same ultimate destinyBefore dying perhaps Hitler experiences some pangs of despair the selfsacrificing hero enjoys a few seconds knowing hes performing a noble deedThen beyond that  nothing except in others memoriesBoth are obliterated reduced to lifeless flesh and bonesNow the naturalist might be correct in drawing this conclusion and in holding that those who believe in survival and retribution are just projecting their own wishes out upon the worldBut I think something within us resists consigning both Hitler and our compassionate hero to the same fateThe reason we resist is because we have a deep intuitive sense that a principle of moral justice is at work in the world regulating the course of events in such a way that our good and bad actions rebound upon ourselves to bring the appropriate fruitWhere the naturalist holds that this intuition amounts to nothing more than a projection of our own ideals out upon the world I would contend that the very fact that we can conceive a demand for moral justice has a significance that is more than merely psychologicalHowever vaguely our subjective sense of moral justice reflects an objective reality a principle of moral equilibrium that is not mere projection but is built into the very bedrock of actualityThe above considerations are not intended to make belief in rebirth a necessary basis for ethicsThe Buddha himself does not try to found ethics on the ideas of kamma and rebirth but uses a purely naturalistic type of moral reasoning that does not presuppose personal survival or the working of kammaThe gist of his reasoning is simply that we should not mistreat others  by injuring them stealing their belongings exploiting them sexually or deceiving them  because we ourselves are averse to being treated in such waysNevertheless though the Buddha does not found ethics on the theory of rebirth he does make belief in kamma and rebirth a strong inducement to moral behaviorWhen we recognize that our good and bad actions can rebound upon ourselves determining our future lives and bringing us happiness or suffering this gives us a decisive reason to avoid unwholesome conduct and to diligently pursue the goodThe Buddha includes belief in rebirth and kamma in his definition of right view and their explicit denial in wrong viewIt is not that the desire for the fruits of good karma should be ones main motive for leading a moral life but rather that acceptance of these teachings inspires and reinforces our commitment to ethical idealsThese twin principles open a window to a wider background against which our pursuit of the moral life unfoldsThey show us that our present living conditions our dispositions and aptitudes our virtues and faults result from our actions in previous livesWhen we realize that our present conditions reflect our kammic past we will also realize that our present actions are the legacy that we will transmit to our kammic descendants that is to ourselves in future livesThe teaching of rebirth thus enables us to face the future with fortitude dignity and courageIf we recognize that no matter how debilitating our present conditions might be no matter how limiting and degrading we can still redeem ourselves we will be spurred to exercise our will for the achievement of our future goodBy our present actions of body speech and mind we can transform ourselves and by transforming ourselves we can surmount all inner and outer obstacles and advance toward the final goalThe teachings of kamma and rebirth have a still deeper ethical significance than as simple pointers to moral responsibilityThey show us not only that our personal lives are shaped by our own kammic past but also that we live in an ethically meaningful universeTaken in conjunction they make the universe a cosmos an orderly integrated whole with dimensions of significance that transcend the merely physicalThe levels of order that we have access to by direct inspection or scientific investigation do not exhaust all the levels of cosmic orderThere is system and pattern not only in the physical and biological domains but also in the ethical and the teachings of kamma and rebirth reveal just what that pattern isAlthough this ethical order is invisible to our fleshly eyes and cannot be detected by scientific apparatus this does not mean it is not realBeyond the range of normal perception a moral law holds sway over our deeds and via our deeds over our destinyIt is just the principle of kamma operating across the sequence of rebirths that locks our volitional actions into the dynamics of the cosmos thus making ethics an expression of the cosmoss own intrinsic orderlinessAt this point ethics begins to shade into ontology which we will examine in the next part of this essayThe teaching of rebirth taken in conjunction with the doctrine of kamma implies that we live in a morally ordered universe one in which our morally determinate actions bring forth fruits that in some way correspond to their own ethical qualityThough the moral law that links our actions with their fruits cannot be demonstrated experimentally in the same way that physical and chemical laws can be this does not mean it is not realIt means only that like quarks and quasars it operates beyond the threshold of sensory perceptionFar from being a mere projection of our subjective ideals the moral law locks our volitional deeds into an allembracing cosmic order that is perfectly objective in that it functions independently of our personal desires views and beliefsThus when we submit our behavior to the rule of ethics we are not simply acting in ways that merit moral approvalBy conforming to the principles of ethics we are doing nothing less than aligning ourselves with the Dhamma the universal law of righteousness and truth which stands at the bedrock of the cosmosThis brings us to the ontological aspect of the Buddhist teaching on rebirth its implications for understanding the nature of beingBuddhism sees the process of rebirth as integral to the principle of conditionality that runs through all existenceThe sentient universe is regulated by different orders of causation layered in such a way that higher orders of causation can exercise dominion over lower onesThus the order of kamma which governs the process of rebirth dominates the lower orders of physical and biological causation bending their energies toward the fulfillment of its own potentialThe Buddha does not posit a divine judge who rules over the workings of kamma rewarding and punishing us for our deedsThe kammic process functions autonomously without a supervisor or director entirely through the intrinsic power of volitional actionInterwoven with other orders in the vast complex web of conditionality our deeds produce their consequences just as naturally as seeds in a field bring forth their appropriate herbs and flowersTo understand how kamma can produce its effects across the succession of rebirths we must invert our normal everyday conception of the relationship between consciousness and matterUnder the influence of materialistic biases we assume that material existence is determinative of consciousnessBecause we witness bodies being born into this world and observe how the mind matures in tandem with the body we tacitly take the body to be the foundation of our existence and mind or consciousness an evolutionary offshoot of blind material processesMatter wins the honored status of objective reality and mind becomes an accidental intruder upon an inherently senseless universeFrom the Buddhist perspective however consciousness and the world coexist in a relationship of mutual creation which equally require both termsJust as there can be no consciousness without a body to serve as its physical support and a world as its sphere of cognition so there can be no physical organism and no world without some type of consciousness to constitute them as an organism and worldThough temporally neither mind nor matter can be regarded as prior to the other in terms of practical importance the Buddha says that mind is the forerunnerMind is the forerunner not in the sense that it arises before the body or can exist independently of a physical substratum but in the sense that the body and the world in which we find ourselves reflect our mental activityIt is mental activity in the form of volition that constitutes kamma and it is our stock of kamma that steers the stream of consciousness from the past life into a new bodyThus the Buddha says This body O monks is old kamma to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition as something to be feltIt is not only the body as a composite whole that is the product of past kamma but the sense faculties tooThe eye ear nose tongue bodysense and mindbase are also fashioned by our past kamma and thus kamma to some degree shapes and influences all our sensory experienceSince kamma is ultimately explained as volition this means that the particular body with which we are endowed with all its distinguishing features and faculties of sense is rooted in our volitional activities in earlier livesPrecisely how past volition can influence the development of the zygote lies beyond the range of scientific explanation but if the Buddhas words are to be trusted such an influence must be realThe channel for the transmission of kammic influence from life to life across the sequence of rebirths is the individual stream of consciousnessConsciousness embraces both phases of our being  that in which we generate fresh kamma and that in which we reap the fruits of old kamma  and thus in the process of rebirth consciousness bridges the old and new existencesConsciousness is not a single transmigrating entity a self or soul but a stream of evanescent acts of consciousness each of which arises briefly subsists and then passes awayThis entire stream however though made up of evanescent units is fused into a unified whole by the causal relations obtaining between all the occasions of consciousness in any individual continuumAt a deep level each occasion of consciousness inherits from its predecessor the entire kammic legacy of that particular stream in perishing it in turn passes that content on to its successor augmented by its own novel contributionThus our volitional deeds do not exhaust their full potential in their immediately visible effectsEvery volitional deed that we perform when it passes leaves behind a subtle imprint stamped upon the onwardflowing stream of consciousnessThe deed deposits in the stream of consciousness a seed capable of bearing fruit of producing a result that matches the ethical quality of the deedWhen we encounter suitable external conditions the kammic seeds deposited in our mental continuum rise up from their dormant condition and produce their fruitsThe most important function performed by kamma is to generate rebirth into an appropriate realm a realm that provides a field for it to unfold its stored potentialsThe bridge between the old existence and the new is as we said above the evolving stream of consciousnessIt is within this stream of consciousness that the kamma has been created through the exercise of volition it is this same stream of consciousness flowing on that carries the kammic energies into the new existence and it is again this same stream of consciousness that experiences the fruitConceivably at the deepest level all the individual streams of consciousness are integrated into a single allembracing matrix so that beneath the surface of events the separate kammic accumulations of all living beings crisscross overlap and mergeThis hypothesis  though speculative  would help account for the strange coincidences we sometimes meet that prick holes in our assumptions of rational orderThe generative function of kamma in the production of new existence is described by the Buddha in a short but pithy sutta preserved in the Anguttara NikayaVenerable Ananda approaches the Master and says Existence existence is spoken of venerable sirIn what way is there existence The Buddha replies If there were no kamma ripening in the sensory realm no sensesphere existence would be discernedIf there where no kamma ripening in the form realm no formsphere existence would be discernedIf there were no kamma ripening in the formless realm no formlesssphere existence would be discernedTherefore Ananda kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture for beings obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving to be established in a new realm of existence either low middling or highAs long as ignorance and craving the twin roots of the round of rebirths remain intact in our mental continuum at the time of death one especially powerful kamma will become ascendant and propel the stream of consciousness to the realm of existence that corresponds to its own vibrational frequency When consciousness as the seed becomes planted or established in that realm it sprouts forth into the rest of the psychophysical organism summed up in the expression name and formAs the organism matures it provides the site for other past kammas to gain the opportunity to produce their resultsThen within this new existence in response to our various kammically induced experiences we engage in actions that engender fresh kamma with the capacity to generate still another rebirthThereby the round of existence keeps turning from one life to the next as the stream of consciousness swept along by craving and steered by kamma assumes successive modes of embodimentThe ultimate implication of the Buddhas teaching on kamma and rebirth is that human beings are the final masters of their own destinyThrough our unwholesome deeds rooted in greed hatred and delusion we create unwholesome kamma the generative cause of bad rebirths of future misery and bondageThrough our wholesome deeds rooted in generosity kindness and wisdom we beautify our minds and thereby create kamma productive of a happy rebirthBy using wisdom to dig more deeply below the superficial face of things we can uncover the subtle truths hidden by our preoccupation with appearancesThereby we can uproot the binding defilements and win the peace of deliverance the freedom beyond the cycle of kamma and its fruitThis aspect of the Buddhist teaching on rebirth will be explored more fully in the third part of this essayThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arosePhra Ajaan Lee was born in in a rural village in Ubon Ratchathani province northeastern ThailandAt the age of he was ordained as a monk at the temple in his home village and there began his study of Buddhist doctrine and monastic disciplineHe discovered much to his distress that life in his temple  as in most temples in Thailand at the time  had little to do with the practice of the Buddhas teachingsAs he wrote later in his autobiography Instead of observing the duties of the contemplative life we were out to have a good time playing chess wrestling playing match games with girls whenever there was a wake Whenever I looked into the books on monastic discipline Id start felling really uneasyI told myself If you dont want to leave the monkhood youre going to have to leave this templeSoon after making this resolution he happened to meet a monk of the wandering ascetic tradition founded by Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasīlo and Phra Ajaan Mun BhūridattoImpressed both with the mans teachings and with his way of life Ajaan Lee set out on foot to find Ajaan Mun and to become his studentHe spent two very intensive periods studying with Ajaan Mun once that first year in the forests of Ubon and then again four years later at Wat Chedi Luang in Chieng MaiAjaan Mun and Ajaan Sao were unique in their time in teaching that the way to nibbāna was still open and the training they gave their students in the direction of that goal was also unique involving not only intensive meditation practice but also the total reeducation of the students character his habits values and powers of observationAs Ajaan Lee wrote in his autobiography Staying with Ajaan Mun was very good for me but also very hardI had to be willing to learn everything anew Some days hed be cross with me saying that I was messy that I never put anything in the right place  but hed never tell me what the right places were To be able to stay with him any length of time you had to be very observant and very circumspectYou couldnt leave footprints on the floor you couldnt make noise when you swallowed water or opened the windows or doorsThere had to be a science to everything you did  hanging out robes arranging bedding everythingOtherwise hed drive you out even in the middle of the Rains RetreatEven then youd just have to take it and try to use your powers of observationIn other matters such as sitting and walking meditation he trained me in every way to my complete satisfactionBut I was able to keep up with him at best only about percent of the timeAfter Ajaan Lees second period of training Ajaan Mun sent him out into the forests of northern Thailand to wander and meditate on his ownAjaan Lees wanderings eventually took him through every part of Thailand as well as into Burma Cambodia and IndiaOf all of Ajaan Muns students Ajaan Lee was the first to bring the teachings of the forest tradition into the mainstream of Thai society in central ThailandIn he founded a temple Wat Paa Khlawng Kung in a cemetery near Chanthaburi on the southeast coast and in he founded Wat Asokaram in a marshy area at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River on the outskirts of BangkokHe drew students  monks and lay people men and women  from all levels of society and all walks of lifeIn he was given the ecclesiastical rank of Chao Khun with the title Phra Suddhidhammaraṅsī GambhīramedhācariyaHe passed away inEven in his last years though he continued to retreat regularly into the forestTo quote again from his autobiography Living in the forest as I like to do has given me a lot to think about Its a quiet place where you can observe the influences of the environmentTake the wild rooster If it went around acting like a domestic rooster the cobras and mongooses would make a meal of it in no time So it is with us If we spend all out time wallowing in companionship were like a knife or a hoe stuck down into the dirt  itll rust easilyBut if its constantly sharpened on a stone or a file rust wont have a chance to take holdSo we should learn always to be on the alertLiving in the forest the mind becomes confidentThe Dhamma youve studied  or even that you havent studied  will make itself clear because nature is the teacherIts like the sciences of the world which every country has used to develop amazing powers None of their inventions or discoveries came out of textbooksThey came because scientists studied the principles of nature all of which appear right here in the worldAs for the Dhamma its just like science It exists in natureWhen I realized this I no longer worried about studying the scriptures and I was reminded of the Lord Buddha and his disciples They studied and learned from the principles of natureNone of them followed a textbookFor these reasons Im willing to be ignorant when it comes to texts and scripturesSome kinds of trees sleep at night and are awake during the dayOthers sleep by day and are awake by nightThis book on the frames of reference is based to some extent on my own thoughts and opinionsIn some spots it may not be directly in line with the original texts because my primary aim has been to get to the heart of the matter so that it can be conveniently put into practiceThose who hold zealously to the texts may feel that what I have written is wrong but as for me I feel that whoever is able to practice in line with what is written here will find that it can be taken as a guide to the true principles of concentration discernment and releaseTo hold to the texts isnt wrong but they should be held to discerningly just as in medicine A doctor who thinks that the only way to cure a fever is to drink a concoction of boiled neem and quinine leaves is wrongSome doctors may add the leaves of other trees and make it into a powder some may make a concentrated extract others may vary the dosageIn the same way when practicing the Dhamma to go no further than the texts may in some cases be wrongActually any path that abandons defilement and brings relief from suffering is rightThe value of medicine lies in its ability to cure disease the value of a method of practice lies in its ability to abandon defilementAs far as I can see there is nothing wrong with any method that has been found to workIn the end all such methods must follow the basic principles of virtue concentration and discernment and differ only as to whether they are crude or sophisticated direct or indirect fast or slowNow I dont want to set myself up as an absolute authority of any kindThus I want you the reader to use your own discernmentTake whatever passage seems right for you as a basis for your practiceThere is no need to follow the entire bookSimply focus on a single point and that will be enoughOnce you have mastered an important point all the other sections will come together and connect right thereWhen you are ready to meditate you should try to find a quiet solitary place to assist in your practice of the frames of referenceOtherwise your practice wont go smoothly because solitude is desirable for all spiritual seekers in generalJust as a person who wants to look at his reflection in the water will be able to see himself clearly only when the water is still with no wind rippling across the surface in the same way a person who wants peace that is subtle and profound has to conduct himself in this mannerOr to put it another way there has to be external peace and quiet before internal peace will ariseWhen both forms of peace are present you will know and see the Dhamma as it actually isSo when you put this form of meditation into practice you should first say your chants and pay respect to the Buddha in whatever way you are accustomed to and then begin sitting in meditationYou are sure to obtain genuine results in line with what I have written hereIf there is anything defective or wrong in this book I trust that the reader will show me forgiveness for Im not much of an expert when it comes to the textsIve simply learned a few parts and put them into practiceOne more point This practice of training the heart is very important in that it forms the source of all goodness and merit and whatever is the source of goodness and merit deserves special care and attentionThe heart is a vessel for all that is goodWhen the heart is pure any meritorious actions you may perform externally will truly foster happinessExternal merit is like a tasty curryIf its served in a filthy dish then even though the curry may be delicious the person eating it wont want to eat his fill because of the filthBut if the dish is clean and the curry delicious the person eating is likely to eat with confidence to his hearts contentIn the same way if the heart is clean it will find itself attracted to performing externally meritorious actionsIt will always be ready to make sacrifices because in every case it will taste the nourishment of its goodnessNot only that a clean heart also forms the path for release from stress and suffering leading ultimately to nibbānaThose who are to reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbāna will do so by way of the heartIf the heart isnt trained then no matter how much external goodness you may have you wont be able to reach nibbānaNibbāna can be attained only by training the heart in the practice of virtue concentration and discernmentVirtue forms the basis for concentration concentration the basis for discernment and discernment the basis for releaseConcentration is especially important because it forms the basis for discernment and intuitive understanding which are the crucial factors of the pathYou cant do without concentrationIf concentration is lacking you can gain nothing but jumbled thoughts and obsessions without any sound supportConcentration is like a nail and discernment a hammerIf the nail isnt held firm and straight the hammer will strike it only hitormiss and the nail will never get through the boardFor the heart to penetrate the world and get through to the highest Dhamma it must take a firm stance in concentration so as to give rise to intuitive understandingIntuitive understanding can occur only to those who have centered the mind in concentrationAs for discernment its something we all have but if it lacks intuitive understanding it can never get beyond the worldFor this reason we should all take an interest in the factors that form the path leading beyond suffering and stress to abundant wellbeingIf you have questions about any part of this book please feel free to ask at any timeThe merit coming from the writing of this book I ask to dedicate to all those who have felt inspired to help pay for its printing costs so that it can be distributed freely as a gift of DhammaMay the power arising from this gift bear them fruit so that whatever they aspire to that is upright and just may succeed in bringing them happiness in every wayAn explanation of the four frames of reference which are  for those who put them into practice  a means for freedom from defilementIn order to use these four frames of reference as a means for centering the mind you must first familiarize yourself with the following three qualitiesOtherwise you cant say that youre standing firm on your frame of referenceThe truth of the matter is that the translations given above are too narrow  for in dealing with the frames of reference mere mindfulness isnt enoughWhen its not enough and yet you keep being mindful of the body you will give rise only to feelings of pleasure and displeasure because the duty of mindfulness is simply to keep remembering or referring to an objectSo in developing the frames of reference you have to know your tools for remembering This can be illustrated as follows The body is like a sawmillThe mind is like a drive shaftAlertness is the pulley that spins around the drive shaft in one spotMindfulness is the belt that ties the mind to its object not letting it slip away to other objectsArdency  focused investigation  is the saw blade that keeps cutting the logs into pieces so that they can be of useThese three qualities must always be present for your practice of centering the mind to succeedNow we will discuss the work to be done the objects for which focused investigation alertness and mindfulness are responsible each its separate wayThe objects are four These are the four things for which you must be responsibleThe term body here refers to conglomerations of the four properties both those that have consciousness directing them and those that no longer do but that still appear to the eyeBoth sorts are termed physical bodiesBodies can be considered under three aspects The body whether inner or outer is simply a matter of the four propertiesNow that you know your duties you have to perform them properlySampajañña Keep your alertness in place right at the mind withinYou dont have to direct it anywhere elseSati Your mindfulness has to be allroundIn other words refer inwardly to the mind and then out to the object  in this case the physical body  and then watch after the mind and its object to make sure that they dont slip away from each othertappa Focus ardently on investigating the physical body analyzing it into its various aspectsThis can be done in any of five waysAnicca Its inconstant unstable always shifting precariously aboutDukkha Its hard to endureAnattā Its not you yours or anyone elsesYou didnt bring it with you when you came and cant take it with you when you goWhen you die youll have to throw it away like an old log or a piece of kindlingTheres nothing of any substance or worth to it at allWhen you consider things in this way youll come to feel a sense of dismay and detachment that will make the mind steady still and firmly centered in concentrationThese five activities are the duties of your focused investigation fighting to see the true nature of the physical bodyAs for mindfulness it has to follow its own duties referring to the object under investigation at the same time referring to the mind withinDont make reference to anything elseKeep check on whether or not you have your mind on what youre doing This is alertnessKeep track of your mind observing it at all times to see in what ways it might be acting or reacting on youKeep your alertness always in place right at the heartAll the activities mentioned here are aspects of taking the body as a frame of referenceWhether you are dealing with the inner body with outer bodies or with the body in and of itself you have to use the three qualities mentioned aboveOnly when you have them fully developed can you say that you are developing the great frame of referenceNormally mindfulness is a quality we all have but when it lacks alertness it falls into wrong ways becoming Wrong MindfulnessBut when you can follow the methods outlined above you are sure to develop a disinterested steadiness of mindYou will come to feel a sense of dismay and detachment that will make the mind quiet calm and unperturbedThis is the ladder of liberating insight leading to nibbāna which people of wisdom and experience have guaranteedThis ends the discussion of keeping the body in mind as a frame of referenceThe word feeling refers to the experiencing of sensations that arise from ones own actions or kammaThere are three sorts of feelings inner feelings or moods outer feelings and feelings in and of themselvesThese feelings are called out feelings because they are connected with the external sense mediaThe cause of stress first arises when alertness is weak and the mind vacillatesThe vacillation is called craving for notbecomingAs the movement becomes stronger a mental current arises and goes straying outThe current that strays out is craving for becomingWhen it comes across a thought or sensory object and grabs hold thats called craving for sensualityFor this reason you should watch after the mind to make sure that it stays with its one object its feeling of pleasureDont let any other preoccupations get involvedKeep your mindfulness and alertness firmly in place and then make a focused investigation of the truth of that feelingOnly when you do this can you say that you are making use of feelings in and of themselves as a frame of referenceBy and large whenever a mood or feeling arises we tend to give rise to various hopes or desiresFor instance when a good mood arises we want that sense of wellbeing to stay as it is or to increaseThis desire gives rise to stress and so we receive results contrary to what we had hoped forSometimes a bad mood arises and we dont want it so we struggle to find happiness and this simply piles on more sufferingSometimes the heart is neutral  neither happy nor sad neither pleased nor displeased  and we want to stay that way constantly or else we start to think that staying neutral is stupid or inaneThis gives rise to more desires and we start to struggle for something better than what we already areWhen this happens we cant say that were firmly based on our frame of reference  for even though we may be mindful of the fact that a good or a bad or a neutral feeling has arisen were not beyond itThis shows that we lack the three qualities that can nurture and support mindfulness in becoming a factor of the PathIn other words start out with alertness firmly established and then use mindfulness to connect the mind with its objectDont let the mind slip away from the object and dont let the object slip away from the mindKeep mindfulness firmly in reference to the object and watch the mind to make sure that it stays fixed on its one objectAs for the object its the responsibility of your focused investigation to keep track of whatever aspect of feeling may appear inner or outer happy sad or neutralIf we were to express this in terms of the factors of the Path wed have to do so as follows The alertness that constantly watches after the mind keeping it at normalcy making sure that it doesnt fall into unskillful ways is virtueThe mindfulness that keeps the mind connected with its object so that it doesnt slip away to other objects is concentrationThe focused investigation that penetrates into each object as it arises so as to know its true nature clearly  knowing both arising and disbanding as well as nonarising and nondisbanding  is discernmentThese three qualities have to arise together in a single mental moment for the Path to come together and then the Path will function on its own in line with its duties enabling you to see clearly and know truly without having to let go of this or work at that work at this or let go of that let go of the outside or work at the inside work at the outside or let go of the inside or whateverWhen all three of these qualities are gathered together you can deal with any feeling at all  past present or future pleasant unpleasant or neutral  because when these three qualities are fully developed they all connectThis is why I made the comparison at the beginning The mind is like a drive shaftAlertness is like a pulley spinning in place around the drive shaftMindfulness is like the belt that keeps the mind and its objects from slipping away from each otherFocused investigation is like the saw blade that works back and forth cutting each object to pieces  which is what is meant by bhagavantOnly a person who has the discernment to see in line with the truth in this way can be said to have fully mastered the use of feelings as a frame of referenceIn using the mind as a frame of reference there are three aspects to deal withThe mind inside refers to a state exclusively in the heart unrelated to any outer preoccupationsThe mind outside refers to its interaction with such outer preoccupations as sights sounds etcThe mind in and of itself refers to the act of singling out any aspect of the mind as it appears whether inside or outAs for the modes of the mind inside there are three The mind outside is divided into the same three aspects  states of passion irritation and delusion  but these are said to be outside because once any of these aspects arises it tends to go out and latch onto an outer preoccupation that simply serves to further aggravate the original state of passion irritation or delusionThe mind then doesnt clearly or truly understand its objectsIts knowledge goes off in various directions away from the truth seeing beauty for instance in things that arent beautiful constancy in things that are inconstant pleasure in things that are painful and self in things that are notselfAll of these things are aspects of the mind outsideThe mind in and of itself refers to the act of singling out any one of these aspects of the mindFor example sometimes passion arises sometimes irritation sometimes delusion Whichever aspect may be arising in the present single it outWith your alertness firmly in place be steadily mindful of that aspect of the mind without making reference to any other objects  and without letting any hopes or wants arise in that particular mental moment at allThen focus unwaveringly on investigating that state of mind until you know its truthThe truth of these states is that sometimes once theyve arisen they flare up and spread sometimes they die awayTheir nature is to arise for a moment and then dissolve away with nothing of any substance or worthWhen you are intent on examining things in this way  with your mindfulness alertness and powers of focused investigation firmly in place  then none of these defilements even though they may be appearing will have the chance to grow or spreadThis is like the baskets or jars used to cover new lettuce plants If no one removes the baskets the plants will never have a chance to grow and will simply wither away and dieThus you have to keep your alertness right with each mental state as it arisesKeep mindfulness constantly referring to its object and use your powers of focused investigation to burn into those defilements so as to keep them away from the heart at all timesTo put this another way all of the mental states mentioned above are like lettuce or greengram seedsMindfulness is like a basketAlertness is the person who scatters the seeds while the power of focused investigation is the heat of the sun that burns them upSo far we have mentioned only bad mental statesTheir opposites are good mental states virāgacitta  the mind free from the grip of passion adosacitta  the mind free from the irritation or anger that can lead to loss and ruin amohacitta  the mind free from delusion intoxication and misunderstandingsThese are skillful states of mind which form the root of all that is goodWhen they arise maintain them and observe them so that you can come to know the level of your mindThere are four levels of good mental states Some people when they reach this point believe that they have done away with defilement because they mistake the emptiness for nibbānaActually its only the first stage in the level of formlessness and so is still on the mundane levelIf you seriously want to know whether your mind is on the mundane or the transcendent level then observe it when you turn your awareness inward and make it still  when you feel a sense of peace and ease that seems to have no defilements adulterating it at allLet go of that mental state to see how it behaves on its ownIf defilements can reappear youre still on the mundane levelSometimes that mental state remains unchanged through the power of your own efforts but after a while you become unsure of your knowledgeYour mind has to keep fondling ie making a running commentary on itWhen this is the case dont go believing that your knowledge is in any way trueThere are many many kinds of knowledge The intellect knows the heart knows the mind knows consciousness knows discernment knows alertness knows awareness knows unawareness knowsAll these modes are based on knowledge they differ simply in how they knowIf you arent able to distinguish clearly among the different modes of knowing knowing can become confused  and so you might take wrong knowing to be right knowing or unawareness to be awareness or knowledge attached to suppositions to be freedom from suppositionsThus you should experiment and examine things carefully from all angles so that you can come to see for yourself which kind of knowledge is genuine and which is counterfeitCounterfeit knowledge merely knows but cant let goGenuine knowledge when it goes about knowing anything is bound to let goAll three levels of the mind discussed so far are on the mundane levelSuch attitudes are an obstacle to what is truly goodTake for example the longheld belief that goodness means to practice generosity virtue and meditation on the uposatha days Streamwinners have completely let go of such beliefsTheir hearts are no longer caught up in beliefs and customsTheir virtues no longer have preceptsIn other words they have reached the essence of virtueTheir virtue is free from the limits of timeIn this they differ from ordinary runofthemill peopleOrdinary people have to hand goodness over to external criteria  believing for instance that virtue lies on this day or that during the Rains Retreat during this or that month or year  and then holding fast to that belief maintaining that anyone who doesnt follow the custom cant be virtuousIn the end such people have a hard time finding the opportunity really to do goodThus we can say that they dont know the true criteria for goodnessAs for Streamwinners all the qualities of virtue have come in and filled their heartsThey are able to unshackle themselves from the conventional values of the world that say that this or that is goodWhat is truly good they have seen appear in their heartsGood lies right hereEvil lies right hereNeither depends on external activitiesThis is in line with the Buddhas sayingThis is what is meant by StreamwinnerStreamwinners are like people who have rowed their boats into the main current of the Chao Phraya River and so are destined to float down to the rivers mouth and into the sea of amata  deathless  nibbanaThere are three ways they can reach the seaThis  reaching the stream to nibbana  is the beginning stage of the transcendent levelIf you were to simplify the three Fetters you could do so as follows To be attached to the conscious body as being ones own is selfidentificationTo be attached to the activities of the body is attachment to precepts and practicesNot knowing how to separate the mind from the body or from ones activities makes one unable to see clearly and know truly This leads to uncertainty and doubtThese are simply my opinions on the matter so you who read this should consider things carefully on your ownThis ends the discussion of the transcendent and mundane skillful states of mindWhen you know the characteristics of the various mental states you should use the three qualities mentioned above as your tools Keep your mindfulness alertness and powers of focused investigation firmly in place at the mindTo be able to gain knowledge you have to use the power of focused investigation which is an aspect of discernment to know how mental states arise and fall pulling out taking a stance and then returning into stillnessYou must keep your attention fixed on investigating these things constantly in order to be able to know the arising and falling away of mental states  and you will come to know the nature of the mind that doesnt arise and doesnt fall awayTo know the arising and falling away of mental states of the past is one level of cognitive skill and deserves to be called knowledge of previous births To know the states of the mind as they change in the present deserves to be called knowledge of death and rebirth To know how to separate mental states from their objects knowing the primal nature of the mind knowing the current or force of the mind that flows to its objects separating the objects the current of mind that flows and the primal nature of the mind To be able to know in this way deserves to be called knowledge of the ending of mental effluents The objects or preoccupations of the mind are the effluent of sensualityThe current that flows is the effluent of a state of becomingNot knowing the nature of the mind is the effluent of unawarenessIf we were to express this in terms of the four Noble Truths we would have to do so as follows The objects or preoccupations of the mind are the truth of stressThe current of the mind that flows into and falls for its objects is the truth of the cause of stressThe mental state that penetrates in to see clearly the truth of all objects the current of the mind and the primal nature of the mind is called the mental moment that forms the PathTo let go of the objects the mental current and the nature of the mind without any sense of attachment is the truth of the disbanding of stressWhen the three qualities that assist the mind  alertness mindfulness and focused investigation  are vigorous and strong strong alertness becomes the awareness of release strong mindfulness becomes intuitive understanding and strong focused investigation becomes liberating insight the discernment that can stay fixed on knowing the truth of stress without permitting any sense of pleasure or displeasure for its object to ariseIntuitive understanding fathoms the cause of stress and the awareness of release knows the heart clearly all the way throughWhen you can know in this way you can say that you know rightlyHere I would like to back up and discuss the question of the mind in a little more detailThe word mind covers three aspectsAll of these aspects taken together make up the mindIf you dont know the mind in this way you cant say that you really know itAll you can do is say that the mind arises and falls away the mind doesnt rise or fall away the mind is good the mind is evil the mind becomes annihilated the mind doesnt become annihilated the mind is a dhamma the mind isnt a dhamma the mind gains release the mind doesnt gain release the mind is nibbāna the mind isnt nibbāna the mind is sensory consciousness the mind isnt sensory consciousness the mind is the heart the mind isnt the heartAs the Buddha taught there are only two paths to practice  the body speech and heart and the body speech and mind  and in the end both paths reach the same point Their true goal is releaseSo if you want to know the truth concerning any of the above issues you have to follow the path and reach the truth on your ownOtherwise youll have to argue endlesslyThese issues  for people who havent practiced all the way to clear insight  have been termed by people of wisdom as sedamocanakathā issues that can only make you break out in a sweatSo I would like to make a short explanation The primal nature of the mind is a nature that simply knowsThe current that thinks and streams out from knowing to various objects is a mental stateWhen this current connects with its objects and falls for them it becomes a defilement darkening the mind This is a mental state in interactionMental states by themselves and in interaction whether good or evil have to arise have to disband have to dissolve away by their very natureThe source of both these sorts of mental states is the primal nature of the mind which neither arises nor disbandsIt is a fixed phenomenon always in placeBy the primal nature of the mind  which is termed pabhassara or radiant  I mean the ordinary elementary state of knowing in the presentBut whoever isnt able to penetrate in to know it cant gain any good from it like the proverbial monkey with the diamondThus the name given by the Buddha for this state of affairs is really fitting avijjā  dark knowledge counterfeit knowledgeThis is in line with the terms pubbante aññāṇam  not knowing the beginning ie the primal nature of the mind parante aññāṇam  not knowing the end ie mental states in interaction with their objects majjhantika aññāṇam  not knowing the middle ie the current that streams from the primal nature of knowingWhen this is the case the mind becomes a saṅkhāra a fabricator a magician concocting prolifically in its myriad waysThis ends the discussion of the mind as a frame of referenceMental qualities as a frame of reference can be divided into three sorts inner mental qualities outer mental qualities and mental qualities in and of themselvesThese five Hindrances can be either inner or outer phenomenaFor exampleIf these five Hindrances are still weak and havent yet streamed out to become involved with any external objects they are called inner mental qualitiesThese are thus called outer mental qualitiesWhen any mental quality first arises in the mind its called an inner qualityWhen it flares up grows stronger and streams out to an outer object its called an outer qualityThe qualities mentioned above are all unskillful qualitiesThey act as obstacles to such things as jhāna liberating insight and the transcendentThus if you want to gain release from them you must first center the mind firmly in concentrationTo be able to center the mind firmly you have to develop the following three qualities within yourself Thus if you hope for the genuine happiness offered by the Buddhas teachings you should take the three qualities mentioned above and make them permanent features of your heart  and you will come to see clearly the quality free from fabrication called the unfabricated the genuine DhammaUncreated uncaused it simply is by its very natureIt doesnt circle about arising and passing awayThe unfabricated is a perfectly ordinary part of nature yet no one in the world can know it aside from those who have developed virtue concentration and discernmentSo if you sincerely want to go beyond suffering and stress you should work to give rise to clear and true insight through your own effortsWhen you can keep your alertness constantly in place you will be able to know the nature of the mindYour powers of reference and focused investigation will have to be constantly in place within for you not to be misled by the objects and preoccupations of the mindMost of us ordinarily have no clear sense of our own nature and so we cant clearly see the thoughts and urges that arise within usAs a result we go out to fasten onto their objects giving rise to the wheel of wanderingon circling around and around without endHere I will refer to the wheel within Not knowing the primal nature of the mind is the cycle of defilement or unawareness which is the beginning of the cycleThis gives rise to fabrication which is the cycle of intention and actionThis in turn leads us to experience mental objects and preoccupations which is the cycle of retributionThus there are three parts to the cycleThe three parts of the cycle can be illustrated as follows Unawareness is the hub of the wheelFabrications are the spokes and mental preoccupations the rimThe sensory organs form the yoke and harness sensory objects are the oxen and the driver is birth aging illness and deathNow pile on your belongings  your defilements  and with a lash of the whip youre off The oxen drag you away leading you up the mountains and down until in the end you crash and are smashed to smithereens ie deathFor this reason we must make our awareness penetrate into the nature of the mind at the center of the axle which doesnt turn with the wheel and which is said to be uncyclingWhoever can do this will find that the path is sudden and short not slowFor example in ancient times monks and lay disciples were able to reach Awakening even while sitting and listening to a sermon while going for alms or while gazing at a corpseFrom this we can gather that after imbuing themselves with the qualities mentioned above they focused their investigation on that particular point and gained clear and true insight right then and there without having to pull in or out back or forthThey were able to let go naturally with no in or out no coming or goingThose who investigate will see the truthSome people believe that they will have to abandon all mental preoccupations before they can train the mind but the truth of the matter is that the mind is usually deluded right there  at its preoccupations  and the spot where you are deluded is the spot you have to investigateIf you dont solve the problem right where youre deluded dont believe that you can let go by hiding out or running awayEven if you do run away and hide youll end up coming back and falling for the same old preoccupations once morePeople of discernment though whether they deal with what is inside or out can give rise to virtue concentration discernment and release in every contextThey have no sense that the inside is right and the outside wrong that the inside is wrong and the outside right or that the inside is refined and the outside baseSuch opinions never occur to people of discernmentDiscernment has to be allaround knowing or knowing all around before it can be called fullfledged discernmentKnowing all around means to know the inside first and then the outsideAllaround knowing means to know the outside first and then to bring that awareness all the way inThis is why they are called people of discernment They can bring the outside in what is base they can make refined past and future they can bring into the present because they have brought the parts of the Path together in equal measure  mindfulness alertness and focused investigation  each performing its duties forming the way that leads beyond all suffering and stressThose who can do this will be able to reach the truth in any postureAll that will appear to them will be the condition of stress and the condition of things in themselvesTo see things this way is called yathābhūtañāṇa  seeing things for what they really areThe four frames of reference can be reduced to two physical and mental phenomena or  another way of putting it  body and mindEven though they are divided into four it is simply the current of the mind that is dividedWhen you come to the essence of the practice it all boils down to the body and mindIf you want really to simplify the practice you should focus on investigating the body and then focus on investigating the mindThis way of practice falls in line with all four of the frames of referenceWhen you can do this you will give rise to the mental moment that forms the Path  and the moment the Path arises in full power is the moment you can let goLetting go has two forms Being able to set go of mental objects but not of ones own mindBeing able to let go both of the objects of the mind and of ones selfTo be able to let go both of ones objects and of ones self is genuine knowingTo be able to let go of ones objects but not of ones self is counterfeit knowingGenuine knowing lets go of both ends It lets the object follow its own nature as an object and lets the mind follow the nature of the mindIn other words it lets nature look after itselfObject here refers to the body self refers to the heartYou have to let go of bothWhen your knowledge can reach this level you dont have to worry much about virtue concentration or discernmentVirtue concentration and discernment arent the nature of the mind nor is the nature of the mind virtue concentration and discernmentVirtue concentration and discernment are simply fabricated phenomena tools for extinguishing defilementWhen defilement is extinguished then virtue concentration and discernment disband as wellVirtue concentration and discernment are like waterDefilement is like a fireThe mind is like the person using the water to put out the fireWhen the water has put out the flames the water itself has vanished  but the person putting out the fire hasnt disappearedThe fire isnt the water the water isnt the fireThe person isnt the water the water isnt the personThe person isnt the fire the fire isnt the personThe genuine nature of the mind isnt defilement nor is it virtue concentration and discernmentIt simply is in line with its own natureThose who dont know the nature of the truth maintain that death is annihilation or that nibbāna is annihilation of one sort or anotherThis is simply their own misunderstandingEven those who have gone no higher than the level of Streamentry are able to know that the true nature of the mind isnt in any way annihilated which is why they are people of strong unwavering conviction believing in the paths and their fruitionsEven though their hearts arent yet entirely free from the admixture of defilements those defilements cant efface the true nature of their hearts  just as an ingot of gold when it falls into the dirt may be covered with soot but the soot cant turn it into anything other than goldThis is unlike ordinary runofthemill peopleAn ordinary persons mind may be pure from time to time but it doesnt stay that wayIt cant escape from being defiled again  just as a sharpened knife will stay in shape only if it is kept bathed in oilIf you put the knife to use or forget to keep it bathed the steel of the blade might turn into something other than steelThus each of us should enthusiastically make the effort to reach at least the Stream for although all the qualities I have mentioned  whether fabricated or unfabricated  lie mixed within every one of us none of them are as exalted as virāga dhamma the act of dispassion that extracts the unfabricated from the fabricated as gold is extracted from crude oreThe Buddhas teachings are subtle and deepWhoever isnt set on truly putting them into practice wont know their taste  like a cowherd hired to watch over cattle without ever knowing the taste of their milkThus we are taughtAjaan Lees last recorded sermon dealt with the topic of making oneself ones own refuge by practicing the four frames of reference  much like one of the Buddhas sermons in the last year of his lifeBecause the sermon expands on the topic of the four frames of reference in a slightly different way from the above book I thought it would make valuable addition to this volume so here it isI will now explain this verse so that you can practice in a way leading to the supreme attainment capable of eliminating all your suffering and fears reaching the refuge of peaceWe come into this world without a substantial refugeNothing  aside from the Buddha Dhamma and Saṅgha  will follow us into the next lifeThese three are the only things in which we can take refuge both in this life and in lives to comeThere are two levels on which people take refuge in the Triple GemSome take refuge only on the level of individuals while others take refuge on the level of inner qualities by developing the steps of the practice within themselvesAll four of these types are individual people so to take refuge in them is to take refuge on the level of individualsThey can give us refuge only in a shallow and not very substantial wayEven though taking refuge on this level can be advantageous to us it helps us only on the level of the world and can give only temporary protection against falling into the realms of deprivationIf we lose faith in these individuals our mind can change to a lower level  for all individuals fall under the laws of all fabricated things They are inconstant and changing subject to stress and notself  ie they cant prevent their own deathSo if you go to a Buddha as refuge on the level of individuals there are only two sorts of results youll get at first gladness and then sadness when the time comes to part  for its the nature of all individuals in the world that they arise age grow ill and dieThe wisest sages and the most ordinary people are all equal on this pointSages of the past have divided the teachings in the Buddhist Canon into four typesAll of these sayings were organized into the three parts of the Buddhist Canon the discourses the discipline and the AbhidhammaIf we take refuge in the Dhamma on this level it is simply an object something we can rememberBut memory is inconstant and cant provide us with a safe dependable refugeAt best it can help us only on the worldly level because we are depending on individuals on objects as our refugeAll four of these count as one type of Saṅgha on the level of individualsThis being the case then when anyone tries to take refuge in them that refuge is inconstantWe can depend on them only for a while but they cant provide us any true refugeThey cant keep us from falling into the realms of deprivationAt best taking refuge in them can give us results on the worldly level  and the worldly level is changing with every momentThis ends the discussion of the Triple Refuge on the level of individualsTaking refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Saṅgha on the level of inner qualities means reaching the Triple Gem with the heart through the practiceTo reach the Buddha on the level of inner qualities you first have to know the virtues of the Buddha which are of two sorts causes and resultsThe causes of his Awakening are mindfulness and alertnessThe result of his Awakening is the transcendent the stilling of all defilements and mental effluentsSo we have to develop these qualities within ourselvesBuddhasati  mindfulness like the Buddhas  is what wakes us upFull alertness is what makes us correctly aware of cause and effectThe way to develop these qualities is to practice in line with the four frames of referenceThis will enable us to reach the Buddha on the level of inner qualitiesBefore focusing mindfulness on the body so as to wake yourself up you first have to know that there are two ways of looking at the bodyFrom there you can go to wind in and of itselfThere are six aspects to the wind property the breath energy flowing down from the head to the spaces between the fingers and toes the breath energy flowing from the spaces between the fingers and toes up to the top of the head the breath forces in the stomach the breath forces in the intestines and the inandout breathThese six aspects make up the wind property in the bodyWhen you focus on wind in and of itself be mindful to keep track of only one of these aspects at a time  such as the inandout breath  without worrying about any other aspects of the breath energyThis can be called focusing on wind in itselfThe same principle applies to earth in and of itself water in and of itself and fire in and of itselfWhen you have mindfulness and alertness constantly established in the body the body in and of itself wind fire earth or water in and of itself  whichever seems easiest and most comfortable  keep with it as much as possibleWhen you do this the body will wake up for you arent letting it simply follow its natural courseTo bring mindfulness into the body helps keep it awakeThe body will feel lighter and lighter as we keep it in mindAlertness is what enables us to be aware throughout the bodyWhen these two mental qualities enter into the body the body will feel agile pliant and lightIn Pali this is called kāyalahutāThe mind will also be awake and will give rise to knowledge in and of itself through its own sandiṭṭhiko practice  ie the person who does the practice will see the results for him or herself in the here and nowPeople who awaken from their slumbers are able to see and know thingsThe same holds true for people who practice mindfulness immersed in the body as a frame of referenceThey are bound to see the true nature of their own bodiesTo penetrate in knowing and seeing in this way is to reach the Buddha Dhamma and Saṅgha  which differ only in name but are one and the same in their essenceWhoever doesnt practice in this way is asleep both in body and mindA person asleep cant see or know anything at all which is why we can say that people of this sort have yet to reach the Buddha on the level of the inner qualitiesTo practice contemplation of feelings be mindful of each of the various kinds of feeling that occur in the body and mindFor instance sometimes theres physical pleasure but mental distress sometimes physical pain but mental pleasure sometimes pleasure both in body and mind and sometimes pain both in body and mindSo focus in on being mindful of feelings as they ariseExamine them closelyThis is called contemplation of feelingsAs for feelings in and of themselves this means focusing on one type of feelingFor instance wherever theres pleasure focus right there solely on the pleasureYou dont have to get involved with feelings of pain or equanimityIf youre going to focus on pleasure keep focused right thereOr if you want you can focus on equanimity without getting involved with pleasure or painDont let the mind jump around so that any other preoccupations come in and interfereKeep monitoring the feeling youve chosen until you know its true nature through your own awarenessWhichever type of feeling is easiest for you to focus on keep your mindfulness and alertness right there as much as you canThis is what will enable you to awaken from the feelings within youWhoever does this ranks as having developed the inner quality of buddha that is the cause for coming awakeThere are three basic states of mind you can focus onThese states of mind arise from preoccupations with what we like and dislikeIf you have mindfulness watching over your mind with every moment it will enable the mind to awaken and blossom to know the truth about itselfWhenever passion arises in the mind focus on being mindful of the mind in and of itselfDont focus on the object of the passionPay attention solely to the present and the passion will fadeOr if you want you can use other methods to help by contemplating the object of the passion in certain waysFor example you can contemplate the unattractiveness of the body focusing first on the insides of your own body seeing them as filthy and disgustingYour mind will then be able to free itself from the passion in which it is immersed and to become more blooming and brightWhenever aversion arises in the mind focus on being mindful exclusively of the present state of your mindDont focus attention on the external object or person that gave rise to the anger and aversionAnger in the mind is like a burning fireIf you arent mindful and aware of the state of your own mind and instead think only of the object or person that incited the anger its like setting yourself on fireAll you can do is end up getting burntSo you shouldnt preoccupy yourself with the outside objectInstead focus on being mindful and aware of the state of aversion in the mindWhen mindfulness reaches full strength the state of aversion will immediately disbandAversion and anger are like a cover over a fire that lets the fire provide heat but no lightIf we remove the cover by doing away with the aversion the light of the fire can brighten the mindThe light here is discernment and skilled awarenessActually theres nowhere else that we have to look for goodness other than our own mindsThats how well be able to gain the freedom from suffering and stress that is termed cittavimutti mental release ie a mind beyond the reach of its preoccupationsThis is one way in which we reach the Buddha Dhamma and Saṅgha on the level of inner qualitiesAs for states of delusion in which the mind tends to be absentminded and forgetful These come from there being many objects crowding in on the mindWhen we find this happening we should center the mind on a single preoccupation where we can gather strength for our mindfulness and alertness in the same way that we can take diffused light rays and focus them on a single pointThe power of the light is sure to get brighterIn the same way when we are constantly mindful of the mind and dont let it get involved with various outside perceptions and preoccupations mindfulness will give rise to a powerful light skilled awarenessWhen skilled awareness arises within us our minds will grow shining bright and well awaken from our slumber of unawarenessWe will have attained a quality of secure refuge in our own heartsWe will know for ourselves and see for ourselves and this is what will enable us to attain the noble qualities of the transcendentThese five Hindrances are bad mental qualitiesIf you fall into any of them youre in the dark  like a person at the bottom of a well who cant see anything on the surface of the earth cant move around as he likes cant hear what people at the top of the well are saying and cant see the light of the sun and moon that illumine the earthIn the same way the Hindrances obstruct us from developing goodness in many many waysThey close off our ears and eyes keep us in the dark put us to sleepWhen mindfulness fills the body like this the body feels saturated like soil saturated with moisture Whatever you plant stays green and freshPlants flourishBirds and other forest animals come to live in their shadeWhen rain falls the soil can hold it instead of letting it wash awayA person who has mastered the first jhāna is like a holdingplace of goodness for other human and celestial beings because jhāna and concentration can have a cooling influence not only on oneself but also on others as wellWhen mindfulness fills the body like this the body feels saturated like soil saturated with moisture Whatever you plant stays green and freshPlants flourishBirds and other forest animals come to live in their shadeWhen rain falls the soil can hold it instead of letting it wash awayA person who has mastered the first jhāna is like a holdingplace of goodness for other human and celestial beings because jhāna and concentration can have a cooling influence not only on oneself but also on others as wellWhen you attain the pleasure and ease that come from the first jhāna you are freed from the Hindrances of indecision and restlessness  anxietySo you should work at developing these factors in your mind until it can stay steadily in jhānaYour heart will then be blooming and bright giving rise to the light of discernment or liberating insightAnd if you have developed your capabilities enough then on attaining the first jhāna you may gain entry to the transcendentSome people though may go on to the second jhānaPeople who have done this experience nothing but an inner brightness and happiness in their hearts for they dwell with the quality they have given rise to within themselvesThey reach the Buddha Dhamma and Saṅgha on the highest level the level of release or ultimate attainment a quality free from defilement and mental effluentsPeople who train their hearts in this way have reached the Buddha Dhamma and Saṅgha on the level of inner qualityIn other words they have reached refuge in their own heartsThey have absolutely closed off the route to the realms of deprivationAt the very least they are destined after death to go to the higher realms of happinessAt best they will attain nibbānaAll of them are certain to attain nibbāna within at least seven lifetimes for they have reached an inner quality that is steady and certainThey wont fall into anything lowAnyone who has yet to attain this quality though has an uncertain futureSo if we want the peace and security that Buddhism has to offer we should all try to find ourselves a dependable refugeIf you take refuge on the level of individuals find people of worth so that your conviction in them will take you to the happy realmsAs for refuge on the level of inner qualities which will really be of substantial value to you practice so as to give rise to those qualities within yourselfTo summarize On the level of inner qualities the Buddha Dhamma and Saṅgha are all one and the same thingThey differ only in nameSo you should opanayiko  bring these qualities into your heartSandiṭṭhiko  When you practice youll see them for yourselfPaccattaṃ  Youll know them only for yourselfThings that other people know about arent safeIf you want peace and refuge that are substantial and sure you should give rise to them in your own heartThe result will be nibbāna liberation from defilement from all birth aging illness and death in this world and any world to comeThere is no happiness higherThis is buddha on the level of results freedom from sleep total AwakeningAnd this ends our discussion of the verse on refugeThe definitions given here are based on the meanings these terms have in Ajaan Lees writings and sermonsIf anything in this translation is inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their wayAs for whatever may be accurate I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain the truth at which it points The translatorMany people have asked for Luang Pus Dhamma talks out of a desire to read them or listen to them and I have to confess frankly that Luang Pus Dhamma talks are extremely rareThis is because he never gave any formal sermons or discoursed at any great lengthHe simply taught meditation admonished his students answered questions or discussed the Dhamma with other elder monksHe would speak in a way that was brief careful and to the pointIn addition he never gave sermons at formal ceremoniesSo in response to the desire and interest that many people have shown in Luang Pus Dhamma I have compiled this book of his short teachings  pure truths at the highest level lessons and admonishments he gave his students answers to questions and passages from the Buddhas words in the Canon that he always liked to quoteBecause I lived for a long time with him to the end of his days I have gathered these passages from memory or from notes in my journalI have also included the events locations and people who were involved to help make the passages easier to understand and more inviting to readIt was noteworthy  and amazing  that even though Luang Pu normally wouldnt speak or would speak as little as possible he was still very quick and astute in his expression never missing his markHis words were brief but full of meaning every sentence containing a message complete in itselfIt was as if he would hypnotize his listeners forcing them to ponder his words for a long time with their deepest discernmentThe reader  noticing that some of the passages here contain teachings that are ordinary some that are amusing and some that are pure truth on the ultimate level  may wonder why they werent placed in ascending order from easy to difficult or from low to highThe reason I didnt place them in order like that is because each passage is complete on one page and I wanted to vary the atmosphereIf this is inappropriate unseemly or faulty in any way I ask that all those who are learned will be kind enough to forgive me an author of very little intelligenceOn December Their Majesties the King and Queen paid a private visit to Luang PuAfter asking about his health and wellbeing and engaging in a Dhamma conversation the King posed a question In abandoning the defilements which ones should be abandoned firstLuang Pu respondedAll the defilements arise together at the mindFocus right at the mindWhichever defilement arises first thats the one to abandon firstEach time after Their Majesties came to visit Luang Pu and had dealt with the purpose of their visit on taking their leave the King would say We request that you keep your aggregates going for more than one hundred years to provide the general public with an object of respectCan you accept our request Even though this was simply a polite formality and the Kings way of giving a blessing to Luang Pu Luang Pu didnt dare accept for he couldnt resist the nature of fabricated thingsSo he would respondIm afraid I cant acceptIt all depends on how fabricated things go of their own accordA senior monk of the meditation tradition came to pay his respects to Luang Pu on the first day of the Rains Retreat inAfter giving him instruction and a number of teachings on profound matters Luang Pu summarized the four noble truths as followsA wellread layman was conversing with Luang Pu saying I firmly believe that in our present day and age there are not just a few monks who have practiced to the point of reaching the paths fruitions and nibbanaSo why dont they make their knowledge public so that those who are interested in the practice will know of the levels of Dhamma they have attained as a way of giving them encouragement and hope so that theyll accelerate their efforts to the utmost of their abilityLuang Pu answeredThose who have awakened dont talk of what theyve awakened to because it lies above and beyond all wordsA monk who lives heedlessly simply counts his precepts as theyre found in the textbooks proud of himself that he has all of preceptsBut as for the number hes actually intent on observing how many are theyIts normal that when people practicing concentration start getting results they can have their doubts about what theyve experienced  for example when they experience conflicting visions or start seeing parts of their own bodiesMany people came to Luang Pu asking him to resolve their doubts or to give them advice on how to continue with their practiceAnd a lot of people would come to say that when meditating they saw hell or heaven or heavenly mansions or else a Buddha image inside their bodyWas what I saw real they would askLuang Pu would respondThe vision you saw was real but what you saw in the vision wasntThe questioner might then ask You say that all these visions are external and that I cant yet put them to any use if I stay stuck simply on the vision I wont make any further progressIs it because Ive been staying so long with these visions that I cant avoid themEvery time I sit down to meditate as soon as the mind gathers together it goes straight to that levelCan you give me some advice on how to let go of visions in an effective wayLuang Pu would respondOh some of these visions can be lots of fun and really absorbing you know but if you stay stuck right there its a waste of timeA really simple method for letting go of them is not to look at what you see in the vision but to look at whats doing the seeingThen the things you dont want to see will disappear on their ownOn December Luang Pu participated in the annual celebration at Wat Dhammamongkon on Sukhumvit Road in BangkokA large number of temporarily ordained women from a nearby teachers college came to discuss the results of their vipassana practice telling him that when their minds settled down they would see a Buddha image in their heartsSome of them said that they saw the heavenly mansions awaiting them in heavenSome saw the Culamani StupaThey all seemed very proud of their success in their practice of vipassanaLuang Pu saidAll the things that appeared for you to see are still externalYou cant take them as a substantial refuge at allIn March a large number of scholarly and meditating monks  the first group of Dhamma Missionaries  came to pay their respects to Luang Pu and to ask for teachings and advice that they could use in their work of spreading the DhammaLuang Pu taught them Dhamma on the ultimate level both for them to teach others and for them to put into practice themselves so as to reach that level of truthIn conclusion he gave them a piece of wisdom for them to take and contemplateOn that occasion Luang Pu gave an admonition to the Dhamma missionaries at one point sayingWhen you go out to disseminate and proclaim the Buddhas teachings it can either lead to the advancement of the religion or to its destructionThe reason I say this is because the person of each Dhamma missionary is the determining factorIf when you go you behave in an appropriate way keeping in mind the fact that youre a contemplative with manners and behavior corresponding with whats proper for a contemplative those who see you if they dont yet have faith will give rise to faithAs for those who already have faith your behavior will increase their faithBut as for the missionaries who behave in the opposite fashion it will destroy the faith of those who have faith and will drive those who dont yet have faith even further awaySo I ask that you be consummate both in your knowledge and your behaviorDont be heedless or complacentWhatever you teach people to do you yourself should also do as an example for themBefore the Rains retreat in Luang Phaw Thaw a relative of Luang Pus who had ordained late in life returned from many years of wandering with Ajaan Thate and Ajaan Saam in Phangnga province to pay his respects to Luang Pu and to learn more about meditation practiceHe spoke with Luang Pu on familiar terms saying Now that youve built an ordination hall and this large beautiful meeting hall youve probably reaped a really huge amount of meritLuang Pu repliedWhat I built was built for the general good the good of the world of the monastery and of the religion thats allAs for reaping the merit what would I want with merit like thisSix years after the Second World War was over the legacy of the war remained in the form of the poverty and difficulties caused by the shortages of food and materials that affected every homeIn particular there was a great shortage of clothIf a monk or novice had even one complete set of robes he was fortunateI was one of a large number of novices living with Luang PuOne day Novice Phrom another one of Luang Pus nephews saw Novice Chumpon wearing a beautiful new robe so he asked him Where did you get that robe Novice Chumpon told him I was taking my turn attending to Luang PuHe saw that my robe was torn so he gave me a new oneWhen it came Novice Phroms turn to give Luang Pu a foot massage he wore a torn robe with the idea that hed get a new robe tooWhen he had finished his duties and was leaving Luang Pu noticed the tear in the robe and was struck with pity for his nephewSo he got up opened a cabinet and handed his nephew something sayingHereSew that upDont go around wearing a robe all torn like thatDisappointed Novice Phrom had to quickly accept the needle and thread from Luang Pus handA middleaged lady once came to pay respect to Luang PuShe described her situation in life saying that her social position was good and she had never lacked for anythingShe was upset though over her son who was disobedient disorderly and had fallen under the influence of every kind of evil amusementHe was laying waste to his parents wealth as well as to their hearts in a way that was more than they could bearShe asked Luang Pu to advise her on an approach that would lessen her suffering as well as getting her son to give up his evil waysLuang Pu gave her some advice on these matters also teaching her how to quiet her mind and how to let goAfter she had left he commentedPeople these days suffer because of thoughtsLuang Pu continued with a Dhamma talk saying Material things are already there in the world in a way thats perfectly completePeople who lack the discernment and ability cant take possession of them and so they have difficulties in providing for themselvesThose with the discernment and ability can take possession of the valuables of the world in large quantities making life convenient and comfortable for themselves in all circumstancesAs for the noble ones they try to conduct themselves for the sake of gaining release from all those things entering a state where they have nothing at all because In the area of the world you have things that you haveIn the area of the Dhamma you have something you dont haveWhen you can separate the mind from its involvement with all things the mind is no longer tied to sorrowWhether sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations are good or bad depends on the minds going out to fashion them in that wayWhen the mind lacks discernment it misunderstands thingsWhen it misunderstands things it gets deluded under the influence of all things that are binding both physically and mentallyThe ill effects and punishments we suffer physically are things from which other people can help free us to at least some extentBut the ill effects within the mind to which the mind is in bondage through defilement and craving are things from which we have to learn to free ourselves on our ownThe noble ones have freed themselves from ill effects of both sorts which is why suffering and stress cant overcome themWhen a person has shaved his hair and beard and put on the ochre robe thats the symbol of his state as a monkBut it counts only on the external levelOnly when he has shaved off the mental tangle  all lower preoccupations  from his heart can you call him a monk on the internal levelWhen a head has been shaved little creeping insects like lice cant take up residence thereIn the same way when a mind has gained release from its preoccupations and is freed from fabrication suffering cant take up residence at allWhen this becomes your normal state you can be called a genuine monkLuang Pu was invited to teach in Bangkok on MarchDuring a Dhamma conversation some lay people expressed their doubts about what buddho was likeLuang Pu was kind enough to answerWhen you meditate dont send your mind outsideDont fasten onto any knowledge at allWhatever knowledge youve gained from books or teachers dont bring it in to complicate thingsCut away all preoccupations and then as you meditate let all your knowledge come from whats going on in the mindWhen the mind is quiet youll know it for yourselfBut you have to keep meditating a lotWhen the time comes for things to develop theyll develop on their ownWhatever you know have it come from your own mindThe knowledge that comes from a mind thats quiet is extremely subtle and profoundSo let your knowledge come out of a mind quiet and stillHave the mind give rise to a single preoccupationDont send it outsideLet the mind stay right in the mindLet the mind meditate on its ownLet it be the one that keeps repeating buddho buddhoAnd then genuine buddho will appear in the mindYoull know for yourself what buddho is likeThats all there is to itTheres not a whole lotIn early September the Housewives Association of the Interior Ministry led by MrsJuap Jirarote came to the Northeast to do some charity workOne evening they took the opportunity to stop by and pay their respects to Luang Pu at pmAfter they had paid their respects and asked after his health they received some amulets from himSeeing that he wasnt feeling well though they quickly leftBut there was one lady who stayed behind and took this special opportunity to ask Luang Pu Id like something good from Luang Pu tooLuang Pu replied You have to meditate to get something goodWhen you meditate your mind will be at peaceYour words and deeds will be at peaceYour words and deeds will be goodWhen you live in a good way like this youll be happyThe lady replied I have lots of duties and no time to meditateMy government work has me all tied up so where am I going to find any time to meditateLuang Pu explainedIf you have time to breathe you have time to meditateIn Luang Pu went to Chantaburi to rest and to visit with Ajaan SomchaiOn that occasion a senior monk from Bangkok  Phra Dhammavaralankan of Wat Buppharam the ecclesiastical head of the southern region of the country  was also there practicing meditation in his old age being only one year younger than Luang PuWhen he learned that Luang Pu was a meditation monk he became interested and engaged Luang Pu in a long conversation on the results of meditationHe mentioned his responsibilities saying that he had wasted a lot of his life engaged in study and administration work well into his old ageHe discussed different points of meditation practice with Luang Pu finally asking him Do you still have any angerLuang Pu immediately answeredI do but I dont pick it upWhen Luang Pu was undergoing treatment at Chulalongkorn Hospital in Bangkok large numbers of people came to pay their respects and listen to his DhammaMrBamrungsak Kongsuk was among those who were interested in the practice of meditationHe was a student of Ajaan Sanawng of Wat Sanghadana in Nonthaburi province one of the strict meditation centers of our day and timeHe broached the topic of the practice of the Dhamma by asking Luang Pu how does one cut off angerLuang Pu answeredTheres nobody who cuts it offTheres only being aware of it in timeWhen youre aware of it in time it disappears on its ownMany monks and novices attending to Luang Pu late at night in Chulalongkorn Hospital were perplexed and amazed when they noticed that on some nights well after am they could hear Luang Pu explaining the Dhamma for about ten minutes and then chanting a blessing as if there were large numbers of listeners right in front of himAt first no one dared ask him about this but after it had happened many times they couldnt contain their doubts and so they askedLuang Pu told themThese doubts and questions are not the path for practicing the DhammaA large group of Dhamma practitioners from Buriram province  headed by Police Lieutenant Bunchai Sukhontamat the provincial prosecutor  came to pay their respects to Luang Pu to listen to the Dhamma and to ask questions about how to progress further in their practiceMost of them had practiced with all the famous ajaans who had explained the practice in a variety of ways that werent always in line with one another and this had caused them more and more doubtsSo they asked Luang Pus advice as to the way of practice that was correct and easiest as they had difficulties in finding time to practiceIf they could learn of a way that was really easy it would be especially right for themLuang Pu answeredWatch the mind right at the mindThe group of Duangporn Tharichat from the Air Force Radio Station in Bang Syy headed by Akhom Thannithate came to the northeast to present group donations and to pay their respects to the ajaans in the various monasteriesWhen they stopped off to pay respect to Luang Pu they presented their donations and received small mementosAfter that some of them went shopping in the market while some of them found a place to restHowever there was one group of about four or five people who stayed behind and asked Luang Pu to advise them on a simple method to get rid of mental distress and depression which was a constant problem for themWhat method they asked would give the quickest resultsLuang Pu answeredDont send your mind outsideA lady professor after hearing Luang Pu give a talk on Dhamma practice asked him the proper way to wear sufferingShe continued These days people dont wear suffering in the correct way or in line with a common pattern even though King Rama VI established a good standard in the time of his reignWhen a member of your immediate family or a senior member of your extended family died the pattern was to wear suffering for seven days days or daysBut nowadays people dont follow any patternSo Id like to ask you What is the correct way to wear sufferingLuang Pu answeredSuffering is something to be comprehendedWhen you comprehend it you let it goWhy would you want to wear itA Chinese lady after paying her respects to Luang Pu asked him I have to move to Prakhonchai District in Buriram Province to set up a store near my relatives thereThe problem is my relatives have been recommending that I sell this that and the other thing in the store in line with their opinion as to what would sell well but I cant make up my mind as to what would be good to sellSo Ive come to ask your advice as to what would be good for me to sellLuang Pu answeredAnything is good to sell as long as there are people to buy itOn May a group of ten or more army officers came to pay their respects to Luang Pu quite late in the evening before heading on to BangkokTwo of the members of the group had the rank of Lieutenant GeneralAfter conversing with Luang Pu for a while the members of the group took the amulets from around their necks and placed them in a tray for Luang Pu to bless with the power of his concentrationHe obliged them and then returned their amulets to themOne of the generals asked him Ive heard that youve made many sets of amuletsWhich of them are famousLuang Pu answeredNone of them are famousA group of three or four young men from a distant province came to see Luang Pu as he was sitting on the porch of the meeting hallYou could tell from their behavior  in the casual way they sat and spoke  that they were probably familiar with a rogue monk someplaceOn top of that they seemed to believe that Luang Pu was interested in talismans for they told him of all the great tantric ajaans who had given them talismans of extraordinary magical powerFinally they pulled out their talismans to display to one another right there in front of himOne of them had a tusk of a wild boar another a tigers fang another a rhinoceros hornEach of them claimed extraordinary powers for his talisman so one of them asked Luang Pu Hey Luang PuWhich of these is more extraordinary and good than the others for sureLuang Pu seemed especially amused and said with a smileNone of them are good none of them are extraordinary at allThey all come from common animalsLuang Pu once said In the Rains Retreat of I made a vow to read the entire Canon to see where the endpoint of the Buddhas teachings lay  to see where the end of the noble truths the end of suffering lay  to see how the Buddha had summarized itI read the Canon to the end contemplating along the way but there was no passage that made contact deeply enough in the mind that I could say for sure This is the end of sufferingThis is the end of the paths and fruitions or whats called nibbanaExcept for one passageVenSariputta had just come out of the attainment of the cessation and the Buddha asked him Sariputta your skin is especially bright your complexion especially clearWhat is the dwelling place of your mindSariputta answered My minds dwelling place is emptinessThats the one thing that made contact with my mindVenAjaan Suchin Sucinno received his law degree from Dhammasaat University a long time ago and held the practice of the Dhamma in high regardHe was a student of Luang Pu Lui for many years and then after hearing of Luang Pu Dunes reputation came to practice with himEventually he took ordinationAfter staying with Luang Pu for a while he came to take his leave so that he could wander off in search of solitudeLuang Pu advised himIn the area of the Vinaya you should study the texts until you correctly understand each and every rule to the point where you can put them into practice without errorAs for the Dhamma if you read a lot youll speculate a lot so you dont have to read that at allBe intent solely on the practice and that will be enoughLuang Taa Naen ordained well after middle ageIlliterate and unable to speak a word of Central Thai he had his strong point in that he was wellintentioned tractable and diligent in his duties to the point where you couldnt fault himWhen he saw other monks taking their leave to go wandering or to study with other ajaans he decided that he wanted to go tooSo he came to ask permission to leave which Luang Pu grantedBut then he felt worried I cant read I dont know their languageHow will I be able to practice with themLuang Pu advised himThe practice isnt a matter of the letters of the alphabet or of spoken wordsThe fact that you know you dont know is a good place to startThe way to practice is this In the area of the Vinaya watch their example the example set by the ajaanDont deviate in any way from what he doesIn the area of the Dhamma keep watch right at your own mindPractice right at the mindWhen you understand your own mind that in and of itself will make you understand everything elseOne of the problems in administering the Sangha in addition to having to deal with all the other major and minor issues that come up is the lack of monks who will be abbotsWe sometimes hear news of monks competing to become abbot of a monastery but Luang Pus students had to be cajoled or forced into taking on the abbotship in other monasteriesEvery year without exception groups of lay people would come to Luang Pu asking him to send one of his students to become the abbot at their monasteryIf Luang Pu saw that a particular monk should go he would plead with him to go but for the most part the monk wouldnt want to goThe usual excuse was I dont know how to do construction work I dont know how to train other monks I dont know how to give sermons Im no good at public relations or receiving guestsThats why I dont want to goLuang Pu would respondThose things arent really necessaryYour only responsibility is to follow your daily duties going for alms eating your meal sitting in meditation doing walking meditation cleaning the monastery grounds being strict in observing the VinayaThats enough right thereAs for construction work that depends on the lay supportersWhether or not they do it is up to themTo the end of his life Luang Pu would have his daily warmwater bath at every evening assisted by a monk or noviceAfter he had dried off and was feeling refreshed he would often speak a few words of Dhamma that occurred to him at the timeFor instance once he saidWe monks if we establish in ourselves a sense of satisfaction with our status as monks will find nothing but happiness and peaceBut if we have the status of a monk and yet hanker after any other status well be engulfed in suffering all the timeWhen you can stop thirsting stop searching thats the true state of being a monkWhen youre truly a monk the poorer you are the more happiness you haveEven if youve read the whole Canon and can remember lots of teachings even if you can explain them in poignant ways with lots of people to respect you even if you build a lot of monastery buildings or can explain inconstancy stress and notself in the most detailed fashion  if youre still heedless you havent tasted the flavor of the teachings in any way at all for those other things are all externalThe purposes they serve are all external as a benefit to society a benefit to other people a benefit to posterity or a symbol of the religionThe only thing that serves your own true purpose is release from sufferingAnd youll be able to gain release from suffering only when you know the one mindIn one of Luang Pus branch meditation monasteries there lived a group of five or six monks who wanted to be especially strict in their practice so they made a vow not to talk throughout the Rains RetreatIn other words no word would come out of their mouths except for the daily chanting and the biweekly Patimokkha chantAfter the end of the Rains they came to pay their respects to Luang Pu and told him of their strict practice In addition to their other duties they were also able to stop speaking for the entire RainsLuang Pu smiled a bit and saidThats pretty goodWhen theres no speaking then no faults are committed by way of speechBut when you say that you stopped speaking that simply cant beOnly the noble ones who enter the refined attainment of cessation where feeling and perception stop are able to stop speakingAside from them everyones speaking all day and all night longAnd especially those who vow not to speak They talk more than anyone else simply that they dont make a sound that others can hearIn addition to the wisdom that came straight from his heart Luang Pu would also quote passages from his having read the CanonAny passage that he saw as important as a short and direct lesson in the practice he would repeat to usFor instance one of the Buddhas teachings that he liked to quote was this Monks this holy life is not practiced for the sake of deceiving the public nor for the sake of gaining their respect nor for the sake of gains offerings and fame nor for the sake of defeating other sectariansThis holy life is lived for the sake of restraint abandoning dispassion and the cessation of sufferingLuang Pu would then addThose who ordain and those who practice have to aim in this directionAny directions other than this are all wrongLuang Pu once said People as long as theyre runofthemill have their pride and their opinionsAs long as they have pride its hard for them to see in line with one anotherWhen their views arent in line with one another it causes them to keep quarreling and disputingAs for a noble one who has reached the Dhamma he has nothing to bring him into a quarrel with anyone elseHowever other people see things he lets it go as their businessAs in one of the Buddhas sayingsMonks whatever the wise people of the world say exists I too say existsAnd whatever the wise people of the world say doesnt exist I too say that it doesnt existI dont quarrel with the world the world quarrels with meOn February when Luang Pu was seriously ill and staying at the Chulalongkorn Hospital in Bangkok Luang Pu Saam Akiñcano came to visit him in the hospital roomAt that time Luang Pu was restingLuang Pu Saam sat down near him and raised his hands in respectLuang Pu responded by raising his hands in respectThen the two of them sat there perfectly still for a long timeFinally after an extremely long time Luang Pu Saam raised his hands in respect once more and said Ill be leaving nowOK Luang Pu respondedFor the entire two hours those were the only words I heard them sayAfter Luang Pu Saam left I couldnt help but ask Luang Pu Luang Pu Saam came and sat here for a long timeWhy didnt you say anything to himLuang Pu respondedThe task is done so theres no need to say anything moreDuring all the many years I lived near Luang Pu I never saw him act in a way to indicate that he was bothered by anything to the point where he couldnt stand it and I never heard him complain about any difficulty at allFor example when he was the senior monk at a function he never made a fuss or demanded that the hosts alter things to suit himWhenever he was invited any place where he had to sit for long periods of time or where the weather was hot and humid he never complainedWhen he was sick and in pain or if his food came late no matter how hungry he was he never grumbledIf the food was bland and tasteless he never asked for anything to spice it upOn the other hand if he saw any other elder monk making a fuss to get special treatment from other people he would commentYou cant endure even this little thingIf you cant endure this how are you going to win out over defilement and cravingLuang Pu was pure in his speech for he would speak only of things that served a purposeHe never created any trouble for himself or for others through his wordsEven when people tried to bait him so that they could hear him criticize others he wouldnt fall for the baitMany were the times when people would come to say to him Luang Pu why is it that some of our nationally renowned preachers like to attack others or denounce society or criticize other senior monksEven if you paid me I couldnt respect monks like thatLuang Pu would respondThats the level of their knowledge and understandingThey say what comes easily in line with the level of their knowledgeNobodys paying you to respect themIf you dont want to respect them then dont respect themThey probably wont mindGenerally speaking Luang Pu liked to encourage monks and novices to take a special interest in the practice of wandering in the forest to meditate and observe the ascetic practicesOnce when a large number of his students  both senior and junior  came for a meeting he encouraged them to search for seclusion in the wilderness living on mountains or in caves for the purpose of accelerating their practiceThat way theyd be able to release themselves from their lower states of mindOne of the monks said thoughtlessly I dont dare go to those places sirIm afraid that spirits might victimize meLuang Pu shot right backWhere have there ever been any spirits who victimize monksThere are only monks who victimize spirits  and they make a big production of it to bootThink about itNearly all the material things lay people bring to donate are for the sake of dedicating the merit to the spirits of their dead ancestors and relatives their parents their grandparents their brothers and sistersAnd do we monks behave in a fitting wayWhat mental qualities do we have that will send the merit to those spiritsBe careful that you dont become a monk who victimizes spiritsAt present there are a lot of meditators who get enthusiastic about new teachers or new meditation centersJust as lottery enthusiasts get excited about monks who forecast lottery numbers or amulet enthusiasts get excited about monks who make powerful amulets in the same way vipassana enthusiasts get excited about vipassana teachersA lot of these people when taken with a particular teacher will praise that teacher to others and try to persuade them to share their opinion and respect for the teacherAnd especially at present there are famous speakers who tape their Dhamma talks and sell them all over the countryOne woman once brought many tapes of a famous speakers talks for Luang Pu to listen to but he didnt listen to themOne reason was that he had never had a radio or tape player since the day he was bornOr supposing that he had had one he wouldnt have known how to turn it onLater someone brought a tape player and played many of these tapes for Luang Pu to listen toAfterwards she asked him what he thoughtHe saidNiceHe has a beautiful way of expressing himself and an abundance of words but I couldnt find any substance to themEach time you listen you should be able to get the flavor of study practice and attainmentThats when theres substanceAt present many people who are interested in meditation practice are extremely confused and doubtful about the correct way to practiceThis is especially true of people just beginning to get interested because meditation teachers often give conflicting advice on how to practiceWhats worse instead of explaining things in a fair and objective way these teachers seem reluctant to admit that other teachers or methods of practice might also be correctThere are not a few who show actual disdain for other methodsBecause many people with these sorts of doubts would often come to ask Luang Pus advice I frequently heard him explain things in this wayWhen you start practicing meditation you can begin with any method at all because they all lead to the same resultsThe reason there are so many methods is because people have different tendenciesThis is why there have to be different images to focus on or words to repeat  such as buddho or arahang  as means of giving the mind a point around which to gather and settle down as the first stepWhen the mind has gathered and is still the meditation word will fall away on its own and thats where every method falls into the same track with the same flavorIn other words it has discernment as its surpassing state and release as its essenceEveryone who came to pay respect to Luang Pu would say the same thing Even though he was almost years old his complexion was bright and his health strongEven those of us who lived near him all along rarely saw his face darken or look exhausted or get furrowed in displeasure or painHis normal state was to be quiet and cheerful at all timesHe had few illnesses and was always in a good mood never excited about events or affected by praise or blameOnce in the midst of a gathering of elder meditation monks who were conversing about how to characterize the normal state of mind of those who live above suffering Luang Pu saidNot worrying not being attached Thats the mental dwelling of those who practicePeople practicing the Dhamma at present are of two sortsThe first are those who when they learn the principles of the practice or receive advice from a teacher and get on the path are intent on trying to follow that path to the utmost of their abilityThe other sort are those who  even though theyve received good advice from their teacher and have learned the correct principles of the practice  arent sincerely intentTheir efforts are laxAt the same time they like to go out looking for other teachers at other centersWherever they hear theres a good center there they goMeditators of this sort are manyLuang Pu once advised his studentsWhen you go to a lot of centers and study with a lot of teachers your practice wont get results for when you go to a lot of centers its as if you go back to the beginning over and over againYou dont gain any sure principles in your practiceSometimes you get uncertain and bewilderedYour mind isnt solidYour practice degenerates and doesnt progressStudents and practitioners of the Dhamma are of two sortsThe first sort are those who genuinely study and practice to gain release from sufferingThe second are those who study and practice to brag about their accomplishments and to pass their days in arguments believing that memorizing a lot of texts or being able to quote a lot of teachers is a sign of their importanceMany times when people of this second sort came to see Luang Pu instead of asking his advice on how to practice they would spray out their knowledge and ideas for him to hear in great detailStill he was always able to sit and listen to themIn fact when they had finished he would add one more comment to theirsThose who are obsessed with scriptures and teachers wont be able to gain release from sufferingBut still those who want to gain release from suffering do have to depend on scriptures and teachersIn practicing concentration theres no way everyone will get results at the same speedSome people get fast results others get slow resultsThere are even those who never seem to gain a taste of stillness at allStill they shouldnt get discouragedThe act of making an effort in the area of the heart is in itself a higher form of merit and skill than the act of giving gifts or observing the preceptsA large number of Luang Pus students would ask him Ive been trying to practice concentration for a long time but my mind has never been stillIt keeps wandering off outsideIs there another way I might be able to practiceLuang Pu would sometimes recommend this other methodWhen the mind isnt still you can at least make sure it doesnt wander off farUse your mindfulness to stay mindful solely of the bodyLook to see it as inconstant stressful and notselfDevelop the perception of its being unattractive with nothing of any substance to it at allWhen the mind sees clearly in this way it will give rise to a sense of dismay disenchantment and dispassionThis too can cut through the clingingaggregatesTheres one thing that meditators love to talk about and thats What do you see when you sit in meditationWhat appears when you meditate Or else they complain that theyve been sitting in meditation for a long time and yet nothing has appeared for them to seeOr else they talk about seeing this thing or that all the timeThis makes some people misunderstand things thinking that when you meditate you get to see what you want to seeLuang Pu would warn these people that this sort of aspiration is all wrong for the purpose of meditation is to enter into the genuine basis of the DhammaThe genuine basis of the Dhamma is the mind so focus on watching the mindGet so that you understand your own mind poignantlyWhen you understand your mind poignantly youve got the basis of the Dhamma right thereTo ward off any heedlessness or carelessness in the behavior of his monks and novices Luang Pu would choose a poignant way of reprimanding themLay people work hard at their living with lots of difficulties so that they can gain the material things the food and the money they need to support their families their children and grandchildrenNo matter how tired or exhausted they are they have to keep strugglingAt the same time they want to gain merit which is why they sacrifice some of their belongings to make meritThey get up early in the morning to fix good food to put in our alms bowlsBefore they put the food in our bowls they lift it above their heads and make a wishWhen theyve finished putting the food in the bowl they back away squat down and raise their hands in respect once moreThey do this because they want merit from supporting our practiceAnd what merit is there in our practice that we can give to themHave you behaved yourself in a way that you deserve to receive their food and eat itAjaan Samret had ordained from when he was a child until he was almost years oldHe had been a meditation teacher strict in his practice good in his reputation and respected by many peopleBut he didnt make it all the wayHis state of mind deteriorated because he fell in love with the daughter of one of his supportersSo he came to take his leave of Luang Pu in order to disrobe and get marriedEveryone was shocked at this news and didnt believe it could possibly be true because looking at his practice they had assumed he would stay in the contemplative life to the end of his daysIf the news were true it would be a major blow to the meditative communityFor this reason fellow elders and his students tried everything they could to get him to change his mind and not disrobeIn particular Luang Pu called for him and tried to talk him out of his plans but to no effectFinally Ajaan Samret said to him I cant stay onEvery time I sit and meditate I see her face floating right in front of meLuang Pu responded in a loud voiceThats because you arent meditating on your own mindYoure meditating on her rear so of course youre going to keep seeing her rearGet out of hereFeel free to go wherever you wantI lived with Luang Pu for more than thirty years attending to his needs all the way to the end of his life and I observed that his practice was right in line with the Dhamma and Vinaya right in line with the path that leads solely to release from sufferingHe never got sidetracked into magical spells sacred talismans or any other dubious activities not even the least little bitWhen people asked him to bless them by blowing on their heads hed ask Why should I blow on your head When people asked him to put an auspicious mark on their car hed say Why put an auspicious mark When people asked him to determine an auspicious day or month for their activities hed say All days are good Or if he were chewing betel and people would ask for the chewed remains hed sayWhy would you want thatIts dirtyThere were times when I felt ill at ease fearing that I may have done wrong in being party to those who talked Luang Pu into doing things that he wasnt interested in doingThe first time was when he joined in the opening ceremonies for the Phra Ajaan Mun Museum in Wat Pa Sutthaavaat in Sakon NakhornThere were lots of meditation teachers and lots of lay people who went to the teachers to pay respect and ask for favorsMany people asked Luang Pu to blow on their headsWhen I saw him just sitting there without responding I pleaded with him Please just do it to get it over with So he blew on their headsAfter a while when he couldnt get out of it hed make auspicious marks on their carsWhen he grew tired of their requests for amulets he allowed them to make amulets in his nameWhen he felt pity on them hed light the victory candle at their chanting rituals and join in their ceremonies for consecrating amuletsBut then I felt extremely relieved when Luang Pu saidMy doing things like this is simply an external physical motion in line with social normsIts not a motion of the mind that leads to states of becoming levels of being or to the paths fruitions and nibbana in any way at allAll sections of the Dhamma are simply strategies for getting people to turn and look at the mindThe Buddhas teachings are many because peoples defilements are manyStill the way to put an end to suffering is only one nibbanaThis opportunity we have to practice the Dhamma rightly is very rareIf we let it pass by well have no chance of gaining release in this lifetime and well have to get lost in wrong views for a long long time before we can meet up with this very same Dhamma againSo now that weve met with the Buddhas teachings we should hurry up and practice to gain releaseOtherwise well miss this good opportunityWhen the noble truths are forgotten darkness will overwhelm beings with a mass of suffering for a long time to comeIt wasnt just once that Luang Pu taught the Dhamma using comparisonsOnce he saidExternal discernment is the discernment of suppositionsIt cant enlighten the mind about nibbanaYou have to depend on the discernment of the noble path if youre going to enter nibbanaThe knowledge of scientists like Einstein is wellinformed and very capableIt can split the smallest atom and enter into the fourth dimensionBut Einstein had no idea of nibbana which was why he couldnt enter nibbanaOnly the mind that has been enlightened in the noble path can lead to real Awakening full Awakening complete AwakeningOnly that can lead to release from suffering to nibbanaIn a lot of undesirable events overwhelmed the senior officials in the Interior Ministry  loss of wealth loss of status criticism and sufferingAnd of course the pain and sorrow spread to affect their wives and children as wellSo one day some of their wives came to pay respect to Luang Pu and told him of their suffering so that he might advise them on how to overcome itHe told themOne shouldnt feel sad or miss things external to the body that are past and gone for those things have performed their function correctly in the most consummate wayMany wellread people would comment that Luang Pus teachings were very similar to those of Zen or the Platform SutraI asked him about this many times and finally he replied in an impersonal wayAll the truths of the Dhamma are already present in the worldWhen the Buddha awakened to those truths he brought them out to teach to the beings of the worldNow because those beings had different propensities  coarse or refined  he had to use up a lot of words sections of Dhamma in allWhen wise people try to select the words best suited to explain the truth to those who aim at the truth they have to use the methods of the truth that on reflection are the most correct and complete without worrying about the words or getting fixated on the letters of the texts in the least way at allAjaan Bate of Khoke Mawn Forest Monastery came to converse with Luang Pu about the practice of concentration saying Ive been practicing concentration for a long time to the point where I can enter fixed penetration for long periodsWhen I leave meditation there are times when I feel a rapturous sense of ease long afterwardsSometimes theres a sense of bright light and I can fully understand the bodyIs there anything else I should do nextLuang Pu answeredUse the power of that fixed penetration to examine the mindThen let go of all preoccupations so that theres nothing left at allAt a later time Ajaan Bate together with two other monks and a large number of lay people came to pay respect to Luang PuAfter Luang Pu had advised the newcomers on how to do the practice Ajaan Bate questioned Luang Pu further on the advice he had received on his last visitLetting go of all objects is something I can do only momentarily he saidI cant stay that way for long periods of timeLuang Pu saidEven if you can let go of all objects for a moment if you arent really observant of the mind or your mindfulness isnt completely allaround it may be that youve simply let go of a blatant object to move to a more refined objectSo you have to stop all thoughts and let the mind settle on nothingnessSomeone said Ive read the passage in your biography where it says that while you were wandering you came to a good understanding about the issue of the mind concocting defilements and defilements concocting the mindWhat does that meanLuang Pu answeredThe mind concocting defilements refers to the minds forcing thoughts words and deeds to make external things come into being making them good making them bad giving rise to the results of kamma and then latching onto those things thinking Thats meThats my selfThats mineThats theirsDefilements concocting the mind refers to external things coming in to force the mind in line with their power so that it fastens on to the idea that it has a self assuming things that keep deviating from the truthSomeone said The teachings about virtue concentration discernment and release that Ive memorized from books and from the teachings of various ajaans Are they in line with Luang Pus understanding of their essenceLuang Pu answeredVirtue means the normalcy of a mind thats free of faults the mind that has armored itself against doing evil of any kindConcentration is the result that comes from maintaining that virtue iea mind with solidity with stillness as the strength sending it on to the next stepDiscernment  what knows  is a mind empty light and at ease seeing things clearly all the way through for what they really areRelease is a mind that enters emptiness from that emptinessIn other words it lets go of the ease leaving a state where it is nothing and has nothing with no thought remaining at allSomeone said When I bring the mind to stillness I try to keep it firmly in that stillnessBut when it meets up with an object or preoccupation it keeps tending to lose the foundation Ive been trying to maintainLuang Pu respondedIf thats the way it is then it shows that your concentration isnt resilient enoughIf these preoccupations are especially strong  and in particular if they concern your weak points  you have to deal with them using the methods of insightStart out by contemplating the coarsest natural phenomenon  the body  analyzing it down to its detailsWhen youve contemplated it so that its perfectly clear move on to contemplating mental phenomena  anything at all in pairs that youve ever analyzed such as black and white or dark and brightA group of monks came to pay their respects to Luang Pu before the Rains Retreat and one of them said Ive been meditating for a long time and have attained some peace but I have this problem about eating meatEven just looking at meat I feel sorry for the animal to whom the meat belonged that it had to sacrifice its life simply for me to consume itIts as if I really lack compassionWhen I start worrying about this I find it hard to bring my mind to peaceLuang Pu saidWhen a monk partakes of the four requisites he should contemplate them firstIf on contemplating he sees that eating meat is a form of oppression and shows a lack of compassion for animals he should abstain from eating meat and eat vegetarian food insteadAbout three or four months later the same group of monks came to pay their respects to Luang Pu after the Rains Retreat and told him We ate vegetarian food throughout the rains but it was very difficultThe lay people where we were staying in Khoke Klaang village Praasaat district knew nothing about vegetarian foodWe had trouble finding any and it was troublesome for the people who were supporting usSome of the monks ended up in poor health and some of us almost didnt make it all the way through the Rains RetreatWe werent able to put as much effort into our meditation as we should haveLuang Pu saidWhen a monk partakes of the four requisites he should contemplate them firstIf on contemplating he sees that the food in front of him  whether its vegetables meat fish or rice  is pure in three ways in that he hasnt seen or heard or suspected that an animal was killed to provide the food specifically for him and also that he himself obtained the food in an ethical way that the lay people donated it out of faith then he should go ahead and eat that foodThis is how our teachers have practiced as wellOn the second day of the waning moon in the third month of Luang Pu was staying at Prakhonchai Forest MonasteryAfter pma group of monks who liked to wander around pitching their tents near populated areas came to the monastery to spend the night there tooAfter paying their respects to Luang Pu they talked about what they felt was the outstanding feature of their practice saying Those who eat meat are supporting the killing of animalsThose who eat only vegetables show a high degree of compassionThe proof of this is that when you convert to eating just vegetables the mind becomes more peaceful and coolLuang Pu respondedThats very goodThe fact that you can be vegetarians is very good and Id like to express my admirationAs for those who still eat meat if that meat is pure in three ways  in that they havent seen or heard or suspected that an animal was killed to provide the food specifically for them  and they obtained it in a pure way then eating the meat is in no way against the Dhamma and VinayaBut when you say that your mind becomes peaceful and cool thats the result of the strength that comes from being intent on practicing correctly in line with the Dhamma and VinayaIt has nothing to do with the new food or old in your stomach at allA group of merchants said We have our duties as merchants which means that sometimes we have to exaggerate things or take excessive profits but were extremely interested in practicing concentration and have already started practicingSome people have told us though that with our livelihood we cant practice meditationWhat do you say about this Luang PuFor they say that selling for a profit is a sinLuang Pu saidIn order to survive every person needs an occupation and every occupation has its own standards of whats right and appropriateWhen you follow those standards in a proper way that counts as neutral  not meritorious not sinfulAs for practicing the Dhamma thats something you should do for only those who practice the Dhamma are fit to work in all circumstancesOnce when Luang Pu was staying at Yothaaprasit Forest Monastery a large number of monks and novices came to pay their respectsAfter they had listened to his teachings Luang Taa Ploi  who had ordained when he was old but was well restrained in his practice  said to Luang Pu Ive ordained for a fairly long time now but I cant yet cut my attachments to the pastNo matter how firmly I set my mind on the present I find that mindfulness lapses and I keep slipping backCould you tell me another method to stop this sort of thingLuang Pu respondedDont let the mind run out after external preoccupationsIf your mindfulness lapses then as soon as youre aware of it immediately pull it backDont let it go looking into preoccupations that are good or bad pleasant or painfulDont fall in line with them but dont use force to cut them offSometime around Luang Pu was invited to a celebration at Wat Dhammamongkon on Sukhumvit Road in BangkokDuring the celebration he was invited to sit in protection as part of a consecration ceremony for Buddha images and amuletsAfter the ceremony was over he went outside to rest in a small hut where he spoke with a large number of his monkstudents who were studying in Bangkok at the timeOne of the monks commented that he had never seen Luang Pu participate in a ceremony like this before and wondered if this was his first timeHe then went on to ask how one goes about sitting in protectionLuang Pu repliedI have no idea what the other ajaans do when theyre sitting in protection or sitting in blessing As for me I simply sit in concentration in my same old styleA young girl once said to Luang Pu I heard Grandfather Sorasak Kawngsuk say that anyone who wants to be intelligent and do well in her studies should first practice sitting in meditation to get the mind concentrated in stillnessI want to be intelligent and do well in my studies so Ive been trying to meditate and bring my mind to stillness but its never been willing to grow stillSometimes I get even more restless than beforeWhen my mind doesnt grow still in this way how can I do well in my studiesLuang Pu answeredSimply focus on knowing what it is that youre studying and that in itself will help you do well in your studiesWhen the minds not still have it know that its not stillIts because you want so much for it to be still that its not stillJust keep at your meditation in a calm way and the day will come itll grow still in line with your wishesSome monks and novices after the Rains Retreat like to go off wandering in groups to various placesEach of them makes a big production out of preparing his requisites and a full set of dhutanga accessoriesBut many of them go in a manner that deviates from the purpose of wandering for seclusionFor instance some of them wear their dhutanga accessories on airconditioned busesSome go visiting their old friends in company officesSo Luang Pu once said in the midst of a gathering of meditation monksTo make yourself a goodlooking wandering monk isnt proper at allIt goes against the purpose of going out to wanderEach of you should reflect a great deal on thisThe purpose of wandering in meditation is only one thing to train and polish the heart so that its free of defilementsTo go wandering in meditation only in body but without taking along the heart is nothing excellent at allA meditator once said to Luang Pu Ive been trying to stop thinking in line with what youve taught but Ive never been able to succeedWhats worse is that Ive gotten frustrated and my brain seems dazedIm convinced though that what youve taught isnt wrong so Id like to ask for some advice on what to do nextLuang Pu respondedThat shows that youve missed the pointYoure told to stop thinking but all you do is think about stopping your thinking so how can the actual stopping come aboutGet rid of all your ignorance about stopping to thinkAbandon your thoughts about stopping your thinking and thatll be the end of the matterThe second day of the waning moon of the eleventh month Luang Pus birthday falls on the second day after the end of the Rains Retreat every yearSo his students  both scholarly monks and practicing monks  liked to travel to pay their respects to him on that day to ask his advice on the practice or to report the results of their practice from the preceding RainsThis is one tradition they observed as long as he was aliveOnce after giving detailed advice on how to practice Luang Pu ended with the following wordsStudying the Dhamma by reading and listening results in perceptions and conceptsStudying the Dhamma by practicing it results in actual levels of Dhamma in the heartPhra Maha Thaweesuk was the first of Luang Pus students to pass the ninth and final level of the Pali examsThus in Luang Pus name Wat Burapha sponsored a celebration of his achievementAfter Phra Maha Thaweesuk had paid his respects to Luang Pu Luang Pu gave him a short admonitionTo be able to pass the ninth level exams shows that youre very industrious sufficiently intelligent and an expert in the Canon for this counts as the completion of the study courseBut to be interested just in study cant bring release from sufferingYou have to be interested in the practice of training the mind as wellAll sections of the Dhamma came out of the Buddhas mindEverything comes out of the mindWhatever you want to know you can look for it in the mindOn March Luang Pu went to Sri Kaew Cave Monastery on Phu Phaan Mountain Sakon Nakorn province for more than ten days of solitude and restOn the evening of the last day before he was to leave Ajaan Suwat together with the other monks and novices in the monastery came to pay their respectsLuang Pu commented Its been comfortable resting hereThe air is good and the meditation easyIt makes me think of the old days when I was wanderingThen he gave a Dhamma talk which included the following passageThat which can be known all belongs to the worldAs for that which has no thing that can know it thats the DhammaThe world always has things that come in pairs but the Dhamma is one thing all the way throughMany people interested in the practice whether lay or ordained are not only intent on their practice but also like to search out teachers who are skilled in giving adviceOnce a group of meditating monks from the central region of Thailand came to spend many days listening to Luang Pus Dhamma and to his advice on meditationOne of the monks told Luang Pu of his feelings Ive searched out many teachers and although they all teach well they generally teach just about the Vinaya or the practicing of wandering and following the ascetic practices or else the bliss and stillness that come from practicing concentrationBut as for you you teach the straight route to the top notself emptiness nibbanaForgive me for being so forward as to ask but in teaching about nibbana have you attained it yetLuang Pu answeredTheres nothing that will attain and nothing that wont attainAjaan Bate a close relative of Luang Pus lived at Khoke Mawn MonasteryEven though he ordained only late in life he was extremely strict in his practice of meditation and the ascetic practicesLuang Pu once praised him saying that his practice had gotten good resultsWhen Ajaan Bate fell seriously ill and was near death he said that he wanted to see Luang Pu one last time to bid him farewell before dyingI informed Luang Pu who went to see himOn his arrival Ajaan Bate got up and bowed down to him and then lay back on his sleeping mat as before without saying a wordBut his smile and the happy look on his face were easy to seeLuang Pu said to him in a voice both clear and gentleAll the practices youve been trying to practice are specifically meant for use at this timeWhen the time comes to die make the mind one then stop focusing and let go of everythingWhen lay people came to visit Luang Pu he ordinarily wouldnt ask them about anything far awayHed usually ask Have you ever meditated Some would respond that they had others that they hadntOne woman a member of the latter group was more outspoken than the restShe said As I see it theres no reason we have to go to all the trouble of meditatingEvery year I hear the Mahachaad sermon at least times at many different templesThe monks there say that listening to the Mahachaad story guarantees Ill be reborn in the time of the Buddha Sri Ariya Metteya where Ill meet with nothing but pleasure and easeSo why should I make things difficult for myself by meditatingLuang Pu saidThings that are excellent are right in front of your face and yet you dont show any interestInstead you place your hopes on faroff things that are nothing but rumorsThis is the mark of a person whos hopelessWhen the paths fruitions and nibbana of the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama are still with us totally complete and yet you dither around and dont show any interest in them then when the dispensation of the Buddha Sri Ariya Metteya comes youll dither around even moreSometimes when Luang Pu noticed that the people who came to practice with him were still uncommitted still pining after the happiness and enjoyment of purely worldly things to the point where they werent ready to let them go and practice the Dhamma hed give them a teaching to think about so as to see things clearly for what they areI ask you all to examine happiness to see exactly where was the point of greatest happiness in your lifeWhen you really look at it youll see that its just that  nothing more than anything else youve ever experiencedWhy wasnt it more than thatBecause the world has nothing more than thatThats all it has to offer  over and over again nothing more than that at allJust birth aging illness and death over and over againTheres got to be a happiness more extraordinary than that more excellent than that safer than thatThis is why the noble ones sacrifice limited happiness in search of the happiness that comes from stilling the body stilling the mind stilling the defilementsThats the happiness thats safe to which nothing else can compareWat Burapha where Luang Pu spent each Rains Retreat without exception for more than years is situated in the heart of the town of Surin right in front of the Provincial Offices and next to the provincial courtFor this reason the noise of cars and trucks was constantly disturbing the peace and quiet of the monasteryEspecially during the annual Elephant Fair or any of the holidays there would be noise and bright lights for seven or fifteen days at a timeThe monks and novices whose minds still lacked resilience would be especially bothered by thisWhenever theyd bring this to Luang Pus attention theyd always get the same responseWhy waste your time being interested in those thingsIts the nature of light to be brightIts the nature of noise to be loudThats what their functions areIf you dont focus on listening thats the end of the matterAct in a way thats not in opposition to your surroundings for thats just the way they areSimply reach a genuine understanding with them using deep discernment thats allOne of my weaknesses was that I liked to talk with Luang Pu half in jestThis was because he never took offense and was always approachable to the monks and novices who lived close to himOnce I asked him In the texts they say that devas came by the tens of billions to listen to the BuddhaWould there be enough space to hold them allWas his voice loud enough for all of them to hearWhen I heard Luang Pus answer I was stunned and amazed for I had never read anything like it in the texts and had never heard anyone say such a thing beforeOn top of that I heard him say this only when he was seriously ill and nearing deathThere would be no problem even if the devas gathered by the millions of billions for the space of one atom can hold up to eight devasThat insoluble problem that people  whether children or adults intelligent or stupid  argue about uselessly and without ever coming to an agreement is this Which came first the chicken or the eggFor the most part they argue about this only in jest and can never come to any conclusionStill there were people who would bring this question to Luang Pu thinking that he probably wouldnt answer a question of this sortBut eventually I heard him give an answer like nobody elses when one day Phra Berm came to massage his feet and asked him Luang Pu which came first the chicken or the eggLuang Pu answeredThey came at the same timeThere were times when Luang Pu seemed almost annoyed with people who having hardly meditated at all asked him how to push things along so that they could see results right awayHe would scold themWe practice for the purpose of restraint for the purpose of abandoning for the purpose of unraveling our desires for the purpose of putting an end to suffering not for the purpose of seeing heavenly mansionsWe dont even make it our goal to see nibbanaJust keep on practicing calmly without wanting to see anything at allAfter all nibbana is something empty without shapeTheres no foundation to it and nothing to which it can be comparedOnly if you keep at the practice will you know for yourselfOne of Luang Pus lay students came to pay his respects and to report proudly on the results he had gained from his practice saying Im really glad to see you today because Ive been practicing in line with your advice and have been getting results step by stepWhen I start meditating I let go of all external perceptions and the mind stops its turmoilIt gathers together grows still and drops into concentrationAll other preoccupations disappear leaving just happiness an extreme happiness cool and refreshedI can stay there as long as I wantLuang Pu smiled and saidIts good that youre getting resultsSpeaking of the happiness in concentration it really is happyTheres nothing else that can compareBut if you get stuck just on that level thats all you getIt doesnt give rise to the discernment of the noble path that can cut through becoming and birth craving and attachmentSo the next step is to let go of that happiness and contemplate the five aggregates to see them clearlyThe mind of a noble one who has reached the transcendent even though it may live in the world surrounded by whatever the surroundings cant be pulled by the world into getting perturbed or mixed up with those things at allIn other words the affairs of the world cant overwhelm it cant pull it back to the level of a runofthemill persons mindIt cant be brought under the power of defilement or craving ever againIts like coconut milkOnce you squeeze it out of the coconut flesh and boil it over high heat until the oil separates you cant turn it back into coconut milk againNo matter how much you may mix the oil with other coconut milk you cant turn the oil back into coconut milk at allThe paths fruitions and nibbana are personal You can truly see them only for yourselfThose who practice to that level will see them for themselves will be clear about them for themselves will totally end all their doubts about the Buddhas teachingIf you havent reached that level all you can do is keep on guessingNo matter how profoundly someone else may explain them to you your knowledge about them will be guessworkWhatever is guesswork will have to be uncertainIts like the turtle and the fishThe turtle lives in two worlds the world on land and the world in the waterAs for the fish it lives only in one world the waterIf it were to get on land it would dieOne day when a turtle came down into the water it told a group of fish about how much fun it was to be on land The lights and colors were pretty and there were none of the difficulties that came from being in the waterThe fish were intrigued and wanted to see what it was like on land so they asked the turtle Is it very deep on landThe turtle answered What would be deep about itIts landThe fish Are there lots of waves on landThe turtle What would be wavy about itIts landThe fish Is it murky with mudThe turtle What would be murky about itIts landNotice the questions asked by the fishThey simply take their experience of water to ask the turtle and the turtle can do nothing but say noThe mind of a runofthemill person guessing about the paths fruitions and nibbana is no different from the fishThe evening of April after Luang Pu had returned from a ceremony in the palace and was resting at the royal monastic dwelling in Wat Bovorn a highranking monk who was also a meditator came to visit and to converse with him about the DhammaHis first question was this They say that a person who was a yakkha in a previous life on returning to a human birth can study magical formulae and be very powerful in whatever way he uses themHow true is thatLuang Pu sat right up and answeredIve never been interested in that sort of thing at allBut have you ever meditated to this point hasituppapada the movement of the mind where it smiles on its own without any intention to smileIt happens only in a noble ones mindIt doesnt happen in ordinary people because it lies beyond the conditions of fabrication  free in and of itselfGreat senior monks tend to have lots of students both lay and ordainedAnd among those students are people both good and badEspecially among the monks There are lots of good ones with a few bad ones mixed inOne of the monks close to Luang Pu tended to be a little too casual about taking things without permissionPeople would report this to Luang Pu but he tended not to say anything about itOnce when he wanted something that this monk had taken he asked another monk to go ask after it but the first monk denied having taken itThe second monk came back to inform Luang Pu of the first monks denialLuang Pu didnt complain but simply said thisSome monks are so intent on observing the precepts that they forget to observe the fiveIt was after pm and I saw that Luang Pu was sitting and resting so I went to inform him Luang Pu Ajaan Khao has diedInstead of asking when or how Luang Pu saidAh yesAjaan Khao is finally done with the burden of hauling his sankharas aroundI visited him four years ago and saw all the difficulties his physical sankharas were giving himHe had to have other people looking after him all the timeAs for me I have no bad karma with regard to the bodyBut as for bad karma associated with the body even noble ones  no matter what the level of their attainment  still have to contend with these things until theyre finally released from them and no longer involved with themThe normal state of the mind is that it has to live with things of this sortBut as for the mind thats welltrained when these things arise it can immediately let them go and maintain its peace without worries without attachments free from the burden of having to be involved with themThats all there isThe great fire in Surin resulted in lot of suffering a huge destruction of property and a great sense of lossSome folks even went out of their mindsPeople came in a stream to see Luang Pu and to bemoan the good they had done in the past saying Weve been making merit at the temple and practicing the Dhamma since the time of our grandparentsWhy didnt that merit help usWhy didnt the Dhamma protect usThe fire totally destroyed our homes Many of these people stopped coming to the monastery to make merit because the Dhamma didnt help protect their homes from burning downLuang Pu saidThe Dhamma doesnt help people in that way at allThe fire simply acted in line with its functionWhat this means is that destruction loss disintegration separation have always been with us in this worldAs for those who practice the Dhamma who have the Dhamma in their hearts when they meet with these things they understand how to place the mind in such a way that it doesnt sufferThats how the Dhamma helpsIts not the case that it helps by preventing aging or death or hunger or fireThats not the case at allWhen people asked Luang Pu about death and rebirth or about past and future lives he was never interested in answeringOr if some people argued that they didnt believe that heaven or hell really existed he never tried to reason with them or to cite evidence to defeat their argumentsInstead hed give them this piece of advicePeople who practice the Dhamma dont have to give any thought to past or future lives or to heaven or hellAll they have to do is be firm and intent on practicing correctly in line with the principles of virtue concentration and discernmentIf there really are levels of heaven as they say in the texts people who practice well are sure to rise to those levelsOr if heaven and nibbana dont exist people who practice well dont lack for benefits here and nowTheyre sure to be happy as human beings on a high levelListening to what other people say looking things up in the texts cant resolve your doubtsYou have to put effort into the practice to give rise to clear insight knowledgeThats when doubt will be totally resolved on its ownEven though people would come in groups to hear Luang Pus opinion about rebirth claiming that this person or that was able to remember many past lives seeing what they had been in the past or who their mothers or relatives in past lives had been Luang Pu would sayIve never been interested in this sort of knowledgeEven just threshold concentration can give rise to itEverything comes from the mindWhatever you want to know or see the mind will grant you the knowledge or vision  and quickly at thatIf youre satisfied with just this level of knowledge the good result is that youll fear being reborn on a low levelThat way youll set your mind on doing good being generous observing the precepts and not harming one anotherYoull be able to smile confident in the results of your meritBut as for eliminating defilement to destroy ignorance craving and attachment in order to reach total release from suffering thats something else entirelyIn all the long time I lived close to Luang Pu there were never any fables or entertaining tales in his teachings  no jataka tales or stories of the presentAll his teachings were noble truths pure and simple on the ultimate or impersonal levelOr else they were a few carefully chosen comments as if he were trying to be frugal in his wordsEven when he gave instructions on religious ceremonies or on how to make donations or basic morality he taught in a very detached wayFor the most part hed sayCeremonies and meritmaking activities can be regarded as skillful means but from a meditators point of view they lead to only a small amount of skill thats allAfter the opening ceremonies for the Phra Ajaan Mun Museum Luang Pu traveled further to visit Ajaan Funn at Khaam CaveIn those days large vehicles could go no further than the base of the hill where the cave was located which meant that Luang Pu had to climb a long distance up the hillThis he found extremely tiring having to stop and catch his breath many timesI felt keenly pained for my part in putting him to such difficultiesFinally when we had reached the meeting hall at the top of the hill and Ajaan Funn had paid his respects Ajaan Thate happened to arrive as wellSeeing these three great elders coincidentally meeting and hearing them converse in a friendly way in such a peaceful and smiling atmosphere my sense of inner pain totally disappeared and was replaced by a feeling of raptureAjaan Funn expressed his admiration of Luang Pu saying Your health is very strongEven at your age youre still able to climb all the way up the hillLuang Pu respondedIm not really all that strongIve looked the matter over and seen that I have no bad karma with regard to the bodyWhen I cant use the body any more Ill just drop it thats allIm sure you can imagine how thrilled the large surrounding crowd of lay people was to be present at this coincidental meeting of three great ajaansThis sort of opportunity isnt easy to findSo two photographers from Surin starting taking as many pictures as they couldWhen we were back on the bus for the trip home the photographers saw that everyone was hungry for the pictures so they announced that they would blow them up to  prints and sell them with the proceeds going to help Jawm Phra Forest MonasteryI thought to myself that it wasnt a very pretty thing to see a price put on an ajaans pictures with the purpose of selling them but almost everyone on the bus placed an orderWhen the photographers developed their film they discovered that of the more than twenty pictures they had gone to all that effort to take all were totally blank like a cloudless skyThat put an end to everyones hopes for the pictures and as it turned out that was the last meeting among those three great ajaansWhen people asked Luang Pu if he had read any of the many accounts of Ajaan Muns life he would answer A few The next question would be And what do you think of all the psychic powers and miraculous events they describe Luang Pu would answer Back in the days when I was living with Ajaan Mun I never heard him mention anything about themNormally when Luang Pu would speak of Ajaan Mun hed speak only of his ascetic practices sayingAmong the later generations of monks Ive never seen a single one adhere to these practices as strictly as Ajaan MunHe wore only robes made of rags that he had sewn and dyed himselfHe never used finished robes received from anyone elseHe stayed in forest dwellings his entire lifeHe ate only the food he had received on alms round and only out of his alms bowlEven when he was severely ill he would sit up and hold his bowl in his lap for others to put alms inHe never took the special allowances that come from spending the Rains Retreat or receiving the kathinaHe never got involved in construction work and never tried to persuade other people to do soBecause I had been on familiar terms with Luang Pu for a long time when I would ask him a question he would tend to answer by asking a question in return  his way of getting me to think out the answer on my ownFor example when I asked The minds of arahants are clean and brightCan they predict the next lottery number accurately he answered Would arahants be interested in knowing stuff like thatWhen I asked Do arahants dream in their sleep like ordinary people he answered Arent dreams an affair of the aggregate of fabricationWhen I asked Have there ever been any runofthemill people still thick with defilements who have nevertheless been able to teach other people to become arahants he answeredHavent there been a lot of doctors who even though they themselves are ill have been able to cure other people of their illnessesBodily He was physically strong and nimble wellproportioned in his features cleansmelling with few diseasesHe liked to bathe with warm water only once a dayVerbal He had a deep voice but spoke softlyHe was a man of few words who spoke the truth spoke directly with no scheming to his speechIn other words he never hinted never cajoled never spoke sarcastically never gossiped never begged never asked anyones pardon never talked about his dreamsHe never told jataka stories or fabulous talesMental There was a truth to him  once he had set his mind on doing something he would work at it until he succeededHe was always kind and compassionate quiet calm and enduringHe never flared up in anger or showed any signs of frustration or impatienceHe was never upset about things that were lost and was never heedlessFully mindful alert he was cheerful at all timesHe never seemed to suffer and was always unshaken by eventsNo untoward states of mind overcame himHe always taught usTry to clearly understand events as events that they arise change and then dissolve awayDont suffer or be sad because of themLuang Pu was severely ill at the Chulalongkorn HospitalOn the night of the th day of his stay he was very fatigued to the point where the doctors had to give him an oxygen tubeLate that night after midnight a famous monk together with a large following came to pay respectSeeing that this was a special occasion I let them into Luang Pus roomLuang Pu lay on his right side with his eyes closed throughout the visitWhen the monk and his following had bowed down to him the monk leaned over him and spoke directly into his ear Luang Pu do you still have feelings of painLuang Pu answeredFeeling and body still exist in line with their nature but I dont partake of that feeling at allOn January just before Luang Pu was to leave Chulalongkorn Hospital his students decided to donate a sanghadana to dedicate the merit to the past generations who had built the hospital and had since passed onWhen the ceremony was over a number of doctors and nurses came to pay their respects to Luang Pu and to express their happiness that he had recoveredThey commented in a friendly way Your health is still good and strongYour face is bright as if you hadnt been sick at allThis is probably the fruit of your good powers of concentrationWe dont have much spare time to practice concentrationAre there any methods that are simple or quickLuang Pu respondedWhenever you have time use that time to practiceTraining the mind examining the mind is the quickest most direct method of allThroughout his life Luang Pu never accepted the idea of lucky hours or lucky daysEven when he was simply asked What would be a good day to ordain or to disrobe or Which days are lucky or unlucky he never went along with the ideaHed usually say All days are good If people asked him to determine an auspicious time he would have them go find out for themselves or else he would say Any time thats convenient is a good timeHe would conclude by sayingEverything comes from our behaviorGood times bad times lucky times unlucky times merit sin All these things come from human behaviorLuang Pu never did anything to make a show or call attention to himselfFor example if people wanted to take his picture their timing would have to be rightFor instance if he had already put on his full set of robes to listen to the Patimokkha or to ordain a monk or to participate in one sort of ceremony or another then if you asked to take his picture at a moment like that it would be easyBut if he was sitting informally and you asked him to get up and put on his robes to pose for a picture youd have a hard time getting him to complyOnce a lady from Bangkok brought a fine blanket for Luang Pu to use in the cold seasonA few months later in the middle of the hot season she happened to come and pay her respects againShe asked him to get the blanket and pose with it so that she could take a picture because she had forgotten to take a picture when she had donated itLuang Pu refused to do so saying gently Theres no real need for that Even when she asked him a second time and a third he kept saying Theres no real needWhen she left I felt ill at ease so I went to Luang Pu and asked him Do you realize how dissatisfied she wasLuang Pu smiled and saidI knowAnd the reason she was dissatisfied is because she has a dissatisfying heartOnce a senior meditation teacher came to discuss many highlevel topics of Dhamma with Luang Pu and ended with a question Some of the senior meditation monks conduct themselves well and inspire great respectEven other monks agree that theyre firmly established in the Buddhas teachingsBut then something happensEither they disrobe or their behavior starts going astray running afoul of the Dhamma and VinayaSo what level of Dhamma does one have to reach in order to cut transmigration for sure so that theres no more becoming and birthLuang Pu saidBeing strictly restrained in line with the Vinaya and observing the ascetic practices is an admirable form of conduct thats extremely inspiringBut if you havent developed the mind to the level of heightened mind and heightened discernment it can always regress for it hasnt yet reached the transcendentActually arahants dont need to know muchThey simply have to develop their minds to be clear about the five aggregates and to penetrate dependent coarisingThats when they can stop fabricating stop searching stop all motions of the mindRight there is where everything endsAll that remains is pure clean bright  great emptiness enormously emptyThe desire to know and see so as to put an end to ones doubts is something you find in all advanced peopleEvery science every branch of learning has been established so that people will question and want to knowThats when theyll make the effort to study and practice to reach the goal of that branch of learningBut in the area of the Buddhas teachings you have to study and practice in a balanced wayAnd your effort has to be intense so that you can enter into the highest thing in the Dhamma on your ownThats when youll end your doubts totally on your ownIts like a person from the countryside whos never seen BangkokWhen people tell him that in addition to being developed in other ways Bangkok has a Jewel Wall and an enormous Gold Mountain he makes up his mind to go to Bangkok with the expectation that hell be able to get some jewels from the wall and some gold from the mountainBut when he finally makes it to Bangkok and someone shows him Thats the Jewel Wall thats the Gold Mountain that puts an immediate end to all his questions and expectationsThe paths fruitions and nibbana are like thatI remember that in two meditation teachers from the northern part of the Northeast came to pay their respects to Luang PuThe way they discussed the practice with him was very delightful and inspiringThey described the virtues and attainments of the different ajaans with whom they had lived and practiced for a long time saying that that luang pu had concentration as his constant mental dwelling this ajaan dwelled in the Brahma attitudes which is why so many people respected him that luang pu dwelled in the limitless Brahma attitudes which is why there was no limit to the number of students he had and why he was always safe from dangersLuang Pu saidWhatever level a monk has reached as far as Im concerned hes welcome to dwell thereAs for me I dwell with knowingWhen those two monks heard Luang Pu say that he dwelled with knowing they were silent for a moment and then asked him to explain what dwelling with knowing was likeLuang Pu explainedKnowing is the normality of mind thats empty bright pure that has stopped fabricating stopped searching stopped all mental motions  having nothing not attached to anything at allLuang Pu was pure in his speech because he liked to talk about the genuine truthHed speak only of the highest aims of the Buddhas teachings hed refer only to the Buddhas words that led solely to the end of suffering and stressYou could tell this from the Buddhas teaching he quoted most oftenThe Buddha saidMonks there that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither the dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moonAnd there I say is neither coming nor going nor staying neither passing away nor arising unestablished unevolving without supportThis just this is the end of stressWhen Luang Pu returned from the hospital in early it didnt mean that he had fully recovered from his illness simply that he had to use an extreme level of endurance to survive for eight more months to the special meritmaking celebration that had been planned for his th birthdayAs the day of the ceremony approached his symptoms started getting erratic Hed be very tired uncomfortable and feverish from time to timeI asked him if we should take him back to Chulalongkorn Hospital but he said Theres no need to And then he added I forbid you to take me for even if I went I wouldnt recoverI replied Last time your illness was heavier than this and you still recoveredThis time its not heavy at allYoure sure to recoverLuang Pu saidThat was last timeThis isnt last timeOn October Luang Pus condition was no better than stable after pm but his complexion was abnormally brightHis followers  lay people town monks and forest monks  came in large numbers for the celebrationAt pm a large contingent of forest monks came to pay respect to Luang Pu who sat up and discussed the Dhamma with themSpeaking in a clear voice he advised them on the entire path of practice as if he were resolving all their doubts and questions summarizing all the meditation instructions he had ever taughtLater that night near pm Luang Pu had us take him out of his hut in a wheelchairHe looked gently around the whole area of the monastery with no one realizing that that would be his last look at things outsideAfter pm Luang Pu had us take him back into his roomHe lay on his back supported by a large pillowHe asked the eight or nine monks in the room to chant the Seven Blessing Chants for him to hearThen he told them to chant the Satisambojjhanga Sutta three times and Dependent Coarising three timesThen he asked us to chant the Great Frames of Reference Discourse but none of us had memorized itSo he said Open your chanting books and chant from the book but there were no chanting books aroundFortunately Ajaan Phuunsak who had been looking after Luang Pu all along had brought his copy of the Royal Chanting Book so he picked it up and searched through the book to find the right page leafing back and forth until Luang Pu said Hand it here He then opened the book to the right page without even looking at it and said Chant from right here This amazed every monk in the room for Luang Pu had opened the book right to the Mahasatipatthana Discourse on pageThe discourse was long and it took us more than two hours to finish itHe listened quietly throughoutA few moments after we had finished chanting the Mahasatipatthana Discourse Luang Pu began speaking about the Lord Buddhas total nibbana from the beginning to the endHere Ill ask just to quote his concluding remarksThe Lord Buddha didnt attain nibbana in any of his jhanic attainmentsWhen he left the fourth jhana his mental aggregates all ceased at once with nothing remainingIn other words he allowed his feeling aggregate to cease in an awake state of mind the normal human mental series complete with mindfulness and alertness with no other mental states coming to blind or delude the mind at allThis was the mind fully in its own stateYou could call that state great emptiness or the original cosmos or nibbana whichever you likeThats the state Ive been practicing all along to reachThose were Luang Pus last wordsLets go back in time for a moment to some events nearly years agoLuang Pus group of four wandering monks and novices had split off from Ajaan Muns group and were wandering through Thaa Khantho district in Kalasin provinceAs they went through the dense forest they encountered all sorts of dangers and difficulties every kind of wild animal and in particular malariaFinally one of the monks unable to fight off the disease died in a pitiful way right in front of his fellow monksWorse than that when Luang Pu split off from the group accompanied by just one small novice into another forest wilderness near Kut Kawm village malaria came and took the life of the novice right before his eyesLuang Pu could do nothing but look on in utter dismay simply because he lacked the medicine to treat the diseaseNow come back to the events just after amon OctoberThat same condition of wilderness returned for a moment in Luang Pus room for although he was seriously ill there wasnt a single nurse not a single drop of saline solution anywhere aroundThere were simply Luang Pus monastic students circled around him as if protecting his total freedom to put down his body in a death that left no traces  completely pure quiet and calmThe Buddha had searched for the truth for six years and when he gained Awakening he did so at the approach of dawn ie after amHaving gained Awakening he taught for another years using the period after ameach day to spread his awareness to see whom he should teach the next dayWhen the time came for his total nibbana he chose the same time of dayA bundle of fabrications that had arisen on October in Praasaat Village Surin province grew and developed in stages conducting his life in a way that was admirable and rightHe remained in the ochre robe to the end of his days practicing in an exemplary fashion truly an unexcelled field of merit for the world He worked in a consummate way for his own true benefit and for the true benefit of others until OctoberThats when Luang Pu dropped his body at am just like thatWhat was amazing was that his students  lay and ordained city dwellers and forest dwellers  had already gathered to make merit in celebration of the beginning of Luang Pus th year the completion of his eighth twelveyear cycle as if in full preparation for this eventIt was only then that I understood what Luang Pu had meant when he said that he had no bad karma with regard to the bodyFor even though he had reached his th year his body was strong spry clean and calmAlways fully mindful and alert he suffered no senility or forgetful lapses at allWhen the time came for him to die he died quietly with no signs of pain or difficultyHe caused no trouble mental or physical for those who were looking after him no waste of doctors no waste of medicine no waste of anyones timeIn the midst of the stillness near dawn free of the noise of people or traffic  even the leaves of the trees were still the air was cool with a gentle drizzle falling like snow  Luang Pu a member of the pure noble Sangha dropped his body leaving us with only his virtues to remember and miss in a way that will know no endThe daily schedule at Metta Forest Monastery includes a group interview in the late afternoon and a chanting session followed by a group meditation period later in the eveningThe Dhamma talks included in this volume were given during the evening meditation sessions and in many cases covered issues raised at the interviews  either in the questions asked or lurking behind the questionsOften these issues touched on a variety of topics on a variety of different levels in the practiceThis explains the range of topics covered in individual talksI have edited the talks with an eye to making them readable while at the same time trying to preserve some of the flavor of the spoken wordIn a few instances I have added passages or rearranged the talks to make the treatment of specific topics more coherent and complete but for the most part I have kept the editing to a minimumDont expect polished essaysThe people listening to these talks were familiar with the meditation instructions included in Method  in Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo and my own essay A Guided Meditation If you are not familiar with these instructions you might want to read through them before reading the talks in this bookAlso further Dhamma talks are available at wwwaccesstoinsightorg and dhammatalksorgAs with the previous volumes in this series I would like to thank Bok Lim Kim for making the recording of these talks possibleShe more than anyone else is responsible for overcoming my initial reluctance to have the talks recordedI would also like to thank the following people for transcribing the talks andor helping to edit the transcriptions Debra Breger Paul Breger Kathy Forsythe Addie Onsanit Nathaniel Osgood Xiao Quan Osgood Barbara Pereira and Michael Zoll VensAtthaññu Bhikkhu Balaggo Bhikkhu Gunaddho Bhikkhu Metteyyo Bhikkhu and Vijjakaro BhikkhuMay they all be happyIf you read a lot of books about the Dhamma it can get pretty confusing after a while for there are so many different takes on exactly what the Dhamma isOn top of that there are people who will tell you its all very complex very subtle only a very erudite scholar or subtle logician could figure it all outWith so many teachings its hard to figure out which ones to hold on toOf course some people will tell you that you cant hold onto anything at allThat makes it even more confusing and obscureSo its good to remember that the Buddha himself taught the Dhamma in very simple termsAnd all the teachings derived from a few very basic very commonsensical principlesYou might call it wisdom for dummies the kind of wisdom that comes from looking at whats actually going on in your life asking some very basic questions and applying a few very basic principles to solve your big problemsWhen you use wisdom for dummies it doesnt mean youre dumbIt means you recognize that youve been foolish and you want to wise upAs the Buddha once said when you recognize your foolishness you are to that extent wiseThis may sound obvious but when you think about it you see that it teaches you some important things about wisdomIn fact the realization that youve been foolish contains within itself many of the basic principles of the DhammaTo begin with this kind of realization usually comes to you when you see youve made a mistake you could have avoidedIn recognizing that much you recognize that your actions do make a difference Some actions are more skillful than othersIn recognizing that the mistake came from your foolishness you recognize the principle that your ideas and intentions played a role in your actions and that you could have operated under other ideas and intentionsYou could have been wiser  the mistake wasnt preordained  and youve got something to learnThat right there is the beginning of wisdomIts when youre willing to learn that the Buddha can teach you more about what it means to be wiseStart with one of his basic ways of distinguishing a wise person from a fool If youre a wise person you tend to your own duties and avoid the things youre not responsible forIf youre a fool you tend to ignore the things youre responsible for and to focus on things youre not responsible forThis is probably the number one principle because it cuts out a lot of other issues such as taking a stand on where the universe came from or if the universe came from anything whether its finite or infinite what your inner nature isA lot of what we think of as metaphysical issues get put aside this way because youre not really responsible for those issuesAnd what are you responsible forYour actions what youre choosing to doNo one else can make your choices for you so you have to focus on doing them wellThis is why the Buddha says that wisdom starts growing when you ask someone whos knowledgeable Whats skillfulWhats unskillfulWhat when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happinessWhat when I do it will lead to my longterm harm and suffering Why are these questions wiseBecause they come from seeing that the issue of how to find a worthwhile happiness is something you really are responsible forHappiness is preferable to suffering it depends on your actions and longterm happiness is better than shorttermThis is whats meant by skillfulThe distinction between skillful and unskillful is another basic principleOnce one of the Buddhas lay students was accosted by someone from another tradition who asked him Well now does your teacher teach about the origin of universe or whether its finite or infinite He went down the list of the big issues of the time and the lay student kept saying No he doesnt talk about any of those things And the other person responded Well in that case hes a nihilistHe doesnt teach anything at all So the lay student said No thats not trueHe does teach the difference between whats skillful and whats not He later went to report this conversation to the Buddha who approved of what he had saidThe distinction between skillful and unskillful forms the basis for the four noble truthsWhen you dig deep down into why people suffer you find that its because of cravingHow can people stop sufferingBy developing the path which is primarily composed of good qualities of mindSo you realize the mind has to be trainedThats another basic principle of wisdom that true happiness comes from training the mind because the mind is what makes the choicesThats why we meditateAnd thats why meditation requires that we focus our attention on the present moment because these choices are being made right nowThis again brings up the distinction between shortterm and longterm happinessNot all your choices are between doing something harmful and something not harmfulSometimes the choice is between two things that are relatively harmless but one leads to shortterm and the other to longterm happinessYou have only a limited amount of time a limited amount of energy so you dont want to get distracted by the shortterm thingsNow part of the mind likes doing things that lead to longterm suffering because they provide happiness in the shorttermSometimes itll deny the longterm suffering or else itll feel that the quick fix is worth the tradeThen there are other things difficult in the shortterm that lead to longterm happiness down the lineSo you need strategies and tactics for getting the mind to avoid the things that you like doing that are going to be harmful in the longterm and to get yourself to do the things that may be difficult now but will give you longterm happinessThis too the Buddha said is a basic measure of your wisdomOne of these strategies is developing the brahmaviharasRemind yourself that you want to be kind to yourselfYou want to be kind to other peopleThis is an attitude you want to develop because it helps youWhen youre facing a shortterm happiness that leads to longterm suffering either for yourself or other people it really helps to have this attitude of kindness already developed in the mindThis is one of the reasons why we meditate to develop these attitudes ahead of timeHaving the breath as a way of training yourself to be kind to yourself is an important aspect of developing goodwill It helps you realize that you really do have a role in shaping your present experience starting with the breath and then moving into other areas of the presentTheres nobody forcing you to breathe in an uncomfortable way or in a way that puts yourself to sleep or in a way that gets you anxious and on edgeAnd yet we allow these things to happen because were distracted often about things that are really none of our businessBut the breath is something that really is your responsibilityNobody else can breathe for youAnd nobody else can tell you what kind of breathing is going to be comfortableYou have to pay attention yourselfSo this is another area where you really are responsibleAnd it does have a huge impactIf the mind has a sense of inner wellbeing youre operating from a position of strengthYou dont have to be a slave to things outsideYou dont have to let the mind be shaken by things outsideYou have a different source for happiness that comes from withinYoure coming from a position of strength which means that youre in a better position to act in skillful waysAt the same time you get more and more sensitive to one of the big principles in the workings of cause and effect the principle that informs all the basic principles of wisdom and discernment the fact that some causes have an effect over time some have an effect immediately and some have bothWhen youre facing any experience in the present moment part of it comes from past actions and part from things youre doing right nowYou arent currently responsible for the things coming from past actions but you are responsible for the things coming from your present actionsIt takes sensitivity to figure out which is which but if you can develop that sensitivity it gives you a handle on thingsYou may be experiencing pain right now but you dont have to suffer from itThe choices youre making right now are the ones deciding whether youll suffer or notThis is where the distinction between what youre responsible for and what youre not shows its more subtle sideIf theres pain coming from past actions its dukkha in the context of the three characteristicsIts just part of the way things areThe suffering youre adding though is dukkha in the four noble truths which doesnt have to be thereIt comes from your craving and thats something you can do something aboutThere may be pain in the body there may be undesirable thoughts coming up in the mind but as you focus more carefully in the present moment you begin to realize that you choose where to focus and how you want to shape the situationYou could let yourself suffer fall victim to these things or you could make a changeThis point is often misunderstoodWhen you read the Buddhas teachings on mindfulness out of context its possible to interpret them as saying that when youre being mindful say of feelings you just watch whatever feeling comes up and dont make any changesDont meddle with itJust be nonreactive allowing whatevers happening to happenWhat this attitude does though is to drive underground some really important sources for insight the ability to see to what extent youre shaping your feelings of pleasure and pain right nowThis applies to physical pleasure and mental pleasure to physical pain and mental painSo when the Buddha talks about the things you do that lead to happiness hes not just referring to your external actionsHes also referring to the way you think the way you interpret filter make choices about how to shape the present moment a purely internal matterMindfulness is to remind you that you can make choices and that you want to learn to make them skillfullyYou can learn how to breathe in a comfortable way to think in a comfortable way to fashion your thoughts and your perceptions so as to shape a greater sense of wellbeingYou dont have to invest any moneyJust take time and use your powers of observationThats what it all comes down toThese are very simple things very simple principles were operating onWhat the Buddha does is to take these very simple principles and follow them through to see what their implications areIts wise to realize that youre responsible for some things and not for othersThis applies whenever youre experiencing stress You have to ask yourself Is this something coming from the past or from something Im actually doing right now You focus on the issue of how youre creating suffering for yourself right now and how you can develop new habits that create the causes for happinessAs you follow through with this you begin to get more and more sensitive to where youre creating unnecessary sufferingThis is how that question on skillfulness begins to translate into the three perceptions or what are sometimes called the three characteristicsAs the question says youre looking for my longterm welfare and happiness When you give rise to happiness in the present moment you focus on whether its longterm or shorttermYou notice that if its shortterm if it changes if its inconstant you cant rely on it as your true happinessIts stressfulSo why would you want to lay claim to it as you or yoursIn these ways these three perceptions help to become your principles for judging whats working and whats notIf its inconstant its not longterm its stressfulIf its stressful its not happinessAnd if its not happiness you cant hold onto it as your longterm welfare and happinessBut the followup question is Is this a stressful cause that will eventually lead to longterm happiness or just a cause of more stress Remember to keep this point in mind as wellIf its solidly pleasant in terms of its result you put up with the stress and pain of the actionBut if it leads to longterm suffering its something you want to dropYou tell yourself This is not what Im looking for Its like going into a place where you can pan for goldYou want to have standards for what youre looking for as you pan for the gold thereYoure looking for certain colors certain characteristics that indicate genuine nuggets of goldAny gravel or flashy fools gold that doesnt meet those standards you just throw away throw away throw awayBut as for the pan in which youre swilling the gold around even though its not gold you dont throw it away yetIn other words even though the qualities you develop in terms of virtue concentration discernment are not ultimately what youre looking for they do help you find what youre looking forWhen youre looking at the results of your actions you want to have some way of separating the gold from the gravel and dross so you need the panIts not notself just yetUltimately when you apply the perception of notself to let go of everything its still a question of knowing what is your responsibility and whats notYou let go of everything youve been identifying with because youre looking for the highest happinessThe quest for happiness is your responsibility everything else at that point  even your innermost sense of who you are and whos been following the path  is notBut once youve done that final act of letting go you dont have to be responsible for anythingThe ultimate happiness looks after itself and youre finished with your duties on the pathAs the Buddha says the holy life is completed the task doneIn this way when you follow through with all the basic principles of wisdom you find that they explain everything in the Buddhas teachingsYou focus on whats your responsibility and you realize your responsibility is the fact that youre creating unnecessary sufferingBut you can also be responsible for creating longterm happinessThen you use the Buddhas teachings as tools to help you realize that if theres something you want to do but you know its going to cause harm you need some help in learning how to talk yourself out of itAs for good things that are difficult  as when its difficult to be generous difficult to be virtuous or difficult to meditate  you need ways of helping yourself get over the hump tools strategies ways of thinking that make it easier so that you can let go of the unskillful things that you like and arrive at that true happiness which ultimately lies beyond even wisdomThis kind of happiness is the fourth of what the Buddha said the four ariyadhammas the four noble Dhammas virtue concentration discernment and releaseThe first three factors in the list all aim at release and then  when theyve done their work  they get put asideEven wisdom gets put asideYou put down your goldpan for youve found all the gold you needBut until that point you want to learn how to use itThe important point is to remember that the most useful wisdom is the basic kind just following these basic principles to see how far they can take you as you get more and more sensitive to what the right questions are and finding more and more skillful ways of answering those questionsSo hold onto the pan even though it may not be pretty or fancy and simply learn how to use it with greater and greater skillThat basically is wisdom for dummies the wisdom for people who recognize that theyve been foolish and that they dont want to keep on being foolishThat means that they arent fools they simply see that theyve been fools  an important differenceTheyre the kind of fools who arent really dumbThe real dummies are those who think that theyre already smart and that the only wisdom good enough for them has to be counterintuitive hidden essences mysterious teachings that dont make senseBut the Buddha didnt teach that wayHe simply taught basic principles for people who want to wise up The first principle is to realize that your actions are important that they make a difference that they come from your ideas and intentions and that they can be changed for the betterSecond focus on what really is your responsibility and let go of things that are notThird train your mind to develop better and better answers to the question that focuses on what youre really responsible for what you can do that will lead to your longterm welfare and happinessThen take advantage of the tools the Buddha offers so that its easier to give up the things that you like doing that are harmful and to get yourself to do the things that are difficult but will lead to the longterm happiness you wantAjaan Lee has a nice image to illustrate this point A person goes to a mountain and comes back with a big hunk of rock to get the gold ore out of itAnother person who assumes hes smart sees the first person doing that and says What kind of fool would want a big hunk of rockI just want the gold So he carries a pick to the mountain to dig out the gold  but he doesnt get any gold because gold doesnt come out of the rock that wayYou have to take the rock put it into the smelter and heat itThats when the gold comes outThe silver comes outAll these other minerals come out on their own when they reach their melting pointThe heat here stands for the effort of your practiceYoure willing to put in the effort to separate whats skillful from whats notThats how you get the goldAnother analogy is climbing a treeYou cant climb the tree from the top down starting with subtle concepts and advanced treatisesYou have to start from the bottom admitting to yourself Theres a lot I dont know and I cant figure it out just by reading but I can figure it out by watching what Im doing and seeing whats working to give longterm happiness If youre willing to be the sort of person who doesnt have things all figured out ahead of time but you know that youve got some good tools and youre willing to learn how to use them well Thats how youll get to where you want to goThe Buddha treated his students like adultsIf he had wanted to he could have told them about all the amazing and wonderful things that he had learned during his awakening and that they should simply obey him without questionBut instead he taught them how to question how to think for themselves how to gain awakening themselvesEven when he was teaching children he taught them adult things or basically how to become adultsThe Novices Questions for instance start out with the big harsh fact of life that all beings subsist on foodThis fact is also the main proof against the idea of intelligent designIf there were intelligent design we could all live off the dew every morning the rain every eveningWe wouldnt have to harm anyone else in keeping our bodies goingBut this is a fact of life We have a body that need to be fed we have to eatWhen we eat theres suffering even if were very strict vegetariansThe farmers who have to clear the fields and plant the food the animals who die when the fields are cleared the people who have to transport the food once its grown A lot of work and misery goes into thatSo when the Buddha introduced the topic of causality to children he started with a harsh fact of lifeThis is your prime experience of causality Feeding goes on all the timeWithout it life couldnt lastWhen he taught his young son Rahula about truthfulness the teaching was also pretty harshIf you feel no shame in telling a lie he said your goodness is emptyIts thrown awayYou cant be trustedThen he taught Rahula to apply truthfulness in looking at his actions to learn from his actionsThat is basically what it means to become an adultWhen you do something you notice what actually happens as a result and then you learn from itIf your action harmed yourself or others you resolve not to repeat that mistakeThen you remember to apply that lesson to your next action and then the nextThats what mindfulness is for to remember these lessonsAs the Buddha says this is how you purify your thoughts words and deedsNobody else is going to come along and do the job for youYouve got to do it yourselfYou have to learn how to be observantYou have to learn how to deal maturely with your mistakesDont hide them from yourselfDont pretend they didnt happenBe adult enough to willingly tell your mistakes to other peopleThat is what it means to be an adult You take responsibilityWhen he taught Rahula meditation he started off with the images of making the mind like earth making the mind like water like fire like windIn other words earth doesnt react to what it dislikesIf you throw something disgusting on the earth the earth doesnt shrink awayThe same with fire It can burn disgusting things and doesnt recoil in disgustThe same with water the same with wind They wash things away they blow things away and it doesnt matter whether those things are disgusting or notThey dont reactThat was the Buddhas preliminary instruction to Rahula on the kind of mind you have to bring to meditationYou dont go by your likes or dislikesYou dont shrink away from painYet this doesnt mean you become indifferent because the next step is to work with the breath which requires that you train the mind in a certain directionYou train yourself to breathe constantly aware of the whole body to breathe calming the breath  which means that you are sensitive to pleasure or pain and youre working to ever more subtle levels of pleasureBut in order to learn how to do this skillfully you have to put your immediate reactions aside and look to see what actually worksAll of these are instructions on how to become an adult how to deal with complexities because cause and effect is a very complex issueLook at dependent coarisingIt requires an adult mind to handle that kind of complexityAnd yet the Buddha gives basic instructions to children on how to handle it  how to approach it how to be an adult in your meditation how to take responsibility for yourself  looking at things in terms of what you do and the pleasure and the pain that resultOnce youve got those basic principles down then its simply a matter of learning to be more and more observant as to what works in getting the mind to settle down what works in giving rise to insightHe gives you helpLook at the Canon fortyfive volumesAnd a very large portion of it appears to have come from the Buddha himselfThats a lot of advice but it all keeps pointing you back to yourselfAs the Buddha keeps saying Buddhas only point the wayIts up to you to follow the pathThis means you have to be responsibleYou have to be clear about your intentions mature about admitting when you have some unskillful intentions in the mind and honest about the results that come when you act on unskillful intentionsOnly by observing that again and again can you finally get tired of those intentionsWhen you really see that theres a connection between unskillful intentions and needless suffering you become genuinely motivated to find the escape from that sufferingThis is the only way you can do itBasically you have to learn to judge whats worth observing and whats notAnd again the Buddha points you to whats worth observingThe issue of needless stress that comes from unskillful states of mind Thats where he points you  Look here look here look here Then its up to you to see and  when youve seen  to take that knowledge and put it to useThis requires that you be responsibleSo its a pretty radical a very demanding teachingThe question is Do you want to be an adult or not There are lots of people out there whod rather not be adults whod rather be infantilizedAnd there are lots of other people who enjoy telling them what to do what to thinkEven in Buddhist circles you find various kinds of meditation where as they say Everything has all been thought out everything has all been worked out just follow the instructionsDont think dont add anything of your own Its interesting to note that a lot of these methods also refer to the teaching on notself as egolessnessAny sense of pride any sense of independence is a bad thing in those meditation traditionsAs one tradition would say just be totally passive and aware very equanimous and just let your old sankharas burn awayAnd above all dont thinkOr if you are going to think they say learn how to think the way we thinkAnd they have huge volumes of philosophy you have to learn to squeeze your mind into their mold after which they promise you awakeningBut that doesnt workAwakening comes from being very observant in seeing things you dont expect to see developing your own sensitivities your own discernmentAfter all as the Buddha said the issue is the suffering youre creatingIf you dont have the basic honesty and maturity to see that youre never going to gain awakening no matter how much you know no matter how much you study no matter how equanimous you areYouve got to take responsibilityAnd youve got to be willing to learn from your mistakesWhen the Buddha taught Rahula he didnt say Dont ever make mistakes He said Try not to make mistakes but if you do make a mistake  and its expected that you will  this is how you handle it this is how you learn from it Thats teaching Rahula how to be an adultSo its up to each of us Do we want to be adultsOr do we want to continue to be treated like children told what to do told what to think not being willing to take any risksIt may sound safe and reassuring but if you dont take risks you never get awakenedAnd the safety of being a child is all very delusionalIts the delusional safety of wanting to be told that everything you need to do has already been thought outOr that there are lots of different ways to the goal so it doesnt matter which one you choose you can choose whichever one you like and you can be guaranteed that all the paths will lead to the same placeAgain that kind of thinking puts your likes and wishes ahead of everything elseThats precisely what an adult cant doAs an adult you have to realize that there are risks in this meditation pathThere are some paths that do lead to the goal they do lead to the end of sufferingOther paths lead to all kinds of other placesYou have to be responsible for which path you choose which one looks to be the most honestThis of course throws you back on your own honesty as wellSometimes you read about teachers who turn out to be major disappointmentsThey do really horrible things to their students and the students complain that theyve been victimizedBut in nearly every case when you read the whole story you realize that the students should have seen this comingThere were blatant warning signals that they chose to ignoreYou have to be responsible in choosing your teachers choosing your pathOnce youve chosen the path that looks likely you have to be responsible in following it in learning how to develop your own sensitivity in following itBecause after all what is the path that the Buddha points outTheres virtue theres concentration and theres discernmentThese are all qualities in your own mindWe all have them to some extentLearning how to develop whats in your own mind is whats going to make all the differenceThe Buddhas discernment isnt going to give you awakening his virtue and concentration arent going to give you awakeningYou have to develop your ownNobody else can develop these things for youOther people can give you hints they can help point you in the right directionBut the actual work and the actual seeing is something you have to do for yourselfSo the question is Are you mature enough to want this pathAre you mature enough to follow it throughNobodys forcing youJust realize the dangers of not following this path and make your choiceYears back when Ajaan Suwat was teaching a meditation retreat at IMS someone asked him a question in a QA session toward the end of the retreat How do we bring meditation into daily life His answer was to focus on the five and the eight precepts  but a lot of people misunderstood his answerThey interpreted it as his being dismissive of laypeople that laypeople really couldnt or shouldnt focus on meditation in daily life that they should just stick to the lowly practice of the precepts insteadBut that wasnt his pointHis point was that following the precepts is an important part of meditationThe act of taking on the five precepts teaches you very important lessons about skills integral to meditationTo begin with it focuses your attention on your intentions because you can break a precept only intentionallyThis forces you to ask yourself What are your intentionsWhy do you actWhats the motive behind your actions and your choices When youre forced to focus on these questions you realize that one of the few intentions really worth sticking with all the time is the intention to be harmlessThis is why you decide that you dont want to kill to steal to have illicit sex to lie or to take intoxicants because all of these actions are harmful by natureSo you set up that intention and try to stick by itThis requires mindfulness and alertness which are important factors in training the mindYou have to keep your precepts in mind and be alert in watching over your actions to make sure they dont go against your original intentAt the same time you have to develop strategies for fending off any intentions that would go against your intent to be harmlessThis requires ingenuity and discernmentRight here you can begin to see the connections with meditationOnce youve set up an intention to stay with the breath you have to be mindful and alert to make sure you actually do stay with the breath and dont go wandering offYou also have to use your discernment and ingenuity to fend off any contrary intentions that would lure you away from your original intentThe precepts also teach you to be scrupulousIts easy to think of being harmless to all beings in a general way but when you really try to act on that intention you discover all sorts of ramifications you didnt expectYou have to pay attention to animals you may have otherwise overlooked ants and termites for instanceYouve got to take their survival into accountThis forces you to be very scrupulous in your behavior very careful in what you will and will not doThis habit too is very helpful in the course of meditation helping you to pay attention to little details little movements in the mind that are easy to overlook but can have important consequencesIn this way you can see how the precepts are a form of meditation in daily lifeThey take your actions as your objects of meditation and they force you to develop many of the mental skills and attitudes you need in formal meditation mindfulness alertness ingenuity strategic discernment and a scrupulous attention to detailThe precepts also teach you the power of your intentionsAs you stick with a skillful intention youll find it really does change your lifeIt creates a better atmosphere for your meditatingIf you stick with the intention not to be harmful then when the time comes to sit down and meditate or to try to be mindful in other ways throughout the day its a lot easierYoure not burdened with remorse over any harmful things you might have done or saidYou dont have to go into denial about might have done or saidThis creates a much better atmosphere a much better environment for the mind to keep things in mind and to settle down and be at ease with itselfBut the precepts also help induce a sense of samvega dismay over the prospect of continued samsaraYoull begin to notice as you try to maintain the intention not to be harmful how really difficult it is to be totally harmless because life maintains itself by feedingThis is one of the best arguments against intelligent design or at least compassionate intelligent design Why do we have to feed off one another all the timeWouldnt it be better if we could feed off inanimate objects or energiesIf we could eat rocks or soil if we could live off light waves or sound vibrations nothing would be harmedLike the harmoniums in The Sirens of Titan We could just feed on vibrations and take pleasure in one anothers happinessBut thats not how the world worksWorldly happiness is limited by the fact that one persons happiness often requires feeding on someone elses suffering and painSo there are limitations to the range of the preceptsWhen you decide to adopt the precept against killing for example you decide basically that you yourself are not going to kill and youre not going to give the explicit order to anybody else  or even an indirect hint to anyone else  that they should killBut even then its still difficult to go around without somebodys getting killedWhen you walk along a sidewalk you dont know how many living things you step onOr eating Even if you decide to be a strict vegetarian a lot of insects get killed in the process of farming vegetablesGophers and other animals get killed when farmers clear the fieldsSo as you reflect on your precepts and on your desire to be harmless it creates a good strong sense of samvega  which is an important element of discernment to remind you that it would really be good to get out of this whole process of samsaraing to find a happiness that doesnt need to feedMaybe there is something to this nibbana business after allIt really would be something good something worth trying to attainSo the precepts not only help develop the skills you need for concentration but also provide a context and motivation for gaining discernment and insightAs for the eight precepts those move into another area of training for the mindAgain Ajaan Suwat The eight precepts add the element of restraint of the senses Each of the added precepts places restraints on the types of pleasures we might try to get through the sense doorsThe precept against illicit sex turns into a precept against sex periodThat covers all of the sense doors right thereThen theres the precept against eating after noon or before dawnThat covers pleasures of tasteThe precept against watching shows listening to music using perfumes and scents covers pleasures of sight hearing and smellAnd then the precept against high and luxurious beds and seats covers the sense of touchAs you go down the list you can see that each of the five senses is coveredThis adds a higher level of restraint and places some barriers on our typical ways of indulging our desire for pleasure evening munchies the desire for a nice thick mattress to lie on wanting to smell nice liking to listen to musicBy taking on these precepts you learn to put some barriers around your selfindulgenceThese barriers serve several purposesOne they focus you on the meditation If youre going to find any pleasure in the course of the day you have to look more intently at developing pleasure in the meditation to make up for the restrictions youve placed on your foraging for pleasure outsideIn addition you learn important lessons about indulgenceIf you tend to be indulgent in your daily life youre going to be very selfindulgent when you meditateIf you cant say No to your daily desires its going to be hard to say No to them while youre sitting here meditatingThe mindstates that want to go off and think about pleasant sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations are very easy to indulge in if you dont have the habit of saying No to your impulse to look for pleasure in those things throughout the dayAs you develop this habit of saying No to sensual indulgence in the course of the day its a lot easier to say No to sensual thoughts in the course of the meditationYouve also developed the habit of learning when to say enough which will hold you in good stead as you begin to develop the sense of nonsensual pleasure and rapture that come with concentrationYoull be more likely to realize when youve indulged enough in those kinds of pleasure so that you can turn to the further work you need to do in terms of insight and discernmentYou cant just stay wallowing in the pleasure of concentrationYouve got to learn how to understand whats going on in the mind why it creates mental worlds to begin with  the worlds that pull you away from the present moment and lead to suffering and stressSo the precepts are a crucial part of meditationThey help you develop good habits and foster insightIn particular they help you see into your habits of selfindulgenceA lot of the pleasures we indulge in really do get in the way of deeper pleasure deeper happinessWe all want to have our cake and eat it tooWhen we play chess we want to keep all our pieces and yet win at the same timeBut an important lesson in life is that certain pleasures really do get in the way of higher happinessYouve got to learn how to say No to themAnd to develop a sense of moderation how much pleasure is enough for you to do the real work at handUltimately you see that even the most harmless pleasures in this world are not absolutely harmlessThis realization leads to the sense of samvega that motivates you to look for an even higher pleasure the absolutely blameless bliss of nibbanaSo learn to look at the precepts as an important part of the meditationTheyre not Sunday school rules or conventional truths that someone who hits the more ultimate truths can eventually put aside and discard with impunityTheyre an important part of training the mind in the skills and attitudes itll need in concentration in developing discernment and ultimately leading to releaseSo when Ajaan Suwat was asked about how to bring the meditation into daily life his answer didnt dismiss lay life at allIt pointed to an important factThis is how you meditate in daily life by being very careful about your precepts respecting them and being alive to the lessons they teachMeditation isnt a lap beltYou cant just squeeze your mind into a single technique and expect the technique to do all of your work for youYouve got to develop the proper attitudes toward meditation proper attitudes toward your mindIn addition youve got to develop a range of techniques and learn how to determine which technique to use at which particular time for which particular problem so that you can use the techniques wisely for their intended purposeTheyre not meant to be straitjackets for the mindTheyre more means for explorationAs the Buddha once said he points out the road but its up to you to follow the road to see what you learn along the way and to discover where it takes youIn many cases the good techniques actually present you with questions more than they provide you with answersYouve got to develop the right frame of mind for taking up the questions and figuring out how to get the right answers answers that help put an end to sufferingTo get an idea of what these attitudes are that you need to bring to the meditation its good to look at what the Buddha taught his son Rahula prior to teaching him how to focus on the breathThere are two main sets of instructionsIn the first set the Buddha started his meditation instructions not by telling Rahula to sit and close his eyes but by telling him to develop the right attitude toward all of his actions his thoughts words and deedsIn other words Rahula was going to get practice in how to be a meditator by looking at his actions in all situationsFirst the Buddha established the principle of truthfulnessIf youre the sort of person who feels no shame at telling a lie he said then you have no value as a meditatorYouve thrown your value awayIf you find it easy to lie to other people its going to be easy to lie to yourselfSo truthfulness was the first principle the first attitude the Buddha recommendedThen he said you apply that truthfulness to your thoughts words and deeds before you act and keep reminding yourself to act only on harmless intentionsThis develops the qualities of good will and compassionWhen an intention comes up and youre thinking about following it through ask yourself Is this going to be harmful If you can perceive some potential harm dont do itIf you dont foresee any harm you can go ahead and do itWhile youre acting look for the immediate results coming from your action because actions can bear their results not only in the long distant future but also right here right now where you can immediately see themIf you stick your finger in fire it hurts right nowIts not going to wait to hurt you in some future lifetimeIf you swallow hot soup itll scald you now not after you die and are rebornSo if you see any harm coming from your action stop doing itBut if you dont see any harm either to yourself or to others you can continue with itWhen the action is done look at its results over the long termIf you realize that it did cause harm over time develop an attitude of shame about the actionNow notice that the Buddha is not saying to be ashamed about yourself he wants you to feel shame toward the actionIn other words view the action as something beneath youThats a healthy use of shame its the companion to a healthy sense of prideMake up your mind that youre not going to repeat the action and then go talk it over with someone you respectThis develops an attitude of integrity that you accept responsibility for what youve done and are open about what youve doneThis way you can learnSo the Buddha doesnt start out by telling Rahula not to make mistakesHe says to try to avoid making mistakes but if you do make a mistake this is how you handle it with honesty with an attitude of harmlessness or compassion with a healthy sense of shame and with integrityIf on the other hand you look at your actions and see that they havent caused any harm you can take joy in the fact and keep on practicingThats how you start meditating in your daily lifeThose are the attitudes you want to bring to the meditation a willingness to look at your intentions and to look at their resultsThis is going to be really important in the course of your meditation because theres no other way youll be able to read your own mindThen at a later time the Buddha taught Rahula breath meditationBut before he taught him breath meditation he taught him ten other exercises to prepare him for the breathThe first four exercises deal with the physical elements looking at the body in terms of its elements its propertiesEarth is solidity water liquidity fire heat and wind motionHe said to Rahula Try to make your mind like each of these elements each of these properties For example with earth If you throw disgusting things on earth earth doesnt reactNow the Buddha is not telling Rahula to be passive or obliviousHes saying to be grounded to learn powers of endurance because as youll see the meditations he taught Rahula further on are active kinds of meditation that require a lot of sensitivityYou dont simply sit with whatevers there without making any changesYou are supposed to adjust and change thingsBut if you want to make the proper changes you first have to understand where you actually are and what the problem actually isThen make your changes and watch to see if they actually workNow to be able to watch to see things clearly you have to have powers of endurance the ability to sit with things and watch them steadily over timeUnpleasant things are bound to come up in the meditation for sureTo comprehend them after all is the duty with regard to suffering and stress Youve got to comprehend itAnd to comprehend it there are times when youll have to really sit with it to watch it over time again and again and againThis requires enduranceThen when you try changing something in the meditation  when you experiment with your breath and your mind in various ways  youve got to sit with things for long periods of time to see if what you did really worksYou dont want to be the sort of person who makes a little change sees a little something that looks promising and immediately jumps to the conclusion that this is the solutionThe result may be short lastingYou may ultimately find yourself back where you beganSo you want to see if thats the case which means youve got to be able to sit with thingsThe same principle applies with the other propertiesFire can burn unpleasant things but it doesnt shrink away from themWater can be used to wash away unpleasant things but doesnt get disgustedWind blows unpleasant things around and doesnt show distasteSo you learn to be groundedRemind yourself that whatever comes up you can bear itI remember once when I was staying with Ajaan Fuang he told me out of the blue one day to sit up and meditate all nightMy immediate reaction was that it wasnt a good day for me to try thatI had been working hard that day I said I couldnt do itHe looked at me and said Well is it going to kill you Well no Then you can do it Thats the attitude youve got to have  as with that saying what doesnt kill you will make you strongerBut in the midst of doing difficult things you dont just suffer through themYouve got to figure out How can I get through this without suffering Thats where you start learning how to be ingeniousBut the important thing is that you remind yourself okay you can stand this whatevers coming up youre not going to get blown aroundThat way you can begin to trust yourself as an observerThen to show that the Buddha wasnt teaching Rahula to be passive the next four meditations are about replacing unskillful attitudes with more skillful ones essentially the attitudes of the brahmaviharas goodwill compassion empathetic joy and equanimity  although here the Buddha isnt asking him to develop these thoughts to the limitless extent of brahmaviharasHes simply telling him to replace various levels of aversion in the mind  irritation resentment ill will or the desire to harm  with more positive emotionsIf you notice ill will coming up in the mind try counteracting it with goodwillDont just allow the mind to stay stuck with its ill willYou do what you can to foster an attitude of goodwill to whomever the person may beIf the idea comes up that youd like to be cruel or harmful to somebody counteract it with an attitude of compassion reminding yourself that youre not going to benefit from that persons suffering in any way at allIn fact when other people are suffering thats when they tend to do crazy illconsidered unskillful thingsYouve got to have some compassion for people who are engaged in unskillful activities hoping that theyll learn the good sense to stopEmpathetic joy is the antidote for any feelings of resentment you may feel for somebody elses good fortuneYou realize that resentment doesnt do you any good at allPeople who are enjoying good fortune mustve done something sometime that leads to happiness so why resent itDo you want people to resent good fortune when it comes your wayOf course notAs for feelings of equanimity these are meant to counteract feelings of irritationYou want to be equanimous toward irritating things so that irritation doesnt build up to the point where it makes you do something stupidIn each of these cases you want to be skilled at giving rise to skillful attitudes when you need them so that you dont just sit there stewing in aversionThen the Buddha taught two meditations for counteracting other sorts of unskillful qualitiesFor lust he said to try to develop the perception of the foulness of the human bodyNow this is not about having an unhealthy negative image of the body its actually training in having a healthy negative image of the bodyYou realize that everybody is in the same boat this wayWere all filled with blood pus contents of the stomach contents of the intestines all kinds of stuff you wouldnt like to have on the floor here in the morning when were getting the meal readyThis is a useful antidoteWhen feelings of lust come up and you think about what lies under the skin its hard to maintain sexual desireSo again the Buddha is not teaching Rahula to be passive or simply to accept whatevers coming upHes telling him how to counteract unskillful attitudes and replace them with skillful onesIn the final preparation before teaching Rahula breath meditation the Buddha taught him something thats usually considered to be a very advanced teachingHe said Try to develop the perception of inconstancy to counteract the conceit I am Now notice The Buddha is putting this right at the beginningOne of the reasons for this is that when skillful and unskillful things come up in the mind if you immediately brand yourself as Im the sort of person whos always skillful or Im the sort of person whos always unskillful thats going to get in the way of actually seeing which actions in the mind are having a helpful impact and which ones are notIf when something that looks unskillful comes up and you immediately react to it My gosh Im a really bad meditator Im miserable look at this this horrible thought I shouldnt be thinking this You either feel selfhatred or you start going into denial pretending that it didnt actually happenNeither reaction helps develop any insight at allIf you engage in denial you cant see what youre doing cant see whether the intention was actually skillful or not and cant see the results of the actionAnd you certainly cant counteract denial if you dont admit that its thereOr if you build the other kind of I am around the unskillful thought that Im miserable that really shoots you down saps your ability to counteract the thoughtThis is the problem with I am It starts getting to issues of innate natureIf you have a bad innate nature you cant change itIf you have a good innate good nature then when something that looks skillful arises in the mind you immediately read it as a sign of your innate goodnessYou start getting complacent and careless and you dont really see whether theres anything unskillful lurking under the surfaceWhere does this particular intention really leadWhat needs to be done with itIs it really as good as it seems at first glanceIf you decide that its part of your innate Buddha nature you get complacentSo again you miss out on things dont really see things as theyre happening because the I am gets in the wayIts interesting The Pali word for conceit  mana  doesnt mean only a sense that youre better than other peopleIf you say Im worse than other people or Im equal to other people thats conceit as well because youre still building the I am around thingsThere are several ways to get around thisThe first is the Buddhas advice to Rahula Whatever comes up is inconstantIt doesnt last so its not enough to build an identity aroundAnother way around the I am is that whatever comes up in the mind you remind yourself that this happens to everybodyRemind yourself that you dont have any innate natureThe mind is neutralIt just knowsThe thinking is skillful or unskillful but those are habits which arent innate at allOr you can do what the Buddha didThis is something people tend to forget when they meditateOn the night of his awakening his first knowledge was about himself his narrativesYou think you have narratives He had narratives going way back eons and eonsBut he didnt jump straight from there to the present momentHe took a detour and thought about all the beings in the world How about themHe saw that they all went through the same process  all different kinds of birth and rebirth  and on seeing them in a more universal way he was able to see underlying patterns what kind of actions were skillful what kind of views underlay skillful actions that lead to fortunate rebirths and how unskillful actions lead to unfortunate onesIt was by looking at the large picture that he was able to see patternsOnly then did he look at the present moment from the perspective of those larger patternsThat helps cut through the I am and the individual narrativesYoure looking at events common to beings all over the world and youre looking at them in light of those larger patterns  not of natures but of actionsWhen youre looking at greed anger and delusion in the mind in this way it helps to loosen some of the sense of identity around themAnother way to loosen that sense of identity is to think of the mind as a committeeThe committee contains all kinds of members who propose all kinds of thingsJust because somebody in the committee has proposed a bad idea doesnt mean the committee is badThe duty of the committee is to listen to the ideas brought to the floor figure out which is the best one to act on right nowIf they make a mistake they go back and undo the old decision open the floor to suggestions and arrive at a new decisionThey dont worry about the innate nature of the committeeWhen you can see events in the mind in this way then youre really ready to meditate because it allows you to deal with them just as events as instances of intention and the results of intentionsWhen you put aside the I am youre in a much better position to see things for what they actually do and then you can deal with them in the most appropriate wayIt was only after the Buddha taught Rahula all of these things that he said Okay sit downThis is how you do breath meditationSo when you sit down to do breath meditation its good to reflect on these attitudesTheyre your tools your means for reading the events that are arising and passing away and also for reading the results of applying different techniquesThey help you figure out which technique is useful for which kind of issue whats getting results whats not getting resultsThats how you develop your discernmentYou see cause and effect skillful and unskillful ie the four noble truthsYou develop the path so you can comprehend suffering and eventually let go of its causeThats how you realize the end of suffering by experimenting by exploring by bringing the right attitudes and the right mental qualities to whichever meditation technique you chooseThose qualities are the factors that make all the differenceSo do your best to bring the full set of mature qualities to meditationThats how you get resultsWhen you start to meditate its important that you make a firm determination establishing the firm intention that youre going to stay with the breath for the entire hourAnd its good to remind yourself of the reasons for why you want to do this because that helps to firm up the intentionWere here because we want a happiness thats blameless a happiness thats dependable a happiness thatll lastAnd this is the road that leads there training the mindThe Buddha once said that the difference between a wise person and a foolish one is that the foolish person sees no need to train the mindHappiness can be bought happiness can be taken Thats the foolish persons attitudeBut the wise person sees that the pursuit of that kind of happiness actually leads to a lot of unhappinessWhatever little happiness it does produce isnt dependableIt requires that conditions be a certain way conditions that lie totally outside your controlThe fact that those conditions are unstable means that the happiness coming from them is going to be unstable as wellSo reflect on thatSometimes you hear theories about how causality works in lifeAnd in many philosophies and religions causality typically starts with an unmoved mover something permanent something good that gives rise to everything we experienceThe question of course is Why does a permanent cause lead to changeable resultsWhy does a good cause lead to undesirable results Those ideas of causality offer no help at allIf something is undesirable where do you go back and change the cause to make it more desirableIf the cause is unchanging youre stymiedBut as the Buddha saw causes change too  and effects can have an effect on causesThis is one of the reasons why things are so unstable and unreliable but its also part of the way outThe causes of suffering can be changed which means that you actually can put an end to sufferingThe Buddhas approach was not to simply accept suffering as a given in life that it has to be that way and we simply learn how to accept it and thats the end of the problemHe saw that suffering can actually be brought to an endAnd the causes of suffering are largely internal which means that the way to put an end to suffering is largely an internal job as wellAs someone once said true happiness is an inside jobThats why we train the mind to search for the causes within it that lead to suffering and see what we can do to change themKeep this point in mind as you practice because a common experience in meditation is that you sit here focused on the breath and then after a while suddenly realize that you havent been with the breath at allYouve been someplace elseThere was a lapse of mindfulness a lapse of alertnessYoure usually surprised that its happened but you shouldnt beExpect that the mind will come up with alternative intentions in the course of the hour and be on the lookout for themSo while youre focused on the breath you also have to be heedful of the fact that you could lose the breath at any momentThis means that you want to do your best to strengthen your focus strengthen your mindfulness strengthen your alertnessAnd one way to do that is as soon as you catch yourself wandering off immediately come back to the breath but without engaging in selfrecriminationDont berate yourself for losing the breathIf you do youll tie yourself up in another long discourse thatll take you away from the breath againJust drop the distraction in its unfinished state and come back to the breath as quickly as possibleReestablish yourselfAnd try to get interested in the breathAs the Buddha said using your powers of analysis is actually one way of leading the mind into concentrationFor people who cant calm the mind simply by sticking with the breath its good to look into the breath as a process to exploreHow does the breathing affect the bodyHow does the effect of the breath on the body have an effect on the mindHow can you maximize the positive effectsWhat kind of breathing would feel really goodAnd when it feels good what can you do with that good feelingThe Buddha suggests spreading it around allowing it to permeate the body throughoutSo theres plenty to do hereIts not just in out in out in outWhen the breath comes in explore how its coming in how it effects different parts of the bodyWhen it goes out explore and experiment to see whats the most comfortable way of allowing it to go outAll too often our cartoon notion of the breath coming in and going out requires that we squeeze it out when it goes outBut you dont want to do thatThe squeezing is actually depleting the breath energy in the bodyTry telling yourself that youll help the breath come in but when it goes out it can go out on its ownYou dont have to push itYou dont have to squeeze itThat way you can begin to maintain a sense of fullness that carries from the inbreath even through the outbreathWhen you breathe with that sense of continual fullness the breath feels a lot betterIt becomes a lot more interestingYou begin to realize that this breath work we do in the body is a useful way of getting the mind interested in the breath so that you dont have to force it to stay hereYoure here through the power of your curiosityAt the same time you have to keep an eye on the mind to notice when it begins to show signs that its about to wander offMaybe its a little impatient maybe the results arent coming as fast as youd likeNothing seems to be changingThe mind starts looking for someplace else to go something else to think aboutIf youre really alert you can catch it before a distracting thought is fully formedThe more quickly you can see that process the betterYou can feel that stirring of a form or a thought beginning to occur like a little tingling or a little stirring around a little knot in the breath energyAt that point its hard to say whether its physical or mentalIt could be eitherThere will come a point though when the mind decides that the stirring is a potential for a thoughtIt looks into it and turns it into a thought worldThe more quickly you can see that happening the more youre able to zap it at the very beginning of the stirringThis too is something youll learn in the course of exploring the breathSo even though we say to keep one eye on the breath and the other eye on the potential for the mind to leave when you really look carefully at the breath youll find that the potential for it to leave is right there as well in the little knots or stirrings that can develop in the breath energySo you dont have to split your focusIn this way you can help maintain your original intention to stay continually with the breath because its interesting because there are lots of things here to learnA similar principle applies when you leave meditation because you really dont want to leave totallyYou spent all this time getting the mind to settle down and it would be a shame just to throw it awaySo there is a skill to leaving meditation as well a skill to opening your eyesWhen you open your eyes remind yourself that the breathbody is still here the sense of energy in the body is still hereAll too often when we open our eyes all our attention goes flowing out into the visual world and our sense of the body gets shrunken down pushed aside blotted outYou want to learn how not to do thatIn other words you can be aware of the visual world at the same time that youre aware of the breathenergy worldYou might ask yourself Which contains whichDoes your sense of the body contain your awareness of the visual world or does the visual world contain your sense of the body See which way of conceiving this relationship helps you to maintain that sense of breath awareness even as you open your eyes get up and move around negotiate the outside world so that your breath awareness becomes more continuousThis allows you to learn things about the mind to develop new skills in the course of daily lifeYou learn how to maintain a sense of ease even in difficult situations a sense of fullness at times when your mind would otherwise be daydreaming or drifting aroundInstead of wasting your time drifting you can stay right here and continue to explore the sense of the body the breathenergy body insideYou can also begin to sense which things knock you off balance distract you pull you out of the bodyWhen you see that happening youve found an issue to exploreThis is how concentration leads to insightIt provides you with a still center from which you can watch the movements of the mind and see where they goThis way you can detect This is what a defilement is like it blocks the mind obscures the mindYou check into it Is it greed anger delusion lust fear jealousyWhat are the things that spark these emotionsYou see the defilements in realtimeIf youre able to do this then the next time you sit down its going to be a lot easier to stay with the breath more continuouslyBut if you develop the habit of throwing away your concentration as soon as you get up its going to be easier to throw it away in the midst of your meditationYouve got to keep in mind the fact that the mind has to be trained if you want to gain true happiness and you dont want to train the mind only when you sit here with your eyes closedYou want the training to be  because the minds potential to create problems is  as wellSo its a matter of establishing your prioritiesWhat kind of happiness do you wantWhat are you willing to give up to attain that happinessHow much time and energy are you planning to invest willing to invest to find true happinessThis is another aspect of wisdom keeping your priorities clearIf true happiness is the top priority that helps to pull the mind out of its ignorance  in other words its overriding concern for other issues  and to bring the issue of suffering and the causes of suffering up to the foreThats what clear knowing is all about making it your clear priority that the issue of suffering is paramountThis is the most important issue to deal withWhen the Buddha talks about ignorance hes not talking about a general lack of knowledge about thingsYou can know many things and still be ignorant of the big issueAnd part of that ignorance comes from the fact that you dont really regard the big issue as the big issueYouve got other priorities other agendasBut the Buddha wants you to see that the question of suffering is the big issue in lifeYour ability to train yourself to put an end to it should be your top priorityWhen I was up in Bellingham this last weekend I was out walking after the mealA guy looked at me and asked Buddhist I said Yeah He said Why are there so many religions in the world I answered Because the different religions ask different questions So whats the Buddhas question His question is Why are we suffering and what can we do to put an end to it Dont you just hate that question he saidI said No I think its a pretty good question The fact that theres suffering is something you might not like and its natural not to like it but it would be strange to hate the question of why it happens and how you can put an end to itWe should regard this as the most important question to try to answer because its the most useful most fruitful question we can exploreIts a privilege to be able to ask this question and answer itThats why one of the duties with regard to the four noble truths is to develop the path the way out of sufferingThis is what were doing here right nowSo wisdom is largely a matter of prioritiesAs youre sitting in meditation as you go through life your top priority should be to stay here with the breath so as to develop the powers of mindfulness concentration and discernment that will allow you to realize the end of sufferingA lot of the practice is learning how to stick to those priorities and not let other priorities sneak inWe sit here with a lot of potentials potential sensations in the body potential qualities in the mindThe practice of meditation is learning how to put aside the unskillful potentials how to develop the skillful ones and how to take advantage of the skillful ones  learning how to feed them to give them strength so that they basically take charge and help put an end to suffering and stressYou could if you wanted to sit here and spend the whole hour thinking about all kinds of random frivolous thingsOr you could sit here creating a lot of painPsychologists studying the nervous system have discovered that there are times when you have a sensation of pain but theres really nothing no pain signal coming in at the end of the nerveThe monitoring stations along the nerve interpret a particular signal as a pain signal and so thats what they send on up the lineThat means that you could sit here focusing on whatever potentials for pain there are and you could turn almost anything into a pain  but you dontYou focus on the potentials for pleasureNotice when the breath comes in where its feeling good which part of the breath cycle feels nicestIs it the middle of the breath the beginning of the breath the end of the breathCan you notice when the breath is getting too longCan you catch yourself squeezing the breath as it goes outWhen you squeeze it youre weakening the potential for pleasure that the breath can giveSomeplace in the middle of the inbreath theres a point of balanceYou might want to focus your attention there and maximize that particular sensation which means that the breath will get shorter and shorter more and more subtle as it hovers around that point of balanceIf thats too subtle to notice simply be aware of when the breath is too long when its too short too shallow too deep which parts of the body would feel better if they were given a greater role in the breathing processTry to figure out which ways of breathing will help to develop the potentials of comfort ease refreshment fullness in the bodyAs you do this youre developing good potentials in the mind as wellThe two major ones are mindfulness and alertnessI recently read someone saying that mindfulness is an unfabricated phenomenon  that only your thought processes that pull you away from the present moment count as fabricated that when youre in the pure present theres no fabrication going on at allBut thats a major misunderstandingMindfulness is something you doIts a fabricated activityAlertness is something you doIts a fabricated activity as wellAnd there are potentials in the mind that can either foster the mindfulness or starve itIn other words mindfulness is something you have to feedIts not your simple awarenessIts the ability to keep something in mindThe reason we dont understand things the reason we dont see the connection between cause and effect is because we forgetIts because we forget that we cant stick with our resolvesSay you decide youre going to stay here for a whole hour with the breath  and five minutes later you find yourself planning tomorrows meal or thinking about events far away in IcelandWhat happenedYou forgotAnd why did you forgetWell there was a blanking out for a moment or two because you werent paying proper attention to the causes for mindfulnessThe Buddha identifies two qualities that feed mindfulness and help it growThe first is wellpurified virtueVirtue here means the intention not to harm not to do harm to yourself not to do harm to other living beingsIf you have harmful intentions in mind part of the mind goes along with them and part of the mind doesntTheres a conflictAnd one of the minds tricks for going along with the harmful intention is to allow itself to forget that the intention is actually harmfulIf this becomes a habit its hard to develop mindfulness because youre running up against these walls of forgetfulness that the mind very insistently wants to keep upYour mindfulness runs up against them and gets deflectedThis is why people in Thailand before they meditate sometimes make a vow Im going to observe the five preceptsIm going to stick with themAnd Im sincere in that resolution This is even easier when you already have been following the five preceptsYou reflect on your actions and there is nothing you regretYou dont have to go into denialThat way its easier for mindfulness to be continuousBut the simple act of resolving to be harmless in all your activities  harmless in what you do harmless in what you say harmless in what you think  can begin to create the right conditions for mindfulness immediatelyMake that a principle you want to hold toThe other quality that helps feed mindfulness is views made straight  straight in the sense that theyre in line with the truth understanding that your actions will have consequences that skillful intentions will tend to lead to pleasant results unskillful intentions to unpleasant resultsThis is a principle that wasnt just made up by somebodyIts been observed by people whove developed their minds to the point where they really can see whats going onAnd on the basis of that you realize for example that generosity is a good thing gratitude is a good thing because people do have the choice to act skillfully or unskillfullyYou have to be grateful for the times when theyve chosen to be skillful and grateful to yourself for the times youve chosen to be skillful because thinking in this way helps to break down the barriers in the mind that say I dont want to think about the Dhamma right nowI want to think about sex or I want to think about drugs or I want to think about whoknowswhat If theres part of the mind that says Hey you cant do that without consequences youve got your first line of defense against those wandering unskillful thoughtsThen there will be part of the mind that says I dont want to think about that because it means Ive been acting unskillfully in the past and it just hurts too much to think about that Thats where the Buddha recommends developing the right attitude toward your past mistakesIts not inevitable that youre going to have to suffer a lot from your past mistakesAs the Buddha said if you can develop an attitude of limitless goodwill compassion empathetic joy and equanimity thatll mitigate the results of your past bad actionsIf you can train yourself so that the mind isnt overcome by pleasure isnt overcome by pain  in other words you dont let these feelings get in the way of your seeing whats actually going on  then again the mind is immune or at least the results of your past mistakes will be mitigatedSo the proper attitude to have toward your past bad actions is one realize that remorse is not going to undo themSimply make the resolve that youre not going to repeat those actions againAnd then two try to develop attitudes of limitless goodwill compassion empathetic joy and equanimityWhen the meditation gets dry bring out these attitudes and work on spreading them around realizing that other peoples unhappiness isnt going to help you in any way nor is your unhappiness going to help you in any waySo why would you wish for anybodys unhappinessEven with people who have been cruel and unprincipled you realize that if they suffer more theyll probably get even more cruel more unprincipledSo try to picture them learning to see to the error of their ways and changing their waysIn other words you wish for them to start creating the causes for happinessYou dont feel that you have to settle old scores first before you let them be happy or wiseWhen you learn how to think in these ways it helps to cut through a lot of the barriers you create in the mind a lot of the unskillful attitudes that can get in the way of continual mindfulnessSo when youve lowered the walls you can see back into the past and ahead into the futureYou can start seeing the connections between actions and their resultsWhen you focus the mind in a certain way what are the results over timeIf youre mindful of your actions you can really see this for yourselfIf you change the way you focus if you change the way you breathe what effect does that have over timeSometimes the effects are immediate sometimes they take a while to seep inOnly if youre really mindful can you see the longterm effectsOnly if youre alert can you see the shortterm effectsThis is why mindfulness and alertness have to go togetherI was reading a Dhamma talk by Upasika Kee last night in which she was saying that real insight as soon as it sees lets go in that very momentIts not that you see in one moment and let go in the nextYou see and you let go in the seeing right there and thenThat kind of insight requires very quick alertnessBut the ability to develop that kind of alertness requires solid mindfulness longterm mindfulness so that you can understand how you get the mind in the right place to see things clearly to begin withAll too often when people sit and meditate the meditation either goes poorly and they have no idea why its going poorly or it goes well and they have no idea why its going wellThats because they havent been watching mindfullyThey watch for a little bit and then they forgetThen they come back and then they forget so that they dont really see the connectionsMindfulness is what keeps the practice in mind and allows you to remember what you did so you can understand the connection between what you did and the results youre gettingAlertness is what allows you to see what youre doing right nowWhen you develop the resolve to act only on skillful intentions and the proper understanding of how your actions shape your life those are the conditions that feed mindfulness that allow mindfulness and alertness to grow strongSo its not the case that people can just walk in off the street sit down and develop mindfulnessIt takes the ability to look at your life and make some decisions about how youre going to live and how you understand the best way of livingThats when mindfulness has a chanceFocus on your breathKnow when its coming in know when its going outNotice where you feel it the sensations that tell you when its coming in and going out and then keep your attention focused on those sensationsYou have to be careful though in how you focusIf you put too much pressure on the breath it starts getting constrictedIf your attention to the breath is too light it slips off and floats awaySo find just the right amount of pressure to maintain on the breath  here meaning the pressure of your attention  but allow the breath to flow as freely as possible in the bodyWe often make the mistake of tensing up around something in order to highlight it in our attention or to stay focused on it but thatll get in the way of the breaths being a pleasurable place to stayWhich is what you need as you meditate  a good place to stay  because if the mind doesnt find any sense of ease in the present moment its going to go wandering off looking for ease and pleasure someplace elseSo experiment with the breathingYou can do it in one of two waysThe first is simply to pose the question in your mind with each breath What kind of breathing would feel really good right now See how the body respondsOr you can go about it more systematicallyTo expand your sense of what the breath is capable of ask yourself What would longer breathing feel like And think of the breath going longer for a whileThen how about still longer What would that feel likeAnd then go shorter deeper or more shallow heavier or lighterTry to push the envelope until you gain a sense of what kind of breathing really does feel good right nowIts important that you learn how to play with the breath in this wayThis may seem counterintuitiveAfter all were trying to get to something unconditioned and unfabricated and yet here we go about it by fabricatingBut thats what the whole path is a kind of fabricationEvery factor of the noble eightfold path from right view through right concentration is something put togetherIts a fabricationIts something you will through bodily fabrication verbal fabrication and mental fabrication ie through the breath through directed thought and evaluation and through feeling and perceptionBut to will skillfully you have to bring these fabrications together in a way that makes the path pleasant to followOtherwise you cant stick with itThis is why right concentration is such an important part of the pathIt gives you a good place to stay  a sense of ease wellbeing refreshment or rapture that nourishes and sustains your ability to stick with the pathSo play around with the breathThink of fabrication as playing and you have permission to playDont think that playing around in this way is going to get in the way of insightIt actually helps create the conditions for insight to ariseFor one it gives stamina to the practiceIf youre simply sitting with whatever comes up meditation becomes an exercise in brute enduranceIf no pleasures coming up in the meditation no sense of rapture or gratification it becomes dull and unattractiveYou find it harder and harder to actually sit down and keep up with the practice day after dayBut if you allow the meditation to be a process of exploring of finding whats really comfortable right now you can stick with itIt becomes something interesting something you want to doAs youre sticking with this process of experimenting with the breath getting it more pleasurable and allowing that sense of pleasure to seep throughout the body it gives you a steadier base in the present momentThe interest you develop in exploring the breath energy in the body helps you stay steadily in the present as wellIf the meditation is simply a matter of watching whatever comes up it gets boring very quicklyThe minds going to find reasons to do other things to slip away and find other things that seem more interesting or importantBut if you allow yourself to explore your curiosity makes you want to stay here to stay sensitive and steadily focusedAt the same time allowing the breath to be comfortable gives you a safe foundation in the present moment  a foundation youre going to need because pains will come upWe need the right attitude toward pain not to feel threatened not to run awayOur duty with regard to pain is to comprehend it but youre not going to comprehend it if you feel threatened by itSo its good to know that you have a safe comfortable place to return to whenever you need itSay theres a pain in your leg and youre not really ready to deal with it yet You can focus on whatever sense of ease and fullness you can develop elsewhere in the body  say in the chest in the stomach in your hands in your feet  through the way you breatheIf things get bad with the pain you can go back to the breathOnce the mind feels nourished and protected by the breath itll be more willing to actually look into the pain probe into the pain trying to understand What is this pain I have in my bodyWhy do I fear it so muchIs it really as fearsome as it seemsAs you get interested in exploring the pain you start taking it apart Which part of the pain is actually a physical sensation and which part is the mental perception that makes things worse in the mindAnd even with that physical sensation Which part of it actually is a painBecause you also have sensations of the different elements in your body which are more like properties of how the body feels from withinTheres solidity liquidity warmth and energyHow does the pain relate to thoseIts a different kind of sensationLiquid is just liquidSolid is just solidIt doesnt have to be painfulIn fact these sensations are a different order of sensation entirely from the painBut theres a pain flitting around in thereIf you glom it together with the physical properties especially the property of earth or solidity you make the pain seem a lot more solid and threatening than it actually isIf youre coming from a position of wellbeing a position of inner security its easier to explore and see these things happening because your agenda isnt necessarily to make the pain go awayYoure curiousYou want to learn about itAnd as you develop a greater sensitivity to the breathing a greater sensitivity to how you fashion the breath and how intention plays a role in your experience of the breath you start seeing more and more subtle levels of stress that you wouldnt have seen otherwiseYou see more subtle levels of fabrication that you wouldnt have seen otherwise as wellBecause one of the big lessons in the meditation is that the present moment is not a givenYoure actually shaping the present moment with your intentionsAnd the best way to sensitize yourself to those intentions and their role in fashioning the present is to try to fashion it skillfullyThis way you get a sense of when you should try to change things and when you shouldnt which problems in the body or in the mind respond to active intervention and which ones respond better when you simply watch them with equanimityAs you put the mind in a better mood through giving it a good comfortable place to stay or giving it something to explore with the breath it becomes more open to seeing its own mistakesIt can even admit its mistakes with a greater sense of cheerfulness because it sees that they dont have to be repeatedIf the mind is in a bad mood its like a person in a foul moodIf you want to talk to him about where hes been unskillful where hes been outrageous or whatever in his behavior he wont want to hear anything you sayHes going to resistBut if hes rested and well fed and in a good mood its a lot easier to broach the topic of his shortcomingsAnd the same with the mind A lot of what were going to learn in the process of understanding the mind is in seeing its subterfuges where it lies to itself where its been dishonest with itself all of which are things we dont like to seeYet if we dont admit these things to ourselves insight will never have a chanceYou cant just put the mind through a meditation grinder and hope that the process is going to take care of itThe mind has to develop the sensitivity to see where its been lying to itself where its been dishonest with itself for genuine insight to ariseSo this game we play with the breath helps put you in the right mood to learn those lessonsTry to explore how to get the breath more comfortable more refined seeing how still you can get both the breath and the mind without forcing them unnaturallyAfter all youre working with a sense of ease so you cant force it to the point where the ease dies awayThis means that you need to develop your powers of sensitivityYou need to have a sense of how much fiddling around becomes too much fiddling aroundWhen the breath gets comfortable enough that you can stay with the body when it feels good to be with the whole body breathing in the whole body breathing out then you just allow it to do its thingAnd as the mind calms down the breath calms down as wellThis is a common pattern throughout the Buddhas meditation instructionsYou try to get a sense of what fabrication is going on and then once youre sensitive to the process of fabrication you allow it to grow stillThis gives you some insight into the fact that youre shaping the present momentYou develop the desire to do it with more skill with more finesse with a greater sense of sensitivity and subtletyAnd you can get there only by consciously trying to fabricate things fabricating your sense of the body through the breathing and fabricating your mind through the perceptions you holdThe sensitivity that develops over time is what allows you to see the subtleties of these processesIf you try to lay down the rule in the beginning that Im not going to do anything Im just going to watch whats already there a lot of whats really happening in the present moment goes underground where you cant see itBut as you consciously try to fabricate a sense of wellbeing in the body a sense of ease in the mind through the way you breathe through the way you relate to the breath then you bring these processes up to the surfaceYou see them more clearlyThis brings more honesty into the mindSo its important as you meditate that you realize you have permission to play are encouraged to play with the breathThis is how maturity develops in any fieldChildren who dont get a chance to play never really matureThe same principle applies to meditatorsIf you dont learn how to play with the present moment you never develop a mature understanding of whats going on in the present momentWhen you dont really understand the role of intention in forming the present moment you never get to the point where you can drop every element of intention thats creating the presentAnd only when you drop the last shred of intention can there be an opening to something outside of the present beyond space and time to that happiness were all looking for which is totally independent of conditions totally reliableAnd only when we have a reliable happiness can we rely on ourselvesYou see this everywhere nowThe economys collapsingThere are more murders out there more suicides more robberies as peoples sense of wellbeing gets more and more threatenedThis is when you really get to see how strong peoples sense of their inner wealth isThe more wealth you have inside the less youre worried about wealth outsideThe less you worry about wealth outside the more you can trust yourself to do the skillful thing to say the skillful thing to think the skillful thing in any situationIf you can train the mind to the point where its found something that cant be touched by anything in space and time but can be touched through inner awareness  as the Buddha says you touch it with the body or you see it with the body in other words its a total experience its not just a vision its not just an idea its visceral Once youve had your first taste of that you know you have a happiness you can depend onThis means you can depend on your mind as wellThe other pleasures of the world become less important and are less likely to tempt you to do unskillful things to attain them and protect them because you realize you have something that doesnt need protectionThats where the meditation gets really goodBut the only way you can develop the maturity needed to find that mature happiness is the same way any person develops maturity You start out by playing around learning about cause and effect by nudging things to see what they do in responseYou nudge this cause  ie the breath  to see what that does to the mind what it does to the sense of ease in the body and then nudge another cause say your perception of the breathIf you see the breath only as air coming in and out of the lungs youre really limiting yourselfThink of other ways you might perceive this energy in the body  flowing through the blood vessels flowing through the nerves flowing around the nerves flowing out to every pore in the skin flowing around the body just beyond the skin having everything in and around the body all connecting upAjaan Lees image is of cutting roads through a jungle till you have a whole system of interconnecting roadsCommunication gets easierInformation flows more smoothlyIts by playing around in this way that you start outgrowing your childish attitudesIts through play that children become adultsSo each time you sit down and meditate remember you have permission to playIts what the meditation is all aboutWe all bring our stories to the meditationSometimes theyre helpful stories sometimes theyre notEven the Buddha brought his stories to the meditationThat first knowledge on the night of his awakening was basically his story stretching back over many lifetimesThe big issues in each lifetime were his name his appearance his food his experience of pleasure and pain and how he passed awayThats pretty much itThe life of living beings name appearance food pleasure pain deathNot much of a storyAnd yet we can elaborate these things into all kinds of issues and spend whole lives going over the details certain incidents in the stories especially the painful onesOr we can look back on the pleasures we once had but that were missing now which can turn those past pleasures into present painThe Buddha found two ways to get out of his storiesOne was to generalize to think about all living beings as a whole That was his second knowledgeThe question arose If he had previous lifetimes how about other beingsMaybe looking at other beings he would begin to see some general patternsAnd thats precisely what happenedHe saw how all beings died and then were reborn and in taking the larger view he saw an important pattern The quality of their rebirth was based on their actions on the quality of their intentions shaped by their viewsFrom there he went to the third knowledge which took the pattern he saw in the second knowledge and applied it to the present moment looking at his views and his intentions in the present moment taking them apartThat was how he got out of his stories altogetherSo as we meditate we want to think about the pattern the Buddha foundWeve got to get out of our narratives our storiesOtherwise they drive us crazyYou go through the same old movies over and over again  movies that if they were put up on the screen you wouldnt pay to watchYet because of the I and the me  my pain my pleasure my appearance my food  you get hooked into watching them over and over againIf you want your meditation to go anywhere youve got to get yourself off the hookThe first step is to start generalizingThink of all the beings in the world who had appearances they didnt like or food they didnt like or missed the food that they once had that they did like or suffered both pleasure and painYoure not the only oneThink about that oftenThese are situations we all undergoAnd the particulars of our appearance and food and pain and pleasure may enthrall us but youve got to look at the general patternWhen you do you find that the comings and goings of good and bad likes and dislikes start seeming inconsequentialAs the general pattern takes the sting or the allure out of your own personal narrative you can come to the present moment and see more clearly what youre doing in the present moment thats creating pain that doesnt have to be thereWhat do you have in the present momentYouve got intentions or in other words fabricationsWhat kind of fabrications do you have hereYouve got the breath thats the bodily fabricationYouve got directed thought and evaluation those are verbal fabricationsAnd youve got feelings and perceptions and the intentional element fashioning them thats mental fabricationThese are the things you want to understandYou understand them by learning how to master them bringing them all together  as were doing right now when we focus on the breath  and approaching their fabrication as a skillWhats the most skillful way to breatheWhats the most skillful way to think about and evaluate your breathWhat are the most skillful perceptions to apply to the breathWhat kinds of feelings are useful to develop out of the breathAs you get more and more absorbed in these questions they really help you get out of your narrativesDuring my first year as a monk back in Thailand I had a lot of time by myself a lot more than you do hereAnd sure enough a lot of my old narratives from grade school high school college and my family kept coming back coming back coming backThe one thing that kept me from going crazy was the fact that I had something interesting to explore in the present moment the breathAs I got more of a handle on the breath got more absorbed in the breath the fascination with the old narratives began to waneThe understanding began to arise that if I really wanted to comprehend why I was suffering from those old past narratives I should try to see how I was causing suffering for myself right now in the present momentThe breath was a good way to explore thatGetting absorbed in the breath is a very important way of getting out of those narratives and into the really big issue Why are you causing stress and suffering for yourself right nowYoure not a passive observerYoure not here watching a TV show that somebody else has prepackagedYoure actively creating the showIts an interactive gameSo its important to look at how you think about the breath how you perceive the breath and to see the impact those thoughts and perceptions haveThis is where Ajaan Lees instructions on the different levels of breath energy are really helpfulTheres the inandout breathingThen theres the breath energy that courses through the nerves and the blood vessels throughout the bodyThen theres the still breathIts important to realize that all three levels of breath are happening all the timeWhat youre going to notice depends on which one you focus on and which one you focus on is going to determine how strong and steady and precise your concentration can beFirst you work with the inandout breath which is the easiest to observe and can get the mind to a certain level of concentration but the inandout breath can take you only so farYoure still changing from in to out in to out and you may have a sense that the inbreath is something very different from the outbreathSo youre watching two thingsBut then if you start getting more and more in touch with the process of spreading of the breath energy through the blood vessels and the nerves that gives you something you can watch continuously with no switching from in to out for this level of energy is always thereYour perception can become steadierAt first its not all that steady because youre exploring This is directed thought and evaluationYoure exploring how the breath energy affects different parts of the body which parts you tense up as you breathe in which parts you squeeze as you breathe outThen you work through those parts section by section clearing out the tension and trying to keep it cleared out throughout the breath cycleSometimes as you get one section cleared up a section that you just cleared up a few minutes ago starts tensing up againIts like the old Thai proverb about throwing live crabs into a basketYou throw one or two into the basketThen you look for your third but by the time you throw the third one in the first crabs crawled outSo again this stage of the meditation is fairly activeTheres a lot of directed thought a lot of evaluation and they have to go back and forth over the same territory many many timesBut the important point is that youre consistently with issues of the breathThats what enables you to be in a state of concentrationEven though theres some activity even though theres some moving around its within a prescribed areaYouve withdrawn from unskillful qualities withdrawn from sensual passions and youre right here with all the complexities of the breath energy in the bodyAs you work through the complexities things begin to hook up and after a while they stay hooked up connected into a single field of energyThats when the perception of breath can get more unifiedAs it grows more unified the issues are less complexYoure concerned less and less with the inandout breathing and more and more with the state of the breath energy flowing through the bodyYou may notice that the breath channels in the body seem to expand as you breathe inThey may seem to contract as you breathe outThis is where youve got to make up your mind to keep them open all the time both with the inbreath and with the out  so that its just open open open open breath channels open all the timeThat can be your one perceptionYou dont have to think about in and out Just everything open everything open By this time you should have noticed where the different nodes of breath energy are the ones that are like road intersections that can get closed offYou can close off the whole road just by closing off the one intersectionBut at the same time once youve got the intersection opened youve got the whole road openSo focus your attention on the intersections and try to keep them open all the timeThats what Ajaan Lee is pointing to when he talks about the resting spots of the breathSay youre focused in the middle of the chestKeep that sense of the middle of the chest wide open all the way through the inbreath all the way through the out and then think of that sense of openness spreading throughout the body wherever its going to goGet in touch with the awareness that already fills the body as well so youre thinking all the way open all the way in all the way out and the in and out become less and less and less important while the openness thats continuous takes center stageWith that perception you can get the mind to a much more solid level of concentrationJust maintain that one perceptionThere will still be some inandout breathing but it grows more and more subtle and impinges less and less on your awarenessThis is how you can get more in touch with that sense of the really still breath thats not affected by any in or out at allNo sense of motion at allJust there filling the bodySo this element of perception this mental fabrication has a really important role in how you relate to the present momentAs you learn to fabricate in more subtle ways more solid ways more unchanging and unified ways the mind can settle down more and more solidly securelySome people when they get to this stage think that the mind isnt doing anything at all no self no actor nothingBut actually its doing just one consistent thingWhen theres that one consistent thing you dont notice the motionsThe sense of the actor gets less and less prominent in the mind because theres no changing of roles nothing to thwart your roleTheres just a sense of being just being hereBut being here is still an activity its still a fabricationNevertheless its a skillful fabricationIts part of your pathThis is how you begin to understand fabrications by mastering the fabrications that give you a sense of ease and wellbeing in the present moment that allow the mind to settle downOnce its settled down it can see the subtleties a lot more clearlySo work on getting the mind in the right position right here right nowAt this point your stories and narratives are far away because youve got something really fascinating in the present momentYou see itYou approach the present moment with the right skills and they really do make a huge difference in the amount of pleasure you get out of itAnd thats an important insight right thereAs you sit here with your eyes closed where do you feel the breathingYou may feel it in lots of places in the body because the breath isnt just the air coming in and out of the lungsIts an energy flowIts part of the breath element that fills the entire bodyYour sense of the body sitting here the whole body from the head down to the feet has a breath aspectPart of that breath is the inandout breath and another part is simply the energy flowing in the nerves in the blood vessels out to the pores of the skinIts all breathSo as you breathe in and out you have the right to sense it anywhere at allYou can focus either on the spot where the breath seems most prominent or on the spot where it simply seems most natural to focusSome people find it easiest to focus on the head others find it easier to focus on the chest the neck or the shouldersSo focus anywhere youd likeAnd allow the spot where youre focusing to have a certain amount of freedomIn other words dont clamp down on itSometimes you may try to define things sharply This is where the inbreath begins this is where the outbreath begins this is where the inbreath ends this is where the outbreath ends But doing that places unnecessary restrictions on your breathingGiven that the whole body is a body of breath energy breath energy doesnt come with clear lines or sharp demarcationsWhen you breathe in the incoming energy simply melds with the old energyIt doesnt fight it doesnt have to be pushed against anythingIt just suffuses and energizes whats already thereTheres no clear line of demarcationWhen the inbreath reaches a point where you feel youve had enough incoming energy the breath goes outSo try not to impose too many strict preconceived notions on the breathJust watch how the process feels and hold that perception in mind that the whole body is a field of breath energy and the inbreath is simply charging up the breath energy already thereThen when things feel too charged you allow the breath to go outWhen its going to start coming in again thats its businessYoure just there to watch itTo use the Thai word Ajaan Fuang would use prakhawng  hover around it look after it make sure it feels goodYou can pose some questions in the mind What kind of breathing would feel better right nowWhat kind of breathing would feel bestWhich part of the body needs more breath energy And see how the body respondsJust hover around the breath like thisThe hovering around Thats directed thought and evaluationAs long as your hovering can stay with the breath and doesnt hover off to other places youve got the third factor for first jhana which is singleness of preoccupation the singleness here meaning both that its the one topic youre interested in and that as you work with it it becomes more and more the one thing filling the whole body your whole range of awarenessYoure working on a very broadbased state of concentration hereAs the Buddha says when a feeling of ease and rapture arises you try to spread it throughout the whole bodyThe image he gives is of a bathman or a bathmans apprentice kneading water into a pile of bath powderIn those days they didnt have soapThe bathman would start with some scented bath powder and then mix it with water kneading the water into the powder until it formed a paste with which theyd batheIts similar to mixing water with flour to make bread dough You want to mix it just right and knead it through thoroughly so that all the flour gets moistened in the same wayYou dont add so much water that the water begins to dribble out or so little that not all the flour gets moistenedThats what directed thought and evaluation are forTheyre not extraneous to the first jhanaTheyre part of the process of arranging a good place for the mind to settle downThey help attain someplace in the body a balanced feeling of ease and refreshment and then allow that ease and refreshment to fill the body to knead it through the body if necessary so that the whole body feels saturated and filled with ease and refreshment with breath with awarenessYoull notice that awareness has two aspectsTheres focused awareness and then theres a kind of background awareness already in your bodyYou want to get them in touch with each otherThe background awareness is already there just like the background breath energy in the bodyThe question in both cases though is Is it fullWhen dealing with the breath youre not trying to pump breath into areas where its never been beforeYoure simply allowing everything to connectAnd the same with your awareness You want your focused awareness to connect with your background awareness so that they form a solid wholeNow as you work with this you may find after a while that everything is as saturated as it can getNo matter how much you try to make it more comfortable it just doesnt seem to changeAt that point you can just settle in with the breathing as it is keeping your awareness centered and fullYou gain a sense more and more that the breath and the awareness become one  because after all theyre filling the same placeThe awareness fills the body the breath fills the body each fills the other and they become oneThe stronger the sense of oneness the further and further away the hindrances goThey may nibble at the edges of your awareness here and there but you really dont have to pay them any attentionYou dont have to chase them awayIf you chase them away you drop the breath and theyve got youSo you dont want them to trick you in that wayWhatever thought comes passing by just let it go passing byBut the greater the sense of unity or unification here the less the hindrances are going to be a problemThat right there is enough to get you solidly basedFrom there the concentration can develop furtherYou may decide that the sense of rapture and refreshment is too coarse that it actually becomes an irritantYoud like something more refined and stillSo tunein to the area where there already is stillness in the awareness where there already is stillness in the breath and let the rapture do its thingYou dont have to play along with it anymoreYou go under the radar below the rapture into a level of more subtle ease relaxed and equanimousIn the Canon the distinction between these two levels is described in terms of two different imagesOne is of a lake fed by a cool spring Thats the second jhanaTheres a sense of upwelling a movement of the watersThe cool water from the spring spreads to fill the whole lake effortlesslyTheres no conscious effort unlike the image of the bathman who is deliberately working the water through the bath powder doughHere the cool water just naturally spreads throughout the lakeBut still theres a spreading a sense of upwelling movement and refreshmentIn the image for the third jhana though the waters of the lake are totally stillLotuses are growing totally submersed in the water from the tips of the roots up to the tips of the flowersNo movement at allJust the coolness of the water saturating themAs things get more and more connected even the subtle movement of the breath in and out grows stillThe awareness is stillThe breath is stillBoth fill the body with their stillnessThis is the fourth jhanaIn the image of this jhana the water disappears altogetherTheres just a light white cloth covering the bodyThe equanimity here weighs less than the pleasure youve been soaking in and your awareness throughout the body is very clearThis is when your concentration is really strongIts not the kind of concentration that blots out other thingsIts just thereYouve got the perception that gently but steadily holds it thereThe world outside is still around you but you dont send your awareness out to itYou stay with the sense of stillness in the breath stillness in the body stillness in the awarenessTheres a great sense of freedom although theres still the subtle work of staying hereYou dont want to drop itBut its not nearly as complex as the earlier stages of concentrationGetting the mind to settle down like this is like a mother hen trying to gather her chicks togetherIn the beginning the chicks are running all over the placeThe hen has to run here and there to round them up but gradually she brings them into a smaller and smaller range until finally they all settle down together under her wingsThats the way it is with concentrationYoure not trying to blot out anything you just maintain your focus and gather everything inThe closer these things come together the less effort involved in keeping tabs on themAnother image they use in Thailand is of a red antThe red ant when it bites just grabs on with its jawsIt doesnt let goYou can pull at its body but the jaws stay in place even when its head has torn offSo all you have to do is gather all your attention on the perception and sensation of the breath throughout the body and then just hang onIf you do it skillfully with this enlarged awareness you settle down and develop a sense of concentration thats easy to maintainIf everything is focused just on one point that concentration will easily be destroyed with the slightest movementYou may be able to maintain it when youre sitting very still but as soon as you have to move the body its goneBut with the wholebody awareness like this where theres a sense of being settled and established with the entire body your frame your center of gravity is lowThe mind is broadly based and isnt easily tipped overEven as you get up from the meditation you can maintain that sense of full body as you walk around as you deal with other thingsIt may not actually qualify as jhana but its a steady foundationIts your foundation of mindfulnessIts an establishing of mindfulness which after all is the theme or nimitta of the meditationWhen the Buddha used the word nimitta he didnt mean a vision or a lightHe meant the topic of your meditationAnd the topic of your meditation is whatIts the four satipatthana the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves mind in and of itself or mental qualities in and of themselves  all of which are right hereIt doesnt take much to move from body to feelings or feelings to mind states or mind states to mental qualitiesTheyre very close together right hereBut you choose one as your primary foundation or frame of referenceFor instance try to relate everything to the breathAs feelings come and go see how they relate to the breathHow does the breath cause themWhich way of breathing helps to induce feelings of ease and raptureWhen the ease and rapture seem to be coarse which ways of breathing or conceiving of the breath allow everything to settle down into a more subtle state of equanimityWhich ways of breathing allow you to gain what the Buddha called an enlarged awareness mahaggatam cittamIn the foundations of mindfulness or the frames of reference he talks about different ways of categorizing the mindAs you read through the list you see that the categories get more and more refined as your concentration gets more and more refinedSo which ways of breathing help the mind get more refinedIn terms of mental qualities which ways of breathing are associated with the hindrances which ways of breathing are associated with the factors for awakeningFor example the first three factors  mindfulness the analysis of qualities and persistence  are related to your directed thought and evaluation trying to see whats skillful and whats not trying to induce whats skillful and let go of whats notHow do you use the breath to develop these factors in such a way that gathers the remaining qualities  rapture and refreshment calm concentration and equanimity  here in the stages of concentrationYou want to hold onto the breath as your main frame of reference so that you dont get scatteredIf you find yourself getting scattered just drop those connections and stay simply with the sensation of the breathLearn how to read your mind to see when the mind is ready to start investigating these connections and when it really needs to just sit down and be stillStay with the one perception that acts as a thread keeps the mind right here sews your awareness together with the bodyYoure creating a place where insight can ariseIt requires a good solid foundation a low center of gravity so that its not easily knocked offIf you flit around from one frame of reference to another you miss a lot of things because in the flitting around there are going to be gapsA lot of interesting things happen in the gaps which you tend to missSo think of your mindfulness of the breath as a long piece of thread that sews everything together over timeAnything that comes up in the body or in the mind try to relate it to the breathThis is the kind of concentration that can provide a good foundation for insight for discernmentIts range of view is all around with few blind spotsThe stronger this concentration the more refined the discernment you can developSo dont worry about when to stop doing concentration and to start doing discernment workAs the Buddha said it requires a certain amount of tranquility and insight in order to get the mind to settle down into strong concentration then once its in strong concentration your tranquility and insight get more refinedThese things go togetherYou may find yourself leaning in one direction or another at any one time but dont lean so hard that things tip over or get scatteredTry to keep everything together like thisThe mind can then begin to cut through a lot of defilements a lot of problems in a way that it couldnt when it was scatteredAjaan Lee gives the image of gathering everything into a single drill bit that drills down into the earth in one placeYour concentration is hereYour mindfulness is hereYour insight is hereWhen theyre all working together the drill bit can go deep and cut through anything  even rock  because all these qualities are working togetherAs youre meditating and listening to the Dhamma talk give most of your attention to the breath to your actual meditation objectThe talk is here in the background pointing things out that may or may not be appearing right now in your breath in your mindThe actual Dhamma is right there in the body in the mindIts not in the words of the talkOne of the Pali terms for a Dhamma talk dhammadesana literally means pointing to the DhammaIn other words the words arent the DhammaThe words point to the Dhamma that can be found in the breath in the mind in this area of awareness where you experience the body from withinTheres an old Peanuts comic strip where Linus comes up to Lucy and says Feel how cold my hands are So he touches her and she says Brrr yes they are cold Then she asks But how do you know how they feel when youre inside them And this is a big problem for most of usWere not really that conscious of how we feel the body from withinYet this is the area where the Buddha says youre going to find the DhammaThe texts talk about touching the Dhamma with the body even seeing the Dhamma with the bodyWhere youre experiencing the body right now Thats where the important things are going to be discoveredThe experience of concentration is going to be sensed right hereEven when you go into the formless realms its going to be right here where your sense of the surface of the body begins to disappearRight where the body was felt thats where youre going to start noticing space and consciousnessWhen your awareness of the deathless comes its going to fill the area where your body is nowThats where the Dhamma is seen and touchedSo right here is where you want to lookAnd get used to looking again and again and again so that you can see things more precisely and accuratelyNow words are useful to help you to discern and distinguish some of the things you might be experiencing hereIts like people who are trained to be professional tastersPart of their training lies in learning how to notice very carefully what their taste buds are telling them but an equally large part is learning a vocabulary that helps them make precise distinctionsThis is the purpose of these words pointing to the Dhamma to help you notice subtle things happening right here that you might have overlooked or glommed togetherYou might have missed some subtle distinctionsWhen most of us look at this sense of the inside of the body we can notice whether were feeling well or not well but thats about itSome people cant even experience that much cant even experience the bodyEither because of abuse when they were small or some other trauma they have trouble feeling their bodies being sensitive to whats going on insideOne way to get around that is not to imagine that youre looking at the body from the area of the head or the eyesInstead back up into the body Notice how the back feels notice how the different parts of the body feel as you back into themAnd use the breath as your guideThink of the different aspects you notice in the body as an aspect of the breath energyAltogether there are four elements or properties that make up our sense of the body from within breath fire water and earthThe sense of energy  which can be either moving or else still but buzzing  is breathDont think of the breath only as the air coming in and out of the lungsIts the energy buzz throughout the bodyWhen you start thinking of the body as an energy flow or energy buzz you begin to notice parts of the body where the flow or the buzz is not quite rightYou might have accepted them in the past as feeling solid thinking Well thats where the bones areThats where the muscles are tight But if you tell yourself This is breath you realize that some parts of the breath seem to be stuck others are stagnantThey dont moveThey dont flowWhat can you do to get them to moveWhat can you do to get them to flowChanging your perception will also change your questions change your ideas of whats possibleThen theres the warmth the fire propertySometimes it seems too warm sometimes not warm enoughWhich parts of the body are warmest right nowDo they feel comfortable or overly warmIf they feel comfortable think of spreading that warmth throughout the body to the places that are coolerIf youre feeling too hot you want to do the opposite Look for the cool areas and think of the coolness spreading throughout the bodyThats the water coming in to dampen the fireEarth is a sense of solidity or heavinessDoes the body feel too heavy or do you feel too lightheadedCan you bring things into balanceIf youre feeling too heavy think more of lightness the breath energy lifting you upIf youre feeling too lightheaded think more of earth There are bones theres all this solid stuff in your body that can keep you groundedOnce youve been able to detect these different properties within the body the next step is to try to bring them all into balance so that things are not too warm not too cold not too heavy not too lightThey feel just rightWhen the body is brought into balance your sense of the breath is going to changeThe energy flow in the body becomes less and less a matter of having to pull energy in from withoutIts more that the pores of your skin are wide open and they connect with breath channels throughout the bodyDifferent parts of the body are nourished with breath energy and all you have to do is think of them sharing the breath energy with one another with other parts of the body that seem more starvedThe more the breath channels connect within the body the less youre going to need the inandout breathThis is important because the more things come to balance and stillness like this the more clearly youll be able to see what the mind is doing right here  and particularly the very peculiar activity that the mind has of taking a sensation in the body and using it as a kernel for a thoughtIt becomes a little symbol in the mind and then the symbol turns into a thought worldThe more quiet and balanced things are in the body the more clearly you will be able to see this happen  and how arbitrary the whole process isOf course this process does have its usesIt enables you to think and function in the worldBut you also want to be able to pull yourself out at any time in case a thought world turns vicious so its good to gain practice in just staying with the bodyThink of body body body keeping the body in and of itself as your frame of referenceIf a thought does arise and you can sense where in the body its lodged think of breathing through that spotOr just think of the energy in that spot untangling itself and getting connected with the energy of the different parts right around it dissolving the tangleWhen you can stay with the sense of the body and not get sucked into a thought world its called keeping the body in and of itself as your frame of referenceThis is why the Buddha starts here when he teaches mindfulnessAnd in teaching mindfulness he teaches you the themes of concentrationYou want to maintain a sense of being centered right here where youre aware of the body from within so that as the movements of the mind go flashing out you can see them and yet not ride along with themThats how you begin to understand things like greed anger delusion craving and all those other mental states that cause suffering  learning how to watch how they form and how not to get hoodwinked into running along with themBut this requires becoming more and more sensitive to how things are happening here in the body how the mind and the different properties of the body interactWhen you find yourself in a bad mood dont immediately focus on how bad things are outsideDont focus on the object of the mood focus instead on the mood itself realizing that it comes from something wrong with how the mind and the body are interactingLearn to look inside and not take the minds comments on the world outside so seriouslyAgain and again this is the message of the meditationYou want to put yourself in a position where you can watch these processes as processes rather than as reliable information about the world out thereThe realization becomes clearer and clearer that everything you know about the world out there is being filtered through this area of your experience the area were all not very clear about not very articulate about not very observant aboutWhich means of course that were going to get deluded by the information the mind puts togetherThe way to get past that delusion is to get more and more clear about this clearinghouse the area where youre aware of the body from withinThis is where everything important is going to appearIf you dont yet see anything happening here then youre not looking carefully enoughEverything thats going to shape your life has to go through this filterYou want to get to know the filtering process very well so you can recognize when its filtering things in an accurate and useful way and when its filtering them in a harmful way that gives rise to sufferingSo we focus on the breath not simply as a means for getting the mind to settle down and be still but also as a means for looking at the mind itself and gaining insightAnd the insight were gaining here is not so much an insight that you can put into wordsThe words help you to articulate some of what youre experiencing here but the actual Dhamma is going to appear right here in your inner sense of the body and immediately make sense in a nonverbal wayThis is why its so important that you get sensitive to this area  and that youre continually sensitive to this area without rushing in rushing out rushing in rushing outYoure going to stay right hereIf theres any rushing in and out you can watch it but youre not going to rush along with itThats how you learn how to see things to see through things so they lose their power over youAs you get more and more sensitive here ultimately youll arrive at the point where you do touch the Dhamma with the bodyYou see the Dhamma with the body  ie you see it where the body is right nowIts a very intimate kind of seeingActually a lot of the Dhamma is already here right nowA lot of the processes of the body the processes of the mind can be sensed from withinBut if youre not looking here if youre not looking continually or youre not looking sensitively from this perspective youre going to miss themSo try to be continuous in your sensitivityMake this your frame of reference stick with this frame of reference and youll come to see a lot of things you never saw beforeThey were happening here all along but you were distractedYou were carried along by the flowThis is why the Buddha calls the things that defile the mind asavas effluents things that go flowing outFor all too long weve allowed ourselves to be carried along with the flow and then end up deposited wherever the flow ends in the mud and mess of the Mississippi deltaBut now you want to take a stance right hereThe Buddha said Make the body in and of itself your island in the middle of the river so as the flow goes out you dont go flowing along with itYou get to see Oh these are the things that get carried along with the flowThis is where the flow goes As long as youre standing on the island you arent getting sucked into the flowYou arent getting deludedYou can see whats happening and let it goThis is why its so important that you take your stance here and that you maintain this stance in all your other activitiesI dont know if youve noticed when we chant the sutta The Analysis of the Path as we did last night that the longest section is the one describing right concentrationIts the only section that talks about stages in the practiceAnd it gives a fairly detailed map of the different elements in each stageThe question is how do we relate to the mapIts tempting to say well theres this ingredient theres that ingredient and so you pull the different ingredients together and hope that what youve got is a state of jhanaBut it doesnt really work that wayIts like being told that durian tastes a little bit like garlic a little bit like onions a little bit like custardIt has a little bit of cyanide a little bit of vitamin ESo you throw all those things together thinking that youre going to get durian but what you get is an inedible messIf you want to get durian you have to plant the seedHere the seed is the topic of the meditationThe topic as the Buddha said is the four establishings of mindfulnessFor example staying focused on the body in and of itself ardent alert and mindful putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world Thats what you focus on the process you focus onOnce youve planted the seed and keep watering the seed the tree will growWhen its mature the tree will start giving fruitIf youve planted the right seed youre going to get the right fruitSo you dont have to go designing the fruitYou just have to be very careful to plant the right seed and care for it wellSo focus on the breath in and of itselfAs youre focusing on the breath put aside any sensual passionsTheres the phrase in the description of jhana secluded from sensuality Some people interpret that as meaning totally cut off from any input from the physical sensesSome interpret it as meaning secluded from sensual pleasures so that you have to meditate in a place thats unpleasant or a place thats very boringBut neither of those interpretations is what the Buddha meansSensuality in his sense of the word is your passion for your sensual thoughts and plans the extent to which you love to obsess about those thingsSo in being secluded from sensuality youre not trying to close off any contact with outside senses and youre not trying to put yourself in a dull boring placeYoure trying to develop a more internal seclusion If you see any sensual passion coming up you sidestep itYou put it asideRight here is where the analysis of the body into different parts comes in handyIf theres anything in the body thats got you lusting for it you can think about all the other things right next to it in the body that are disgustingIf youre feeling some greed for food think about the whole process of getting and eating food exactly how much work goes into preparing the food how short at time it actually tastes good in the mouth and then what its like as it goes through the digestive system and comes out the other endIn other words youre using some thinking here to protect yourself to pull you away from unskillful thoughts and in particular from sensual passionAnother way of gaining seclusion from sensuality is to fully inhabit your sense of the bodyThis is what rupa or form means when youre in concentration the sense of the body as felt from withinYou feel the inside of your hands the inside of your feet the inside of everythingThe mind isnt living out in the world with its thoughts about sights or sounds or smells or tastes or things that come and touch the bodyYou want to be on the level of form the body in and of itself as its present to you right here from the inside right nowAnd as youre alert and mindful youre ardent You want to use your alertness and mindfulness in a skillful wayIn other words notice how the breath feels and ask yourself Is this the kind of breath sensation you could settle down and spend lots of time withIf its not what can you do to change itThis is where evaluation comes inThe image for the first jhana is of a bathman working water through his lump of bath powder and turning it into a kind of doughOf the different images used for the jhanas this is the only one with a conscious agent deliberately doing something and evaluating the resultsYoure finding a sense of pleasure and fullness with the breath and then you deliberately work it through the body as a whole evaluating the results as you go alongIn doing so you learn an awful lot about this sense of the form of the body and how the energy moves through it and around it how the energy can move in a comfortable way and how if you force it in the wrong way it gets very uncomfortableYou have to observe and learn what works and what doesntIn this way youre not only developing a nice place to be in the present moment but also learning about how the different aggregates  such as the aggregate of feeling and the aggregate of form  interact how your perception has an effect on these thingsYoull see how you come to the meditation with specific perceptions in mind a particular idea in mind of how the mind focuses itself of how the breath works of how the energy in one part of the body relates to the energy in another part of the bodyAs you meditate you get a chance to test those perceptionsIf theyre not working try out other perceptionsAll of this is evaluationWhen youve got the right focal point youre evaluating it properly and youre keeping a specific topic in mind as continually as you can youve got all the causal factors that can get you into right concentrationThen you dont have to think about anything elseYou dont have to ask yourself Do I need to add a little bit more rapture a little bit more pleasure If youve got the causes right the results will come on their ownThe rapture and pleasure are resultsIf you arent getting the right results focus back on the causes which are directed thought evaluation and singleness of preoccupationWhen these are right the pleasure will come as a sense of ease whereas the rapture can come in many different formsIn some cases its simply a sense of refreshment of lightness or fullness in the bodyOther times its more intense a sense of thrill running through the body or your hair standing on endAgain your main concern is to stick with the causesYou dont want to go out redesigning the fruit painting the fruit squeezing the fruit or pulling on itFocus on the causes and the fruit will mature on its ownThen theres always the question How do you know youve hit the first jhanaYou cant really know at firstIt doesnt come with a sign that says Now entering jhana When you find the mind in a state that feels really good really comfortable with a sense of coming home then when you leave it put a postit note on it This might be something importantIn other words you apply a label to it but at the same time you realize youre not yet really familiar with the territory so you dont want to be too quick to incise the label in marbleThe only one of the jhanas that has a really definite signpost is the fourth which is where the inandout breathing stopsTheres a sense of awareness filling the body and its all very stillThe mind is still the body is still and everythings perfectly balancedTheres no inandout breathing at allAt that point you know youve hit the fourth jhana and you can put a more confident note thereThen you can look back at the various stages youve been through and you might have to rearrange the notes a little bitOr you find that youve taken more than four steps coming inThere are passages in the Canon that talk about five stages in jhana practice others that talk about threeSo its possible that your path into the fourth jhana might not have the same number of steps as somebody elsesI noticed that when Ajaan Fuang was teaching his students different people would have all sorts of different experiences in the meditation until they got to that one point where everything was very still in the bodyThe inandout breathing finally stoppedBreath energy was filling the body awareness was filling the body everything felt very connected balanced and very bright not necessarily with a light but with a sense of real clarityThen from that point on everybody seemed to go through the same stagesBut the process of getting into that point is going to be a very individual thingThe important factor is that you find a meditation topic you really likeTheres got to be an element of delight here because youre trying to develop a state of becoming a healthy state of becoming an alternative to the unhealthy and unskillful states of becoming youve been engaged in beforeAnd an important component in becoming is delightWith right concentration you have to develop a strong sense of ease and wellbeingThats the only way youre going to be able to pull yourself away from the temptation to keep falling back to the sensual delight that feeds your old sensual indulgencesThe Buddha once said that even though you may have a right understanding about the drawbacks of sensuality if you havent had any access to the kind of pleasure and rapture that jhana can provide youre always going to be tempted to go backSo mere insight on its own is not enough to pull you away from those temptationsYou need something else something stronger and more visceral to provide the mind with a sense of wellbeingThis is what right concentration providesTheres a nice sutta in which the Buddha talks about a bull elephant who wants to go down to the river and bathe aloneWhen he lives with an elephant herd and goes down to the river the she elephants and baby elephants bump into himHe wants to drink clear water and of course theyve muddied up the riverSo he decides to go off on his ownThen as hes living alone when he goes down to the river the water is clearNobody is bumping into him as he bathesHe comes out breaks a twig off the tree and scratches himself with the twigHe finds satisfactionHe allays his itchThe Buddha said that this is the same as when you practice right concentrationYou gain a sense of seclusion and then the pleasure the rapture and the sense of equanimity are like scratching yourself with the twigIt feels goodIt allays your itchAnd thats an important part of the practiceWithout that sense of ease and wellbeing everything gets very dryAt the same time once the mind is satisfied in this way you get to see the activities of the mind really clearly you get to see the body really clearly because you are hereVery consistently here alert mindfulThen you begin to see the body and your mind in terms of the aggregates in actionYou see form ie the form youre inhabitingYou see feelings the feelings that come from the different ways the breath energy moves through the bodyYou see your perceptions in action your fabrications in actionFor instance when you move from the first to the second jhana you let go of verbal fabrication and your relationship to the breath changesSingleness of preoccupation is a factor of all the levels of jhana but when you get into the second jhana the Buddha uses a new term unificationIn unification it feels as if your awareness and the breath become oneIts not as if youre sitting outside of the breath kneading it through the body youre immersed in a lake with the cool water of a spring welling up insideYoure actually one with the breathYou dont have to adjust it anymore you dont have to evaluate it anymoreThings begin to meld together merge together and actually stay that way all the way up through the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThis is what happens when you let go of the verbal fabrication of directed thought and evaluationWhen you get to the fourth jhana you let go of bodily fabricationThe inandout breath actually stopsThere are two ways you can observe the mind in the course of practicing jhanaOne is as its in a particular state of jhanaIn fact all the way up through the dimension of nothingness you can observe each state while youre in itIts like having your hand in a gloveIt can be fully in the glove partly in the glove or totally removedWhen youre fully in the higher jhanas you cant observe them but when youre partly in them you canYou pull the mind slightly above its full absorption  but not totally out  so that you can observe whats going on in that particular stateAnother way to observe it is as you move from one level to the next you begin to see different fabrications different perceptions just peeling awaySo youre beginning to see exactly what the Buddha is talking about when he talks about the five aggregatesYou see them in action  for they are actionsYou see the distinctions among themYou also see how they interact which means that youre not only in a really nice shady place with a branch that you can use to scratch yourself anywhere you itchYoure also in an ideal place to watch whats going on right here in the present moment in terms of the aggregatesThis allows you to start looking at things in and of themselves as they come into being right here right nowThis is why right concentration is the heart of the pathIts the first element of the path that the Buddha discoveredYou probably know the storyHed gone to the extreme end of selfaffliction through the various austerities he had inflicted on himself and after six years he realized that this wasnt workingIn spite of all his investment in that particular path he had the good sense and the humility to realize that there must be another waySo at that point he hearkened back to the time when he was a child sitting under a tree and had entered the first jhanaThe question arose in his mind Could this be the path And he said Yes this is the path So right concentration is the factor that he first realized was part of the pathThen from that point on as he worked with it he began to realize that other factors had to support it as wellBut right concentration is the central one the one you cant do withoutAnd the time spent on developing right concentration is very well spent both because its a good place to stay and because its an ideal place to start seeing things in terms of the five aggregatesSo you keep it in the back of your mind that this is what you want in the practice this is where youre headed as an interim goal on the pathBut as with every aspect of the path you have to combine your desire for a particular goal with an understanding of the steps that will take you thereAs the Canon says desire for awakening is a good thingBut its a good thing only when it gets you to focus on the actual steps that will take you thereAnd the same principle applies to jhanaYou know in the back of your mind that this is where youre headed but you cant be obsessed with whats written on the mapYou have to be more obsessed with the causes that will get you thereYou seclude the mind from sensualityAnd where do you do thatBy focusing on the four frames of reference the four establishings of mindfulnessThe Buddha says that this is your territory as a meditatorIf you wander off your territory its like the quail who wandered away from the plowed field where he could hide from the hawkHe suddenly finds himself out in an open meadow where a hawk swoops down and catches himAs the hawk carries him off he laments his bad fate Ah I shouldnt have left my safe fieldIf I hadnt this hawk would have been no match for me The hawk says Okay Ill let you go there but even there you wont escape me He lets the quail goThe quail goes and stands on top of a stone turned up by the plow and shouts to the hawk Okay come and get me you hawkCome and get me you hawk And the hawk without bragging just folds his wings and dives downThe quail sees that the hawk is coming at him full speed and so jumps behind the stoneThe hawk crashes into the stone and diesThis is the analogy for when you wander off into sensual passions Youre out where the hawk can get youBut when youre here in the body ardent alert and mindful youre in your safe territoryJust keep inhabiting the body as you go through the dayWhether youre in jhana or not doesnt matterAs long as you have this sense of fully inhabiting the body being in touch with the breath energy in the body youre in the right location youre in the proper territoryAs for the map of the different stages keep that in the back of your mindIf you look at the map while youre driving youll drive off the roadUse the map after youve come out of meditation to reflect on what you experienced what happened in the course of the meditationOver time youll arrive at your own more complete map of the different stages the mind goes through the different ways it settles down the different types of concentration you can get intoBut all this comes from having a proper sense of cause and effectThis is why the Buddha put right view at the very beginning of the path seeing the practice of meditation as a type of kamma something you do to get the results that you want with the realization that the results have to come from causesIf you focus on the causes with the sense of where you want to go kept in the back of the mind the causes will take you thereIn this case its not done by focusing on your memory of what was stated in the texts about jhanaIts done by focusing on the breath getting to know the breath by evaluating it adjusting it settling inThats where youll see right concentrationWe start each session with thoughts of goodwill reminding ourselves of why were here and of the fact that the happiness were looking for here is harmlessThats what goodwill is all about May all beings find happiness in a harmless wayOf course that means we need to find our happiness in a way that doesnt take anything away from anyone elseIn other words each of us has to find happiness withinThats why were here meditatingSo the fact that youre not paying attention to anyone else right now is actually a very responsible thing because youre pursuing a happiness that will make you less of a burdenAny happiness you try to gain otherwise is going to take something away from other people other beingsOr if you go to the other wrong extreme of selftorture trying to find some satisfaction out of that youre not going to find true happiness at all so thats not responsible eitherAs weve seen many times people go back and forth between these extremesThey can be very selfdenying until finally they snap then they head off in the other direction getting very selfindulgentWhen they see the harm of indulgence they go back to being selfdenying again back and forthNothing gets accomplished this wayBoth ways of looking for happiness are irresponsibleThe responsible way is to come in and see what inner resources you have that can be developed into a genuine happiness withinAs the Buddha once said your most important resource the most important factor of the right path is right viewIn another passage he said that the most important factor is right concentrationSo you need to emphasize bothEverything else draws on right view and serves right concentrationThe right view here starts with what I just said If youre going to find true happiness it has to come from within because the sources of suffering also come from withinWe suffer mentally not because of unpleasant things happening to us but from how we shape our experience of those unpleasant things  or of pleasant things as the case may beWhich means that we need some internal skillsThats what right concentration is forAs you focus on the breath try to bring your focus to a nice steady spotAjaan Lees image is of a post planted at the edge of the seaThe sea rises but the post doesnt rise with the seaThe sea ebbs but the post doesnt go out with the seaIt stays right thereThe trick here though is to make sure that that steady spot is comfortableIf you clamp down too hard youre going to put too much pressure on your nerves too much pressure on the blood vessels in that part of the body and your concentration will have some bad side effectsIt will create weird sensations in the different parts of the body as the blockage right here interrupts the blood flow and leads to problems somewhere elseSo keeping Ajaan Lees image in mind allow the water to flow around the post but keep your awareness steady with an element of interestTheres going to be something to watch here something interesting is going to appear here so have that element of interest to catch whats actually going onIf you find any tension or blockage building up here think of it relaxing dispersing dissolving awayAnd then think of the relaxation spreading out from that spot through all the energy channels in the body through all the nerves in the bodyIf it needs an escape route out of the body think of it going out the soles of your feet and the palms of your handsAnother image from Ajaan Lee is that meditation is like medicineMindfulness and alertness are the actual medicines the quality of your attention right now is whats healing both for the body and for the mindThe breath acts as a solvent helping the medicine to spread throughout the bodyWhen you apply wellbalanced alertness and mindfulness to any sense of blockage in the body it helps to untangle itThe reason these blockages build up is because were not paying attention to themOur attention is off someplace elseAnd so we miss a lot of whats going on right here right now in the body and in all the connections between the body and the mindSo wherever you focus on the breath in the body keep in mind that you want the breath to be comfortable you want the energy in that spot to be comfortable the sense of flow to be unobstructedAnd the results in the body help you to gauge how skillfully youre focusing the mindIn the beginning its hard to tell the two apartWhen theres a sense of focus there are going to be physical symptoms around the focusBut with time you begin to see that the focus and the symptoms are separate so that if youre focusing say on the nose or in the middle of the head the sense of pressure that might build up around that focus isnt necessaryTry to think of whatever escape routes there may be to allow that pressure to disperse a little bit so its not so heavy not too oppressive out the top of the head down the spine out the hands out the feet down the front of the throat whereverYou find where your escape routes areUse some imagination because weve all been developing different ways of maintaining focus in the body using different physical symptoms as a sign that the focus is staying there or as a reminder to stay at that spotIf some of those symptoms are unpleasant you have to learn how to let them go and yet maintain your focusThe flow of the energy there is a good way of gauging whether youre doing this skillfullyOnce you develop that skill in being both focused and at ease at the same time  alert attentive interested  you see how that quality of still awareness can allow patterns of tension to dissolve away and blockages to be opened upThats when you can bring that same quality of attention to patterns of tension in other parts of the body  around the navel the middle of the chest the back of the neck whereverHere again the steadiness and quality of your awareness is the medicineThe breath is a solvent that allows the effects of the medicine to spread through different parts of the bodyThis is an important skill  learning how to stay focused in a way thats healing  because thats what the Buddhas teachings are all about healingThats what the four noble truths are all aboutTheyre like a doctors prescriptionWhats the illnessWhere does it come fromCure the illness by getting rid of the causeEverything the Buddha taught was meant to be healing a means to happiness thats blamelessSo if you start feeling guilty about practicing concentration remind yourself this is a blameless pleasureThe dangers of jhana are very minor and mildIf you get really addicted to this pleasure you might start getting lazy in your other activities so thats something to watch out forAnd you might start getting lazy about the idea of using the jhana to develop deeper insightYou might say Hey this is good enough for me and just want to stay right thereThe problem of course is that it wont lastIf the jhana isnt supported by right view it begins to fall apartIf youre not careful it can actually strengthen wrong viewsSome people hit a state of concentration and then decide Ah from now on I dont need to watch out after my actions because Ive found the Truth the Ground of Being or whateverBut the problem there is not with the concentration the problem is with the views you bring into it thinking that its going to do all the work for you or that its all you need to doSo the danger is not in having concentration the danger is in the wrong views that you might bring to the concentration or that might prevent you from getting into concentrationFor the biggest danger is not having concentrationWe hear so much about the dangers of concentration but the dangers of not having it are a lot worseIf you dont have this pleasure to tap into youre going to go looking for pleasure in other ways which can often be quite harmfulAs the Buddha once said even though you may see the drawbacks of sensual pleasures if you dont have the pleasure of concentration to tap into youre going to keep going back to your old sensual pleasuresIf you go back to them with denial that just complicates the issuePeople steal kill have illicit sex lie speak divisively speak coarsely use intoxicants not because of their ability to access the pleasure of concentration but because they dont have that abilityThey go looking around for sensual pleasuresPeople engage in selftorment and then they get very censorious and very strict with other people for not torturing themselves or tormenting themselvesOr as we see with a lot of Buddhist scholars they dont have any real concentration so they say that concentration is selfindulgent its not necessary insight has to be strict and selfdenying  and with that attitude even the insight becomes harmfulIt turns into a lot of wrong viewSo the dangers of not having concentration are much greater than the dangers of getting stuck on concentrationAnd again the stuckness is not so much in the concentration itself as in your views around itAs long as youre very clear that concentration is a path and that it has to be combined with other factors of the path  right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort and right mindfulness  then its perfectly safeThis is especially true when you develop the ability to read the quality of your concentration to read how it affects the breath energy in the body and to make sure the energy feels balanced at ease healthyIn this way your concentration is selfcorrecting because its got right view built into itThats because its the kind of concentration that listens notices its based on interest  citta  which is one of the bases for successThis factor has to be present in all states of right concentrationWhether or not its the factor youre consciously emphasizing its got to be there paying close attention to what youre doing noticing where youre adding unnecessary stress and then learning how to stop doing the things that are causing that unnecessary stressEven though this inquiry is just on the level of the breath its an application of the four noble truthsSo this interest is a way of listening to what the body needs as you focus on its various partsIts as if you ask What do you need stomachWhat kind of breath energy would feel good right here Give it what it wantsThen you move to the chestWhat do you need chestWhat breath energy would feel good right here Just pose those questions and try to maintain that steady awareness to watch to respondAs you learn how to balance the force of your concentration with a sense of wellbeing in the energy in the body you find that a lot of the elements of the path come into a balanced relationshipTheyre healingThats when you know when youre doing it rightIn this way you give all the different parts of the body a chance to tell you what they needAnd because a lot of the energy flow in the body is related to different issues in the mind youll find that parts of the mind that tended to not have a voice now start having a voice as wellYou allow them to get healed tooAll of this just as you focus on the breath is your medicine steady awareness combined with interest monitoring the breathA source of happiness that harms no one thats healing to the mindWhen the mind has been healed in this way or even while its in the process of healing you find that your relationships with other people are a lot less strainedYoure putting a lot less pressure on them because youre putting a lot less pressure on yourselfSo again this is a responsible way of looking for happinessDont believe those voices in the mind that say youre being irresponsible as you stay here with the breath or as you focus attention on your own mindYoure focusing your attention on a source of happiness that doesnt harm anybodyAnd thats a noble pursuit right thereAjaan Lee begins his breath meditation instructions by telling you to breathe in deeply three times or seven timesUse the wind element in the body to clean things out a little bitThen allow the breath to find a rhythm that feels just rightSee where your sense of ease is right now which parts of the body feel okay not tense not tightThis may involve a slight trick of perceptionWe tend to focus on the pains the tight areas the problems and we miss the areas that are actually okayIts like that book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain which teaches how to draw a face by focusing not on the eyes or the nose or the mouth but on the space between the eyes and the mouth or between the eyes and the noseIn other words look at the shapes you ordinarily dont look at and you find that the drawing comes out looking a lot more realisticIts the same with the breathIf you have a tendency to focus on the pains and the tensions look instead at the space around themAnd give that space some spaceIn other words allow it to feel at ease all the way through the inbreath all the way through the outIf you find yourself tensing up say at the end of the inbreath or the end of the outbreath then dont breathe so longAnother common mistake in breath meditation is to try to clearly demarcate the distinction between the inbreath and the outbreath by adding a little bit of squeeze or tension to emphasize the line between the twoThat line doesnt really help the breath at allSo think of the inbreath and outbreath as blending into one anotherThe inbreath is the same element as the outbreathAllow the sense of wellbeing to stay constant and continuousDont drop it or step on itDont squeeze it out as the breath goes outGive it some spaceAnd youll find that as youre giving it some space vagrant thoughts may come into the mindIf you were to focus on those thoughts youd have to squeeze off that sense of wellbeingThis means youve got to develop a new habitRealize that the thoughts are not all that important especially not now as youre meditatingYou dont have to get involved with themLet them go passing throughAs you do this youre using the concentration for one of its four main purposes which is to develop a sense of ease and wellbeing in the present momentOf the four purposes this is probably the lowest on the ladder but its nothing to sneeze atWe all need that sense of wellbeing for otherwise we go through life hungry hungry for sensual pleasures hungry for approval hungry to shore up a particular idea of ourselvesAnd as long as youre hungry you cant really see things for what they areEverything just becomes food or nonfood and you gobble the food right down sometimes you gobble the nonfood down as wellWhereas if you can allow the mind to enjoy a sense of wellbeing simply in the way you breathe simply in the way you inhabit the body you can look more objectively at what used to serve as foodYou find that you dont need to feed on all the things you used to feed onThat gives you a measure of freedom right thereIt allows you to start looking at the process of feeding more clearlyAt the same time when you develop this sense of wellbeing its a lot easier to look at yourself at your own motivations your own intentionsWe spend so much of our life suffering from the intentions of other people  or focusing on how much we suffer from the intentions of other people  that we neglect to look at our own intentions to see how much suffering they causeA part of the mind resists this a very strong part of the mindWe like to think that our intentions are good that theres nothing wrong with our intentionsYet a huge part of the practice requires seeing where our intentions are not skillfulThe only way youre going to look at your own intentions with any degree of fairness or equanimity is by getting the mind to settle down and be still to maintain a sense of wellbeing just being right hereWhen I first went to stay with Ajaan Fuang I was struck early on by the sense that he didnt fully trust meI thought I was a very trustworthy person and felt a little offendedBut in my dealings with him it soon became obvious that I did have some intentions and ideas that were very strongly unskillful and I hadnt been willing to look at themWhen there were problems it always seemed that the problem was out there someplace in him in the situation in the other people in the monasteryOnly when I was able to gain some sense of wellbeing in the concentration could I turn around to look at myself and realize that the problem is here in this need the mind feels to feed on certain ideasIts like an animalIf its not disturbed itll feed away with no problemItll seem perfectly tame perfectly harmlessBut if you start pulling its food away itll snap at you and snarlThose are hard parts of the mind to look atThe best way to do that is to gain a sense of wellbeing that allows us to look at ourselves more objectivelyThis is why practicing concentration for a sense of ease and wellbeing in the present moment is very importantA lot of people want to go straight to equanimity practice just watching things arising and passing awayYet you can watch things arise and pass away for the whole rest of your life but if theres no sense of wellbeing in the practice youre going to miss a lot of the arisings and the passings awayYoure going to miss the really important ones because you guard them you hold onto them without realizing what youre doingSo this sense of ease and wellbeing is the first goalpost in our practiceIt involves having a good mature attitude towards goalsWe work toward the sense of wellbeing but at the same time we realize that the seeds for the wellbeing are already hereIts not that we have to sweat and strain and push them into being or that our pushing and straining will cause them to burst out of nowhereIn fact the pushing and straining will prevent them from developingTheyre already here in a gentle potential formBut we do have to be carefulWe do have to watch to be sensitive and to show a great deal of restraint in respecting the little pockets in the mind the pockets in the body where theres already a sense of wellbeing that we tend to overlookTo sense the potential for wellbeing thats already there you have to look very carefully with a lot of sensitivityThats where the effort is directed not in exerting pressure on anything but in being as sensitive as you can to these pockets of wellbeing and allow them to growOnce youve got that sense of wellbeing then the Buddha says you can use your concentration for three other purposesOne is to gain what he calls knowledge and visionThats where you develop a sense of light in the bodyAnd that light can become the basis for the different psychic powers or what they call the higher knowledgesThese develop for some people and not for othersIf they happen to you you have to learn how to handle them in a mature wayIf they dont happen it doesnt matter for theyre not necessary for purifying the mindThe next purpose of concentration is to develop mindfulness which the Buddha defines as the ability to keep things in mind and alertness which he defines as being able to see thoughts as they arise as they stay as they pass away perceptions as they arise stay pass away feelings as they arise stay and pass awayIn other words you use the state of concentration as a basis for watching events in the mind without getting involved in the story lines or thought worlds you could create out of themYou keep in mind your desire to see them as processesNow notice The Buddha doesnt say that this is insightIts mindfulness and alertness just simply tuning in to whats actually happening and keeping in mind how to handle it skillfullyThe insight that gives rise to the end of the defilements is something elseIts the last use of concentration as a foundation for the ending of the asavas the minds fermentations or effluentsThat goes deeperYou dont simply watch things arise and pass awayYou see how they arise and pass away in dependence on shaky conditionsYou gain a larger and larger sense of how little value there is in their arising and their passing awayYou come to realize how in the past youve created all sorts of dramas all sorts of identities all sorts of worlds out of these thingsAnd theyre nothing but very fleeting eventsAs the Buddha says you learn how to see them as empty ephemeral notself you learn to see them as stressTheres a passage where the Buddha talks about seeing whatever arises as stress arisingWhatever passes away as stress passing awayThats not just being alert to things as they happen but its also gaining a sense of their valueTheyre just stress thats allThe analogy in the Canon is of a blind person who has been given an oily stained ragHes been told that its a nice white piece of clothSo he treasures it folds it up neatly carries it with him wherever he goesThen after some time his relatives finally find a doctor who can cure him of his blindnessThe first thing he looks at is the cloth and he realizes he was misledWhat he thought was a nice white piece of cloth is actually a soiled ragAll the issues and affairs worlds and identities dreams and dramas we build in our lives are made out of oily ragsIts an insight that we dont like to seeBut again its a lot easier to see this once the mind has had a sense of wellbeing through the practice of concentration so that its not addicted to chewing on ragsOr like that Far Side cartoon with cows feeding in a pasture One of the cows suddenly jerks her head back spits out her mouthful of grass and says in shock and surprise Wait a minuteThis is grassWeve been eating grass Thats what weve been eating all our lives grassThis is an insight that goes deeper than just watching things arise and pass awayIts seeing the worthlessness of making them ariseFor remember were not just passive observers of their arisingWere participants in fixing our foodAs long as we see the food as desirable well have the energy the passion to keep on producingOnly when we see that the food isnt worth it when we lose our taste for it will we lose our passion to produce itFor as the Buddha says once we see things arising and passing away we have to look for their allure  why are we attracted to them and also for their drawbacks What cost do they entailThe purpose here is to see that their drawbacks are much greater than the allureWe like the dramasWe like the worldsWe have reasons for liking themBut they all fall apartTheres no real substance to them nothing of any real value and yet they cause a lot of stressThat insight goes deeperYou see all the suffering that comes from holding onto these thingsThats when you truly understand as the Buddha says that such is the origination  say of form or feeling any of the aggregates  and such is their passing awayThis is what the aggregates are all about nothing but grassThis may sound depressing but its actually liberatingIts like the passage we chanted just now The world is swept awayIt does not endure And there are a lot of teachings in the Dhamma that are unpleasantsounding but are actually important medicine just as some of the most effective medicines are bitterThe Buddha teaches these things not to put a wet blanket on peoples lives on their pleasure on their happiness but to put the mind in a position where it really can look at these things square on so it will find freedom on the other sideThe Buddhas teachings never end with a negativeThey go through the negative to something positive that lies beyond for example as mindfulness of death leads ultimately to the deathlessSo the truths were learning are hard to learnTheyre not just about things outside but also about whats going on in our mindsTheres something not quite right about the way we feed the way we feel we need to feedThe problem isnt with things out thereIts with our intentions our reasons for feedingWe have to learn how to become skeptical of our own intentionsAnd the only way to manage that without feeling disoriented depressed or discouraged is to have the sense of wellbeing that comes from concentration so that you let go not out of discouragement or of sour grapesYou let go because youve found a better alternativeEach time you learn how to let go in the right way things get better and better inside because the whole point of all these teachings is to find ultimate freedom insideAnd although the path leading there involves some harsh lessons in looking at our own ignorance our own craving and clinging our own unskillful intentions it also involves developing skillful intentions realizing that we do have the potential for skillfulness as well and learning to use that potential wisely developing a sense of ease and wellbeing that enables us to do this work in a more balanced and productive wayA traditional Pali term for concentration is viharadhamma a home for the mindIts a place where the mind can stayBut its also more than thatAs with any home theres more to the home than just the bedroomAnd theres more to the home than just living in itFirst youve got to build itAnd for many of us thats the hardest part right there getting it builtYou put up a few posts and they fall downYou put them up again they fall down againBut you cant let yourself get discouraged because you need shelterYou need a place to keep your valuablesYou need a place to restAnd you need a good sheltered place to workOtherwise you work out under the hot sun or the cold of winterSo youve got to get the shelter builtYou put up the posts againIf you stick with it long enough you can put up at least something thatll stayLean a few pieces of plywood against each other wrap some plastic around them and youve got at least some shelterThen as you get better and better at building you can build yourself a better and better house until youve got one thats able to give you shelter from most of the vagaries of the weatherYouve got a comfortable place to stayBut then youve got to maintain itThis is the next difficulty in the practiceFor many of us once we get the mind into concentration the immediate question is What next The mind just sits there and doesnt do anything and we get antsyWell at first youve got to learn how to let it sit there and not do anything for long periods of time not to give in to the antsinessThat requires skill making sure you dont get bored making sure you dont lose your focus noticing when it begins to unravel when it begins to fray and learning how not to get complacent about repairing the little frayed endsSo as soon as the slightest leak develops in the roof youve got to fix itOtherwise mold sets in and the whole house begins to rot and fall apartIn other words theres a skill in maintaining the concentrationYou learn a lot about the mind in the course of the maintainingIf you take the meditation into your daily life  in other words trying to keep centered in your center as you go through your various activities  you begin to see very clearly where your attachments are where the asavas are the ways your mind flows out to things barging right through the walls of your concentrationThis means youve got a double dutyOne is to try to train the mind not to go barging through the walls and two to fix up whichever walls have been knocked downIn this way youre learning both about the minds defilements and the skills you need to be a good repair personAs you replace the wall you learn more about wallsYou may be able to take what used to be a plywood wall and put up a stone wall in its placeSo the maintaining is an important part of the concentration and an important step in developing discernmentBut to gain that discernment you cant simply use the meditation as a place to hide out at the beginning or end of the dayYou have to carry your concentration with you throughout the day so that you can use it as a way of gauging the movements of the mind and learning whatever skills you need to rein the mind in when it goes barging outSo those are two of the steps in having a homeOne is learning how to build it and the second one is learning how to maintain itThe third step is learning how to put it to useFor this step its good to think of the home as having several rooms and not just oneFor most of us the concentration is just the bedroomIts the place you go to rest and thats itBut even there you can learn how to use the concentration for more than just simply restingAs in the story of the princess and the pea When you lie down on your mattress are there any peas under the mattressCan you sense themIn other words is your bedroom really as comfortable as it could beYou can learn a lot just by investigating the bedroom and finding out where the irritants still areIf theres noise outside how can you insulate the windows so that the noise doesnt come inLike those hotels in airports where theyve learned how to insulate the windows so you dont even know that the planes are taking off or landing How can you insulate the mindIs it better to shut the windows or to leave them so wide open that the noise goes through and doesnt get lodged anywhereAnd what can you do to make the bed more comfortableTheres a lot to be learned right there for it heightens your sensitivity to even the least little bit of stress that the mind is creating for itself in the very process of staying concentratedBut theres more to the house than just the bedroomTheres also an exercise room a kitchen a woodshop a scientific laboratoryIn other words its a working home a craftsmans homeWhat this means is that you learn how to use the concentration not just as a place to rest but also as a place to do your workTo start out the work can be something very simpleIf youve got a big problem in daily life for instance a good way of dealing with it is to pose it as a question in your mind before you meditateTell yourself At the end of the meditation session I want to think about this issueAnd then put it out of your mindDont let your mind go there while youre meditating while youre trying to get it into concentrationOnly at the end of the hour or however long the session may be do you bring up the issue againAnd now youre looking at it from the point of view of a mind thats strong and well rested and the issue should be clear  or at least clearer than it wasJust pose the question in your mind and see what comes upYou may find that the new perspective of having the mind still and open makes the solution a lot easier to seeMany people think that once the mind is in concentration you cant let it rest there youve got to do vipassana right awayWell yes you do need to develop insight but before you get to the really subtle work of insight youve got other issues in your life that you have to sort out firstTheres a tendency called spiritual bypassing where people dont want to face the big issues in their lives so they use the meditation as an escape an avoidance strategy claiming that if they can solve the subtle issues of insight thatll solve their issues when theyre off the cushionBut you cant really deal honestly with the subtle issues of inconstancy stress and notself when you havent sorted through the blatant problems you cause in daily lifeThis is one of the reasons why traditionally they didnt have such things as meditation retreatsYou went to monasteriesAnd in monasteries there was time to meditate but there were also other duties in the course of the dayThere was work to be doneYou had to interact with the other people in the monastery to at least some extentAnd in the course of that work and those interactions you learned a lot about the Dhamma the Dhamma of generosity the Dhamma of virtue the Dhamma of patience equanimity goodwill  all these other virtues that are an essential part of training the mindThe idea of creating meditation retreats came basically in the late th or early th century the same time when the assembly line was invented breaking jobs down into little tiny parts that you do repetitivelyThis approach to physical work was efficient and effective so it became the model for a lot of meditation retreats and for the methods taught on those retreatsYou take one method and you just apply it again and again and againBut a lot gets left out in that approachIts like exercising only one muscle in your body so that the muscle gets strengthened all out of proportion to the rest of your bodyAnd that cant be healthyIts better to think of meditation as a training for the whole mind as exercise for the whole mindYou have to train the whole mind in all the virtues of maturity and heedfulnessIn other words you need to develop the ability to anticipate dangers particularly dangers in your own behavior and to figure out what you can do to prevent themYou also need to master skillful suppression the ability to say No to a state of mind that you know is going to lead you down the wrong pathTraditionally this virtue is associated with the attitudes of shame and compunctionIn other words you realize that unskillful behavior is really beneath youShame here doesnt mean low selfesteem it actually means very high selfesteem realizing that your worth as a person shouldnt be squandered on shoddy behaviorCompunction is realizing that if you follow a certain action the results are going to be bad and so you want to avoid that kind of behaviorYou also want to develop what psychologists call sublimation the ability to counteract the desire for an unskillful pleasure by finding a more skillful pleasure to take its placeThis is one of the reasons why we have the practice of concentrationThe mind wants pleasure so you give it a pleasure thats harmless blameless that it can tap into whenever it wants so that the impulse to go after less skillful pleasure wont be so strongThen theres altruism or compassionYou have to learn compassion for the people around you compassion for yourselfAnd you need a good sense of humorI dont know the Pali term for a sense of humor but you see it throughout the texts especially in the Vinaya the ability to laugh at the foibles of human nature that led monks and nuns to do unskillful thingsMany of the origin stories for the rules really are humorousThey teach you to laugh at that kind of behavior but its a goodnatured laughIts not nasty or meanIts the recognition that we all have had those impulses and we can see the foolishness in giving in to themThe virtue of humor is that it allows you to step back and separate yourself from what youre laughing atAs the Greeks used to say the gods laughIn other words the gods are up there on Mount Olympus looking down on human beings below and because they have that sense of distance they can laugh at human behaviorSo when you can laugh at yourself youre putting yourself in a godlike position a smallg god separate from your foibles and above themThese are some of the virtues developed as you learn how to live wisely with other meditators live wisely in a groupPsychologists call these virtues healthy egofunctioning and even though the Buddha never talked in terms of egofunctioning he definitely did teach these virtues as part of the pathSo you try to use your concentration as a tool in developing these virtues in the course of the dayTake some quiet time and then look at your behaviorThis is like having a bedroom with a workshop right next to itYou get rested and then you can go to workAnd even though you may not be directly applying the perceptions of inconstancy stress and notself to the five clingingaggregates youre learning to take a problemsolving approach to issues in your life which is precisely the Buddhas approachThe four noble truths are a problemsolving approach focused on the problem of stress and suffering as a whole and offering a solution to the problemAs you first start applying this approach to the obvious issues in your life you learn to develop maturity around the application of this teachingThe work then gets more and more subtle to the point where your workshop turns into a scientific laboratory and youre discovering new things about quarks and muonsYou can take your precise scientific equipment and learn more and more precise things about whats going on in the mind working from the large issues or the blatant issues to the more subtle onesThis is how skill gets developedYou can even extend the image of the house to the point where you start studying the house itselfTake your microscope to look at the beams and the carpet to analyze the molecules in the airTheres lots of stuff in the house to studyAnd its all right hereSo if you get the mind still and find yourself wondering what to do next the first answer is that youve got to take care of the stillnessRemember Its a houseIts not a movie showYoure not looking for entertainmentThe house doesnt have to be entertainingThe prime requisite for a house is that its restful that it offers good shelterBut then the Buddha saw that you can do more with a house than just find shelter and restYou can make it a working homeIn other words you learn not only how to build and maintain your home but also how to use it as your workshopYou not only develop and maintain concentration but you also put it to useThis was the big difference between the Buddhas approach to concentration and that of his two teachersHis two teachers saw concentration simply as a place to rest and that was it whereas the Buddha said No you can actually work in here as wellTheres more to be done than just restingYou work and analyze you discover new things about the mindAnd if youre still looking for entertainment thats the best kind of entertainment there is the joy of developing a skill the joy of discoverySo its good to have a large sense of what this image of viharadhamma or home for the mind meansYou learn how to build it you learn how to maintain it and then you use it as your workshop working from crude problems up to the more subtle onesSo whatever stage youre in  the building stage the maintaining stage or the working stage  remember to keep this image in mind so that you get the most use out of the homeWhen theres a talk during meditation dont focus your attention on the talkFocus on your breathThe purpose of the talk is to act like a fence to catch you when you wander away from the breath to keep pointing you back to the breathBecause its right at this spot  where the mind and the body meet at the breath here in the present moment  that your practice takes placeThats where youre going to see all the things you need to see and do all the things you need to do in the practiceThe talk is to help keep you focused here and to give you some perspective on what youre supposed to be looking for what youre supposed to be doingLast year I received a phone call from someone who was doing a thesis on using Buddhist teachings and practices in the workplaceHe wanted to ask me some questions as part of his thesisOne of the things that bothered me about his questions was that he would ask first about Buddhist teachings and then about Buddhist practices as if they were two different thingsBut theyre notEverything is part of the practiceEven the more abstract and theoretical teachings are meant to be used for pragmatic purposes when appropriateAfter all right view is part of the pathIts something to do to develop to be appliedWhen its done its work you let it goRight view comes down to the four noble truths and the four noble truths are based on one of the Buddhas really categorical acrosstheboard teachings that you want to abandon unskillful behavior and engage only in skillful behaviorIn other words were working on a skill hereThe things we intentionally do with our body with our words and with our thoughts all count as kamma and they all have resultsTheres no such thing as idle thinkingIt may be idle in its intent but it actually has an impact on the mindIts something youre doing and it leaves kammic tracesJust as the Buddha discouraged idle aimless speech he also discouraged idle aimless thinkingSo learn how to look at your thoughts in terms of what they do the impact they have on the mindThe Buddha himself said that he got on the right path when he started dividing his thinking into these two types thinking that was harmful and thinking that was harmlessIn other words he classed his thinking by the skillful or unskillful impact it had on the mindFrom that distinction the rest of the path grewIn his time most Indian philosophers got worked up about issues concerning the nature of the world and the nature of the selfBut the Buddha didnt get involved in those issues didnt answer any questions that would drag him into those issues because he saw that they werent helpful in putting an end to sufferingMany people got frustrated with him because they couldnt get a clear answer out of him on what they thought were the really important questionsThey mentioned this once to one of his lay followers and said This Buddha of yours Hes a nihilistHe doesnt teach anything at all The man said No thats not trueHe teaches whats skillful and whats not skillful Afterwards the man reported this conversation to the Buddha and the Buddha praised himHe said Thats the right answer the right way to deal with those peopleWhen the Buddha was critical of other teachers it was most frequently over their inability one to explain what is skillful or unskillful or two to provide an understanding of why its important to act in a skillful way and to avoid unskillful behaviorSo this is what were here for to use his explanation of these issues as an aid in developing a sense of skill with the mindAnd even with skillful thinking he said there are times when its even more skillful to let the mind rest in right concentrationIts another factor of the pathIn fact its one of the central onesTheres a passage where the Buddha refers to the other seven factors of the path as aids as requisites to right concentrationRight concentration is the important one the first factor of the path that the Buddha himself discoveredSo thats what we work onAnd in the process we bring in the other factors as they are neededSo learn how to make the mind content to be staying with the breath staying right hereThe mind has a tendency to think and evaluate so use it to think and evaluate the breathHow does the breathing feelWhere do you feel itHow many layers of breath energy are there in the bodyWhen you breathe in whats happening in the different parts of the bodyWhen you breathe out whats happeningDo you know the places where you tend to hold on or to force the breath or to squeeze the breath in an uncomfortable wayCan you learn to breathe in a way that doesnt involve that holding or forcing or squeezingThats taking the question of skillfulness and applying it right here right nowHow can you skillfully relate to the breath so that its easier to stay with so that staying with the breath induces a sense of ease of fullnessAs you begin to feel that ease and fullness learn to protect itIn the beginning it may feel simply like a neutral sensation nothing painful yet nothing outstandingly pleasantBut just protect that neutral feeling for a while and youll begin to see that it does grow more and more pleasurableThen think of that pleasure seeping easily throughout the different parts of the bodyIf theres a sense of blockage in any spot think of allowing it to open upIf you sense a blank space in some part of the body you cant account for  say where your hips should be  try to approach from the back down to the hips and from the legs up into the hips to see where the connection isThere are lots of things you can do to make the breath interestingAnd it is an interesting phenomenon this breath energy in the bodyIt enables us to liveIt enables us to move aroundWithout the breath wed be deadIts what animates the whole bodyIts the connection between the mind and the bodySo its good to exploreAs you explore the breath in this way youre getting some basic handson practice with the four noble truthsWhere is there stressWhats causing the stressThe stress can be caused either by ignorance or by cravingSo as you get to know more and more about the breath youre doing away with ignorance around the breathing process whats called in technical terms the process of bodily fabricationYou bring more awareness to the processAs you do this youll notice that you may have some subtle craving around the breathYou may prefer the inbreath to the outbreath so you make it longer than is really good for youOr you have gotten to like some subconscious ways of forcing the breath sensations but ultimately they create problemsThey create stressSo youre beginning to see some of the causes of stress right here in the present moment simply in the way you breatheAs you let the mind settle down youre developing the pathIts important to use these four noble truths as a framework because they help give you an idea of what you need to doThats why the Buddha set them out as right view because each of them involves a taskStress is to be comprehendedIn other words look at it so that you really understand it so that you stop identifying with it or seeing it as happening to you and see it instead simply as an event connected with movements in the mindWhen you see the movements of the mind that cause the stress and you see that theyre unnecessary then you abandon themIts important to be clear about thatYou dont abandon the stressYou abandon the causeIts like coming into the kitchen and finding it filled with smokeThe first thing you do is to run to the stove or oven and turn off the flame or run to the electric box and turn off the power to the oven or stoveIn other words you dont try to put out the smoke you put out the flameHere the flame is the craving and the ignoranceThose are the things you want to abandonOnce the flame is out then the smoke will dissipateAnd your knowing what to do and doing it Thats the pathYou want to develop that as completely as you can because your knowledge of the path will get more and more precise more and more subtle as you work with it until ultimately you can begin to realize for yourself what the ending of stress is likeSo these categories are here not just to talk about or to think aboutYou talk about them and think about them for the purpose of using them figuring out how youre suffering right now and how you might apply the categories to what youre doing right nowTheres a story about Chao Khun Naw who was a famous meditation monk in BangkokOne night as he was doing walking meditation outside his hut a young monk came running up to him and said Ive been thinking all day and I cant stop thinking Chao Khun Naw looked at him and said Youre doing the wrong task Thats all he said and then he went into his hutBut the young monk had enough knowledge about the four noble truths to realize Oh Ive been developing the cause of sufferingWhat I should be developing is the path That was enough to bring him to his sensesAjaan Fuang tells of how he was once sick with a chronic headache that would last for days on endIt got so bad that other monks would stay in his room at night in case he woke up in painOne night after midnight he woke up in pain and as he got up he looked aroundAll the monks who were supposed to be looking after him were sound asleepHe said to himself Whos looking after whom here But then he said Well as long as Im awake I might as well meditate So he sat in meditationAs he was looking at the pain he suddenly realized hed been doing the wrong thingHed been trying to get rid of the pain when actually the pain was something to be comprehendedSo thats what he did and that shift in understanding proved to be a real turning point in his practiceThe categories of the four truths are here to help you to realize what you should do and to catch yourself if youre applying the wrong task if youre trying to let go of good things or develop unskillful thingsIf you can catch yourself doing that then you can switch aroundUltimately your appreciation of these categories gets so subtle so refined that as Ajaan Mun says they all become oneIn other words they finally get to the point where theres just one task letting go totallyBecause after youve dealt with the blatant forms of stress and let go of the causes you begin to realize that the only thing left is the path doing its workThe only stress still in the mind is the stress of the path because theres a subtle level of stress that keeps concentration going that keeps discernment activeIn other words even the path is stress the cause of stress and so at that point you let go of itAs for the cessation of stress there are passages in the Canon describing how people touch the deathless and yet develop a passion for itThe passion for the deathless then becomes their one remaining obstacleTheyve got to learn how to let go of that tooThats why the Buddha said that all phenomena are notself because you hit a place in the practice where youre latching onto your experience of the deathlessYou have to learn how to not identify with thatThat too becomes something you let goWhen you do that you reach the ultimate end of the practiceSo these four noble truths are tools for getting you to the point where they all collapse into one so theres one duty left the duty of letting go all aroundBut until you reach that point its wise to keep these four categories in the back of your mind along with their underlying principle the idea of skillfulness  that were here to develop a skill to act skillfully speak skillfully and to think skillfullyYou realize that there really is a difference between skillful and unskillful behavior just as theres a real difference between the pleasure and pain they causeKeep that distinction in mindRemind yourself that everything the Buddha taught was meant to be used as a tool on the path at one point or anotherSometimes some teachings may not be the right tool for you right nowAs the Buddha said words have to be evaluated as to whether theyre true or false but even if theyre true you want to say only things that are beneficialAnd even if theyre true and beneficial you have to look for the right time and right place to say themSo apply that same principle to your thinking Are these thoughts trueAre they beneficialAnd is this the right time and place for that thinking that teachingIf its not let it go for the time beingLike right now this is the right time and place to stay focused on the breath bringing all your attention to how you can get the mind to settle down hereAnd as long as that skill hasnt been mastered that should be your top priorityOther issues can waitMeditation is largely training in how to handle pleasure and painWe need this training because we tend to abuse these thingsWhen pain comes along we try to push it awayWhen pleasure comes we like to wallow in itAnd pushing away and wallowing are not really all that productive of any genuine happiness any genuine wellbeingWhen you push the pain away you dont get to know itYou dont get to understand itAs a result you never really get away from itNo matter how hard you push it keeps coming back coming backIts like having a delinquent childYou dont like him in the house and so you push him out of the houseAnd of course that brings on more trouble to you because of what your child has done when hes out of the houseOur abuse of pleasure is a different kind of problemWe want to have it all the time and yet we dont look after itWe just wallow in it and then it turns into something elseAjaan Suwat had an image for thisHe said its like being a water buffaloWater buffaloes like to drink nice clean waterBut when they get a nice puddle of clean water what do they doThey lie in itThey piss in itThey wallow around in it and get it all muddyAs a result they dont have the clean clear water they wantedIn other words the pleasure we gain when we meditate can be used for developing an even higher pleasure a genuine nourishment for the mind to keep us going to keep our meditation work well nourishedYet as soon as we gain a little bit of pleasure we dont want to use it as a basis for any kind of workWe just want to wallow in itThe mind begins to drift away and then weve destroyed our meditation because weve abused the pleasureSo its important that you understand the proper way to approach both pleasure and pain in the meditationThat way you can get genuine benefits from them because they are both noble truthsWhen pain arises think of it This is the first noble truth When the pleasure arises from being settled in the breath thats part of the fourth noble truth right concentration a factor of the pathBut we dont use it as a pathWe just lie in itAnd you know what happens when you lie down in pathsIf its a forest path youre bound to get run over by an elephant or whatever large animal uses the pathIf its a paved road you get run over by trucks and carsThe path is to be followed to be developedThats what you do with this kind of pleasure You learn how to develop itAs for the pain you learn to comprehend itThat means in the beginning  say as a pain arises in the knee or in your back  youve got to strengthen the mind give it a sense of ease and wellbeing so that it doesnt feel threatened by the painThis is where the pleasure from the meditation can show one of its usesYou try to develop a sense of ease with the breathOnce youve got that sense of ease going you dont wallow in itAs the Buddha says once theres a sense of pleasure and rapture coming from getting the mind secluded from its unskillful thinking you allow that sense of pleasure and rapture to permeate the entire body to suffuse the entire bodyNow that requires a little work and a fair amount of alertnessHow do you allow that pleasure to spread without squeezing it out of existenceYou have to learn how to develop just the right touchThis is one way of discovering whether your meditation is too clamped downIf you clamp down on the object of the meditation its not going to produce the sense of ease you wantOr if you try to force the ease through the body its just going to destroy the ease and make things worseSo how do you allow it to spreadJust pose that question in the mind and see what answers you can come up withAnd you want it to fill the whole bodyAs the Buddha said its like having a pile of flour  or in his image a pile of bath powderIn those days youd take bath powder and knead water into it to make a lump like dough that you would then rub over your bodyTo mix the water with the bath powder you had to knead the water through the powder in such a way that every part of the ball of bath powder was saturated with water but it didnt dripSo how do you saturate the whole body with pleasureThat requires a lot of alertness alert to the whole bodyThis is why the Buddha says in the beginning of his breath meditation instruction that you watch when the breath is long and when its shortThen you try to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in the whole body as you breathe out so that when the pleasure arises you can allow it to spread through the whole bodyIf theres any sense of blockage you try to knead the pleasure through that blockageThis is very different from wallowing in the pleasureWhen you wallow in the pleasure as they say in Thai you close your ears and close your eyes and just dive right inYoure not taking care of the pleasureYoure not doing any work at allAnd because youre not doing any work the effort that was required to keep that pleasure going disappearsIn the meantime youve probably lost focus and drifted into a delusive stateSo you need to establish a very large frame of reference the whole body breathing in the whole body breathing outThis is where you become more sensitive to the breath energies in the body the flow of energy down the back or sometimes up the back down the legs or sometimes up the legsThese things really vary from person to personYou find that conceiving of the breath energy in different ways helps to modulate the breathing so that it feels good just right for what you need right nowWhen it feels good in one spot you think of it spreading out in whichever way is the most comfortable to fill the whole body so that youre surrounded with breath energy  behind you in front of you above you below youThe whole body is saturated with a sense of ease and wellbeing with the fullness of raptureNow you want to do this early on in the meditation period because allowing the breath energy to flow in this way helps to eliminate a lot of the potentials for pain in the body the pain that comes from focusing down too hard from sitting in an unbalanced posture or from closing off certain energies in the body to focus more strongly on the spot you want to highlightYou can avoid those problems by thinking whole body all from the very beginning all the way through the inbreath all the way through the outThat in and of itself can help prevent a lot of painsWhen I was first meditating at Wat Asokaram wed have hourandahalf sitsId usually find that after the first half an hour or so thered be pains in my legBut then I realized that up to that point I hadnt been doing much work in spreading the breath spreading the pleasure from the breathingSo as a way of heading those pains off beforehand the first thing Id do right from the very beginning of the session would be to think of the whole body of the breath flowing through the whole bodyThat helped to eliminate a lot of the painsSo while youre sitting here dont think of how long youre going to be sitting hereThink of the work youve got to do right nowWhen theres a sense of ease in the breathing  and the breathing does become a lot easier when youre thinking of the whole body because youve begun to get sensitive to areas where youve tensed up to breathe in or to push the breath out  you can allow the various parts of the body to relaxThen you do your best to maintain that sense of fullbody awareness and relaxationIt does have a tendency to shrink so you have to fight thatThink whole body all the way with the inbreath whole body all the way with the outThats the work you do in the pleasureWhen the pleasure arises you have something to do with itThis also helps when the breath gets more and more refinedIt will come to a point where its going to stop  not because youve forced it to stop but simply because all the breath energies in the body are so full and so well connected that they nourish one anotherYoure thinking less so less oxygen is being turned into carbon dioxide in your bodyAt the same time the carbon dioxide going out the pores is enough to keep the blood in balance so the brains instinctive reading of the level of carbon dioxide in the blood allows the breath to grow more and more stillWhen its still youre really going to need this fullbody awareness not to lose track of thingsThats how you make proper use of the pleasureWhatever sense of ease comes from the breath you allow it to suffuse the bodyAgain you dont force itJust think of everything opening up to allow the pleasure to flow inThis puts you in a really good position if any pains come up because the duty with regard to pain is not to push it away not to make it go awayThe duty with regard to pain remember is to comprehend itAnd the first thing youve got to realize is that whenever theres any pain or stress there are two kindsTheres the simple pain and stress that comes from the three characteristicsIn other words anything thats fabricated like the body or the mind  any of the khandhas or aggregates  is going to involve some stress simply by virtue of the fact that its fabricatedThats part of the natural order of thingsBut theres also a deeper stress a deeper pain that comes from cravingThats stress and pain in the four noble truthsAnd thats not necessaryIn Ajaan Lees phrase the pains in the body are natural painsThe pains caused by craving are unnaturalWe create them  and yet we dont have toThats what you need to learn how to seeWhy do you create these kinds of painsBecause you like to feed on your pleasuresBut when youre feeding on your pleasures youre going to run into pains as wellAnd because youre in feeding mode you start feeding on the pain too and thats unpleasantSo you want to watch Why is the mind feeding on these thingsYou want to develop a sense of what the Buddha calls nibbida which can be translated as disenchantment but also as disgust or distaste for these thingsIn other words you want to stop feeding to lose your appetite for feedingThats different from pushing them awayWhen you push them away you dont really understand the difference between the natural pain in the body and the unnecessary suffering or stress in the mindYou want to keep on feeding but youve got something bad in your mouth so you indiscriminately try to spit it right outAnd often you cant for its a big glob stuck in your throatYou have to learn how to watch these things to make the necessary distinctionsThis is why that sense of ease and wellbeing from the concentration is an important tool an important helpmate in the path because it allows you not to feel threatened by the painThe pain may be there but youve got something else you can focus onAnd one of the things you can do once youve got this fullbody awareness going together with a sense of the breath energy flowing throughout the whole body is to allow the breath to spread through the pain so the pain isnt a wall say in your leg or in your back or in your hipIts porousAnd the breath comes first so the pain cant stop itTheres often a subconscious reaction that perceives the pain as a wall that can block the breathWhen theres a pain you tend to close off that part of the body when you breatheAnd because its squeezed off it doesnt participate in the breathOf course that makes things worseYou allow the pain to restrict your breath energySo you want to reconceive the breath energy as permeating that part of the body prior to the painIts there first so the pain cant block itHold that possibility in mindKeep that foremost so that youre not just reacting to the pain but are actually more proactive in helping to direct the breath energy through the area occupied by the painThis can help loosen up the pain and allow you to feel less threatened by itSometimes the pain will actually go awayIf it doesnt go away you can still watch What does the pain do as you breathe through itHow does it moveHow does it changeWhat are the momentary pain sensationsAre they all pain sensationsOr were you labeling them pain in ignoranceWhat happens when you label them simply as sensationsWhere is the worst spot of the painHow bad is itIs it so bad you cant stand itUsually when you get interested and more proactive with the pain like this instead of simply being on the receiving end you find that the pain is a lot more tolerableThats because youre not just sitting there drinking in the pain or eating up the painYouve gone from feeding mode to investigating modeYoure probing chasing the pain down from a position of strength based on the breathYou can start seeing distinctionsWhats the difference between the physical pain and the mental painWhats the distinction between the physical pain and the bodyWhats the distinction between the mental pain and your awareness of the mental painWe tend to glom these things together but thats because we dont understand themWeve been pushing them away so we push them into one big globBut as you allow them to open up you begin to see that these things are differentThe sensations of the body are earth wind water and firePain is something other than those four thingsSo when pain seems to have taken over your knee try to ferret out which are the pain sensations and which are the knee sensationsFocus on distinguishing among the earth sensations the fire sensations water sensations and the breath sensations in the kneeWhen you can sort them out you see exactly whats left to be the actual painYou see that these are all different thingsThey dont have to be glommed togetherThis is where thinking of the breath as primary  as prior to the pain rather than something that can be squeezed out by the pain  is very helpfulEarth water wind and fire were there firstThe pain came laterKeep that in mindIt helps you separate the pain out from the legAs youre engaging in this analysis youre feeling less and less on the receiving end or on the eating end and more in a position of simply probing to understandThen you apply the same principle to the mind and the mental painTheres the awareness and theres the awareness of the painThen theres the pain itselfTry to sort these things outAgain which came firstThe awareness was firstThe pain is visitingDont let the pain take priorityKeep your awareness your perception of your awareness in a position of priorityWhen you do this youre learning how to use both pleasure and pain in the right wayYoure not abusing the pleasureYoure not abusing the painYoure gaining experience in developing the duties of the four noble truthsYoure developing the path and youre comprehending the pain to the point where you develop dispassion for itIt may seem strange to say that were ordinarily passionate for our pains but we do allow the mind to get colored by them as pain in the body becomes anguish in the mindIf something has the mind upset causing it anguish thats a kind of passion a kind of coloring of the mindAnd its not necessarySo weve got to learn new habits in the way we approach pleasure and pain so that the pleasure isnt simply an end in and of itself and the pain isnt pushed away as an enemyYou put the pleasure to use so that you can comprehend the painOnly when you actively try to comprehend the pain can you can go beyond itOnly when you put the pleasure to use can you can go beyond itAs Ajaan Lee said that becomes the point where you stop bothering them because youve got something better than conditioned pleasures something better than painAnd thats when everyone has their freedomThe pain has its freedomThe pleasure has its freedomAnd you have your freedomSo try to keep these points in mindAjaan Lee often made the point that when youre focused on the breath you dont have just the first frame of reference or the first foundation of mindfulnessYou have all four right thereThe breath is the body in and of itselfThats the first frame of referenceThe feelings of pleasure or pain that youre encountering as you deal with the breath count as feelings in and of themselvesThats the secondAs for the mind state youre trying to develop you find that its either defiled or notOr as you get further into this third frame of reference you start noticing when the mind is concentrated or when its not when its expanded or enlarged or when its not whether its released or not whether its ever been excelled or notAnd then theres the fourth frame of reference the dhammasOften we dont have a real handle on how to make use of that fourth frame of reference because it looks like little more than a list of Dhamma teachingsBut its much more than thatIts a list of different ways you can look at problems that come up in the course of your practiceYou can look at things in terms of the five hindrances the five clingingaggregates the six sense media the seven factors for awakening or the four noble truthsEach of these lists provides a useful framework for looking at whats actually going on in different aspects of the practiceAnd not just looking They also give you guidance in what to doThese are not exercises in bare awareness because each of the different members of the list carries a specific dutyOnce youve figured out whats happening in terms of that particular framework you know what to do in responseYou know what to do proactivelyFor instance as were going through daily life one of the main issues in practice is restraint of the sensesThis is an area where its good to use the framework of the six sense mediaAs the Buddha said in this context when youre looking try to notice Where is the fetter in the lookingIf youre listening where is the fetter in the listeningAnd the fetter here is defined as a sense of passion and delight for what youre looking at or for why youre lookingIts not always the case that a sense of delight comes up after youve noticed somethingSometimes you have a very clear idea of what you want to look for You want to get riled up about something you want to get attracted by something so you go looking for itThis is especially true with thoughtsNotice when a thought comes up Whats the appeal of this thoughtWhy do I go for this particular kind of thinking Once youve looked at the appeal then look at the drawbacksWhat are the drawbacks of going along with that kind of thinkingIf you gave that particular kind of thinking free rein in your mind where would it lead youIf you notice a fetter  in other words you really are delighting in something to the point where it pulls you away from your center  dont just sit there and say Oh Im fettered and leave it at thatYouve got to do something to cut the fetter  because those fetters are the cause of suffering which means that your duty with regard to them is to abandon them as soon as you notice themOf course the big problem here is that we often enjoy our fettersWe actually create them for the purpose of enjoying themSo we have to do something we usually dont like to do to look at our enjoyment and see where its causing problemsIt may seem pleasant and entertaining right now but where is it going to take you down the lineSo thats a framework you can use as you go through the dayAnd you can use it during your meditation as wellYoure sitting here focusing on the breath and all of a sudden your mind is off on something you saw last week something you read yesterday or something youre anticipating tomorrowLook for the fetterWhere is the sense of passionWhere is the sense of delight in that particular thinkingWhat can you do to see through it to pry yourself away from that enjoymentAs the Buddha noted the best thing is to pull yourself away from these unskillful ways of thinking and to encourage harmless ways of thinking insteadFrom there you direct the mind into concentrationThis is where the two frameworks of the hindrances and the factors for awakening become usefulWhen you sit down and try to get the mind concentrated its useful to figure out exactly Whats going on hereWhich hindrance is bedeviling me right now Once youre able to classify a disturbance as sensual desire ill will torpor and lethargy restlessness and anxiety or uncertainty then you know what to do with itAnd sometimes just recognizing it as the problem gets you over the humpThis is because one of the characteristics of the hindrances is that they deceive youWhen desire arises your mind is usually already on the side of the desireYou dont see it as a problemThe thing you desire really is something desirableWhen you have ill will for somebody that person really is awfulWhen the mind is torpid well its time to get some restIts time to sleepThe mind is getting too tiredAnd so on down the lineYou have to learn to see these things as genuine hindrances as real obstacles on your path and not be fooled into siding with themAsk yourself What is this hindering me from Well for one thing its hindering you from learning about the potentials of concentrationYou sit here rehashing your old ways of thinking and will never get out of your old rutsWe read about the ajaans about the people in the Canon who gained strong states of concentrationWe read about the descriptions of concentrationBut whats the reality of concentrationExactly what do those words correspond toIf you spend all your time playing around with the hindrances you never get to knowThe only way to gain direct knowledge of these things is to bring some appropriate attention to the hindrance seeing that its a cause of sufferingTry to look for where the stress is look where the limitation is to see how that hindrance is squandering your energyAnd then look for ways to abandon itWhen you do this youre developing the first three factors for awakening mindfulness analysis of qualities and persistenceMindfulness is what helps you remember to look for whats skillful and unskillful analysis of qualities  which is nurtured by appropriate attention  is what enables you to recognize skillful and unskillful qualities as they arise and persistence is what carries through with the desire to develop the skillful and abandon the unskillful onesAnalysis of qualities actually helps you in many waysIt not only recognizes whats skillful and not but also helps you figure out how to undercut an unskillful state of mind like a hindrance and how to develop the remaining factors for awakening in its placeAs a set these seven factors for awakening are a good framework for understanding how to get the mind to settle downIn particular you look to see that these factors are balancedIf theyre not how do you bring them into balanceTheres a sutta that compares this balancing act to getting a fire to burn at just the right level of intensityIn other words youre trying to develop the fire of concentration the fire of jhana a steady flame of centered awarenessSometimes it looks like its about to go out because the level of energy is too lowIn cases like that you dont want to emphasize qualities like serenity or concentration or equanimityYou want to emphasize more active qualitiesGet the mind moving againAnalyze things as to whats skillful and unskillful and then put in whatever effort is needed to get rid of the unskillful qualities and develop the skillful onesIn taking this more active role you can develop a strong sense of rapture refreshment as the skillful qualities get strengthenedThis further energizes the mindIf on the other hand your mind is too active thats when you try to calm it downGo for serenityGet the mind to focus on easing the breath calming the breath down working through tension in the body until the mind gets more solid and can come to a state of equanimity and equipoiseSo again these frameworks of the five hindrances and the seven factors for awakening are not just guidelines for bare awarenessTheyre frameworks telling you what to do if you find yourself facing a particular type of mind state as youre trying to bring the mind to strong concentrationThey help you get a sense of what your duty is where you can find the path out of that particular unbalanced or unskillful stateOr if you find that youre balanced and the mind is doing fine then your duty is to maintain itYou dont just say Oh thats what concentration is like and just let it dropYou try to keep it going you try to understand what causes it so that you can maintain itThis is where you try to bring in an element of will powerA couple of years back I was talking to a group of people in training to become vipassana teachersI was mentioning just this element of trying to keep the mind steady and one of them said Well it sounds like youre talking about using willpower but I know that thats not what you mean And I said Thats precisely what I mean The element of intention is willpower and its something youve got to use in the practiceBut you cant use just strength of will to get things doneYou also have to use your understanding of cause and effect so that your use of willpower is a skillful use of your willThis is what the categories of the fourth frame of reference are forTheyre there to help give you guidance once a particular state comes up in the mind as to what youve got to do if you really want to find true happinessIn other words theyre not just instructions in how to respond to situationsTheyre also instructions in how to take a proactive role in giving rise to the pathThis is even clearer in the categories of the four noble truthsYou analyze things first in terms of the first noble truth  the five clingingaggregates  to understand wheres the stress here wheres the suffering here where and how youre clinging to these thingsIn particular you want to learn how to identify each of the clingingaggregates  form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness  as events activities to see what spurs them into action and how they stopThen you try to notice how youre clinging to them how you keep compulsively repeating themThen you take your clinging apartIf somethings disturbing your concentration take it apart in terms of these five clingingaggregates Wheres the clingingWhat kind of clinging is itIs it sensual clingingIs it clinging in terms of habits and practicesViewsIdeas of what you are or what belongs to youTry to comprehend it  which after all is the duty with regard to the first noble truthOnce youve comprehended the suffering you should be able to see where its cause isWhats causing you to clingWheres the cravingTry to catch it happeningWhen you can catch it happening the duty there is to abandon itAs for whatever aspects of the path that can help you see these things you develop them all eight factors of the path and particularly right concentrationThis is where you get proactiveWhen youve mastered concentration the framework of the five clingingaggregates comes in againWhen all the factors of the path are in a good state of balance you start analyzing the concentration in terms of the five aggregates to see where it too is stressfulEven the equanimity of the fourth jhana has its element of stressYouve got to look for that so you can develop dispassion all aroundThis is why when youve mastered concentration its useful to take these states of concentration apart in these waysWhere is feeling playing a role thereWheres the perceptionWhere are the thought fabricationsWheres the consciousness of thisWhich aspect are you clinging toCan you see the drawbacks of that clingingIts helpful here to look in terms of the three perceptions  or of any of the perceptions that help to develop a sense of dispassionYou look for the inconstancyOnce youve perceived the inconstancy you look to see that thats stressfulWhen you see the stress you realize that it cant possibly be a happiness youd like to claim as your ownOr you learn to perceive the aggregates that make up your concentration as empty a disease a woundThere must be something betterThis line of perceiving this approach is what finally gets you past all your attachments and brings you to something really solid something unfabricatedAt that point you can put even these strategic perceptions down for theyve done their workYouve been carrying out these skillful duties to arrive at something that doesnt carry a dutyAs Ajaan Mun once said nibbana carries no duty for the mind at allEach of the four noble truths entails a duty but nibbana is something beyond the four noble truths something outside of the framework of the four frames of reference and their attendant dutiesIts not an activity in any waySo its helpful to look at this fourth frame of reference as a series of guidelinesWhen a problem comes up figure out which framework is useful for analyzing where you are in the practice and for pointing the practice in the direction you want to goLearn to see whats going on in your mind in terms of these frameworks so you can figure out what to do whats the duty hereThis helps you to step back from just being in your thought worlds in a way that allows you to take them apart in terms of their elements the events and activities that put them togetherThis in turn gives you a much better idea of what to do with them instead of what you have been doing which has been to cling to them and sufferThis is how you take apart this big mass of suffering in the mindIf you learn how to take it apart you really see its not a solid mountain of rockIts just a pile of gravelAnd each little piece of gravel is not all that heavyYou can deal with it much more easily as a piece of gravel than as part of a solid mass of rockSo try to familiarize yourself with these different frameworks and youll get a much better handle on how to deal with the problems of the mindAjaan Fuang once stated that there are two kinds of people in the world those who think too much and those who dont think enoughHe was referring specifically to concentration practice but his statement applies to other areas of the practice as wellWhen some people come to the practice they want to be told what to do and they dont want to have to think about itThey want a series of instructions that they can follow   and then at the end of the list theyll be guaranteed resultsThat of course places all the responsibility on the teacherIf the results dont come then the teacher was wrongIt was the teachers fault not the studentsAt the same time the attitude of not wanting to think turns many areas of the practice into ritual things where you simply go through the motionsYou do it because youre told to do it and thats all you knowFor Westerners studying with other Westerners in Thailand this is especially dangerousThey do something because their teacher says Well the Thais say to do it but its just the Thai way of doing things When they hear that they naturally hold back a part of their mind saying to themselves When I get home Im not going to do it their wayIm going to do it my way Its like that image of the elephant in the suttasHe charges into the battle but he holds back his trunkHes going through the motions of fighting but hes not really giving himself over to the battleThats one extremeThe other extreme is not so much thinking too much its thinking in the wrong way trying to figure things out beforehand so you dont have to go through the practiceIn other words you assume either that the Buddha didnt know what he was talking about or that he was playing a trick on us and that the whole point of the practice is to figure out the trickHe talks about the unconditioned but then he describes a conditioned path  this obviously cant be true there must be a trick or He talks about putting an end to desire but how can you do that without desiring to end desireThere must be a trick Or so the thinking goesIn other words you try to figure out the path without doing it as an excuse for not doing it and you think that youre cleverA similar comment can be made about scholars who want to have the final word on the right interpretation of the texts without really doing the practice themselvesThey know all the definitionsThey know all the words in the booksThey get established as authorities but without any direct knowledge of what the words are talking aboutThats thinking too much thinking in the wrong wayThe proper attitude is one that Ajaan Lee shows in his autobiographyHe mentions that when he first heard about eating only one meal a day or going into the forest to practice it didnt make any sense to himWhy would you want to go into the forestIts uncomfortable dangerousWouldnt the practice be easier in the village in more civilized surroundingsBut he said everywhere you looked in the texts the Buddha kept recommending going into the forest going into the wildernessSo Ajaan Lee gave it a tryHe took the Buddha at his wordThis meant that when he went out into the forest he didnt simply sit there and say Okay nowShow me the results He started looking around and thinking about what might be good about staying in the forestWhy would this be good for the practiceAnd in the course of living there he came up with lots of his own answersOn the one hand its quiet and you have a lot more time for yourselfBut its also dangerous and in the midst of the dangers you realize youve got to depend on the Dhamma to get you through your particular fears your particular anxieties the dangers the boredom the restlessnessYou have no alternative things to fall back on so you find yourself committing yourself more and more to the Dhamma as your refugeTheres a great passage in the Theragatha where a monk out in the forest is sickHe says to himself So here I am  sickWhat am I going to doAm I going to go back and find a doctor And his answer is No Im going to depend on the seven factors for awakening and the five strengths to fortify my mind Thats how he gets wellIn the case of the ajaans in Thailand there are many stories of their encountering tigers in the forest and realizing that their only defense was mettaSo they developed very strong metta for the tigers expanding their mastery of metta by really taking refuge in itThis is how they developed their skill in the practiceGoing into the forest going into the wilderness really forces you to hold onto the Dhamma in ways that you wouldnt have to when you live in comfortable surroundingsAjaan Lee learned this one through experience and two through thinking about itThis is how you understand the Buddhas teachings both putting them into practice and thinking about them as you put them into practiceYou take the Buddha at his word but then you also try to figure out Why did he recommend thisWhats good about this practiceWhat are the reasons behind itDuring my time with Ajaan Fuang there were times when he would explain things especially when it was obvious that this farang was pretty clueless on those particular mattersBut he also commented once that If I have to explain everything to you Ill die Which meant of course that it was up to me to try to figure things out  going on the assumption that yes there must be reasons for this even though no I dont yet know what they areOnce you have that conviction then you start looking for why this is a good practice how its a useful practiceYou start figuring things outYou understandThis is how understanding comes from conviction as in the list of the five strengths The list starts with conviction and then goes through persistence mindfulness and concentration to discernmentIf youre convinced that there are reasons for these practices youve taken the first stepThen you stick with themAnd its through sticking with them that in the activity itself you begin to see the good resultsYou start connecting cause and effectThats how conviction gives rise to discernmentAn ajaan I know in Thailand once commented on thisHe said Notice that the list of strengths doesnt start with perceptions or ideas or conceptsIt starts with conviction Its like being in a forestIf when youre lost in the forest youre convinced that theres a way out you have the chance to find itIf youre convinced theres no way out youre doomedYoure going to give up and that closes the doorSo conviction leads to ingenuityAnd ingenuity allows you to test different hypotheses as you practiceWhich means that as youre working with the breath here remember that its not just in out in outTheres more to the breathAnd the ways of working with the breath energy are not limited to the ones listed in the booksYou can get some tips from the booksThey can offer ideas of approaches you might not have thought of otherwiseBut its also good to try to figure out your own approaches so that you can come to your own understandingThe things you understand through having figured them out stick with you for a long time much longer than things youve simply heardSo we take the Buddha at his wordThere is a path a conditioned path and it leads to the unconditionedHow does it do thatYou give it a try and see what gets stirred up in your mind as you try to develop concentration mindfulness and all the other factors of the pathSometimes the practice seems to stir up a lot more dust  well thats a good thingIf it didnt stir up the dust you wouldnt have known the dust was thereBut the next question is how do you deal with the dustHow do you use the teachings to deal with that dustAs the Buddha once said everything you really need to know for the practice is there in the wings to awakeningSo try to figure out which of the various lists is applicable to what youre going through right nowOr if youre dealing specifically with problems with concentration as Ajaan Fuang once noted all the issues in breath meditation are contained in the seven steps at the beginning of Ajaan Lees Method TwoIf youre convinced that thats the case and yet the problem isnt obviously mentioned in those seven steps what variations can you play on those stepsWhat are some of the implications of those steps that could apply to your particular problemAs you explore these implications youll find that theres a lot more to them than appears on the surfaceAnd thats an important part of understanding the Dhamma trying to figure out the implications through experimenting learning how to take a few basic principles and work out their ramifications so they speak directly to the problem youre facing right nowIn this way you discover that they mean a lot more than you might have thoughtIts a process of trial and errorSometimes youll come up with ideas that just simply dont work outWell thats important to knowIts something you can learn only from the practiceThis is how the thinking and the acting go togetherIts the kind of thinking thats good thinkingIf the thinking and the acting stick close together then even when you think an awful lot it doesnt become too muchAs Ajaan Fuang once noted Ajaan Lee was a very curious person very inquisitiveHe once commented that if Ajaan Lee had met me he probably would have spent a lot of time picking my brain asking questions learning whats taught in a modern university educationThats the kind of person who discovered this breath meditation method were following curious inquisitiveHaving that same attitude allows us to take the method and run with it to see how far it can goSo try to develop this attitude to all aspects of the practice from the way we clean things in the monastery on up Theres a reason why we do it that wayAnd the best way to figure out the reason behind it is to do itYou take the Buddha at his word in this way but youre also very frank about your doubts and you honestly try to resolve any conflict between the twoThats how things become clearTheyve conducted experiments where they put people under hypnosis and tell them that when they get out of hypnosis theyll do something at a certain signalAnd sure enough they come out of hypnosis and at the signal they do it  they climb a ladder wave a hand or whateverWhen theyre asked Why did you do that theyll give explanationsI wanted to do X I wanted to do Y The people running the experiments have claimed that this is proof that people have no free will that our idea of free will is an illusion because the decision was made much earlier and under much different circumstances from what the people claimedWell it doesnt necessarily prove thatIt also just might be the case that most of us  and especially people who are easy to hypnotize  are very ignorant of our own intentionsWhen you allowed yourself to be put under hypnosis that was an intention part of your mind under hypnosis agreed to follow the ordersIf you were harder to hypnotize it might not have agreedIt might have maintained its conscious power of choiceFrom the standpoint of the Buddhas teachings thats the interpretation worth pursuing that we do have free will and yet were very ignorant of our intentionsA large part of the purpose of the practice is to learn how to understand what it means to have an intention to make a choiceIts in those little moments where we exercise freedom of choice that the path to the freedom from suffering liesThe best way to learn about intentions is to try to set up a constant intention and see what happens to itLike right now Make up your mind to stay with the breath and see how long you can do itYou may find that you can stick with it pretty well or that youre suddenly off someplace else and you dont know whyWell you go back to the breath againYou do this over and over and after a while you begin to realize that youve got to expect that there will be a disturbance there will be a distractionYouve got to prepare for thatThe mind will change its mindA new intention will come in and take overYouve got to learn how to observe that process to begin detecting the little signals that the mind has changed its mind and yet still pretends to be staying with the breathNevertheless its ready to goThe briefest lapse of mindfulness and then its goneAnd you wonder How could that happen in such a brief momentWell it wasnt just that one brief momentThe decision had already been made but it was buriedSo now youre warnedYou want to start detecting that decision uncovering all the layers of ignorance and delusion that covered it upAs you do this youll run into other intentions that like to keep it covered upSo therell be a battle insideOne mind but there are a lots of minds to it lots of opinions lots of intentionsThe only way youre going to uncover these things is to try to stick with one intention as long as possibleThis begins with the intention to put an end to sufferingAnd thats based on the conviction that its possible to do itConviction starts with conviction in the Buddhas awakening that he did find the end of suffering and he did it through developing powers of his mindAnd they werent powers peculiar to him they were powers anybody could developThis is an important form of conviction because it gives you the impetus to get on the pathYou say He could do it so can I You need to maintain that beliefSo the knowledge of the Dhamma that you start out with is not really knowledgeIts a conviction a belief  an untested hypothesis that youre going to testBut you decide its worth testingIts like being a scientistThere are lots of different hypotheses or theories a scientist could test but the scientist has to focus on testing the ones that seem most promisingWhich ones are going to be worthwhile which ones will teach you something useful if you prove them true or falseIf you decide that the idea that suffering can be put to an end is worth testing it gives you the impetus to start testing the Buddhas teachings in practiceIt also gives you a rudimentary experience of whats called yoniso manasikara or appropriate attention focusing on the issue of suffering as having paramount importanceWe could focus on lots of other issues in life the economy the weather the environment this persons ideas that persons preferences  lots of different things we could choose to focus on as being importantBut appropriate attention starts with the conviction that suffering is the important problem and there must be a solution to itThis form of attention is not really knowledge yet its a conviction but its focusing you on a particular problemYouve chosen this one as the one most worth exploring most worth trying to solveThats why we meditate because part of the solution to suffering lies in developing certain qualities of mind such as mindfulness alertness concentrationTo develop these qualities you need convictionWhen mindfulness lapses you dont have to debate with yourself as to whether its worth wandering off after that distractionYour conviction tells you No its best to get back back to the breathAnd that decision is based on the conviction that you should develop right effortYou start generating the desire to want to do thisPeople often think that the Buddha gave desire bad press but he actually gave it a central role in the pathIts right there in right effort Generate desire to give rise to skillful qualities generate desire to abandon unskillful onesIn other words the best way to do this is to get yourself to want to do it so that its not just a mechanical process of following somebodys ordersYou have to find ways of encouraging yourself and inspiring yourself on the pathThats how you develop your wisdom how you develop your discernment motivating yourself to realize that this really is a worthwhile project to pursueEven though lots of people might say What could you possibly learn by just focusing on the breath you realize that staying focused here exercises your mindfulness your concentration your discernment all the qualities youre going to need to solve this problem of sufferingThese are the qualities that allow you to test the Buddhas claim that by solving the problem of suffering you solve the biggest problem in lifeYou actually arrive at the deathless a happiness that doesnt change that lies outside of space and timeIts quite a claim but you can think about what life would be like if there were no happiness lying outside of space and timeWhatever you gained youd have to lose it youd gain it again youd lose it againWhat real satisfaction is there in thatBut heres the Buddha someone who seems reasonable claiming that it is possible to find a happiness that doesnt have to depend on conditionsAnd its up to you to decide Do you want to make the effort to explore that possibilitySo you sit down and focus on your breath to develop the qualities of mind needed to test that claimThats the beginning of appropriate attentionIts based on a choice you make  and a choice you have to keep on making because its so easy to fall off the pathIt can be a long pathIt requires a lot of disciplineIt requires persistence patience  qualities that we in the modern world tend to have in only minimal amountsSo its very easy to give upYou need to keep on generating that desire keep on reminding yourself why youre hereYoure here to learn about the potentials in the mind How far toward true happiness can these potentials goOur belief that this is an important hypothesis to test calls for an interesting combination of skepticism and convictionBut its only through that kind of questioning choosing a question you think is important and examining it again and again that knowledge is attainedAnd particularly as you develop these qualities you begin to understand more and more what it is to make a choiceWhere exactly do you make those choicesYou begin to realize that there are many many layers of choice going on in the mindA lot of our explanations as to why we did something are pretty wide of the markTheyre simplified narratives we create after the fact without really observing these things as they actually happenThis is why the Buddha places so much emphasis on alertness the quality of noticing whats going on as its going onHe talks about observing craving the cause of sufferingYou have to see it right there where its happening to perceive exactly what the choice is where it was made and why it was madeYou can do that only if you stay very close to the present momentThis is why the breath is such an ideal topic for meditationIts always right here in the present momentIts right here where the mind and the body meetWhen youre here youre much more likely to see your intentions as theyre being made the choices as theyre being madeBut this requires a lot of sensitivity which is why it requires timeYou have to keep coming back coming back coming back looking deeper and deeper developing stronger and stronger powers of concentration mindfulness alertness getting the mind really still so that it can detect even the slightest movements within itThe going may seem slow but dont let that be a deterrentThe process is gradual for everyoneEven though it seems to be taking a long time and a lot of effort remind yourself that the Buddha himself had to pursue it for a long time had to put in a lot of effortBut when he arrived at the goal he said that it was more than worth the effortAnd so you think about that possibility that through understanding your intentions you can find something that lies beyond intention that through exploring your freedom of choice from moment to moment you can find a freedom beyond moments beyond time altogetherSo keep looking at the choices you make Exactly when do you make them how do you make them where do you make themTry to see as precisely as possibleIts right around the area of intention that there lies the opening to freedomAfter all what is a choiceThere is a little moment of freedom right there where you can choose X or Y but we usually dont take full advantage of itOur choices tend to be very very conditioned by past ideas past beliefs past habitsBecause were not paying full attention we just go along with our old ways of doing thingsSo we dont really appreciate the freedom that lies exactly where that choice is and the way its madeAn important part of mindfulness is to decondition yourselfThe Buddha said just look at the breath look at the body in and of itself putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world  in other words putting aside your old habits of thinking about the world out therePut aside your old ways of using your eyes and ears and nose tongue body and mind to focus on issues outside there in the world to get your knowledge about the world to figure out how to gain what you want out of the world  and of course getting complacent and careless when you get what you want and upset when you dont and trying to find new ways of getting itNow we want to use our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind for other purposes just to see the processes of the senses as they happen in and of themselvesLook at them in a way that highlights the movements of the mind how the mind makes a choice and how it enforces that choice how it justifies that choice to itselfAll these processes are going on all the time but we usually dont look at them because our attention is focused somewhere else far awaySo stay right here at the breath because this is a great place to observe all these other thingsThe Buddha makes a comparison to six kinds of animalsIf you tie them all to leashes and tie the leashes together the animals will all pull in their various directions to feedThe crocodile will want to go down to feed in the river the monkey will want to go climb up to feed in the tree the hyena will want to go to feed in a charnel ground and so onDepending on which animal is the strongest the others get dragged alongBut if you tie them all to an immovable post then no matter how hard they pull they all end up staying right there at the postThe post here is mindfulness immersed in the bodyThe prime way of immersing mindfulness in the body is to be mindful of the breathWhen you stay with the breath you can detect the pull that goes out the eyes ears nose tongue body or mind to past and future to your likes and dislikesBut you dont have to give in to that pull because youve got a place where you can stay grounded and secureThat way you can observe the processes that happen at the eye the ear and all the other senses how a perception arises how the perception turns into a thought and how the thought begins to develop fangs to bite you and make you sufferThese things are all here to be observedTheyre all happening all the timeBut to see them we have to change our focusTo change our focus requires a change of heart telling ourselves that this really is important much more important than things outsideThats what conviction is all aboutAppropriate attention is the change of focus conviction the change of heartYou make up your mind  and your heart  that this is an important issue thats got to be resolved and this is the way to do it training the mind developing these qualities so you can see whats going on in the present more and more clearly and you can uncover all those layers of delusion that cover up your intentions those little spots where theres a potential for freedom that we dont detectSo thats what were looking forTry to keep that as your utmost priority because only through maintaining that sense of priorities can you actually test what the Buddha taught and see if the way out really existsIn Thai they have a term  arahan dib a raw arahant or an uncooked arahant  meaning someone who has read up on the texts has everything all figured out beforehand and then forces his meditation into the mold he learned from the textsWhen hes reached the end of his preconceived notions about where the practice leads okay there he is success in the practiceAs you can imagine raw arahant is not a term of praise or admirationIts a term of derision for the inexperienced person who thinks he can have everything figured out all beforehandTheres another Thai phrase about someone who knows before hes born whos expert before hes even tried his hand Its basically the same ideaWhat were working on here is not a body of facts you can simply memorizedWere working on a skill and where were coming from is ignoranceThis means that although you can get a general sense of this skill beforehand by reading and listening to people talk the actual practice is something youve got to learn to feel your way throughGetting that right feel for the practice is the essence of masteryThe basic principles may apply to everybody but no one else has ever trained your particular mind with its particular problems beforeYoure the one whos going to have to train it by mastering both the principles and the particularsYoure coming from ignorance but youre going to have to learn how to be your own teacherThis means learning how to learn from your particular mistakes Make plans as to what youre going to do do it and then see what happensTry to work with your best intentions from the very beginning  what seems to make the most sense what seems the right thing to do  but be prepared to make adjustments along the wayThis is at the essence of what the Buddha taught Rahula in the sutta I keep referring toAnd I keep referring to it because its so basic and essentialYou cant always know beforehand how the results of your actions are going to turn outSometimes you can anticipate and so you work with your best anticipations but you have to be alert to the fact that your anticipations can sometimes be wrongAnd so the Buddha also teaches you how to deal with the discovery of mistaken anticipations recognizing sometimes while youre doing something that its wrong so you learn to stopOther times you can read the results of your actions only after theyre doneThis requires honesty and integrity and part of the way to learn honesty and integrity is to be willing to confess mistakes when you recognize them to talk them over with someone further along on the pathThis is because your willingness to be open and aboveboard with other people about these things translates into being open and aboveboard about them in your own internal conversationYou develop good habits this wayYour external habits of speaking become part of your internal dialogueSo the practice is a combination of learning what youve picked up from other people taking it to heart and then also realizing that youve got to test itThings may not come out the way you anticipated themThis is part of discernmentIt starts with learning from what youve heard and then thinking it throughReal insight though comes from developing these qualities in the mindIts like going out in the wildernessYou read the maps you make your plans but when you get out in the forest you realize that the forest doesnt look like the mapThe map has splotches of solid pale green with red lines and little symbols on itBut when you look around yourself in the forest you dont see those splotches symbols or linesNow the lines are relevant They symbolize the paths through the forestThey give you a sketchy idea of whats out thereBut you have to realize that theres a lot more out there than just the pale greens and reds of the mapThere are actual trees actual animals actual changes in the lay of the landSo you make plans based on the map but be prepared to throw your plans overboard as you meet up with new and unexpected thingsThis is an important part of the training how to deal with the unexpectedI had a friend back in high school who went into military training and later told me about having to do longdistance running as part of his trainingOne of the things I had hated most about high school physed was longdistance runningItd practically kill meMy worst memories of physed class were having to do a mile run and coming back and getting dizzy throwing up and having to lie there on a bench in the locker room feeling like I was going to dieSo what my friend told me sounded like a horror story Part of his military training was running for a mile with a full pack on his backOf course everybody was anticipating the finish line at the end of the mileBut as they reached the finish line the instructor said Okay one more quartermile As you can imagine there were complaintsBut the instructor said Look when youre engaged in a battle you cant have predetermined lines about this is how far the enemys going to chase you or that youll have to fight only up to five pmYou may have some expectations of how long the battle is going to last but you can never knowYouve got to be prepared for it to last a really long timeAnd youve got to learn how to find the inner resources you can draw on when you get pushed beyond what you think are your limitsThe same holds true in the battle with defilementsYou can never tell when greed is going to come up or how long its going to keep coming back coming backThere are times when lust seems to be really quiet for weeks and months on end but you never know when its going to come back in full strength and you have to be prepared for that possibilitySo learning to deal with uncertainties is an important skill in the practice because youll have to deal with so many uncertainties both inside and outYou need to develop the right attitude the right confidence in your ability to read a situationAnd that kind of confidence comes not through attending selfesteem classesIt comes from actual practice in dealing with situations and over time learning how far your powers of observation can be relied on and where they have to be further sharpenedAjaan Maha Boowa makes the point that when the defilements are named in the books they come in nice neat lists but when they come up in your mind they dont follow the listsThey dont come in the proper orderThey come all pellmell so you have to be ready to deal with them pellmell whatever the order they come inAs in that question the king of Thailand once asked Luang Puu Dune Which defilement do you have to deal with first Luang Puus answer was Whichever one arises first Sometimes there are going to be subtle ones and sometimes blatant onesThey dont line up neatlySo again its good to have names for the defilements to get a sense of what you might be dealing with but be prepared for the fact that a lot of whats going to happen in your mind wont quite be the way its described in the booksAjaan Lee once commented that the ways of the mind are so many that no book on earth could possibly cover them allBut fortunately there are certain basic patterns you learn from and you try applying themThen when youve run through your list of skills and patterns and you find that things are still not working youve got to use your ingenuity and try new approachesThis is why one of the worst attitudes you can have as a meditator is to hope that some ajaan is going to come and tell you to do X and thats all you have to doYou dont have to think about it just do X X X X X obey his instructions and youre guaranteed to come out right at the endThats placing all the responsibility on the ajaan and none on yourselfYouve got to be willing to be responsible to experiment to try different approaches and to learn how to read the resultsThats the skill in the meditationAnd thats how you develop discernmentThis comes from being willing to put yourself in uncertain situations to have an adventure and not just an itineraryThink of the itineraries on those cruises that go through the islands of the Alaskan panhandlePeople basically stay in a floating hotel and what kind of experience do they haveThey get off at the different ports where theyre thronged with guides vying to give them prepackaged predigested experiences of the shrinkwrapped Alaskan wildThen they come back home with their experience packages but without having learned anything newThey didnt develop any skillsThey just paid to be given a showThats what itineraries are likeAn adventure though is when youre willing to put yourself in an uncertain situation and to learn from the uncertaintiesThats the only way youre going to gain real insightThats why the Buddha taught that there are three levels of discernment the levels of understanding that come from listening from thinking and from developing qualities in the mindOnly in the actual developing do you begin to get an intuitive sense a real feel say of what mindfulness is like of what alertness is like of what they can doYou may already know something about these qualities in their potential form but as they grow they can branch out in unexpected waysThey can open up and connect to other qualities in the mind as wellSo theres always an element of uncertainty in the practice that requires your own active participation in taking what youve learned and adjusting it to training the particulars of your mindBecause as I said no one else has ever trained your particular mind before with your particular mix of defilementsYoure the one who has to train itSo pick up what lessons you can read the maps make your plans but know that the plans can get washed away pretty quicklyAnd realize that being thrown on your own resources is not a bad thingIts where genuine insight comesAs Ajaan Maha Boowa says discernment doesnt arise until you find yourself cornered at the end of your ropeIt may not be a pleasant place to be but its where new alternatives show themselves if youre willing to look for themOtherwise your practice is like processed cheese  no matter what kind of cheese goes into the factory it all gets mixed with oil and comes out tasting the sameKraft Velveeta has not changed much since I was a childThey may package it differently but its all very predictable and all very blahBut we dont want processed cheese in the practiceWe dont want blah insightsWe want something better than thatAny practice that requires less than your full participation and less than your full willingness to put things on the line is never going to offer you any real surprisesActually awakening is quite a surprise when it comesSo learn how to deal with the little surprises and the big surprises will have an opportunity to show you that there really is something special in lifeAfter all the Buddha said there are four noble truthsIts not that all life is sufferingPart of life is also the end of suffering  if you open yourself up to what often might seem like impossibilities improbabilitiesTheres a passage where the Buddha says that we practice to see what weve never seen before to attain what weve never attained before to know what weve never known beforeWhich means being willing to do things weve never done before to encounter things weve never planned for beforeSo learn to enjoy that adventurous aspect of the path because its crucialOne of the habits of a good craftsman is a willingness to deal with uncertaintiesYou take the range of skills youve developed and youre willing to apply them to new situations new problemsYou experimentAnd you deal skillfully with failureYou try again until you can see how the basic principles of your skill can be extended in that particular set of circumstances to that particular set of problemsThe same principle applies to meditationYou may find as youre dealing with the breath energy in the body that there are parts of the body you have trouble integrating into your range of healthy breath energySo you have to learn how to think about those parts in new waysIf you try to push them out of you or ignore them they dont go awayThey come back with a vengeanceSo learn to think about them in ways that can include them in the breathFor example if theres tension in your neck or your shoulders think of the neck and shoulders actually doing the breathing and theyre breathing just for themselvesThe fact that theyre tense may mean that theyve been breathing for other parts of the body while they themselves are starvedSo let them have their fill of breath energyOften if areas of the body have been starved of breath energy youll have to start out with lots of deep long inbreaths and shallow outbreaths to get them reenergizedBe careful not to squeeze those areas on the outbreathLet them do the breathing and for the time being its fully for their benefitIf your brain feels foggy you can think of the breath energy coming in and out of the brain that the brain is doing the breathingOr the spinal cord is doing the breathingSee what that does to the breath energy  if it helps to open things up or to strengthen parts of the body that are weakIf it doesnt work experiment to see what does workAs a meditator you always want to be expanding your range of skills consolidating what youve learned and then seeing how it can growIn doing so you find that you expand your sense of who you are of what you can do of whats possibleBut that sense of who you are Dont focus primarily on thatWe have ways of typecasting ourselves You fall here or there on the enneagram youre a smart person a dumb person a sensitive person a clod or whateverIf you think in those terms you tend to limit yourselfWhat those types are are the areas you tend to fall back on the range of skills youre already comfortable withBut you dont want to be limited to those skillsYou have to be willing to deal with uncertainties which means being willing to develop new skillsThere are certain roles that youre comfortable filling but things cant progress if you stay limited to those rolesYou cant let your desire for selfesteem limit you just to the things you already know how to do wellIts a common tendency When you see that you can do something well you can pat yourself on the back that you handled that situation well from that angleBut maybe you handled it poorly from another angleThats an area you dont like to look at because it doesnt feed your selfesteemAnd that way you stay blindOr youre used to certain patterns in your emotional lifeLike patterns in the weather they seem natural because theyre the ones youre used toWhen I was younger I lived back EastLike everywhere east of the Rocky Mountains the heat during the summer would build and build and build and then there would be a huge thunderstormThe heat and humidity would be dispersed and things cooled downYou got used to thinking that thats the way it has to be  the heat and humidity build into a thunderstorm that clears everythingNow you live here in California and the summers arent like that at allWhen the cool air comes in it comes in stealthily very quietlyYou go through a heat wave and then one morning you wake up FogIt crept in overnight without warning with no clear line to tell you Now the heat is going to break Its a different patternWe need to realize in our lives that some of the patterns were used to are unhealthy or they may be useful in some circumstances but not in othersSo its good to learn other ways of dealing with these patternsInstead of trying to think of what kind of person you are or where you fit on a particular scale just look at your range of skills and ask if you can expand that rangeLook at things from different perspectivesFor instance if youre used to thinking of yourself as smart its useful to live in a set of circumstances where other people dont think that youre smartAt first you may find it debilitating because your selfesteem has been built up around the idea that youre smartBut the idea that youre smart can get in the way of learning new thingsYou have to get past that sense of being debilitated and realize well maybe you are dumb in certain areasThe way to do this is to identify yourself as someone always willing to learnThat provides you with a wider range of places where you can stay a wider range of groups you can live with and a wider range of ways you can look at yourself and the situations youre inThe wider your range of skills the easier it is to surviveYour survival doesnt have to depend on other people recognizing the fact that youre smart or even your thinking youre smartOr suppose youre used to being angry going through a certain pattern like the summer storm pattern  the anger gradually builds gradually builds and then a storm clears the air  and youre used to that effect the idea that really feeling the anger fully and expressing it fully is going to clear the airWhat actually happens of course is that you end up doing and saying things that are harmful to yourself and to people around you just as storms can cause a lot of damageYouve got to ask yourself What other ways are there of dealing with the situationDo you really need to clear the air with angerDoes it actually clear the airMight it not be better to go back to the very beginning stages of the anger and watch them to see how you can nip the anger in the bud so the anger can be defused in a subtle way like the fog stealing inThese skills we learn as we meditate  watching thought patterns arise and learning how to nip them in the bud  are an important part of the meditationWe like to think that real meditation is when you settle down with the breath with no distractions and the mind doesnt wander off anywhereBut learning how to deal with distraction is one of the major learning opportunities in the meditation seeing how the distraction begins how theres a little stirring in the mind and then depending on what you want how you place a meaning on that stirring and get attracted to it involved in itIt becomes a little movie you want to follow and then youre off wherever it takes youBut if you want to stick with the meditation you need to see those processes right as they begin forming and to figure out ways of nipping them in the bud questioning the perception dispersing that little stirring of energy with the breath getting more alert to whats actually happening and more mindful of what you really want to be doing with the processWhich means that in learning how to deal with distractions you learn an awful lot about how the mind works how states of becoming ariseThen you take this skill and use it in daily lifeWhen you run up against patterns in yourself and your relationships to the people around you  as in that old book Games People Play  you have to ask yourself what games you like to play the games you feel comfortable playing the ones you feel you can play wellAre they really good games to playIf not how can you pull out of those gamesThats an important range of skills to developAnd again as youre meditating learn which areas of the Dhamma apply to which phase of the emotional waves you go throughIn the beginning stages where the wave is still subtle you can apply the four noble truths look for the stress look for the craving and the clinging and do what you can to let go of that craving and clingingYou need to do this early for if you let the wave develop to a crest to the point where youre in the middle of a rage this subtle type of analysis is not going to workThe only thing you can do then is to use defilement to undercut your defilementTheres that great passage in the suttas where the Buddha advises when youre really angry to stop and think of how when youre angry you tend to do and say things that are selfdestructive that destroy your friendships that destroy your wealth that hurt your best interestsWhen youre angry you dont look goodAll of these are things that will please your enemyDo you want to please that bastardThinking in this way uses your pride and hatred to undercut your angerWhen things have developed to a fullblown level like that the subtle teachings arent going to helpYou have to use crude wisdom  which means that even though it works the results are going to be crude as wellSo its best not to let your emotional waves develop that farAsk yourself What happened to all those skills you learned as a meditatorTheyre not just for sitting quietly on a meditation seatTheyre for use in your daily life to take you out of the unskillful games youve been playing to give you a wider range of actual skillsSo look at your life What in your daily life tends to provoke angerWatching TVListening to the radioWell maybe you should watch less TTurn off the radioThere is that principle called restraint of the senses you knowWhen you look at things that provoke anger its often not the case that the things actually provoke your angerYoure out looking for anger because you want the stormBut what does the storm really accomplish aside from a lot of damageLearn how to look at the people you dislike in a different wayLearn to think about the situations that would normally provoke anger in a different wayIf you find that you cant look at the news without getting angry it means you cant look at the news yetYoure not ready for itIf you want to get involved in social action learn how to look at the news in a way that gives you ideas for what could be done but without the angerIts possible to recognize injustice and to work for change without getting stirred to angerWhen you dont get stirred up in anger you can work more effectivelyThis applies in your personal life as well in your relationships with people right around youThey may do things you dislike but instead of letting yourself get upset ask yourself What would be the most effective way of stopping that kind of behaviorThe most effective way is rarely the route of angerThere are more subtle ways more indirect ways that are much more effective much more lastingBut theyre not going to occur to you if youre boiling over with indignationYou may come to realize that you actually use the injustice or the wrong situation to play a game of angerSo start questioning your motivesIs it really the injustice you care about or is it the charge of the angerThis way you bring the range of skills you develop in meditation into your daily lifeYoull probably see things about yourself that you dont like but hopefully the meditation should have put you in a position where youre ready to face those things maturely and deal with them skillfullyThis is why when the Buddha taught Rahula how to meditate on the breath he first taught him to develop the perception of inconstancyAs he said if you focus on inconstancy it helps to deconstruct the conceit that I am Now ordinarily we think of conceit as one of the last things you abandon in the practiceIts a fetter that only arahants can abandon totallyBut you want to learn how to question it right from the very beginning because it often gets in the way of the skills you could be developing as a meditator or applying to new situations in lifeWhen you can let go of that conceit  even though you cant totally conquer it at least put it out of your mind for the time being  it allows you to look at situations less in terms of what you are and more in terms of what you can do with the range of skills at handAnd do what you can to expand that range of skillsAjaan Lee talks about knowing when to play the role of being a smart person knowing when to play the role being a dumb personThe same with strength and weakness Most people dont like to appear weak but there are times when its useful to play the weak roleYou learn a lot about other people that wayWhat this means is that you want to be able to play both the weak role and the strong role whenever necessaryLast week I was talking to a woman who was dealing with a difficult situation at workShe had begun to realize that it just wasnt worth keeping up the fight that shed be better off quitting the jobBut part of her didnt like the idea for she was going to look like a loserShe liked to think of herself as a warriorWell thats a very incomplete understanding of what it means to be a warriorA good warrior knows which battles are worth fighting and which ones arentIts when youre really confident in yourself as a warrior that youre willing to look weak or demure when you know its to your advantage to do soIn other words youre willing to play lots of different roles  and to learn how to expand your skills in all the different games you might be playing with other people so youre not stuck in the same old narrow range of games narrow range of skillsYoure able to take on different identities as they are appropriate for the occasionThis is a principle that applies to the outside area of your daily life and also to the inside area of your meditationLearn how to live with uncertainties with the confidence that you can learn from them and expand your skillsIts an important step toward freedom this ability to expand your rangeIf you need a working hypothesis about who you are what kind of person you are make it the kind of person always willing to learnThat sort of identity doesnt set you up for a fallIn fact it aids you all along the pathBut once you realize that its the identity you want to take on make sure that your attitudes really carry it outOften you hear that there are two ways of approaching meditationOne is to put in lots of neurotic miserable effortYou stress and strain with your heart firmly set on the time someday in the far distant future when youll finally become awakenedThe other approach is to realize that the Dhamma is all around you in the present momentYou just relax into the present moment and there you areNow if those were the two only alternatives the second would obviously be the only reasonable approachBut there are other alternatives as wellIts possible to relax into the present and still be filled with delusionIts possible to enjoy putting effort into the practice to thrive on challenges to realize that theres a mature way to relate to the goal of awakening and actually get thereYou realize that yes the experience of awakening is not here yet its someplace in the future but to get there you have to focus on hereAnd focusing on here is not just a matter of relaxing theres work to be doneAjaan Lee has a good analogyHe says the practice is like trying to get fresh water out of salt waterThe fresh water is already there in the salt water but just allowing the salt water to sit and relax for a long while is not going to get the salt to separate outYou have to distill itThe fire of your distillery is analogous to the effort that goes into the practiceIf you dont put in the effort youre never going to get fresh water out of the salt waterBut the trick is learning how to sustain effort so that you dont give up when the going gets toughThe best way to make it all the way there is to figure out how to enjoy the work hereIn other words the effort in the meditation doesnt always have to be miserable or neurotic doesnt always have to be a matter of stressing and strainingSometimes it will require strong effort sometimes very subtle effortRight effort doesnt mean middling effort all the time you knowWhat makes the effort right is that its skillful appropriate for right here right now  and youre up for the challengeIn the Buddhas description of right effort youre told to generate desireAnd one of the best ways of generating desire is to learn how to enjoy the effort  in other words to take joy in abandoning unskillful qualities and to take joy in developing skillful onesThis joy is one of the traditions of the noble onesAnd it actually gets resultsThe best way to develop this sort of joy is to regard the practice as a skill that challenges your ingenuityOne of the qualities Ive noticed is common among all the forest ajaans  in spite of all their different personalities  is that they all like to use their ingenuity to figure things outTheyre not the type of people who simply do as theyre told and hope that simply by doing as theyre told awakening is going to come out the other end of the process like luncheon meat out of a factoryThey each found aspects of the path that were like riddles that captured their imaginationThese riddles didnt involve just an intellectual analysis but more the type of analysis where you figure out a problemWhen they found a problem of this sort they liked to find the most effective way of figuring it outSo thats a quality you want to bring to the meditationNotice what youre doing with the breath and what things seem to be problematicThe problem might be a physical pain or an emotional oneTry to figure out how the breath can helpNotice the mechanics of how you breatheWhen you breathe in where in the body does the inbreath energy  the swelling in the abdomen the swelling of the chest  startAnd when this inbreath impulse ripples through the body does it spread smoothly or are there places where its caught up where its blocked where its tensedCan you unravel the blockagesThats one thing you might want to work at if you find this an interesting problemSee what you can doIf this problem doesnt capture your imagination if it doesnt seem to be a problem notice what is a problem for you right here right nowIn other words learn how to pose questions about the breath that relate to issues that really concern youLearn how to go about figuring out the answers and judging when youve found an answer that really worksAnother common tendency in the forest tradition is not to explain everything beforehandThe ajaans tend to give each meditator the opportunity to figure things outOne reason for this is that the things youve learned by figuring them out stick with you much longer than the things youre simply toldThe other reason is that many of our internal problems are extremely internal  the way mental events relate to physical events within you  and only you know how to express them to yourselfYour internal dialogue uses words images and language in an idiosyncratic way that only you can knowSo you have to learn how to phrase idiosyncratic questions and then come up with answers appropriate for your caseIf you can learn to enjoy this process youre more than halfway thereIf you see the effort simply as a chore something youve got to get through youre going to miss an awful lotYoull end up at the point where you tell yourself that this isnt working at allYoull want to go back to what people in the th century called the gospel of relaxation the idea that relaxation simply accepting things as they are is going to cure all your illsThis has been with us for a long time in America the idea that if only we could learn how to relax everything would be okayWeve been at this for more than years and even though it still hasnt worked out the idea hasnt lost its appealAnd its certainly not the Buddhas take on the problemIn his analogy if you havent gotten results from making an effort youve simply been engaging in wrong effortThe difference between right effort and wrong effort is not so much the amount of effort as much as where you focus your effort and what you actually doIf you want to get milk out of a cow for example you learn how to pull at the udderThats right effortWrong effort is trying to get milk out of a cow by twisting her hornNow if youve been putting a lot of effort into twisting her horn but not getting any milk it might be a good idea to relaxBut relaxing is not the whole solution its just the first stepAfter all you still havent gotten any milkThe next step in actually getting the milk is to ask What other parts of the cow can I squeeze And you look aroundYou try squeezing her leg that doesnt workYou try pulling her tail she kicks youAnd finally you pull her udderThats when you get milkIn other words relaxation is the first part of the solution if youve been putting effort into the wrong area if youve been engaging in wrong effortBut if youre engaged in right effort in the right area just keep at itAs your effort gets more consistent you start getting resultsThe more you get results the more you find joy in the effortAnd the more you find joy the more youre energized to try to figure things out at even subtler levelsSo to do well at the meditation its a matter one of being willing to put in the effort and two of learning how to enjoy the effort learning how to enjoy puzzling things outThe Buddhas path is not the sort where you simply do as youre told  noting noting noting or scanning scanning scanning without thinkingThose approaches are simply mindfulness exercises but people tend to do them mindlessly  ie without asking any questionsActual insight comes not by pummeling the mind with a technique but from posing the right questions in the mindWhat are these assumptions Im carrying around hereHow could I do this more efficientlyWhat am I doing that Im not noticingHow can I learn how to notice itHow can I catch the mind as its about to let go of its mindfulness This last point may sound impossible but its notWhen you learn how to pose questions in the mind like this and you enjoy trying to find the answers its going to bring progress along the pathAnd its perfectly all right to want to make progress along the pathAfter all thats how the Buddha taughtA lot of people like to secondguess the Buddha saying He couldnt really mean what he said using conditioned things to reach the unconditionedThere must be some trick to all this They try to figure it all out beforehand to clone an awakened view without having to go through the work of the pathThats the wrong way of trying to figure things outThe right way is to take the Buddha at his word and then when youre doing as he tells you to to try to figure out why he has you do things this particular wayThats one of the features of the forest traditionThey took the Buddha at his word but in an inquisitive wayHe said to follow the Vinaya they follow the VinayaHe said to develop right concentration which means jhanaOkay they do thatThen they look at what theyre doing to see how it helps in bringing suffering to an endWhat this means in practice is that you learn how to question your efforts in terms of the four noble truths until you arrive at something that lies beyond effort beyond the pathBut you cant get to the beyond unless you go through the effort of the pathIn fact its in focusing on the doing of the path that you actually come across the beyondSo take the Buddha at his word There is right effortWhen the Buddha singled out three of the most important factors of the path in helping right concentration they were right view right effort and right mindfulnessThese are the most important helpmates or requisites for right concentrationThese are the factors you want to focus on while youre meditating right view right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThey all involve doing things developing things watching the results and then  when you see something unskillful happening  letting it goIf you learn how to take joy in the developing and joy in the letting go youre on the noble pathAnd its not a bad place to beIts better than being stuck in a place where youre trying to clone awakening and end up with nothing but wrong view wrong mindfulness and wrong all the way down the lineNo milk in your pail and an irritated cow besidesSo take the Buddha at his wordAnd be up for the challenge  because it can be a lot of funPart of the definition of right concentration is that you seclude your mind from sensual thoughts from sensual obsessions and its not easyThe mind likes to spend a lot of time planning sensual pleasuresA man once came to see VenAnanda and said I hear that the monks even the young ones train their minds to put aside sensual passion sensual thoughts sensual plansI dont believe thatHow can that be So Ananda took him to see the Buddha and the Buddha said Well even when I was a young monk it wasnt easyMy heart didnt leap at the idea of giving up sensual passionsBut I realized that for the mind to gain stillness to gain a sense of solidity it would have to put sensual passion sensual ideas aside at least for the time beingThe way he did it was twofold One was to think of the drawbacks of sensuality and the other was to think of the rewards of renunciationIf we compare this to the factors of the path it falls under right effort  as we chanted just now chandam janeti generating desireDesire does have a role in the path the desire to abandon any unskillful thoughts that have arisen to prevent unskillful thoughts from arising again to give rise to any skillful thoughts or mental qualities that havent yet arisen and to maintain and develop those that haveIn each case you have to generate the desire for the effort to happenTry to get your mind on the side of the idea that this is what you want to doThis involves psyching yourself up giving yourself reasons that actually motivate you to put aside your usual obsessions and to look for something betterThe texts recommend many different ways of doing thisYou start with the Buddhas first method learning to see the drawbacks of sensualityThe Buddha has lots to say on this topic gives lots of analogies for understanding the drawbacks of sensuality Its like a pit of burning embers a drop of honey on the blade of a knife a chain of bones without any meatOnce when I was in Laguna someone complained Why is there so much on the drawbacks of sensuality Because were so strongly attached to sensualityYou have to keep hammering the point home that sensual desire carries heavy drawbacks all the trouble that laypeople go through in work for instance working and working and working to get paid so that theyll have the money to buy pleasuresThen theres fear that they may not get paidOr even if they do get paid its not going to be enoughOr its going to get stolenOr as the texts say kings or thieves will make off with itHateful heirs will make off with itIts because of sensual desire that we get into wars and battles even battles at homeThere are a lot of drawbacks to sensuality and its good to think about them on a regular basisIt helps incline the mind to the idea that maybe it would be good to put those thoughts aside and see if you can develop a sense of ease a sense of wellbeing that doesnt have to depend on themIts not as if the Buddha is going to starve youHe gives you an alternative pleasure one thats safe that provides real nourishmentIn the beginning its hard because part of the mind doesnt want to settle down and work toward itSo you have to go on faith on the conviction that this is something you really should wantThat right there may seem to be a contradiction putting together the terms should and wantWe think of wanting as something that happens naturally and the shoulding as unnaturalBut you can induce a desire  you do it all the timeSo if you want to be truly happy you should induce desires for the causes of true happinessSeeing renunciation as rest is another tactic for generating desireThe Canon contains a famous account of a former king who becomes a monkHe goes and sits under a tree exclaiming What bliss what bliss The other monks are afraid that hes recalling his past pleasures as king so they go tell the BuddhaThe Buddha calls him into his presence and says I hear youve been sitting under a tree exclaiming What bliss what bliss What do you have in mind as you say this And the monk says Back when I was a king I couldnt sleep at nightEven though I had guards posted inside the palace outside the palace inside the capital city outside the capital city inside the countryside and outside the borders of the countryside I still couldnt sleep at night for fear that I would be attacked and killedBut now I sit under a tree with my wants satisfied my mind like a wild deer feeling no fear from any direction Thats the bliss Im thinking aboutThats the bliss of renunciation a possibility that doesnt even occur to most peopleWe see this so many times People whove amassed wealth amassed power realize that theyre in danger because of their wealth and their powerSo they set up prisons for themselves  gated communities with walls security cameras watchmen and guard dogsVery few of them realize that theyd be a lot better off abandoning that wealth and learning how to sit happily under a tree in the woods with a mind like a wild deerSo those are two ways of inducing the desire to let go of unskillful states and to develop skillful ones seeing the drawbacks of sensuality and allowing your imagination to conceive of the rewards of renunciationThere are other ways of inducing desire as wellOne is humorThe Canon has a sutta where the Buddha talks about the reasons why people are lazy and the reasons why theyre diligentFor lazy people its say if you havent had enough to eat you tell yourself Im weakIve got to rest Or if youve just recovered from an illness you say Oh Ive been sick Ive got to rest And so it goes Whatever whatever Ive got to rest As for the reasons for being diligent the external conditions are the sameSay youve been sick and now youve recovered a little bitYou tell yourself I dont know Maybe the illness could get worse so I should try to practice now while Ive got at least some strength Or you havent had much to eatYou realize My bodys not weighed down by foodIm not drowsyIts great for practicing And so on down the lineIn other words the externals are the same in each caseThe reasons that some people see as obstacles to their practice other people see as opportunitiesThe difference lies simply in the attitude they have toward themThe way the Buddha phrases these cases is humorous for the lazy excuses are attitudes we all know too wellWhen you can laugh in a goodnatured way at how your laziness justifies itself it loses some of its power over youThe Buddha also recommends using a sense of pride and honor as a reason for wanting to practiceFor the monks this means living up to the fact that youre a monkWhen you say youre a contemplative are you really a contemplativeOr are you just here as a tourist checking it out seeing what its like wearing robes going for alms playing the role of a monkIf you had any sense of honor youd want to make your mind the mind of a monk the mind of a contemplativeThis ties in with the motivation of compassionYoure here receiving alms and all these other requisites from peopleYoure living off their generosityAs a return act of kindness to your supporters you want to keep practicing partly to pay back the debt partly so that their gifts to you will bear great fruit for themThats part of the way kamma works If you purify your mind those who support you will reap great rewardsThe Buddha also talks of developing a warriors sense of pride and honor in your ability to master the practiceMonks he says are like five different kinds of warriorsTheres the warrior who sees the dust of the approaching army and grows faint runs awayTheres the warrior who sees the top of the banner of the approaching army feels faint runs awayTheres the warrior who actually sees the army running at him hears the tumult hears the noise of the army gets faint runs awayTheres the soldier who gets engaged in handtohand combat gives up losesAnd then theres the soldier who comes out winning doesnt get faint when he sees the dust of the approaching army doesnt get faint when he sees the banner hears the tumult or actually engages in handtohand combatHe comes out victoriousThese warriors are like five different kinds of monksTheres the monk who hears that theres a beautiful woman in that village over thereJust the thought that there are beautiful women out there is enough to make him give up the trainingThats the one who grows faint on seeing the dust of the approaching armyThen theres the monk who gives up when he actually sees a beautiful woman Hes like the warrior who sees the top of the banner of the army gets faint runs awayThen theres the monk who faints on hearing the tumult of the approaching army ie hes sitting out meditating under a tree and a woman comes up and teases him makes fun of him and he gives up the trainingThen theres one who gives up when engaged in handtohand combat  in other words the woman actually comes up and throws herself all over him so he gives up the trainingThe one who comes out victorious doesnt grow faint or give up with any of these thingsHe sticks with his resolve that hes going to try to overcome his sensual passion regardlessThe Buddha teaches in this way to instill a sense of honor a sense of pride that mastering this practice is an accomplishmentSome people look down on monks Theres one vipassana teacher I know whose highest praise for me is that I would have made a good laypersonFor him most monks are losersBut hes wrongSee that our ability to overcome sensuality is not a weakness its a strengthIt requires a sense of honor to do this a sense of pride and masteryOf course the problem with pride is that you tend to compare yourself with other people but there are times when it serves a good purposeAnd ultimately the Buddha tries to put a check on comparisons like that reminding us that were not here to compete with other peopleWere here to compete with ourselvesWhen he talks about the traditions of the noble ones  your ability to be content with whatever you get in terms of food clothing and shelter  he says that youre also careful not to compare yourself with other people who live more luxuriously who are not so contentYou dont try to exalt yourself or disparage others around this issueYou realize that youre here to overcome your own weakness not theirsAs he says when youre able to overcome your weakness and heedlessness in this way its the same as when the moon released from a cloud illumines the worldSomeone who maintains this tradition heedfully makes the world a brighter placeThe Buddha also makes comparisons with physical skillsOnce when VenAnanda was on his almsround he passed some youths in the city of Vesali practicing their archery skills learning how to shoot arrows through keyholes from a great distanceHe went back and reported this to the Buddha commenting that that was quite an impressive accomplishmentSo the Buddha asked him Which is more difficult to pierce a keyhole with an arrow or to take a very fine hair and use it to pierce the tip of another very fine hair Ananda said Oh the second skill is an even more amazing one And the Buddha replied Even more amazing than that is the skill of being able to pierce the truths of suffering its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation In other words he reminded Ananda that this path requires a great deal of precision and skillWhen you can accomplish it youve mastered a great skillHave pride in your craftsmanshipSo the Buddha uses a sense of honor and pride as a way of generating desire to develop skillful qualities in the mind and to abandon unskillful onesIts a shame that in modern society the sense of honor seems to have wasted away as we become a society of consumersTheres not much honor in consumingWe take pride in amassing things in conspicuous consumption but thats the pride of a foolHonorable pride the pride that comes with a skill seems to be disappearing from our society  and its a real lossThe sense of honor thats required to develop a skill makes better people out of usIf you can think of some skill youve mastered and the sense of pride and accomplishment that came from having overcome whatever problems whatever difficulties lay in your way you can take that same sense of accomplishment and apply it to the practice realizing that this is a much more demanding skill but also much more rewarding much more usefulThe fact that its demanding should simply spark you to even greater efforts greater enthusiasm so you can generate the desire thats such an essential part of right effortSo instead of bemoaning the fact that you have to give up this or give up that think of the good things that appear in your own mind when you have the strength to give them upAfter all renunciation is not only a skill but also a wise exchange a wise tradeYoure trading in something of little value for something of much greater valueYoure trading candy for goldYoure doing something very difficult but very honorableRather than feeling faint at the difficulty you should stir yourself up to say Yes I can do this As Ananda says this is the proper use of conceit and pride in the path Other people can do this why cant I Thats the way in which desire and conceit are actually part of the pathWe usually think of them as things to be overcome and abandoned but if theyre properly used they do have their roleSo learn to use them whenever appropriateSome of the discourses give an impression that the practice is a smooth upward incline one surefooted step after another going progressively up and up and up a staircaseFortunately the Canon contains other passages confirming that its not always a steady progressThere are ups and downsSome of the passages especially in the Therigatha and Theragatha portray monks and nuns complaining that the practice would go well for a while and then crash go well for a while then crash one monk commenting that this had happened so often that he was ready to commit suicide it had gotten so badThose passages are good reminders that no matter how bad things get its still possible to gain awakeningIn each of these cases where the monks and the nuns had run amok from their dwellings crazed over the ups and downs of their practice they finally pulled themselves together and were able to attain total releaseThis is why its good to look to these stories for encouragementBack in the th century people liked to read the lives of great men and womenIt was considered an essential part of a good education to study their examples how theyd been through many many hardships and yet hadnt lost heart how theyd finally come out on topWith modern literature the taste has changed to antiheroes people you may sympathize with but who you wouldnt want to take as examplesIts a shame that weve lost a taste for genuine heroes and heroines in our literatureOccasionally you find it though as in the accounts of the most recent political campaignsEven the most welloiled campaign machine would have its ups and downs but what mattered was how the people in charge managed those ups and downsOne of the important lessons you can learn from these accounts is that when things get bad its not the end of the worldYou just stop take stock of the situation and figure a way outOr you can read about expeditions like Shackletons down to AntarcticaThings got really bad even before they could get to AntarcticaTheir ship got locked at sea in the winter ice so they had to leave the ship and walk across the ice dragging their dinghies behind themWhen they reached the edge of the ice they set out across the oceanMost of them thought they were doomedBut even when they thought they were doomed they kept going because of one thing their sense of discipline realizing that as long as you stay disciplined you can take advantage of whatever opportunities do ariseThats the first lesson to take from these stories a strong sense of disciplineAs you dig down into this lesson it reminds you that you need to get back to basics so that the consistency of your discipline has a firm foundationIn our practice getting back to basics means reminding yourself of why youre here Youre suffering and this is the way outWhat is that way outAs the Buddha says right view comes firstIn his analysis of dependent coarising the prime factor causing suffering is ignoranceYou dont see things in terms of the four noble truths and your attention goes wandering off to all sorts of other placesOr if you do have little bits and pieces of knowledge thats all it is little bits and piecesNothing continuousYou need to develop mindfulness and alertness so that your knowledge becomes more continuous and the bits and pieces connect upSo consistency and the focus on how to end suffering are two basic principles to bring to your awarenessYoure here to gain knowledge by looking at things consistently in terms of the four noble truthsGet started with the right questions Where is there stress right nowWhat are you doing to cause itWhat actions help to alleviate itThen bring more consistent attention to those questions and to how they apply to what youre experiencing right nowIf it strings you out to focus on the stress then focus on the question Where are the good things right nowWhat can you rely on as your path If theres a little bit of mindfulness hold onto itRight speech right action all the rights of the noble path Hold onto what youve got realizing that the situation inside and out may not be what you like but your way out of here is to hold onto whatever you still have of the path these states of mindEven if all youve got is just that simple ability to stay attentive then stay attentive and keep that attention appropriate without getting entangled in the story lines the narratives and all the other crazy ideas that the mind keeps churning out for itselfSo when things dont look good try to get some perspective by reminding yourself What are the basicsWhy are you hereWhat is this all aboutIts about developing some skills and learning how to comprehend your stress and suffering learning how to abandon the cause when you can see it learning how to develop the good factors of the path and whatever other qualities of mind reinforce the path when they ariseEndurance is importantIts the quality that gives the consistency to the pathSimply following the path one hour a night is not going to do the trickOnagain offagain That doesnt help at allIt may help a little but it doesnt build up the momentum you needMomentum comes with sticking with things over timeIts like planting a treeIf you plant the tree and water it only occasionally or water it just once and forget about it the tree is not going to surviveYou have to be consistent in looking after it committed to looking after itThats how it growsTake a lesson from your breathing The body breathes continuallyIf it breathed just while you were focusing on it and then stopped breathing when you were thinking about something else youd be deadSo take some lessons from the breath because its consistentIt keeps coming in and going out whether you pay attention to it or not whether you like it or notIts thereIt keeps coming in and going out keeping you aliveTake that as a lesson for the mindYouve got to be consistentEven though the path is not yielding the quick and exciting results youd like to see remember that nobody promised it was going to be quick and easy that it was going to be exciting all along the wayWhen the practice has its ups you have to be heedfulWhen it gets down you have to be heedfulYou cant be complacent either wayIn other words when things are going really well you cant take your hands off the steering wheel assuming that the car is going to drive itselfYou cant let yourself get complacent or carelessKeep being attentive very very consistently moment by moment by moment to whats happeningIf things are going well do what you can to keep them going wellWhen things are not going well again you cant be heedlessYou cant let negativity take over your mindItll have lots of things to complain about  This is not the right place to practice these are not good people to practice with on and on and on  diverting your attention from the real problem which is that youre not paying careful attention to what the mind is doingThe mind is a very clever politicianIt can very quickly distract you from whats really going onThis is why the Buddha said to obtain completion through heedfulness through being very careful uncomplacentThats the discipline that will see you throughThat expedition that Shackleton ran I once got into a disagreement with someone who said that Shackleton made all sorts of wrong decisions so his followers shouldnt have listened to himBut if they hadnt listened to him the whole thing would have fallen apartPeople would have diedHe got people through  and inspired them to get themselves through  even though he did make mistakesA sense of discipline is what can correct for those mistakes to make sure that theyre not disastrousSo always remember whenever theres a problem that more attention is requiredIn particular you have to pay more careful attention to whats happening in terms of the issue of stress and its causesEverything you need to know for awakening is right hereAll the factors are right here simply that at the moment theyre out of control theyre causing sufferingWhen you learn how to bring them under control then this process of fabrication for example can turn into the pathMany of the elements of dependent coarising have the potential to become path factorsAttention in nameandform can become appropriate attentionFabrication can become the comfortable breathing and directed thought and evaluation of right concentrationSo its all right hereWhen you get bored or discouraged with the practice remind yourself that its because youre not paying careful attentionYoure letting your expectations get in the way or your moods get in the way Something is getting in the way so that youre not really seeing whats going onThis combination of focused attention and consistency means that you pay more and more careful attention  appropriate attention  to the issues of the four noble truthsThe truths are not just truths about something theyre ways of looking categories you can apply to anything going on in the mindYou can watch all the crazy thoughts in the mind and if you do it from the perspective of the four noble truths knowledge can ariseLearn to find what in the mind you can rely on as a path factor that will give you the strength you need to withstand the negative factorsThe ability not to get discouraged by events comes down to your ability to keep talking to yourself with the right tone of voice saying the right things to yourselfThats what right view is all aboutRemind yourself that no matter how bad things get or how long the dry stretches seem to last its not the endThe possibility for knowledge is always thereThis is one of the amazing things about the mind Its always awareTheres always that potential for knowledge for understandingSometimes it may seem weak but its there and you can encourage itThats how when things get bad you can become your own best counselor your own best advisor so that when things crash not everything gets demolishedYour determination not to keep on suffering Thatll see you throughAjaan Mun talked about this in his last major sermonThe one thing you hold onto all the way through the path he said is the determination not to come back and be the laughingstock of the defilements ever again not having to suffer ever againThe Buddha calls this taking yourself as your governing principle reminding yourself that youre suffering and that deep down inside you want to find a way outSo discard your unnecessary baggage and hold onto the basics  consistency discipline appropriate attention  for those are the things thatll see you throughWere practicing to put an end to stress suffering and painBut the practice itself involves stress suffering and painAs the Buddha said there are times when you realize that certain unskillful qualities in your mind are not going away as you live at your easeSo you have to be willing to put up with some pain if you want to get rid of themIn other words were not out pursuing pain in order to prove a point but we use it when we need toRecently someone claimed that people who choose the monastic path are the young men out looking for the hardest path they can find  kind of a macho masochismBut thats not the case at allYou dont look for pain any more than you have to but you realize that there are times when if you dont put up with some pain or stress then greed anger and delusion arent going to vacate your mindThe image the Buddha gives is of a fletcher someone who makes arrowsThe fletcher has to straighten the arrow shaft by running it next to a flameAs long as the shaft isnt straight yet he has to keep running it next to the flame first this side then that sideOnce the shaft is straightened though he doesnt need to run it against the flame anymoreIn the same way our practice is not necessarily heading into pain but straightening out the mind is going to involve running alongside some pain so that we can ultimately get beyond the painThis is why the Buddha began the OvadaPatimokkha one of his first major summaries of the path by saying that patient endurance is the utmost austerityBack in his time there were people who practiced austerities to burn away their defilementsBut as the Buddha pointed out the particular type of physical austerity didnt matter  such as standing on one leg out in the sun lying down on a bed of nails or whateverWhat mattered was learning how to develop the quality of endurance in the mind Thats what burns away defilementSo were after a mental quality a quality that can live with pain and not get upset by itThe comparison the Buddha gave is of an elephant going into battleIf the elephant has been trained then no matter what horrible sights or sounds or smells or tastes or tactile sensations it encounters in the battle its not deterredNo matter what enticing sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations its not swayedThats the kind of quality you want to develop in the practiceIts not going to be easy but you can make it easier  if you know how to approach itThe first step is to focus on the mindTo what extent is the mind making it harder to endure these thingsThe Buddha gives the example of a person shot by an arrowAnd being shot by one arrow isnt enough He shoots himself with more arrowsThe first arrow is the actual pain the extra arrows are all his mental flailing around in reaction to the painThese extra arrows are the problemAs Ajaan Fuang once said if physical pain isnt killing you you can take itBut for most of us the problem isnt so much the physical painIts all that extra suffering that we add on top of it all the extra arrows we shoot into the mindSo you want to keep looking into the mindWhat are these extra arrowsAnd how can you prevent yourself from shooting themOne way is to develop a good sense of humor around the whole situationI dont know the Pali word for humor but you see examples of it in the Canon where the Buddha talks about the conditions for aroused effort as opposed to the conditions for lazinessThe external conditions are the same in either caseIf you havent eaten enough you sit there complaining I cant practice todayI have no energyIm feeling hungryIm feeling tired and weak Thats a condition for lazinessThe condition for aroused effort if you havent eaten enough is to say Ah the body is lightI dont have to worry about digesting my food todayIm not sleepy or drowsy or weighed down by the food And in the way the Buddha expresses each pair of cases theres a humor to the whole suttaThats one thing learning how to maintain good humor around the practiceYou may have heard the story of the th century Englishman who went across northern Canada with a group of Dene IndiansHe noticed that on the days when they couldnt find any food the Dene tended to joke and laugh the mostThats how they were able to keep up their spiritsThe same with the passage in Slaughterhouse Five where the American prisoner of war visits the section of the prisonerofwar camp where the British troops are being held The British troops are all very organized theyre putting on comedy sketches theyre basically having a good timeTheyre suffering a lot less than the Americans who just sit around moping over their individual sufferings plotting revenge on one anotherThe British troops are actively determined to keep up their spirits as much as possible in the face of a very difficult situationSo try to develop that attitude as you practiceThis is why adjusting the breath is sometimes called playing with the breathIf youre sitting with pain ask yourself What can the breath do that Ive never had it do before And think of the breath in different ways youve never thought of before  coming in and out different parts of the body running in different ways through the body connecting up in different waysSee what you can do to keep yourself entertained with the breath to gladden the mindBecome more proactive toward the pain investigate it be curious about it instead of just passively suffering from itKeeping a good humor helps to put you in a position of powerThats one attitude to ease the burden of enduranceThe second is to have an attitude of infinite goodwillMany of the Buddhas teachings on endurance make this pointAfter he was wounded by Devadatta with a stone sliver in his foot the pain was excruciatingSo he went to lie downMara came up to taunt him Are you mopingAre you drunkAre you a lazybonesWhats your problem here The Buddha replied Im not moping lazy or drunkIm not in a stuporI lie down with sympathy for all beings Thats what minimizes the pain developing a sense of goodwill for everybody even those who may have injured youYou realize that youre not the only person in the world whos suffering and you wish no one any illThat helps to lighten your painThe third attitude is to depersonalize the situation your ability to step back from the situation and not put it into a narrative where youre the victim the person whos sufferingThink of the passage where the Buddha describes the different ways that people can speak to youThey can speak in timely or untimely waysThey can speak with good intentions or bad intentions say words that are true or false  so on down the lineThese are the kinds of speech that exist in the human worldSo when something unpleasant is said to you analyze itAsk yourself Were those words timely or untimelyTrue or falseBeneficial or harmful By analyzing the words in these impersonal terms you pull yourself out of the narrativeRemind yourself This is the human conditionUnpleasant nasty words are nothing unheard ofTheyre happening to people all around the world all the timeAs the Buddha says when people have wronged you have wronged someone you love or have done good things for someone you hate keep reminding yourself What else should I expect This is the human conditionPut things into the larger perspectiveYou can pull yourself out of the condition of being the victim simply by learning how to analyze things in impersonal termsTheres a great passage in the Canon where VenSariputta says If someone says something really hurtful tell yourself Ah an unpleasant sound has made contact at the ear We usually dont think in those termsWe think Why is that person saying that to meHow outrageous can you get We create a narrative that lays more suffering on the mindThe next time someone says something really unpleasant remind yourself An unpleasant sound has made contact at the ear That depersonalizes itPulls you out of itStops you from shooting yourself with arrowsThen as the Buddha says spread thoughts of goodwill to all beings starting with the person whos harmed youKeep spreading those thoughts to include everyone including yourselfAll of this applies to the physical pain that comes up in the meditation as wellPart of the mind says Why am I doing thisWhy am I torturing myself Look at that thought simply as a thought arising and passing awayLook at the pain simply as momentary sensations arising and passing awayAnalyze the thoughts as eventsThen remind yourself If youre sitting here moaning and groaning about the pain youre not really showing goodwill for yourselfGoodwill for yourself means learning how to pull yourself out of the suffering learning how not to identify with it not to glamorize it not to romanticize it not to insist on your right to sufferYoure here to find a way around itThe suffering were trying to gain release from is the suffering caused by the mindAs Ajaan Lee says there are two kinds of suffering the suffering of natural causes which comes from the conditioned nature of things and unnatural suffering which comes from cravingAnd often our craving manifests itself as the narratives we want to tell ourselves about whatevers happeningSo the trick to developing endurance is to learn to look at what the mind is doingLearning how to sit with pain is often a good way of seeing whats happening in the mindThat old image of the watering hole out in the savannah is good to keep in mind If you want to survey the animals in the savannah or take a picture or make a documentary film of the animals in the savannah you dont go wandering around the savannahTheyll hide from youYou go to the watering holeAny animal in the area will have to come to the watering hole at some point during the day or the nightThats when you can observe and take pictures and make your documentaryIts the same with the mindWhen theres pain and youre sitting with it watching it from the point of view of the breath all the unskillful little animals in your mind are going to come up at some point and youre in a great position to observe themYou say Ah this is what anger is like This is how it comes this is how it goesThis is how the victim comes this is how the victim goesThis is how the whining member of the committee comes how it goes You get to see them allAnd as you see them you learn how not to identify with themTry to develop that sense of humor that ability to pull yourself out of the narrative simply by analyzing whats going on in impersonal termsDevelop goodwill for all beingsWhen personal terms do come up develop that sense of goodwill for all as the Buddha says with a mind like earthAgain hes got that humorous story of the man who comes along and tries to dig at the earth and spit on the earth and urinate on the earth saying Be without earth be without earth But of course the man is never going to succeed in making the earth be without earth because earth is so largeYou want to make your mind that large so that no pain  physical or mental  can have an impact with its piddling urine and spitHumor infinite goodwill and the ability to see things in impersonal terms These are the strategies for keeping yourself from shooting those extra arrowsThese are the strategies for helping your endurance become less of a burden and turn into something stable lasting and strongTheres a common perception that meditation doesnt involve any thinkingYou just force the mind to stay alert in the present moment and refuse to get involved in any thoughts at allThen it will settle downThat approach works for some people in some circumstances but not for everyoneThis is why the Buddha gave a wide range of instructions on how to deal with distracting thoughtsJust noting them and dropping them is one way of dealing with them but there are other ways of dealing with them as well many of which require that you think in order to get around themSo its important to know how to use your thinking processes as a part of the meditationOne method that Ajaan Lee recommends is to think about the breath and think about how you think about the breathHe talks about the breath energy throughout the whole body and how the breath can be good or bad for youHe also talks about how to explore the different manifestations of breath energy in the body how to experiment with different ways of perceiving themIn other words get yourself interested in the breath interested in how you relate to the energy in the bodyAs you explore that as you think about it and analyze it and watch it the mind drops its other interests objects and preoccupations and gets absorbed through the process of analysisThis is one of the bases of success vimansa concentration based on analysisBut there are times when the mind will refuse to settle down with the breathIts got other issuesSo there are different ways of dealing with those issuesFirst youve got to figure out what the issues areIf the mind seems restless what is it restless aboutWhat has it stirred upSometimes the agenda lies under the surfaceOne way to bring it up into the light of day is to refuse to think about whatever the issue is and see what part of the mind complains saying This is important youve got to think about this And you can ask it Why Listen to what it has to say both in terms of the content and in the terms of the tone of voiceLook into the assumptions on which that complaint is basedThen analyze the assumptions to disentangle yourself from themYou might ask yourself who in your past thought that way spoke that way someone whose ideas and attitudes you picked up often without questioningWeve picked up lots of unhealthy attitudes from our parents from our teachers from our friends from the media and they keep sloshing around in the mindAjaan Lee talks about the fact that you have germs in your bloodstream and theyre going through your brainMaybe the thoughts going through your brain are their thoughtsEven if you dont resonate with the idea of germs in your brain having thoughts the same basic principle applies to the people in your background Their thoughts have somehow gotten planted in your brainThe fact that the thoughts are planted in your brain isnt your responsibility right now but it is your responsibility if you take them up and chew on themYou have to dissociate yourself from that kind of thinking to ask What are the assumptions behind those thoughtsDo you really believe them Learn how to look at them from the outsideI had the advantage when I was learning how to meditate in Thailand that when Id bring an issue up with Ajaan Fuang hed sometimes give me a quizzical lookHe had never heard any thinking like that beforeAnd just the fact that he regarded as strange the thoughts I regarded as natural helped me realize how much I was a product of my culture of a particular set of circumstances at a particular time in a particular placeAnd its a really good exercise to learn to question your background the ideas you were brought up with the assumptions you carry aroundIf these things are not questioned theyll simply lurk there and eat away at your mind and get in the way of the practiceIt may turn out that after investigating these ideas you decide that they are useful at certain times in certain places but not alwaysAnd especially not if theyre interfering with your meditationYou have to see that theyre not really appropriate for what youre doing right nowThats one way of dealing with thoughts like thatAnother is simply to look at what the thoughts are doing to the mindIf you allow the mind to think in these ways over and over again youre creating mental rutsAre those ruts that you wantDo you want your mind to keep lurching back into those ideas again and again and againAs the ruts get deeper and deeper it gets harder and harder to get outThis is called looking at the drawbacks of that particular thoughtAnother way of dealing with these thoughts is to actively replace them with the opposite thoughtThis is what the recollections taught by the Buddha are useful forIf youre feeling discouraged in your practice you can think about all the members of the Noble Sangha who went through really miserable times in their practice for one reason or another  either outside hardships or just their own inability to get the mind concentratedTheres the story of one monk who decided to commit suicideHe had been practicing for more than yearsAs he said he hadnt had even a fingersnaps worth of concentrationSo he got the razor and everything all readyAnd thats when he came to his senses his mind suddenly gathered into one and settled downAs for us we havent gotten suicidal in our practice yet and I daresay that weve had more than a few fingersnaps worth of concentrationSo you can take comfort from the fact that if he could do it you can do itTheres no need to get discouragedYou can also think about the Noble Sangha when outside circumstances get toughThere are verses in the Theragatha about monks who fall sick out in the wildernessThey have no doctor no medicineSo what do they doThey resolve to develop the factors for awakening the five strengths the five faculties four bases of success and to use those qualities as their medicineTheres also a set of verses about a monk who doesnt get any almsHe asks himself What are you going to do And his answer is Im going to go back to my dwelling and Im going to meditate Its cold outside what are you going to do Im going to use the four immeasurable meditations  limitless goodwill limitless compassion limitless empathetic joy limitless equanimity  to warm the heartThese reflections remind you that when things get difficult you want to develop the minds resources so that you dont just keep obsessing about the difficulties and complaining about how they make it impossible to practiceThere have been people in the past whove been in worse situations than youre in but they were able to practice in spite of that factIn other words you learn how to think in positive ways helpful ways instead of destroying yourself with your thoughtsThere are also reflections on your generosity on your virtue on the fact that youve developed the qualities that make people into devasThose are to remind you that you do have worth that you do have potential in the meditationThese are some of the ways in which thinking is useful in the meditationYou analyze unskillful thinking and you try to replace it with skillful thinkingAs the Buddha said once the mind has settled down with the skillful thinking you can then bring it back to the breath bring it back to contemplation of the body whatever your frame of reference so that you can deepen the concentrationIn Ajaan Maha Boowas analogy this is like trying to cut down a tree in the middle of a forestIf the tree were out in an open meadow thered be no problem cutting it downYoud simply decide which direction you wanted it to go and youd cut it to fall in that directionBut in the forest you have to deal with all the branches that are entangled with the branches of the other treesYou have to cut them first before you can bring the tree downIn other words if you find that your thoughts are entangling you with the world youve got to learn how to think in ways that help disentangle you that cut the intertwining branches whether through seeing the negative side of the thoughts that are pulling you away or actively replacing those negative thoughts with positive thoughts that incline the mind to see the value of the practice to really feel the value of the practice and to give you confidence in your ability to do the practiceToday I asked several people about which stories about the Buddhas life they found most inspiring when they needed confidence and inspiration in the practiceAnd it was interesting to see how widely the stories variedSome people were inspired by the Buddhas physical courageSome were more inspired by his restraint as a teacherSome were inspired by his psychic powers his ability to deal with devas brahmas and MaraSome were more inspired by his ability to deal with simple peopleTheres a great passage in the Theragatha where an outcaste person talks about his lifeHis job was to gather the old wilted flowers at shrines and throw them away one of the lowliest occupations in India at that timeOne day the Buddha comes up and simply stands in front of himThe guy tries to flatten himself against the wall behind him to get out of the Buddhas way but then he begins to realize that thats not why the Buddhas standing thereThe Buddha wants to teach himThe Buddha takes on this outcaste as a student and teaches him to be an arahantThere are lots of ways you can find inspiration in the life of the BuddhaYou have to decide for yourself which story or incident you find most inspiringThe same with the DhammaThe same with the SanghaThere are lots of possibilities thereThis is one way in which reading the Dhamma is usefulTheres a tendency among some meditators to believe that reading gets in the way of your meditationBut reading about good examples reminds you that human beings can do thisThere are human beings whove succeeded in the practiceThere have been in the past and there can still be in the present momentTheres a tendency in modern literature to focus on antiheroes people whose virtue lies in their being frank about their weaknesses  which is a kind of virtue but not the whole story of virtueFor the sake of the practice its more useful to read about people whove succeeded in doing whats difficultTheyre our friends from the pastOne of the definitions of true friends is that they give what is hard to give do what is hard to do sacrifice what is hard to sacrificeThey did that for us  not just for us personally but for everybody in the futureTheres that great story about VenMahaKassapaToward the end of his life the Buddha calls in MahaKassapa and says Look youve been living out in the wilderness living off meager almsYou dont really need to do this anymoreYoure an arahant nowCome and stay near meLive a more comfortable life MahaKassapa says No Ive been doing this all along praising this sort of lifeI want to keep this up as an example for the generations to come In other words he did that for usSo think about that when things get difficultThere are people in the past who wanted to encourage us wanted to see us get the same results from the practice that they gotTake heart from thatOnly when you learn how to think skillfully in this way can you get the mind to a point where its willing to stop thinkingSo remember Not all thinking is badNot all fabrication is badYou have to learn how to fabricate skillfully before you can let go of fabrication and these are some of the ways you can do itAs with so many other issues the Buddha took a middle road when it came to the issue of otherpower and selfpower on the pathOn the one hand theres the famous passage where VenAnanda comes to see the Buddha and exclaims that having admirable friends is half of the practice half of the holy life and the Buddha says Dont say that AnandaHaving admirable friends is the whole of the holy life And the Buddha gives himself as an example saying Without me as your admirable friend you wouldnt be practicing the noble eightfold pathNotice that he doesnt say Im doing it for you He says Im an outside condition He makes it possible for you to practiceIf we didnt have the Buddha if we didnt have the Dhamma to point the way to us where would we be right nowWe wouldnt be here meditating thats for sureWed be off someplace else doing who knows whatAt the same time though theres also the passage where the Buddha says Its up to you to follow the path the Tathagatas only point the way Or the passage where a man comes to see the Buddha and says Why is it that when you teach the path to people they dont all arrive at the goal  implying that theres something wrong with the Buddha as a teacherSo the Buddha responds Have you ever given directions to people to follow the road to RajagahaThe man says YesDo they all get to RajagahaWell some people follow the directions and they get there but others dont and they end up way out westThats something I cant take responsibility forThe Buddha then says that in the same way he cant take responsibility for the fact that some people follow his instructions and achieve the noble attainments while other people dont follow themIn other words its up to each of us to actually put the teachings into practice so that we can get the resultsThe Dhamma were trying to attain is something thats going to be found inside the heartThe Dhamma were listening to right now is pointing to that DhammaThats why the word for Dhamma talk  dhammadesana  literally means pointing to the DhammaThese words are not the DhammaThe words point to a possible attainment inside your heart to the potentials that are inside your heartIts up to you to develop themThe problem of course is that there are many yous in there  lots of different potentials lots of different opinions and intentions lots of different goalsAnd the mind moves from one to anotherWhen you sit down to meditate part of the mind is with the program and part of the mind is not which can be the cause for a lot of frustrationBut you can learn how to use these many selves to your advantageRemember each of your selves is the result of an activity aimed at happinessWe self as a verbWere engaged in selfingIf we had one set self wed be stuck thereThat would be our nature and we wouldnt be able to change itAny changes would have to come from outsideBut fortunately were not stuck with one selfWe have lots of different selves formed around lots of different activities aimed at happinessIf we use these selves properly they can help one another alongThey can provide a perspective on one another so that what one self doesnt see another self can see what one self cant do another self canSo its important that we learn to get all of these different selves working togetherThis is why the Buddha focuses so much attention on the issue of happiness because all of our activities all our selves are aimed at happiness in one form or anotherThey have different understandings of what it might be different strategies for how to get there but theyre all aimed at the same placeA large part of the practice is learning how to get them to work together to understand where true happiness can be foundYoure going to encounter this a lot as you meditateYoure sitting here with the breath and suddenly theres an impulse to go someplace elseYou have to examine the impulse learn how to say No and learn how to make the No stickSometimes you can do that simply by noticing OhHere comes an impulse heading in the wrong direction and the impulse drops awayYoure back with the breathNo problemOther times the impulse to go off goes deeper than thatIts based on a really deep misunderstanding about where happiness can be foundIn cases like that you have to reason with the mindYouve got an old habit that may have worked in some circumstances in the past but its not appropriate right nowThis is why concentration requires some discernmentAs the Buddha once said Theres no jhana without discernment To get the mind to settle down you have to reason with the obstreperous parts that want to go off someplace else to think about other things plan other thingsYou have to reason with that particular set of selves to show them that their notions dont really lead to any true happiness and youre all better off coming backAs you fight off these different distractions you find yourself going deeper and deeper into a lot of the minds misunderstandingsThis is how concentration gives rise to insightOr as the Buddha said Theres no discernment without jhana The two qualities go together they depend on each otherSo we get good instructions hear the Dhamma see the Dhamma practiced in a way thats an inspiring exampleThats the kind of help we get from outsideAs for inside we have to develop the conviction that we can do it and that its really worth doingThis is where the Buddhas teachings on acceptance come inOften we hear that a central part of practice is radical acceptance learning how to accept who you are just as you are and its all okayBut thats making a lot of assumptions right there that there is a whoyouare that you are a certain way that youre going to stay that certain way and its all right to stay that certain way  all of which totally goes against what the Buddha had to teachTo begin with he didnt say that you are a certain way or that youre stuck thereThe question of who you are is something he put asideHe has you focus instead on what you doAnd what are you doingIs it skillful or is it notIf its not skillful then one youve got to admit the fact that its not skillful and two accept the fact you could make your behavior more skillfulThis is the part of acceptance that many of us resistWe may not be happy where we are but for some reason we resist changingThis is the way I am and this is the way Im going to stay That kind of stubborn acceptance the Buddha doesnt encourage at allOr This is the way I do things and Im going to keep on doing them this way Thats a form of clinging  clinging to habits and practices  and its a cause of sufferingWhat the Buddha wants us to accept is the fact that our actions are causing suffering but we dont have to keep acting in those waysWe have the potential to changeMany of us resist thatEven though we know were suffering for some reason we dont want to changeWe disempower ourselvesThe first step in regaining some of that power is to have the conviction that yes the Buddha did gain awakening through his own efforts and yes he did it through developing qualities of mind that we have in a potential form and that we can develop tooThat conviction is meant to be a challenge Are you going to live your life without examining these possibilities without trying to develop these qualitiesIf so youre missing out on a really important opportunityThats what true acceptance is You accept the challenge  for you see that the alternative is continued sufferingYou can also see the Buddhas position on acceptance in the five things he has us reflect on day in and day outThe first four are I am subject to aging subject to illness subject to death subject to separation from all that is dear and appealing to me Thats accepting the fact of suffering in its various formsAnd its not just you not just meEverybody is subject to these thingsBut then the fifth thing he has us accept is that were the owners of our actions heir to our actions born of our actions related through our actions and have our actions as our arbitratorsWhatever we do for good or for evil to that will we fall heirIn other words what were experiencing in the present is the result of our actions past and present and what well experience in the future is also a result of our actionsSo what were experiencing and are going to experience is up to usWe have to accept responsibility There is suffering we are responsible for the suffering that has happened but we also have the potential not to sufferThats another part of conviction another part of the type of acceptance the Buddha has us develop not just accepting where we are but accepting that we bear responsibility for where we areWhen we have the responsibility we have the power to changeAgain some of us resist thatBut where does that resistance lead usIt keeps us stuck in sufferingSo to get out of that suffering you develop conviction that awakening is possible and it can be found through developing qualities you already haveThat leads to the next strength the next empowerment which is persistence energy the effort we put into the practiceWe realize that we can do this and we dont have much time so wed better get right to itAnd stick with itWe practice when we feel like practicing and we also practice when we dontWe cant let our moods be in chargeIf we dont follow the path now who knows when were going to be able to follow itIt doesnt get easier with age you knowAnd nobody else can do it for usOther people can point out the way other people can inspire us with their example but if were going to see the results we have to do the actionsWe have to train the mind train our intentionsThis takes time so we have to stick with itThis leads to the third strength or the third empowerment which is mindfulness the ability to keep these facts in mindYou keep reminding yourself Regardless of what you want to do this is the way things areIf you dont work at the practice now you may not have the time in the future so youve got to remember to keep working at it now keep at it now keep at it nowFortunately its not all work not all strenuous effortIf youre mindful and alert as you try to develop skillful qualities and let go of unskillful ones the mind comes to concentrationAnd concentration is characterized by pleasure rapture equanimity a strong sense of wellbeingThis is what gives us energy on the pathWhen the Buddha gives analogies for the different factors of the path he often compares concentration to foodWe feed on rapture he says like the radiant gods Or when he compares our practice to a frontier fortress he compares right concentration to the different stores of foods that keep the soldiers strong and well nourishedThe pleasure of the concentration becomes a form of strength you can develop insideBased on that strength you can strengthen your discernment for the stillness and satisfaction of concentration enable you to perform the duties of discernment starting with the ability to see clearly where suffering is arising and whats arising with itYou notice What are you doing when theres suffering in the mindWhen the suffering goes what did you just doWhat did you stop doingWhat did you just changeYou can see suffering arising and passing away but more importantly you can see its causes arising and passing awayThat way you understandThis understanding is what allows you to cut through the causes with more and more precision to get more skillful at all the duties of the four noble truthsWhen youre really skilled at these things dropping the obsessions that cause suffering the mind grows lighter and lighterIts unburdenedYou dont have to waste your energy carrying the weight of suffering aroundThese are all strengths we can develop within a kind of inner power we can develop once we know the path and are convinced that it can be done  and that we can do itSo its important to accept that we have these potentials that whatever way we behave if its unskillful it can be changedAs the Buddha once said if it werent possible to abandon unskillful actions and to develop skillful ones he wouldnt teach us to do these thingsBut it is possibleThis is why he has you focus on the issue of action what you can do as opposed to what you are or what you can do now as opposed to what youve habitually been doing in the pastHabits can be changedIf you find yourself resisting that fact you have to ask yourself whyIs it from lazinessFrom prideAnd why do we engage in laziness why do we engage in prideWhat do we get out of it what do we gainThese things may make us feel good in the present moment but do they really make us happyDo they really lead to wellbeingYou have to see that every action you take every choice you make is made for the purpose of happinessBut often its misdirected illadvisedAnd so given that every you is aimed at happiness the wiser yous can reason strategically with the unskillful yous until you win them overThats the kind of internal work we all have to doThis is how we take advantage of all our many selvesAccept that we have these good potentialsAnd accept the fact that if we dont develop them were going to keep on sufferingSo when we talk about acceptance in the Buddhas teachings its not simply accepting what you areThe Buddha has you accept where you are  ie youre stuck in suffering  but you dont have to stay thereAccept that you have the potential to go beyond suffering through training your actions training your intentions training the mindWe have the Buddha and his Sangha of noble disciples as our examplesWe have the Dhamma as our guideThats the outside help the outside powerThe inside power is the determination we can generate from within as we follow their example as we bring our actions in line with the guidance provided by the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the DhammaThis is the teaching thats stressed over and over again in the forest tradition You dont change the Dhamma to suit yourself you change yourself to fit with the Dhamma ie you change your actions to fall in line with the DhammaThats how you develop your inner powers that can lead to true happiness the happiness we all wantParts of us may resist but we learn how to reason with those parts reason with those attitudesAs we do well find that everything convergesAll the factors of the path come togetherAnd at that point it doesnt really matter whether it was because of outside help or inside help ie our inner strengthThe fact is that weve reached release and thats all that mattersSo accept that thats a possibility and see where it takes youWe sit here focused on the breath mindful of the breath alertWe want to make sure were not just mindful and alert for a few breaths and then off someplace elseWe want to stay mindful and alert for the whole hourAnd then at the end of the hour when you get up you want to maintain that mindfulness and alertness as long as youre awakeThat requires ardency the willingness to give energy to the practice with the confidence that if you do it in the proper way in a skillful way  and thats what ardency is all about its not just plain old effort its skillful effort  if your effort is skillful then you gain energy in returnBut you first have to be willing to make the investmentThat often means going through periods when the effort is not yet skillful and wondering if its ever going to get rightThis is where your determination sees you throughIn fact all of the qualities that are called paramis or perfections come into play hereThe practice is not simply a matter of techniqueIt requires developing your heart as well as your mindWe think of the heart and mind as two separate things but in almost all the languages where Buddhism has been practiced the words for heart and mind tend to blur into each otherCitta in Pali is used in some cases where it means mind and in some where it means heartSo youre not just training your mind here youre training your heart as wellWhich means that meditation is not just a matter of techniques but also a matter of strengthening the inner qualities that allow you to give yourself to the practice in a wholehearted way in the hopes that the whole heart and whole mind will benefitThis is what the teachings about the perfections are all about They focus on the qualities of the heart and mind that you need to bring to the practice and are going to get developed in the practiceTheyre an excellent framework for looking at the practice as a lifetime process not simply what you do when youre on retreatTheyre a way of enabling you to answer the question What are you going to do with your lifeWhat do you want out of your lifeWhen you look back in your life as death is approaching what do you want to look back onAnd what do you want to take with you as a result of having lived this lifeIf you focus your attention simply on pleasures you wont have anything at that point  just memories of the pleasures which may or may not be pleasant memoriesOr you may decide that you want to leave your mark to accomplish something in the world but thats a pretty risky proposition because the world has its pendulum swingsThe efforts you make might come just at the end of a pendulum swing thats going to turn around and wipe out everything youve doneI once listened to a lawyer who had worked his way up through the government echelonsHed argued a lot of civil rights cases back in the era when the Supreme Court was liberalBut then he lived long enough to see the pendulum swing back and get conservative againHe lived to see many of the things he had worked for dismantledI once went with my father to visit our old home in CharlottesvilleIt was a house wed built ourselvesWe had worked with the architect got the design we wantedAnd even though we hired some builders Dad did a lot of the carpentry work we as a family did the painting  all the things we could do to help save money in building the houseSo one day some years after we had moved away I went with my father and older brother to visit CharlottesvilleAs we swung by the house we saw that the current owners werent taking proper care of itThe roof was beginning to rot through in some spotsWe drove back dropped my brother off and then it was just my Dad and meAs he was driving he said You know I have nothing to show for my life And he went through all the times he had been a farmer spent all that time and energy growing his potatoes and then was paid money by the government to destroy the crops to help keep up the price of potatoesHed gotten a job in the government and worked hard to make proposals that Congress then porkbarreled beyond recognitionAnd then finally a president came in and wiped out the council he was working onThinking about what he said made me realize that if you look for your accomplishments in the world outside they can easily get erasedSo if were not here just for our own personal pleasures or to leave a mark in the world what are we here forWell the teaching on the perfections points you to the mindYou want to be here to develop qualities of the mindYou may not want to be here but here you are so what are you going to do about itWhat are you going to get out of thisTheres a lot of suffering involved in being a human being  and this is one of the better planes of existence  so what will you have to show for your lifeIf youve worked on qualities of the mind they carry overTheyre an accomplishment thats entirely within your powerThats what were working on hereIts good to keep that perspective in mindThe qualities may not grow as quickly as wed like but thats what the quality of patience is for to learn how to stick with something even through frustration even through difficultyIn the course of that you may find yourself getting distracted with ideas of what else might be more pleasant Thats what the qualities of determination and truthfulness are forIn fact determination seems to underlie all the perfectionsThere are four aspects to determinationYou use your discernment to decide what you want to accomplish to see how it best might be accomplished and then you stick with itTo stick with it requires truthfulness which doesnt mean just telling the truth it means that once youve made up your mind you really stick with what youve decided to doYoure true to yourselfYoure not a traitor to yourselfThats whatll see you throughThis is going to involve some renunciation and require that you develop a sense of calm within the renunciation because there are many possible pleasures in this lifeIf you try to gather up all of them you go crazyOnce a year I head up to the Bay Area where there are still traces of the human potential movementTheres a strong sense up there that you can and should actualize your full potential as a human being by striving for excellence in all areas of your life becoming physically strong and healthy mentally sharp artistically creative socially enlightened sexually active politically active spiritually advancedPeople rarely stop to consider that excellence in one area might actually cancel out or preclude excellence in anotherIn the back of their minds theres always the thought Well if Im not happy its because Im not trying hard enough in every possible direction Thats crazymakingYouve got to focus on whats really worthwhile in life which means resisting a lot of the currents in our culture because our culture seems to be all about distraction in all directions  or as someone once put it discursive noiseYoure the one who has to focus your mind to keep it calmly centered and oncourse in the midst of all thisYoure the one who has to decide on your goals and to realize that youll have to give up some of the things you like in order to attain those goalsIve told you the story about the Chinese woman teaching her stepdaughter while they were playing chess that if you want to be happy in life you have to decide that theres one thing you want more than anything else and you have to be willing to sacrifice everything else for that one thingThat of course was a lesson the stepdaughter didnt want to hearWhat she did notice though was that her stepmother was losing chess pieces all over the boardSo she decided Well heres my chance to beat my stepmother in chess She started playing more aggressively but it turned out to be a trapThe stepmother had been sacrificing her pieces strategically to lure the girl in and then she checkmated herOf course the way the stepmother played chess was an illustration of the principle she was trying to teachIf youre willing to sacrifice some pawns and knights and other pieces here and there you can winThats how we should live our lives realizing we cant keep all our pawns and win at the same timeWe have to make our choicesThere are a lot of eitherors in lifeWe prefer the bothand  and sometimes not just the bothandWe want the bothandandandandandBut if you really want to have something to show for your life youve got to recognize where its strictly eitherorYouve got to decide that there are important qualities in the mind that have to take top priority over everything elsePriorityThats one of the possible meanings of the word parami which is usually translated as perfection Parami is one of those words that nobody really knows why it was chosen or what it meansIt doesnt appear in any of the Buddhas own teachings but was a later development in the traditionOne of the possible meanings of parami is related to parama which means to be foremostAnd the idea of foremost can be understood in two ways One is that you try to become really excellent and foremost in these particular qualities of the mind and two you want to give them top priority make them foremost in your lifeWhen youre working on a job whether or not the job succeeds you want to be sure to develop qualities like patience truthfulness determination and discernment regardlessSometimes the success of the job may depend on factors totally beyond your controlBut patience is something you can develop determination is something you can develop regardless of outside circumstancesSo remember as you meditate its not just a matter of following a techniqueYou have to apply yourself fullyYou have to give your whole heart to thisAnd as you give your whole heart your heart gains wholenessWhen you give questions of the wise heart top priority the heart does become excellentIts good to look at your life and ask yourself What do I want to accomplish with this life You dont know how many years you have left but you do know you have right nowAnd then the next right now and the nextSo as long as the right nows are coming use them as an opportunity to develop these qualities of the heart because these are the things that make human life worthwhileYears back I taught a course on the forest tradition at a Buddhist study centerThe first evening of the course after making some general remarks I gave the people attending the course their first assignment to go back to their rooms and clean them up arranging everything very neatlyThats where a lot of the training in the forest beginsWherever you go you try to be neatWhat this teaches you in a very concrete way is to be intent on what you do to try to pare down your activities so that the few activities you do you do carefully heedfully with circumspectionThis is a good habit to develop as a meditator regardless of whether youre a monk or a laypersonAs the Buddha said this is one of the things to be done by one who is skilled in aims be a person of few activitiesThis doesnt mean being lazyIt means deciding whats really important in life and focusing your energies thereAs for the things that fritter away your time just drop themThat simplifies life a lotIts the oldfashioned way of simplifying thingsThe modern ways of simplifying things of course is to buy a magazine that tells you what to buy to simplify your lifeBut the Buddhas way is the old way to see which activities youre engaged in that get the mind stirred up and learn how to abandon themAnd activities here means everything from the way you look at things the way you listen to things to the actual responsibilities you take onThe bottom line for a meditator when doing any of these things is to ask yourself How does this affect the state of your mindThis is very different from the bottom line in the rest of the worldThere if youre a layperson you have to pay attention to how much money and how many people you need to survive in physical comfortBut when you start practicing the question is How much do you really need for mental comfort for the mind to find the happiness that comes from peace and tranquilityIf youre engaged in work that takes up a lot of your time and energy then even though it may provide a comfortable income its really not conducive to the practiceYou want to find a job that you like that you enjoy doing so that its not pure drudgery but that also gives you time to practice energy to practice so your time isnt frittered away frittered awayThis last weekend I was with an old friend from college and it was sad to see how much of his life was taken up by his jobLike so many people his question was How much longer did he have to work so that he could finally afford to retire and then really do what he wanted to doAnd you always wonder Will the person survive to retirementThats a scary thoughtYou save up and save up but then you dont live to enjoy what youve savedIn the meantime your time is wasted  maybe not totally wasted but you dont get as much out of it as you could haveWhat this means is that as a meditator you dont just take the meditation and squeeze it into the cracks of your life as it isYouve got to ask yourself How can I live my life in such a way that it will be more conducive to the practice to give more space to the meditation so that the meditation the state of your mind can become the bottom lineThis requires that you take a skeptical look at the things that society at large views as importantAs the Buddha said basically what the world has to offer is just eight things material gain material loss status loss of status praise criticism pleasure and painThats itThats what the world has to offerAnd as you notice those things come in pairsYou dont get the good side without the bad sideThey trade places back and forthIf you make your happiness depend on things like this youre setting yourself up for a fallAnd yet we let these things  especially issues of status and praise  really pull us inSo youve got to learn how to look at them with a jaundiced eyeThink about the dangers that come from having a high status having the respect of other people because in many cases their respect is really not worth that muchThey respect you because they want to get something out of youYou have to work on seeing through thatApproach society at large as an anthropologist wouldThink of yourself as coming down from the planet Mars as an anthropologist who wants to see how these strange earthlings think how they behave so that they dont snare you with their valuesAnd you dont snare yourself with their valuesIf you can maintain this attitude you can cut through a lot of garbageAs Ajaan Fuang used to say nobody paid you to be born youre not here dependent on anybody elses approvalYoure here because you want to find true happinessWhether other people approve or not thats their businessWhen you think in this way you can start making choices that really are in your true best interest without getting snagged on whether other people approve whether it looks strange in their eyes or you think it might look strange in their eyesWhen you can cut through these eight ways of the world you find that a lot of the obstacles to practice get cleared out of the waySo it helps to see both gain and loss as having good and bad sidesWhen theres material loss you find out who your true friends areWhen you lose status as Ajaan Lee says if they call you a dog well dogs dont have any lawsThey can go wherever they like and do whatever they want to doWhen people criticize you it gives you a chance to reflect on yourself Is what they say trueIf it is youve learned something important about yourselfIf its not then youve learned something important about themAs for pain we all know that the Buddha said that pain suffering stress  however you translate dukkha  is a noble truthTheres a lot to be learned thereSo try to face the ways of the world with equanimity and not let yourself get sucked into the narratives or systems of values that people use to tie you in to keep you going along with their view of the worldAfter all they want to make sure that everyone around them shares the same values so that they can feel comfortable so they dont have to face the huge abyss inside their hearts the huge emptiness the huge void when those values are exposed for what they areAnd their way of avoiding that is to rest assured that everybody else believes the way they do thinks the way they do and acts the way they doBut youre not performing them any service by playing alongThey may not like it if you dont play along but they have to learn to accept thatMaybe they can learn from itIf they dont learn from it well you cant force them to learnBut you cant allow their attitudes to run your lifeThis is a huge area your reaction to other peoples praise and criticism the respect or lack of respect they give youIts so important that as the Buddha said one of the signs of a person whos reached nibbana is that he or she doesnt reverberate in response to criticismHe compares the awakened mind to a gong thats been crackedYou hit the gong and theres no soundOr there may be little plunk but it doesnt reverberate doesnt continue ringingThe ability to train your mind so that it doesnt keep ringing with the words of other people Thats a really essential part of the practiceA lot of societies have rites of passage where a person approaching adulthood is sent out to be aloneFor many people its the first time in their lives theyve ever really been by themselvesIt gives them a chance to gain a sense of who they are and what they really think about things what they feel inspired to do with their livesIn our society we lack thatIt may be why most people never really grow upSo try to make the meditation your rite of passage the time when youre alone and can sort things out from a mature position as to what you really believe in and what you dontThe first year when I went back to Thailand to ordain I was sorting through a lot of attitudes and ideas I had picked up from whoknowswhere all through the years of my lifeI was far enough away and had enough time for myself so that I could really look at these things and decide what I really believed in what I didntAnd meditation gives you a good place to stand so you can watch these things without getting caught up in themWhen youre meditating all thoughts are suspect until they show they can help you with staying with the breath or understanding whats going on in the mindOnly then do you admit them into the meditationBut everything else gets called into questionAnd this is a useful attitude to maintain even when youre not meditatingThe press of society makes it difficult but if youre really serious about your true happiness youve got to press back to develop the ability to question things that youve believed for a long timeIf you simply stay with other people who share similar attitudes that tends to reinforce old ideas reinforce old valuesSo youve got to be doubly careful about thatAnd when you decide that you dont agree with societys values learn to do it in a way thats not confrontationalAfter all youre going your own wayYoure not a permanent earthlingYoure not here to settle down for goodYoure here primarily to practice to train your mindIf having trained your mind you can help other people thats fineBut if you cant make sure that at least you get your own mind in shapeAs Ajaan Suwat used to say whether we get other people to come here doesnt matter as long as we get ourselves ie that we train ourselves and get results from the trainingThats what mattersSo learn to foster a little space of separation between you and the values of society at largeAjaan Mun was often criticized for not following the old Thai monastic customs old Laotian monastic customsPeople said Why arent you doing it the Thai wayWhy arent you doing it the Lao wayWhat is it with these dhutanga practices youre followingIts just not the way other people do things And he replied Well the ways the Thais do things the ways the Laos do things are all the customs of people with defilements This point applies to the customs of every society in the world Asian or notHe was more interested in the customs of the noble ones to delight in developing to delight in abandoning ie to delight in developing skillful qualities and to delight in abandoning unskillful qualitiesThat attitude right there flies right in the face of most of human societyBut if you can hold to it it gives you space it gives you the proper orientation so that as you go through life and learn to be more selfreliant in your meditation you really do have your own compassAnd you can make sure that it always points due NorthTheres a short verse in the Canon where a monks sitting in his hut during a rainstorm and saying My hut is wellthatched so go ahead and rain as much as youd like Thats a symbol for a mind thats well trainedIt can deal with any situationNo matter how good or how bad things are outside the mind is protectedThe good and bad things cant penetrate itThe Pali term for those things outside is lokadhamma the dhammas of the worldMost peoples minds are not simply penetrated by these things theyre totally flooded totally overwhelmedGain loss status loss of status praise criticism pleasure and pain These things are constantly raining down on us and most people are out in the open totally exposed with no protection at all thinking that gain must be good loss must be bad status is good loss of status is bad praise is good criticism is bad pleasure is good pain is badSo the mind is totally overwhelmed by whatever comes its way hoping that the good things will last and the bad things will stay awayIts trying to dodge the bad raindrops and gather up the good onesBut as we all know these good and bad things come in pairsAnd none of them last foreverThey keep changingThis is why we need to train the mind so that we can separate ourselves from them so that we can have the wellthatched roof that protects us from the rain and the wellsealed walls that protect us from the windPart of the process is just learning to get yourself inside the hut in other words learning how not to identify with the dhammas of the worldTheres a great story that Ajaan Fuang once toldHe was out in the woods and as evening fell he set up his umbrella tent basically an umbrella with a mosquito net hanging from itNow when you set up your umbrella tent as a forest monk you make a vow that once youve set it up youre not going to moveYoure not going to relocate no matter what  which means that you have to be very careful before you set it upYou check the weatherYou look all around the area to see if there are any ants or other insects that might bother youOnly then do you set up your umbrella tentNow that evening he said he saw no clouds at all in the sky so he figured itd be a nice night to stay out in the openIn a case like that you run a line from one tree to anotherYou hang your tent from the lineThen in the middle of night he didnt know where it came from but a huge storm blew upSo he immediately gathered all of his robes except for his lower robe and put them in his bowl so theyd stay dryAnd then he just sat there wearing one lower robe as the cold wind and rain blew in through the mosquito nettingThe theme of his meditation was The body may be wet but the mind isnt wetThe body may be wet but the mind isnt wet And staying with that theme he was able to get the mind to settle down and be still to stay not wet throughout the nightIn other words he didnt dwell on the theme of the wetness out there or the wetness of his body  in terms of identifying with things outside the body counts as outside as wellHe didnt take the wetness into his mindThats how he got through the nightSo an important part of protecting yourself from the rain of the world is learning how not to identify with things that are subject to gain and loss status and loss of statusDont make them part of your selfidentityLearn how to see them simply as lokadhammas aspects of the worldTheyre not aspects of your mindIf you dont identify with them youre not exposed to themThats when you can learn how to use them wisely for they can be tools all of themThe usefulness of gain status praise and pleasure is obvious although we usually dont use them very skillfully which means that we dont get much actual goodness out of themWhen gain comes people tend to identify with itThey make it part of their selfimage and do unskillful things with it rather than seeing it as something of the world that has temporarily come their wayThe wise question to ask when gain comes your way is How are you going to squeeze the best use out of it This doesnt mean squeezing as much pleasure as you canIt means squeezing what is actually usefulHow can you use you gains to train your mindWhats the best way to be generous with themWhats the most discerning way to help other people with themWhat other good qualities can you derive from using those gains wiselyWhen loss comes what can you learn from thatThere are good lessons to be learned from loss you know as long as you dont keep your identity all tied up in the lossOne good lesson is Who are your true friendsWho are the people who are willing to help you even though they cant see any immediate gain coming from itThats a good lesson to learnWhen youre going around wealthy you dont know who your friends areYoure exposedIve known people born into extremely wealthy and powerful familiesThey all seem very wary and uncertain as to whom they can trust  and with good reasonThere are always people trying to take advantage of them one way or anotherSo going through periods of loss is good for sorting out who your friends areIt also teaches you to be ingenious and resourceful in making the most of what few things you do haveA similar principle applies to status and loss of statusWhen you gain status youre gaining in powerWhats the best use of that powerIn other words what will give the greatest longterm benefits to yourself and the world at largeWhen youve lost that status again you learn who your friends are and you learn to be resourceful in keeping up your good spirits in spite of the worlds disregardWhen praise comes whats the best use of the praiseIts not to let yourself get all puffed up thinking that youre already good enoughIts to let you know that your goodness is appreciated its to encourage you to keep on doing good and trying to do betterCriticism even though we dont like it tends to be a lot more useful than praise and for two reasonsOne you may actually learn things about yourself that you otherwise wouldnt knowWe tend to be very blind to our weaknesses our failings the areas where we really need to do workPart of us may know but we figure that as long as nobody else is noticing it doesnt really matterSo its good to get criticism to help you realize that people are noticingYouve gone out of bounds or youre lacking something that really does matterAs the Buddha said when someone points out one of your faults regard that person as someone who has pointed out treasureYouve got something you can work onAs for the criticism thats not true well youve learned something about the person who criticized you which is always a useful lessonIt may not be a lesson you want to learn or like to learn but its good to know who has a grudge against you who is unfair to youIts a good lesson to learnAs for pleasure and pain notice how the Buddha uses them because they both have their usesWe tend to take pleasure as a goal in and of itselfWe want as much pleasure as possible but this gets us in a lot of troubleNot that pleasure is bad in and of itself just that were pretty indiscriminate in how we relate to pleasuresThe Buddha has us sort out which kinds of pleasure are actually harmful and which ones are harmlessThe main harmless ones are those based on getting the mind into concentration because this is a pleasure where youre not in conflict with anybodyWhen youre sitting here looking at your breath nobody is trying to elbow you out of the way so that they can hog your breathIts totally yoursIts an entire field open for you to explore to reap what pleasure you canAnd thats a very rare kind of pleasure in the worldYoure not creating any bad kamma with anybodyYoure not creating any unskillful mental statesThere may be a slight attachment to the pleasure of concentration even a strong attachment but its a healthy attachmentYou sometimes hear warnings about the dangers of concentration but the danger of concentration lies in wrong concentration concentration devoid of mindfulness concentration devoid of alertness concentration based on ulterior motives  to exert power over others to win their respect  or wrong viewBut concentration as a mental factor in itself is neither good nor badThe issue is with how much mindfulness and alertness it has how you understand it what youre trying to get out of itThat makes all the differenceAnd the dangers of concentration are much less than the dangers of all the sensual passions were otherwise attached toIn the Canon the Buddha has long long lists of the dangers of passion for sensual pleasuresBut as for the dangers of concentration you have to search really hard to find a sutta that talks about themThe primary sutta that does simply notes that once youve got your mind in concentration then when you try to incline it toward letting go of your identity views the mind may not leap up at the idea of letting goIn other words youre still attached to the concentrationBut again the fault is not with the concentration its with your unwillingness to let it goCompare that with the dangers of sensual pleasures and passions When people are enmeshed in sensual passions their minds certainly dont incline to letting go of identity viewsPeople kill one another over sensual pleasuresWe have wars over sensual pleasuresSocieties break apart over sensual pleasuresFamilies break apartPeople work themselves to deathOr in their quest for wealth they push themselves to all sorts of extremesIve recently been reading about Arctic explorationThe dream of gold up in the Arctic killed who knows how many peopleBut nobody gets killed over jhanaSo its a useful pleasure a healthy pleasure blamelessIts part of the pathYou learn to use this pleasure to get the mind in a position where it can really look into the flip side of pleasure  pain  which the Buddha said is a noble truthWhen the mind is well fed with a skillful sense of wellbeing its ready for what the Buddha said is the true task with regard to stress and pain which is to comprehend itIf youre afraid of pain if you run away from it if you try to push it away youre not going to comprehend itComprehending comes from looking at it steadily seeing it for what it is and seeing where youre still passionate for things that cause stress that cause painOnce you learn how to feel dispassion for those things thats when youve really comprehended stressThe pleasure of concentration is what allows you to look at pain to the point of comprehending itSo the important point with regard to all these dhammas of the world is learning how to use themThey do have their uses as long as you dont identify with themThey are tools you can useIts like the water of rainInstead of getting soaked by it you learn how to take the runoff from the roof and store it in jars you learn how to build a holding tank or a pondThen you can use the rainwater to drink to bathe yourself to irrigate your cropsThen the water is beneficialIn other words water does have its uses at the right time as long as youre not exposed to the rain soaking it up all the time letting it penetrate your bones shivering and catching your death of coldSo as were meditating were trying to develop that wellthatched roof the ability to keep the mind focused on the breath and the right attitudes that allow us to see these affairs of the world for what they areTheyre not really us not really ours theyre just part of the worldTheyre like moneyYou may have money in your pocket but its not really yoursIts printed by the governmentYou look at the money and see Does it have your name written on itWell no its got other peoples namesEven with a credit card that does have your name on it The banks name is also on it and the banks name is biggerIts in charge of what you can and cant do with the cardAs for the value of the money the government and the banks can change it whenever they wantIf they wanted to call it back they could do itIn the meantime while youve got it you use itAnd you try to use it as wisely as possible with the realization that its not really yours to keep its a part of the worldOnce you can make that distinction you find it a lot easier to live in the world and not soak up all the craziness of the worldYou can stay warm and dry in your hutIts well thatchedThe rain may be falling all around but it cant penetrate the roofYou can set out jars to gather up the runoff and put it in a tank get some use out of it which is much wiser than just going out walking in the rain keeping yourself exposed all the time without any shelter at allSo youre aiming at a combination of two things having this place to stay with the breath and having the right attitudes toward all the things that would pull you awayThats how you learn how to thatch your roof and stay under it for your protectionWe live in a conditioned world which means that we have to learn how to live with limitationsSome conditions open up possibilities others close them offAnd our range of limitations fluctuates all the time as if we were living on a raft in the ocean with the waves rising and falling every which waySometimes theyre small waves sometimes big waves sometimes huge waves that overwhelm usSometimes the currents in the ocean push us in the direction we want to go sometimes in the opposite directionWhen thats the case we have to fight themSometimes we can win the fight sometimes we cantThis is why people go crazy  because everything is so complex and uncertainTheyve done experiments where they put pigeons in boxes each box with a green button and a red buttonIn some of the boxes when the pigeon presses the green button it gets food when it presses the red button it doesnt get anythingThose pigeons are very happy and well adjustedIn other boxes though the pigeon will sometimes get food when it pushes the green button and sometimes not sometimes itll get food when it pushes the red button and sometimes notThose pigeons go crazySo we have to learn how to not go crazy with all these fluctuationsLook for patterns in your life because they are there  complex but theyre thereAnd learn how to push against your limitationsIf you give up entirely you live a totally passive life and simply become a victim of eventsIn other words you say Well my mind is the way it isTheres no way I can change itGreed anger and delusion are natural I just have to accept them if I want to be happy Thats totally giving inYour raft on the ocean gets tossed wherever the currents and the waves may go and you never get to shoreIf on the other hand you simply go on the force of belief believing that you have an unlimited power to go in whichever direction you want you end up living in a total fantasy worldAnd then the clash of your fantasy world with the actual world can wipe you out as wellSo we have to learn how to read the currents how to anticipate the waves all of which requires being really observantThis is one of the reasons why we meditate to develop our powers of observation so we can gain a sense of where our other powers lie of what we can and cannot accomplishThis involves recognizing when weve run up against a wall so that we can turn around and focus our energies in the directions that will get us to shoreOur whole sense of who we are comes from the fact that as children we learned how to test the limitations we ran into what things could we control what things were beyond our controlThis is why we started to identify with the bodyThe body wasnt just a mass of pleasures and painsIt also seemed to be at least somewhat under our controlWe learned how to move our fingers how to grasp things how to stand up and walkWe kept pushing the limitsAnd for a while the limits seemed to give way to our pushingWe had more and more things under controlThen of course as you get older things turn around in the other direction and the limits start pushing backIn some cases you can develop a skill that you can keep working at throughout your life but those are rareWith most skills you get to the point where you peak and then find yourself less and less able to manage themAs the body gets older it begins to get creaky here and painful thereFinally it gets to the point you cant control it at allSo you have to learn how to make the most of it while youve got whatever control you can manageWhat this means is that we identify with whatever we seem to have power over Those things are us theyre ours We do this in many different waysOur sense of who we are is something we keep creating for each different situation and its good to learn how to be fluid in that skill of identifying yourselfIf you come into a situation with fixed preconceived notions about who you are or what you are that can become a major limitationIn other words you turn yourself into a beingAs the Buddha said when you become a being you identify with form feeling perception fabrications or consciousness of particular kindsAnd whatever way you identify yourself thats how you limit yourselfYou gain certain powers by bringing those things under your control but you also take on certain limitationsThose limitations may not be getting in the way of the particular task you want to do but if you take one particular idea of who you are and try to apply it everywhere you begin to see where the limitations areAnd of course one big limitation is always thereAs the Buddha once said What is oneAll beings subsist on food Once you become a being youve got to feed the things you identify withThat means youre tied not only to what you identify with but also to your sources of foodYoure tied to the process of feeding and theres no way that feeding is not going to harm other beings somewhere whether youre feeding off them physically or emotionallyThats a huge limitation right thereWed like to think that we can be beings of infinite love and harmlessness radiating beams of infinite compassion and empathetic joy in all directionsBut if part of you is feeding that places a limitation on how totally harmless you can beSo the idea is to learn how to develop different ways of identifying your powers and using them so that ultimately you get to the point where you dont have to be a being anymore where you dont have to identify yourself with anything and you dont have to feedThe important obstacle here is that you just cant will yourself into that positionYou can get there only by learning to be skillful which takes effort and timeBut once you get there theres total freedom from limitationThats the one constant in all of the Buddhas discussions of nibbana the most positive statement he makes about it total freedomOften he describes nibbana indirectly in terms of analogies and similes but total freedom total limitlessness is his most direct description of the goalTo get there youve got to explore your powers what you can and cant do within the realm of conditioned realityTheres a useful story to reflect on in connection with thisIts a little fable in the novel The Once and Future King by THWhiteI dont know if you know the bookIts a retelling of the Arthurian legendThe first book in the novel The Sword in the Stone  Walt Disney made a movie of it  tells the story of young Warts childhood up to the point where he pulls the sword out of the stone and so becomes Arthur King of EnglandAs part of Warts training leading up to that event Merlin the magician turns him into different kinds of animals so that he can learn lessons from animals such as ants geese and fishIn one of the last transformations Wart is turned into a badger and sent down to meet an older badger in his burrowIt turns out that the old badger is like an Oxford don with his den full of papersHes written a thesis on why human beings are better off than animals his telling of the creation mythOn day number five according to the badger God created all the animals but didnt create them in their final formHe created them as embryosThen he lined up all the little embryos and said All right you little embryos Im going to give you a boonYou can exchange any of your body parts for toolsIf you want you can exchange your mouths for scissors or your feet for hoes or your arms for wings any kind of tool you think is going to be useful for surviving in the worldBut remember once youve made your choice youll have to live with itYou cant change backSo the animals thought for two days about what tools they might want and then one by one asked for their boonsThe badgers for instance asked to turn their skin into shields and their forearms into garden forksAnd so on down the lineSome of the embryos wanted wings some wanted tailsWhatever tools they asked for God equipped their bodies permanently with the tools until the only embryo remaining was manSo finally God said Well our little man youve thought long and hard about your choiceWhat tools do you want And the little manembryo said I think Id rather use tools than be a toolId rather learn how to make them learn how to master all kinds of different tools rather than just limiting myself permanently to one or two builtin toolsAh God said youve guessed our riddleBecause you have the intelligence to want to use tools rather than be a tool you get to have dominion over the other animalsThat was the badgers creation mythAnd when you strip it of its theistic trappings it makes a good point If you identify yourself with a particular tool all the time you get limited to that toolOne of the animals in the badgers myth was a toad in the Antipodes who traded its whole body for blotting paperIt could soak up water when there was rain and just hold it throughout the dry seasonThat would help it survive in a place where theres infrequent rain but thats pretty much the limit of its abilitiesHuman beings on the other hand can make toolsThey can use different tools for different situations and as a result can go many places and accomplish many many thingsThats a lesson we have to learn as meditators that whoyouare is a toolIts something youve fabricated for a particular set of circumstances and it may work perfectly well for those circumstancesBut if you hold onto that tool all the time its like turning yourself into a hammer and then limiting yourself to the habit of hammering away at everything you meetBut there are bound to be times when what you really need is a saw or a chisel or a wrenchWhen it finally dawns on you that being a hammer leaves you pretty miserable you may decide that you dont want to be anything at allSo you throw away your hammerBut that doesnt work either because there are times when youll need a hammerThe trick is learning to come to a particular situation without a preconceived notion of who you are of who you want to be and then trying to squeeze that into the situation or squeeze a situation to fit your idea of who you areInstead youve got to learn how to look at the situation for what it is what its potentials are and then decide what to do to maximize those potentials in the most skillful way right then and thereYou then look at what powers you have and turn them into the tools youre going to need for that particular actionEven your sense of self can be a tool and you have many different senses of selfIf you learn how to pick them up put them down and have them at hand when you need them then you have a whole chest of toolsAt the same time youre not weighed down by your toolsIts like having a tool chest floating behind you within reach wherever you goIn this way you can deal a lot more effectively with the many limitations we face as human beings in trying to find happinessThe Buddha talks about three basic ways of finding happiness generosity virtue and meditationThese are all tools but they each have their different limitationsGenerosity is sometimes limited by how much time you have how much energy and of course the material resources you can draw onYou have to learn to be very judicious in how you apply your resourcesYou cant pour them all into one basket because then youll have nothing left when you need them for other purposesSo even though were taught to have limitless goodwill limitless compassion limitless empathetic joy for all beings theres only so much we can actually give to any particular being in any particular situationThat creates a distance between an attitude you can develop and your ability to act on that attitudeThis is where equanimity comes in when you realize that there are certain areas where you simply cant make a difference or areas where you can make a difference but theyre going to require timeYou have to learn how to husband your resources so you can devote yourself to that task for whatever amount of time its going to requireThen theres virtueIt too has its limitationsAs Ive already noted once youre a being you have to feedSo its impossible for any of us to be totally harmlessBut we can focus on the areas where its really important to develop harmlessnessThis is what the precepts are forAs the Buddha said when you make your precepts limitless  in other words you decide that youre not going to kill under any circumstances youre not going to steal under any circumstances from anyone at all no illicit sex no lying no intoxicants ever at all period  thats a universal giftYou give limitless protection to all beings and you gain a share in that limitless protection as wellSo thats one area where you can push the limits pretty farYou can start embracing the concept of all living beings resolving that youre not going to harm any of them in any of these five waysIts not total harmlessness but its a major step in the right directionThen theres meditation which  as one of the forms of making merit  starts out with meditation on goodwillHere again you run into limitationsOn the one hand youre supposed to develop limitless goodwill for all beingsThe limitless here means that its for all beings in all situations no matter what they doYou dont question whether they deserve your goodwill or if you deserve goodwillYou simply focus on the idea that itd be good for all beings that all beings find true happinessThe world would be a much better place for everyoneSo you want everyone to find true happinessYou make that one of your basic motivationsOn the other hand though you encounter situations where you cant make everybody happyAfter all the quest for true happiness is something each person has to do for him or herselfIts a question of skillYou cant just push a skill on anybodyPeople have to see the need to develop the skillThey have to be willing to put in the time and the energy to do thatAnd they have to be in a position where they canSometimes people are too old or too sick to make much progress in that directionThis is where you need equanimity againYour equanimity has to be limitless as wellIn other words you have to be able to call on it whenever its neededThere are bound to be certain situations that are beyond your control in terms of what you can give in terms of your time and energyAnd there are limitations on what you can do for other people given the limitations of their kamma as wellSo you have to be able to call on this attitude of limitless equanimity whenever neededTo develop these four brahmaviharas in a limitless way you need to fight off the limiting attitudes in your mindThe various forms of aversion  ill will resentment cruelty  are the main limitations on the first three brahmaviharasThe limitation on equanimity is affectionThe people you really love to whom youd like to give all you can but who you cant help as much as youd like Theyre the ones for whom its hard to feel equanimity but theyre also the ones who require your equanimity the mostThats why you have to realize that even affection can be a limitation and that there are times when you need to put it asideIts not that you dont love those people or dont wish them wellYou simply realize that nothing is accomplished by the sort of affection that wants to deny the limits of kamma thats got you beating your head against a wall when you could be going through a door in the wall not too far away  in other words being of help in areas where you can be of helpSo a lot of our practice is learning how to deal with limitations how to find where your powers are how far you can push them in a skillful directionWhen you meet up with a limitation learn to recognize whether its permanent or temporaryThen you apply whatever tools you can find to developing your powers in as compassionate and wise a way as possible to work around those limitationsFor this you need to develop a full set of tools and to keep them in good shapeMany of us have a tendency to throw away our toolsYou learn a new approach a new tactic in your meditation and it works for a little whileThen it doesnt workSo what do you doYou throw it away cast around for something elseBut there may be nothing wrong with the tactic aside from the fact that it works only for certain things and not for othersSo dont throw these things awayKeep them in mind as possible approaches that may come in useful againThe same holds for the whole idea of your selfSome people think that the Buddha tells us that we shouldnt have any self at allBut if you cant identify where your powers are what are you going to work withWhat are you going to depend onWhat will you use to overcome your limitationsAs I said earlier think of your sense of self as a toolYou need different tools for different situationsInstead of bringing one preconceived notion of self into a situation look at the situation in terms of the action it calls for Whats the skillful thing to do hereWhat tools do you have to do that skillful thingPut them to useThat way youre no longer a toad made of blotting paperYou become the little human being in the badgers myth You use whatever tools you can devise and that way youre in chargeThe more tools you can develop the betterThey help you explore where the limitations are as well as where there are openings in the limitations that can lead ultimately to an area totally free from limitation totally unconditionedAt that point you can put all your tools downAs long as youre alive you can still use themBut when the time comes to go you dont need to carry themLike the raft that takes you across the river Once its done its job you just leave it thereYou may feel some appreciation for the help its given you and pull it up on the bank in case anyone else wants to come along and use it as well but otherwise youre done with itIn the meantime though as long as youre crossing the river hold on tight to the raft whichever raft is going to get you past the deadly currentsDont be too quick to throw it awayThe word for clinging upadana also means to feedThe upadana of a tree is the soil it feeds onThe upadana of a fire is the fuel it clings to in order to burnSo upadana means food and sustenance and also the act of taking sustenance ie feedingWhen we apply it to the mind the minds upadana is a place where it looks for happiness  when you feel that the life of your happiness depends on having this person that situation whatever it is to keep your happiness aliveFor most of us our emotional feeding is on other peopleThis is the aspect of our relationships that the Buddha says leads to suffering If our happiness feeds on things that are subject to aging illness and death then our happiness is going to age grow ill and die as wellThis is why we have to look elsewhere for our true happinessIts why we train the mind to develop qualities inside that can provide a happiness thats more secureNow this doesnt mean we dont continue to feel love affection and compassion for people outside simply that we dont have to feed on them anymore which is actually a benefit for both sides if the feeding has been a burden for bothOn the one hand the Buddha has us develop compassion for everybodyIts one of the brahmaviharas unlimited compassion realizing that there are people who are suffering and youd like to do what you can to relieve their sufferingYoud also like them to act in ways that can help eliminate sufferingThats an aspect of compassion thats often missedIts not simply a floatingaround kind of wish for people to be happyIt also requires an understanding of why people are unhappyTheir unhappiness comes from their actions maybe past actions maybe present actionsSo you want to think of them doing things that are skillfulIf their past actions make it difficult to avoid physical pain right now at least you hope theyll be able to find a way of dealing with the pain so they dont have to suffer from itAnd you also wish for them to do things that will prevent future suffering as wellTheres also a more particular kind compassionIt comes out of gratitudeThe Buddha recognizes that we have special connections with other people especially with our parents but also with anyone who has been helpful to us in this lifetimeThose connections call for gratitude which means that these are people to whom you want to give some special helpYouve probably heard of the passage where the Buddha says that a good person by definition is someone who recognizes the good that has been done for him or for her and wants to repay itThis starts with your debt of gratitude to your parentsIn the beginning you literally fed on your mother when she was pregnant with youYou took nourishment from her bloodWhen you were born you fed on her milkAnd as you were a young child your parents worked to provide you with the physical food that allowed you to survive and grow and you continued to feed emotionally on themAs you grew older you found other sources of emotional nourishment and took on the burden of feeding yourself but you still have this enormous debt to your mother and father for having given you life and started you on your wayAs the Buddha said the best way to repay that debt is not necessarily to obey your parents because there are times when your parents have all sorts of wrongheaded and wronghearted notionsThe best way to repay them if theyre stingy is to try to find some way to influence them to be more generousIf theyre not observing the precepts try to get them to be more virtuous to have more principles in their livesIn other words introduce them to the practice of the Dhamma in as diplomatic a way as possibleMost parents resent their children trying to teach them so you have to learn to do this in an indirect waySome also resent the Bword so you dont have to couch these teachings as BuddhistBut you do have that special debt and you have other debts as wellTheres also a sense of affection that should go along with the debtsAs the Buddha said when a young monk ordains he should regard his preceptor or mentor as his fatherAnd the preceptor and mentor should regard the young monk as a sonThat special connection lasts as long as both are still monks and still aliveIt entails various duties in looking after each other but more importantly it entails a sense of trust affection and respectSo theres room for special affection in the practice but the Buddha also warns that special affections can often harbor special dangersHe talks about the hatred that comes from affection and the affection that comes from hatredIn other words if theres somebody you love and somebody else has been nasty to that person youre going to hate the person whos been nasty to the person you loveOr if theres somebody you really hate and somebody else hates that person youre going to feel affectionate toward that person which may bring on some unfortunate consequencesIn other words affection is not always reliable and pureSo here you have to exercise equanimity realizing that sometimes affection can draw you into unskillful mind states that youve got to watch out forThis is why the brahmaviharas dont contain just unlimited goodwill compassion and empathetic joy all of which basically come down to goodwillCompassion is what goodwill feels when it encounters sufferingEmpathetic joy is what goodwill feels when it encounters happinessThose three are a setBut the brahmaviharas also contain equanimity the ability to step back and simply look on a situation dispassionatelyThat ability should be developed to become unlimited as wellIn other words you see that there are times when your partiality toward a particular person is going to cause trouble not only for you but also for that person and other people as wellIf somebody is really sick and all you can do is get upset about the sickness youre going to be less effective in your helpYou have to remind yourself that were all subject to aging all subject to illness all subject to death all subject to separationTheres no way you can avoid thisSo accept that fact and do what you can to mitigate the sufferingTheres a passage in the Canon where King Pasenadi is visiting with the Buddha and an aide comes up and whispers in his ear that Queen Mallika his favorite queen has just diedHe breaks down and criesThe Buddhas way of consoling him is interestingHe reminds him Since when have you ever heard of someone who was born who didnt age didnt grow ill didnt dieWere all subject to these things And its amazing how taking a larger view like that can help console youIt lightens your burden to remember that youre not the only one being singled out to sufferYou may feel singled out at first but you have to realize that theres suffering all over the place people dying all over the place  what every dayIllness is everywhereAging is everywhereSo when these things become apparent both in ourselves and in our loved ones we have to develop equanimity realizing that this is the way things are everywhereThat spurs us to look for another source of happiness deeper insideIf were feeding inside and dont have to feed outside then we can be much more effective in actually being helpful to people who are suffering one way or anotherSo its important to realize that the Buddhas teaching against clinging is not a teaching against affection or against special gratitude or special goodwillHis teaching on the unlimited quality of the brahmaviharas is not a denial that there are people to whom we owe special debtsWe do owe special debts and there are people for whom we should feel special affectionWe simply have to be aware that affection and partiality have their dangersYou probably know the teaching where the Buddha says that its hard to find anyone who hasnt been your mother father sister brother or child in some previous lifetimeWhats interesting about this teaching is that he doesnt use it as a basis for universal loveAfter all we know how difficult relations can be with mothers and fathers sisters and brothers and childrenInstead this teaching is meant to encourage a sense of samvega a realization of how long this wanderingon has been going on and how meaningless affection is in the larger context of all those people over that long stretch of timeYour special debts in this lifetime are to people who actually have been your parents this time aroundIf youve been a parent your special affection does go to your children this time aroundBut we have to realize that there are limitations and dangers to these affectionsAffection can lead to sufferingTheres the case of Lady Visakha who came to see the Buddha after a funeral for one of her grandchildrenThe Buddha asked her Would you like to have as many grandchildren as there are people in this city And even though she had just been to a funeral she said Oh yes lots and lots of grandchildrenThatd be wonderful But he said would there be a day when you wouldnt be going to a funeral And she realized well NoTheres another story of a man coming from the funeral of his sonAnd the Buddha commented Yes suffering does come from those who are dear The man got upset because he felt that those who are dear bring only happinessHis affection was so strong that it blinded him to its connection to the suffering he was feeling right then and thereThe problem is not so much with the people who are dear as with our need to find our happiness by feeding on people who are dearYet there is a way to overcome that which is to learn how to find a deeper happiness inside a happiness that comes from training the mindTheres a passage where VenSariputta announces to his fellow monks that he had sat down to think one day Was there any possible change in the world that would cause him to grieveAnd he had realized that there wasntAnanda immediately asks him But what if something happened to the BuddhaWouldnt that cause you grief And Sariputta says Well noId reflect that its a sad thing that such a wonderful person had passed away is no longer able to help the world And Anandas comment is interestingHe says Thats a sign that you have no conceitIn other words our grief over the loss of other people really comes down to our own sense of loss my loss what this is doing to what I am If we can learn how to get away from that identification that need to feed and lay claim to those we feed on then we can have affection for others pay special attention to those to whom we have special debts and yet not suffer for itThats why its important to make these distinctions  the distinction between clinging and affection the distinction between general goodwill for all and specific goodwill for people who have been good to usIf were clear about these distinctions we can work on expressing goodwill feel love and feel affection in ways that dont cause sufferingTheres a passage in TSEliots Four Quartets where he raises an important question Suppose you have a feeling of deep spiritual contentment of oneness and connectedness with all the universeTo what extent is that feeling meaningfulIs it a sign that youve attained a heightened spiritual stateAre you in touch with some transcendent realityOr is it simply a sign that you had a nice dinner and you feel rested physically satisfiedThis is an important question for people who want to read deep meanings into their feelingsThey want to believe that their feelings constitute their true identity and that their feelings tell the truthBut feelings can lieA warm sense of interconnectedness may indicate simply that your digestion is good and physically youre well provided forOne way of getting around that conundrum is to look not at what feelings really mean but at what you can do with themThis is the Buddhas approachAs he points out our feelings are fabricatedAlthough the happiness of nibbana is not a feeling every other form of happiness is a feeling and every feeling is fabricatedThis means that all feelings have an intentional elementWe put them together for a certain purposeWe want a particular feeling if for nothing else than to establish who we are and what we wantThere is a purpose  many times blind and unknown  that shapes what we feelA study was made years back of facial expressions showing how every common emotion is expressed with a certain set of facial expressions regardless of cultureGrief contentment happiness and ridicule each have their own way of getting patterned in the muscles in your face and this pattern holds across all human societiesThe researchers working on this topic wanted to master all the different expressions so one day they were working on the expression for sadnessAfter trying to get all the muscles in the face together in expression of sadness they found at the end of the day that they were sadThis shows that the emotion doesnt necessarily have to be real just because its strong or pervasiveIt may simply be a habit a result of the way you carry your body the way you compose your faceSo what do you do with the fact that feelings are fabricatedYou learn how to fabricate them wellInstead of trying to dig down and see what your real feelings are notice if you can create comfortable feelings in the body good feelings happy feelings through the way you hold your face the way you hold your body the way you breatheThis can cause feelings of pleasure refreshment and rapture to pervade the bodyAdmittedly theyre fabricated but so are other feelingsThe important point is that these feelings have their usesIf you can maintain these kinds of feeling the mind is in a much better position to look at things from a calm steady point of viewSo when you run across a good feeling like this  whether it just happens or you can induce it  learn how to maintain itThis is part of the duty of the path learning how to develop the factors of right concentration the ease and wellbeing even the sense of rapture that can come from the way you breathe from the way you focus on the different elements in the bodyEven uncomfortable feelings can have their usesThe Buddha gives an analysis of the different emotions that arise in people who are not on the path and in people who areTake for instance what he calls householder grief the grief of someone whos simply upset because he didnt get to see the sights hear the sounds smell the smells taste the tastes feel the tactile sensations or think about the ideas he wanted toHes disappointed in his aimsFor most of us our way of overcoming that particular kind of grief is to try to find those sights and sounds and so on to make them happen so as to feel householder joyBut the problem with householder joy is that you can lose it very quickly and then youre back into householder griefThings go back and forth like this and never really get anywhereIts like throwing a stick up in the airSometimes it falls on this end sometimes it falls on that endTheres no real rhyme or reason to this and you never get out of the cycleThe Buddhas solution to this pattern is to substitute householder grief with renunciate grief the grief that comes from realizing that there is a deathless but you havent attained it yetEven though this may create an uncomfortable feeling in the mind it points to a way outIt acknowledges that there is a deathless there is an escapeThat in and of itself offers hope gives you a sense of directionIt induces you to work in that directionThats why this form of grief is a useful emotionNot every kind of grief or discomfort is badHow many times have you heard people say that its wise not to have any big goals in the practice because youll get dissatisfied over the fact that you havent reached your goal you should just stay content with what youve gotThat kind of attitude is like shooting an arrow without pulling the bow back and getting the string tautThe arrows never going to fly anywhereIt just stays right where it is or drops on the ground at your feet where people can trample on itThere has to be a certain amount of tension in the practice a certain sense that I dont yet have the true happiness I really want in life A sense of samvega a dismay with the way youre living your lifeAnd a sense of urgency that youve got to find a way outOnly with that tension will the practice take flightSamvega may be an unpleasant emotion but you need it in order to spur yourself along the path to do what needs to be doneThe desire to be more generous to be more virtuous to be better at your meditation is not a bad desireIts chanda one of the bases for successSo take that desire and act on itDecide that this really is importantAs you work on the path you may feel deprived of this or that physical comfort so you should remind yourself that thats not importantThe important thing is that theres a deathless and you havent found it yetAnd ultimately this sense of renunciate grief yields renunciate joyYou use it to spur yourself on to actually develop more mindfulness more concentration more discernmentThen you can experience the joy of having mastered these skills  and of ultimately gaining releaseSo renunciate grief is a feeling with a purpose and you can induce itThe fact that its induced doesnt mean its not real or that its not your authentic selfAfter all you know what the Buddha says about trying to find an authentic self in form and feeling and all the other aggregates Youre not going to find itBut you can find things you can useYou take those aggregates and turn them into the pathAs you do this your renunciate grief leads you to renunciate joyYouve got the breath youve got all the elements in the bodyHow can you relate to them in a way that feels goodExplore the possibilitiesMaster them as a skillWhen you can master this skill it gives you a sense of wellbeing in the present moment that doesnt have to depend on conditions outsideYou could sit here and think about all the reasons that would make you miserable being here Its hot outsideYou dont have the comforts you might enjoy if you were living at home  all the long lists of potential grievancesBut what do those grievances accomplishThey dont go anywhere at allBut you can also focus on the fact that youve got a breath youve got the different elements in the bodyThe sense of liquid You can focus on how sticky and disgusting the liquid in your body is or for the time being on the fact that liquid feelings in the body are coolFocus on them so that youre not focusing on the heatYou could focus on the breathWhat way is the breath light totally unstuck totally unfetteredIt has nothing to do with heat or coolness at allIts simply motionEnergyYour mind tunes into that kind of sensationYou may find that you can start smiling and then the smile on your face induces all the chemical reactions in the body that go along with smilingYou start feeling betterSo try to induce feelings that are helpfulFocus not on the issue of whether theyre real but on the fact that youve got all kinds of potentials for pleasure or pain right hereWhat you are going to do with themWhat use can you get out of themWhats the wisest thing to do with themIn this way instead of getting waylaid by the fact that feelings are fabricated and questionable you focus on the fact that you can fabricate them with discernment with knowledgeAs the Buddha points out fabricated feelings are often based on ignorance which leads to sufferingBut you can also fabricate them with the knowledge that leads to the end of sufferingSo look at where you are on the pathSometimes it requires focusing on the grief focusing on the discomfortTheres a passage in the sutta on transcendent dependent coarising that traces all the factors leading up to suffering but then states that from suffering you can develop conviction and through conviction you develop the pathFrom developing the path you develop joyThis is the Buddhas analysis of how you go from householder grief  the fact youre not getting what you want  through renunciate grief to renunciate joyRealize that theres a goal in here there must be a way out of suffering but you havent found it yetThere may be a certain amount of grief around thatBut you can work with that grief until it develops renunciate joyAnd then you can use that renunciate joy to get further along the pathSo these feelings have their usesFocus on the fact that theyre leading you somewhere and you can choose the feelings that take you where you want to goThat way you get the most out of themWeve all had the experience when were asleep of finding ourselves in a dream and for a while believing that whats happening in the dream is realThen something alerts us that something is wrong with the dream and finally to the fact that were dreamingUsually thats enough for us to wake up to pull out of the dreamThat process is very similar to the way we create mental worlds and emotional states during our waking life because our picture of the world around us is always partialIts always stitched together out of bits and pieces of what weve encountered through the sensesWe have a notion of what makes sense and as long as it makes sense and seems to be real we can stay stuck in that state of mindThen something strikes us as incongruous as not fitting inWe realize Oh that was an imaginary world Thats when we pull outBut then we find ourselves in another world which may be better and may notThe ability to recognize whats incongruous whats wrong with a world Thats an important skillWithout it we get stuck in states of mind  what the Buddha called bhava or becoming  where we can suffer very intenselyWe focus on certain things in the world around us certain ideas about who we are in that world and everything else gets filtered through that particular pictureOther peoples actions for example get filtered in this way so that someone acting with perfectly good intentions may seem to be evil sneaky unreliableOr vice versaThey actually may be evil sneaky and unreliable yet we see them as being perfectly reasonable perfectly trustworthyBut because the mental world we inhabit has its own inner coherence we think its accurate and realSo we have to watch out for thisIn a healthy mind its easy to switch from one world to another to recognize the incongruities so that one state of becoming can actually pull you out of a less healthy state of becomingTheres a certain fluidityAnd the fluidity comes from your mindfulness your ability to remember that you take on different identities and inhabit different worlds and some are more useful than othersSome are more beneficial less stressful than othersIf youre skillful you can adopt whichever state of becoming seems to be the healthiest at that particular time given what you want to do in those particular circumstancesThe people with real problems are those who cant get outThey get stuck in a particular thought world and everything gets interpreted in its lightThey can really do themselves a lot of damage because theres no porousness between the different states of becomingTheres no connection  either youre in it or youre out of itThe different identities you take on the different worlds you inhabit seem to be very radically separateUsually for people who are stuck in a very unhealthy state like that their only hope seems to be some outside powerThis is why so many programs dealing with addictions rely on the idea of an outside powerAddicts get stuck in a particular idea of who they are the world theyre in what theyre capable of what theyre not capable ofAnd given the definitions of their little worlds theyre helplessThey need somebody from outside to come in and straighten them outThis comes from getting thoroughly trapped in a very fixed sense of who they areOne of the purposes of the meditation is to get you out of the trap so that you realize you have many different identities you inhabit different worlds and they can best be used as tools realizing that no world that you inhabit is totally real or a totally accurate idea of where you are in terms of your surroundings outside or whats going on insideWilliam James made a lot of this point that our idea of truth is pretty sketchyHow could you possibly know the total truth of the situation in which youre locatedIt would require a knowledge down to the subatomic particles and out to the edge of the universe  maybe even beyond the edge of the universeThat would be impossibleSo to deal with possibilities the mind lives by its sketchesRecognizing this fact is a useful stepThis sketch that Im living with Is it a useful sketchIs it helpful It may have certain true details here and there but you have to realize that no idea of your surroundings is going to be a totally adequate representation of what those surroundings areThe best you can do is ask if your sketch is adequate to your needs your healthy needs and in particular to your desire to put an end to sufferingTo learn how to pull yourself out of unhealthy worlds and into healthier ones first requires an understanding of how the mind creates these worlds and then a development of the skills you need to move fluidly and beneficially between themBoth of these skills are developed in meditationIn other words you get handson experience in creating worlds by trying to create a world of concentration right here inhabiting your body staying with your breath having a focal pointThis is what these worlds are built around a focal point based on a desireIn this case you take the breath as your focal point and your desire is to stay there as continually as possibleTo help carry out that desire you want to learn how to evaluate the breath and your concentration to see how well youre doingFor some people this particular part is also difficult because theyre adept at making negative judgments about themselves and poor at making positive onesThey start berating themselves for not being good meditators for being hopelessThis is why its useful to think about all beings as we do before we meditate every time May all beings be happy When you think seriously about all beings in the world you realize that very few people out there really can get their minds concentrated or even want to tryThe fact that youre trying is a step in the right direction right thereYou can also think about all the people in the past whove meditatedIts not that everybody sat down and as they say in Thailand had it as easy as peeling a bananaEverybody has had to fight to get the mind to settle downSo if you find yourself having trouble take heart that youre not the only oneEverybody has problems with the meditation at one point or anotherEven the people who in this lifetime seem to be natural meditators At some point in the past they were sure to have had difficulties because meditation goes against the grainSo when you learn how to think in these ways its a lot easier to evaluate what youre doing objectively and not berate yourself when things go wrongLook simply in terms of cause and effect and take your idea of who you are out of the picture for the time beingJust focus on the mental states that can stay with the breath notice what distracts them and see if you can be quick in coming back to the breathWhen you do come back dont berate yourself for having leftTake pride in the fact that youve caught yourself and have pulled yourself back in lineWhen you come back try to come back in a way thats deft skillfulReward yourself with an especially satisfying breath one that feels really really good deep down insideThat gives you practice in slipping back into a skillful state of mind from an unskillful one and doing it skillfullyIt also develops your mindfulnessMindfulness is what creates the bridges between these different statesYou remember that you were in one state and now youre in anotherAnd the possibility of slipping back into another distracted state is always there so youve got to keep on top of things to be alert for any signs of the mind preparing to slip awayIt has its tricksIt has its slight moment of blanking out after which you wake up in another worldBut if you can use mindfulness as a bridge across that blanking out its a lot easier to direct the mind from one state of becoming into another when you want toAnd its a lot easier to stay in a state of becoming when you want to stayThese are all very important skills because they also help in learning how to recognize when youre in an unhealthy stateYou can ask yourself Is there suffering here Thats the incongruity We create mind states in order to enjoy them but if they make us suffer theyre out of line with their reason for beingThen you can ask Does there have to be this suffering And part of the mind will say Yes but you have to learn how to question itThats your only escape recognizing that the suffering isnt necessaryIt is possible to be in another state of mind thats less stressfulJust because a strong feeling or thought arises in the mind doesnt mean that you have to go with it or that the feeling is genuinely youRemember that who you are has to be put into quotation marksYou can make a sense of who you are around anything and there are many potentials available in any given momentSo just because theres a feeling there doesnt mean that it has to be the focal point of your sense of who you are because many feelings that come into the mind are actually destructiveThis is why meditation is such an important skill in keeping the mind healthyThe mindfulness allows you to recognize when youve slipped from one state of bhava or becoming to another one sense of who you are to another one sense of whats going on in the world to anotherAnd it also helps you to remember good standards for judging a particular state of mindEven though a state of mind may have some features that are very true  you can verify it by looking at things outside that yes this situation really is difficult or whatever it is that youve focused on  but then you can ask yourself Do you have to suffer around this And the Buddhas answer is always No you dont have to suffer If youre suffering around a particular situation youre not approaching it in a skillful wayThere are others ways to approach itWe always have the potential not to suffer if we look for itSo keep that in mindAnd then learn how to use the skills of meditation to pull yourself out of an unskillful state and create a more skillful one in its place one thats more beneficial more useful healthierSome people will say that youre running away but what are you running away fromYoure running away from one created world into another created world  but a created world thats based on mindfulness and concentration on your ability to discern the causes of sufferingThats a much more useful worldIt has potentialIt can eventually lead you away from suffering entirelySo whenever you find yourself in a situation that seems really difficult and youre just spinning around and around and around try to look for that point of incongruity Somethings wrong here somethings not rightAnd whats wrong is that theres suffering that doesnt have to beYou can pull yourself out through that recognitionAnd you can use your mindfulness of the breath as your handle for getting outBack when I was with Ajaan Fuang some of his students would get themselves into really strange states of mind through their concentrationAnd the handle out was always Where is your breath right nowIs it comfortable That would gradually pull them into the world of the breathIn other words theyd come to inhabit the body from withinIn this way you dont need an outside powerAll you need is your own ability to recognize Theres something wrong here and I can get out This something wrong is the fact something is creating a burden on the mind that doesnt have to be thereTo get out you dont need an outside powerYou just need to remember that you have the ability to create a different sense of who you are and to create a different world to inhabit one thats healthierThe ultimate goal of the practice of course is to be able to get out of all these worlds entirelyThats what it really means to wake upBut in the meantime you can have your little awakening when you wake up in the middle of one of your created worlds and say Oh this is sufferingIt doesnt have to be here And you look in the right place instead of placing the blame on other people in the past or in the presentThe suffering doesnt come from themThe suffering comes from the way the mind thinks about thingsIt creates impossible situations and then burdens itself with themIt doesnt have to do thatMindfulness concentration and discernment form the way outAnd those arent just vague abstractionsMindfulness is the ability to remember what youre doing as you move from one state of mind to anotherAlertness is the ability to see Im doing something thats causing suffering And discernment is what sees that it doesnt have to be that wayTheres an alternativeSo as were sitting here were gaining practice in precisely the skills we need in order to keep our sanityJust start exploring some of the minds possibilities in terms of the different identities it can take on and the different worlds it can inhabitThe meditation gives you a good safe healthy world to inhabitLearn to appreciate this skill because its your lifelineAnd make the most of your opportunity to master itAjaan Fuang would sometimes tell me the story of his childhoodHe was born into a poor family and didnt have many relativesMany of them had died in a plague years beforeHe was orphaned at the age of eleven and was sent off to live in a monastery as what they called a dek wat one of those boys who just hang around the monastery help fix rice for the monks and run errandsHe had a little bit of an education not muchAnd as he got into his teens he began to realize that his life didnt look all that promisingHe didnt have any connections didnt have much of an educationSo he looked to the DhammaThis he said is the only way my life is going to have any meaning is going to go anywhere at all As he said I must not have much merit so Ive got to make as much as I canThat was his original impulse to practice the Dhamma realizing that he didnt have much to come from but what he did have was enough to practice the DhammaAnd this was his hope that he could make something of himself through the practiceThis was a common theme with a lot of Ajaan Muns studentsThey came from peasant families often poor mainly way up in the NortheastThe basic message of Thai society was that poor people didnt have anywhere to goThey were going to stay poorAt the same time there was a lot of pride in Bangkok that if anybody was going to understand the Dhamma it was the scholars in Bangkok people who had the background and education that prepared them to read and think philosophical thoughtsAlthough it was possible for people to come from the countryside areas into Bangkok to learn the scholars were considered to have a monopoly on the DhammaSo when Ajaan Mun was teaching he found he had to deal with the assumption many poor people had that I just dont have the merit to get anywhere in the practice He kept reminding his students You have everything you needYouve got a human bodyYouve got a human mindYouve got breathYouve got your awarenessYouve got some mindfulness some alertnessThese are all the things you need And so a lot of his Dhamma talks focused on one the fact that people were suffering and two they had the resources that if they worked at them could take them out of sufferingThats the important point if you work on themYou need to have a strong sense that where you are is suffering but you have what it takes to get beyond that suffering if you apply yourselfThis is what motivated Ajaan FuangThis is why he was willing to put in long hours in the practice put up with a lot of hardships because that was the only way to make progressHere in the West the problem is a little bit differentMost people coming to Buddhism come from comfortable backgrounds with a good amount of educationBut they still can have a sense of low selfesteem which in their case comes more from psychological than from social issuesThey dont like to be challenged so they like to hear that the practice doesnt ask them to do anything just learn to accept themselves as they are thats all you have to do and thats what the Dhammas all aboutBut that leaves them stuck where they areThe whole point of the Dhamma is that it takes you someplace where you havent beenAs the Buddha said you come to realize the as yet unrealized to attain the as yet unattained to know the as yet unknown to find a true end to sufferingSo there is a lot of work involvedIts not going to be hard all the time but there are times when you really do have to go against what youd like to do or beyond the limits of your comfort zoneThis willingness to push yourself beyond your comfort zone is whats going to make all the differenceBut to do that you need to realize that you have what it takesOften we keep ourselves back or hold ourselves back because we have a very limited notion of what were capable ofThis is where low selfesteem or an unskillful sense of shame can be debilitatingBut as with so many other things theres a skillful sense of shame and an unskillful sense of shameUnskillful shame is what keeps you where you are the idea that I cant get any better than I am Im pretty hopelessThat kind of shame the Buddha never encouragedWhat he did encourage is your willingness to look at what youve been doing to and see where its been unskillfulWhen you do this you are passing judgmentBut youre passing judgment on your actions not on yourselfYour intentions in the past may have been unskillful or the actions may have been unskillful but youre not stuck thereJust because youve had unskillful intentions doesnt mean that youre always going to have unskillful intentionsYou can change your mindYou can change your habitsThe skillful or healthy sense of shame comes in here and says What I did in the past is nothing to be proud of but I dont have to repeat that mistake This is what your powers of judgment are good forWe tend to think of judgment as what a judge does in a courtroom passing a final verdict on people either setting them free or sending them off to jailThe Buddha however is not talking about final judgment of that sortWhat he advises is more like a craftsman judging a work in progress How is it goingWhat can be changedIf its not going well what can I do to improve it That kind of judgment is healthyIts necessary because people with no sense of shame no sense of judgment are dangerous to themselves and to the people around them because they refuse to correct their mistakesSo learn how to use your sense of shame in a skillful way to use your sense of judgment in a skillful way and be willing to push yourself beyond your comfort level to find resources that you havent yet tappedAfter all we all have the potential for awakeningThe qualities that the Buddha developed on the night of his awakening or leading up to his awakening are qualities that we all have in a potential form mindfulness and alertness heedfulness ardency and resolutionThese things can be developedIf we think that were here just to accept the way we are were not accepting the fact that we could develop these qualitiesAcceptance is something you have to learn to do in a skillful wayAccepting just where you are and thinking Thats all I have to do Im perfectly fine as I am Thats unskillful acceptanceIt dooms you to a miserable lifeIf however you accept where you are as a starting point accepting that you also have these potential qualities for awakening thats the skillful use of acceptanceWere often taught mindfulness with the idea that its simply noting whats already there and not doing anything about it just learning how to be nonreactive which assumes that our reactivity is whats causing us to sufferSometimes we even hear that mindfulness is an activity totally devoid of any kind of ideological background bias or agendaBut the way this nonreactive sort of mindfulness is taught definitely has an agenda an ideological understanding that where you are right now is something youre stuck with and youre not responsible for having shaped it or if you are responsible its all in the pastThe only suffering that can be cured is the suffering that comes from refusing to accept where you are and who you areAll you can do in the present moment is accept accept acceptBut thats not the understanding the Buddha encouraged when he taught mindfulnessAs he said part of what youre experiencing now comes from the past but youre also making choices in the present and these choices are actually shaping the way you experience the presentThe way you label things the way you think about things all of the aggregates that go into your sense of the present moment have an element of present intention in themAnd that element can be trained can be changedSo when were mindful and alert were not simply noticing whats already there as a total givenWe also have to notice What are we doing right now to shape this experience and how can that shaping activity be changed We have to remind ourselves What lessons have we learned that can help us shape experience in the most skillful way The different teachings on mindfulness give us a framework  either in terms of the body or our feelings mindstates or mental qualities  as to what has to be accepted what can be changed and how to go about changing it skillfullySo were not submitting the present moment to a final judgmentWere judging it as a work in progress because it leads to the next moment and then the nextWith each moment theres an element of intention skillful or unskillfulYouve got to keep figuring out and judging which is whichOnce you see clearly which is which the duties are pretty clearly laid outIf youre doing something unskillful learn how to abandon it to stop doing itThis requires understanding where it comes from so you can undercut it by undercutting the causeIf youre doing something skillful learn how to maintain that activity nurture it allow it to growAnd again that requires understanding where it came from so you can keep fostering the skillful causesThis means that what were watching here as we meditate is a work in progressAnd were not just watchingWere participating in the workThe type of judgment we use here is the judgment say of a carpenter working on a piece of furnitureAs he planes or polishes the wood he has to keep watching How is it goingAm I putting too much pressure too little pressureWhat needs to be redoneWhat has to be thrown out and started all over againWhat can be salvaged Thats a skillful use of judgment because the carpenter would be ashamed to put out a sloppy piece of workmanshipHes got his reputation his selfesteem to maintainSo think of yourself as a craftsmanAnd learn to develop a skillful sense of shame selfesteem judgment acceptance and nonacceptance learning with practice which things are skillful to accept which things are not skillful to accept so that you can develop mastery in what youre doingOne of the customs of the noble ones is to delight in developing and to delight in letting goThe developing refers to developing skillful qualities of mind developing the pathThe letting go is the letting go of craving ignorance all the causes of sufferingThis is an important point to keep in mind but we tend to forget it in different waysOne way of forgetting it is to delight in developing unskillful qualitiesWe like our greedWe like our lustWe like our angerAnd so we nurture these thingsWe may not be consciously doing it as a practice but it is a habitIt becomes a way of nurturing of training the mind in that particular directionBut when we come to actually developing the factors of the path somehow it seems awfully hardThis is where we have to generate desire to abandon whats unskillful and develop whats skillfulRight effort is in part the ability to generate that desireTry to think about the ways in which lust aversion and delusion are really not your friendsYou might think of them as pets you keep around the houseBut theyre the kind of pets like snakes and wildcats that if youre not careful are going to turn around bite you and eat you upSo its important to think about the drawbacks of things like lustIts something we like a lot but look at where it leads youThink of all the stupid things all the harmful things youve done under the power of lustAsk yourself Do you really want that to take over your mind againIs it really a friendIs it really a nice tame pet to have around the houseOr is it the kind that shits all over the place and attacks you when its in a bad moodThink of all the crazy things that other people do under the influence of lustA large proportion of murders they say have happened between people whove had sex with each otherIf having sex were such a good thing why would they turn around and murder each otherFamily court is the most vicious and violent of the different branches of the court systemAll because of the power of lustOr just look at what lust does to the mind right here right now when it starts flaring upThink of how much you lie to yourself how many areas of the mind get shut down as you focus on liking this wanting that and totally ignoring all the consequencesThe narratives you build up in the mind are total fantasiesTo be attractive they rely on huge blind spotsLarge parts of the mind simply get shut downYour reality principle goes out the windowYou might want to ask Why does the mind do this to itself Its something you really want to look intoYou can also think about the sensual pleasures youve had in the past Where are they nowAll you have left is the memory and sometimes it includes the memory of the unskillful things you did around those pleasuresBut as the Buddha said if you dont have the pleasure that comes from a wellconcentrated mind no matter how much you think about the drawbacks of sensuality or the drawbacks of greed aversion and delusion you cant let them goYou need another form of pleasure to replace the pleasure that comes with sensualityThis is why we have to develop the factors of the path primarily right mindfulness and right concentrationSo learn to look at the pleasures of mindfulness and concentration as your friendsThey dont cause you to do anything unskillfulYou sometimes hear about the dangers of concentration but the dangers of concentration are nothing compared to the dangers of sensualityPeople dont kill steal cheat have illicit sex lie or take intoxicants because of the jhana theyve attainedOn the contrary when you have the pleasure of a wellconcentrated mind its a lot easier to stop doing those unskillful thingsThere are only a few passages in the Canon where the Buddha mentions the drawbacks of jhana and theyre pretty minorYou get so attached to that pleasure that you really dont want to start taking apart your sense of self the way you create a sense of self around your desiresThe Buddha says that this attachment is like grabbing hold of a sappy twig on a tree and your hand sticks to the twig because of the sapBut thats an extremely minor drawback and its something that can be dealt with very easilyIts not nearly as dangerous as the drawbacks of sensuality which the Buddha compares to a burning grass torch or a pit of glowing embersThose drawbacks can pull you off the path entirely and throw you into hell right here and nowSo you want to work on developing a sense of pleasure in the form of the body as sensed from within rather than in visualizing the attractive details of the human bodys appearanceIn other words you take your sense the body as you inhabit it right here right nowHow do you relate to itHow can you find pleasure simply in sitting here and being aware of the fact that youre inhabiting this bodyThis is where the breath comes in because its one of the few processes of the body that you can alter that you can manipulateIt often takes a while to learn how to manipulate it skillfully which is why we spend so much time practicingSometimes you find yourself manipulating the breath and it gets worse which means you have to step back for a while and just learn to watch it to learn more about itThen when you get a better sense of it you can try playing with it again sensing where the different blockages are in the body and how when you breathe in you can get the breath energy to go all the way downLearn to think about a subtle breath energy that doesnt require that you push or pull on anythingAs soon as you start breathing in it immediately permeates and enlivens the whole nervous systemTry to get in touch with that level of breath energy and allow it to have a little more room a little more ease in spreading through the body so that breathing isnt a choreIts nothing you have to doThe breath energy will do this on its ownYou just have to allow itGive it a little room give it a little spaceOpen the mind to the possibility that this can happen and youll find that it doesWhen the energy is flowing well in the body it produces a greater sense of easeAnother way of doing this is to think of relaxing the different muscles starting with the muscles of the fingers and the hands then going up the armsYou can visualize the bones and say wherever theres any tension Thats not a bone tension its muscle tensionThe bones hold no tension at all Allow the muscles around those particular bones to relaxThen visualize the bones up through the arms up to the shoulders then start again at the feet go up the legs through the pelvis up the backbone up the neck the skull of the headWherever you sense any tension or tightness allow it to relaxAnd the energy in the body will flow a lot more smoothly and easilyThis way as you develop the factors of right concentration you make it easier to let go of your other attachmentsYouve got something better to hold on toThis is also why its important to understand that the practice is not just one of letting goThere has to be the developing as wellAjaan Fuang once noted thisHe said Sometimes you hear that its all about letting goBut no you have to developIf you dont develop skillful qualities in the mind you cant really let go of the unskillful onesSo its not just a matter of watching watching watching and letting the defilements just slough offSome defilements might slough off simply through watching but not all of them willThere are some  and these are the really important tenacious ones  where you have to as the Buddha says exert a fabrication against themIn other words you have to do something intentional in order to get past themLike working with the breath Thats bodily fabricationThe way you breathe can help weaken a lot of the defilements so at the very least they dont control your sense of the bodyThat way you can see exactly what theyre doing exclusively in the mindTheyre a lot easier to deal with when theyre not in charge of your breath not in charge of the way the blood is flowing in the body not in charge of the different physical processes in the bodyFor instance when anger arises if you can breathe calmly during the anger and the anger hasnt hijacked your body then its a lot easier to deal with the anger directly in the mindAnother way of exerting a fabrication is exerting verbal fabrication directed thought and evaluationThis can either be directing your thoughts to the breath and evaluating the breath or thinking about the defilement simply as an event in the mind and analyzing it noticing what stress it creates in which parts of the body and how it clouds the mindIn other words instead of looking at the object of your lust or the object of the anger just look at the fact of the lust the fact of the anger as its happening in the mind to see what its doing to keep yourself from siding with itYoure stepping back from it a bitYoure evaluating Do you really want to go along with itIs this really your friendA third type of fabrication is mental fabrication feelings and perceptionsAgain this can relate to the breathYou create a sense of ease and wellbeing in the body that feeling makes it a lot easier to let go of the need for immediate gratification through your defilementYou can say Look Ive got this pleasure hereWhy not focus on the pleasure thats already here rather than on the false pleasure youre dreaming about As you relax your hands and relax your feet you open up a lot of other channels in the bodyYou gain a sense of wellbeing right here right now that doesnt depend on expressing anger or following your lustAt the same time you change the perception around the defilement to see that if you perceive lust or anger as your friend youre going to go running along with it every time it comes for a visitLearn to look at it in a different way Here it comes a cloud to obscure the mind Or as Ajaan Lee says Here come some crooks and thieves and conmenThey want you see things in their way and act under their sway but then when the police come to catch you they go running offYoure the one whos left bearing all the responsibility for what you didSo you want to use these three forms of fabrication  bodily verbal and mental  when you find that simply watching a defilement is not enough simply being equanimous is not enough to get past the defilementBecause after all equanimity and mindfulness are fabrications tooTheyre very subtle fabrications equanimity in particularTheres a belief  you hear it sometimes  that mindfulness and equanimity are unfabricatedBut thats not the caseTheyre part of the pathTheyre something you do something you work on developingAnd at an advanced stage in the practice you do let them goAs Ajaan Mun said there comes a point in the practice where all four noble truths become oneWhat he means is they all have the same dutyIn the beginning you have to comprehend stress let go of the cause develop the path so you can realize the cessation of stressThats four dutiesBut then theres a point though when you have to let go of all four truthsAs Ajaan Mun said nibbana lies outside the four truthsEach of the four truths has a duty but theres no duty for nibbanaTheres nothing you do with nibbanaAt that point you let everything goBut if you havent reached that point the four noble truths still have their dutiesYou still have to do these thingsYou still have to learn how to delight in letting go and delight in developingSo theres work to be done but its good workWithout this work you stay stuck in your old ways suffering in the same old way over and over and over againAs the Buddha says the amount of suffering remaining for someone who hasnt seen the Dhamma is like all the water in the oceans of the earth whereas the amount of suffering remaining for someone who has seen the Dhamma has touched the deathless is like the water you can hold in your handThats a good perception to hold in mindEven though the practice is difficult realize its a lot less difficult than not practicingAnd if you can train the mind to delight in developing the path youre well on your wayOne of the reasons we focus on the breath as the foundation of our meditation is to give us a good place to standLots of different emotions lots of different ideas can come washing through the mind and if you dont have someplace outside of the mind where you can take your stance you get washed awayGreed comes inAnger comes inFear comes inAnd they can be overwhelming if you dont have a place to stand outside of themSo we focus on the breath as a way of getting outside of these overwhelming emotions to realize they dont have to take over totallyWe can have at least one corner of our awareness where theyre not raging and strongNot only does the breath give us a place to stand it also gives us some ammunition to use against these thingsWhen anger comes when fear comes part of their power comes from the way they change the processes of the bodyHormones get poured into your bloodstreamYour heart beats a lot fasterYour stomach tightens upAnd when both your mind and your body are taken over by an emotion like this the only response that seems possible is just to give inBut you dont have to give inYou can work with your breath to counteract at least the physical side of the emotion firstRegardless of whats happening in the mind you can still breathe calmlyIn fact this is an important way of retraining yourselfEven though scary thoughts or infuriating thoughts are coming through the mind you can still breathe calmlyThey dont need to have such a total impactSo while were meditating here its good to gain practice in being sensitive to what kind of breathing feels good and where the different parts of the body are getting caught in unskillful energy patternsIts one of the reasons why Ajaan Lee has you focus on the centers of the breath  the middle of the head the palate the base of the throat the middle the chest just above the navel  because they tend to be trigger pointsOnce a trigger point has been engaged everything else seems to seize up as wellIf you keep the trigger point relaxed open at ease then the other physical reactions dont happenThat way your body can be an ally against these emotions instead of just simply being part of the victim or dragged over to their sideBeing sensitive to the breath also helps you notice when these things are just beginning to creep up on you because sometimes they dont come full blastThey creep up a little bit and then they build and build and buildIf youre distracted thinking about something else or aware of something else you dont notice whats happening until theyve taken overThis is why we emphasize being sensitive to the body not only while youre sitting here meditating but also as you go through the dayIf you know that you have particular trigger points keep your awareness centered on themKeep those spots open regardlessYour first order of business is No matter what happens keep those spots open so the body doesnt get triggeredThat way if something does start creeping in youll notice it immediatelyAnd you find that these emotions are a lot easier to deal with when you catch them right at the very beginning before they trigger the hormones before they trigger the physical reactions because otherwise once those reactions are triggered you simply have to ride them out and that may take a whileAnd of course when the body starts reacting the anger seems constant it seems to be there all the timeActually though it may not be there all the timeMaybe it comes and goesBut the physical reactions seem to be constant and they give the impression that the anger is still thereMaybe the thought that triggered those reactions is long goneBut when you see the reactions continuing continuing continuing you think Well gee that emotion must still be there And you dig it back up againYoure giving it more power than it really needs to have or than it actually hasYou have to understand that even though the physical reaction is still happening the mental trigger may have been long goneAnd you dont have to dig it back up againYoure just riding out the aftereffects of the emotionAs long as youre determined not to be overcome not to be swayed by these things youre okayThat puts you in a position where you can start looking at them as processesRemember that the Buddha said states of experience  and this includes emotions  have three componentsThe first is the physical which is related to the breathThe second is the verbal component the thoughts and narratives that go along with emotionThe third is the mental component the feelings and the perceptions  the mental labels the concepts that underlie the thinking that underlie the verbal sideOnce the physical side is relatively calmed down so that you can gain a toehold here you can start looking at the other components What are the thoughts what are the ideas behind that particular emotion that got you goingWhat are the beliefs the narrativesDo you have to believe themDo you have to engage in themMaybe you could tell yourself other narratives about this situationThat way you recast the situation in a way that doesnt generate anger or fearNow if the object of your fear is genuine and not just a dream or a random idea thats wandered through your mind you have to dig a little bit deeper and say Okay even though there is this genuine danger whats the most skillful way to respond Simply giving in to the fear is not going to helpIgnoring it is not going to help eitherYouve got an actual danger youve got to deal withSo try to use your ingenuity to see how much you can prepare for the danger and what things you have to let go of so that you dont magnify the dangerIts like riding out a storm as when we have these huge windstorms here and all you can do is just hide out in your hut hide out in your tent and hope that nothing falls on youIn the meantime all kinds of damage is being done outside but you cant do anything about it in the course of the stormFor the time being you have to let go of any desire to protect those thingsBut you can protect your mental state wait till the storm has passed and then go out and survey the damageOften youll find that the fears the anger and all these other unskillful emotions come from holding onto things laying claim to things that simply leave you exposed a particular relationship a particular job a particular way of doing things your bodyAs long as you continue to lay claim to these things youre open to dangerYoure open to difficultiesSo you have to remind yourself These things are not meThese things are not mineAs you pursue the issue you find that it often comes down to fear of death especially if youre in physical dangerYou do what you can to protect yourself but you also have to remember that youve got your preceptsYouve got to protect them tooIn fact they should come firstThere are limitations on what you can do to protect yourself physically and still maintain the skillfulness of the mindIn the forest tradition when a monk is set to go out to a dangerous forest or a place where theres either disease or dangerous animals the teacher will say almost sarcastically Are you afraid to die Most people would normally say Of course yes But in the forest tradition youre supposed to make yourself ready to die no matter whatAfter all you can stay in a safe place and yet still dieYou may surround yourself with all kinds of protection yet youve still got the inner workings of your body that can kill you at any timeSo you have to learn how to induce the state of mind that says No I dont have to be afraid You have to realize that Im not the body The bodys been a very useful toolIts been very helpfulBut there will come a point where you have to let it goSo why not practice thinking that way now so that when death actually does come youre preparedYouve been practicingYou can die without letting your virtues dieYou can die and yet maintain the skillfulness of the mindTheres that great passage in the Canon where a monk is going off to a dangerous land and the Buddha says The people there are dangerousTheyre known to be very harsh very barbaric and cruelWhat are you going to do if they denounce you The monk says Well Im going to think These people are really good in that theyre not hitting me What if they hit you These people are very good and civilized in that theyre not stabbing me What if they stab you Theyre good and civilized in that theyre not killing me What if they kill you Well at least my death wasnt a cowardly suicide The Buddha says Okay youre prepared to goThis monks way of thinking is his way of working with the mental fabrication the perception that This body is meIf the body gets killed thats the end wipeout total annihilation You have to remember that thats not the caseCertain mental processes still survive  and you want them to survive and arrive in good shape ie carrying lots of good kamma with themSo you dont want to die in the midst of doing something unskillfulSometimes when were discussing the precepts people will bring up situations such as What if someone is going to kill you if you dont lie Well then how do you guarantee that when you do lie theyre still not going to kill youOr that theyre not going to kill the people you loveWhat would that be like  you go ahead and lie and yet they still kill your children anywayAt the very least make sure that the things you are responsible for  your actions  stay within the precepts within the bounds of whats skillfulThe knowledge that youve maintained your honor can give you a lot of strength even as you go through the process of deathAnd you leave a noble example for those you leave behindSo this is how you take apart unskillful emotions You take apart the physical side then the verbal side then the mental sideFor the mental side you have to learn how to think outside the boxThe same with the verbal side  because verbal here refers to your inner chatter what you say to yourselfOften what you say to yourself can be a lot more harmful than what people do or say outsideSo a large part of your training lies in learning how to talk to yourself in skillful waysTheres a widespread misunderstanding that the most important part of the practice is bare attention simply watching things in a nonreactive wayBut thats not what the Buddha taughtHe taught that the most important part of the practice is appropriate attention where you learn to look at the situation and divide it up into four categories wheres the stress wheres the cause of stress what would be the cessation of that stress ie by abandoning the cause and then how you do that the path of practice that you develop to abandon the cause of stressIn other words you see things in terms of the four noble truthsEach truth has a task which has to be mastered as a skill and brought to completion comprehend the stress abandon the cause develop the path so that you can realize the cessationThats a very different approach from simply being nonreactive or learning to accept whatever comesIf you see that a particular line of thinking is causing a lot of stress and suffering remember Abandoning is the task you do with the cause of stressTo drop that line of thinking you actually have to change it to think in the opposite wayDeep down you may feel This body is me Well what if its not youHow does that change thingsMy preferences are me Well what if theyre notHow does that change thingsSo the practice is not a matter of just watching or just being aware of thingsIf you see that something is unskillful youve got to counteract itAnd to counteract it youve got to ask yourself What are your underlying assumptions The things you say of course toLearn how to question that of courseThink of all the great advances in science the people who questioned the of course Why do apples fall out of trees Well of course Its their nature to fall That was what people believed for centuriesYet Isaac Newton said Wait a minute why And people made fun of him for asking why but he ultimately came up with a totally different explanationNot only does the apple fall but the earth rises to the apple a little bitMatter attracts matterOf course now people are still trying to figure that one outWhy is there gravityMaybe its not a force maybe its a curve in spacetimeBut whats thatIts still a question but it moves the discussion forward in a way that yields lots of benefitsIf it werent for Newtons formulae we wouldnt have been able to send out satellites and space probes to gather information about the universeIts through learning how to question your basic assumptions that you gain and advanceYou begin to see Oh this is something I believed all along without even thinking about it without examining it and its causing me unnecessary sufferingLearn to dig down and question those assumptions because theyre holding you captiveOr to be more precise by holding onto them youre holding yourself captiveLearn how to questionLearn how to let goLearn to turn things inside outIts like turning your pockets inside outYou sometimes find interesting things that you didnt realize were thereSo we work with the breath to give ourselves a foundation where we can start asking questions like this looking into the mind to see where the problems are and applying the categories of appropriate attention the four noble truthsWe remind ourselves that meditation is not just a single activity where youre just mindful or just accepting or just nonreactive or just anythingThere are lots of different approaches you could apply to the present momentLearning how to figure out which one is appropriate right now and learning how to master it as a skill Thats the metaskill of the meditationIts the line of thinking that can set you freeThere are three qualities that the Buddha listed as the roots of unskillful behavior greed aversion and delusionSome psychotherapists have asked why he didnt list fear as the fourth because psychotherapy tends to see neurotic fear as the primary source of mental illnessWhy didnt the Buddha have the same understandingBecause he saw that fear has its usesIts not always unskillfulIf you go into a forest its right to be fearfulIf you werent fearful youd get complacent and carelessYou could dieWhen you think about your own mortality  how fragile your life is how fragile your health is how fleeting your youth is  its right to feel a certain amount of fear for the future How are you going to fare when aging illness and death hit youThink of the Buddha when he was still a young prince and how he saw an old person a sick person a dead personThink of the fear he felt in realizing that all of the areas in which he looked for happiness in life were subject to aging illness and death as wellThe feeling he felt on realizing that is called samvega which is sometimes translated as urgency sometimes as a sense of dismayBut it can also be translated as terror looking into the abyss and seeing youre about to fall into itBut the story doesnt stop thereThe fourth person he saw was a forest mendicantAnd the feeling he felt on seeing the mendicant was pasada confidence If theres a way out this is itThis dynamic between terror and confidence informs all of the Buddhas teachings all of the Buddhas practiceWhich means that a sense of fear is a legitimate part of the practiceIts a legitimate motivation for wanting to get your mind to settle down for wanting to gain some insight into why you are sufferingYou realize that if you dont gain control over your mind then when aging illness and death come youll be at a total lossAt the same time you have the confidence that if the mind is trained then you can handle these things and not sufferSo fear is a legitimate reason for coming to the practiceIn fact its probably the most legitimate of allWe dont like the feeling of fearThe experience of fear is very uncomfortableWe feel small weak and threatenedThis feeling can become unskillful when it gets mixed up with greed aversion and delusionBut a clearsighted sense of fear combined with confidence that there is a way out can actually get you on the pathThis combination of fear and confidence is what translates into what the Buddha said is the root of all skillful behavior heedfulnessYou realize that there are dangers but if youre careful you can avoid themIf the dangers were inevitable thered be no reason to be heedful for nothing you might do could make any differenceIf there were no dangers at all thered be no reason to be heedful eitherBut there are dangers in lifeAnd it turns out that the dangers lie not so much in aging illness and death but in the way we think about thingsOur greed aversion and delusion These are the dangersBut the care with which we learn how to manage our thoughts our words and our deeds provides the way outSo heedfulness reminds us of the dangers but also says If youre careful if youre mindful if youre alert if youre discerning you can gain release from those dangers Thats why were here meditating learning how to train the mind so that it can recognize greed anger and delusion when they comeA large part of the problem is that we dont recognize these qualities for what they are because delusion by definition cant see itself often it gets mixed up with the greed and the anger so we dont recognize them eitherTo get past that you have to learn how to observe your own mind to sense what youre doing thats skillful and what youre doing thats notAnd to do that you have to observe your thoughts to see where they lead to pleasure or painThis is something we dont normally doWe prefer to get involved in a thought world totally in that world trying to shape it whatever way we likeThen for one reason or another we drop that move to another one and then to another oneIts like hopping trainsIf youve ever tried to trace the trains of your thought you know that theyre a lot more complicated than the railroad network here in AmericaYou hop on a train of thought and find yourself in Burma England in the middle of Russia up to the North Pole down to the South Pole out to Mars and Saturn with brief stops along the way when youre feeling hungry tired or hotIts backandforth all over the placeAnd when our thoughts are totally out of control like this no wonder they cause sufferingThey can latch onto any object and worry it to death  and worry us to deathUnless the mind is trained it has very little ability to step back and see whats going onYou need to learn how to see where your thoughts goIn other words you step out of the thought and see it as a part of a causal processThis thought leads to that reaction that reaction leads to that thought that thought leads to that reaction and so onTo get out of these trains of thought you also want to see how each thought gets put togetherWhy do thoughts arise to begin withWhen you understand these processes then you can step back and  when you notice that a particular thought is leading toward suffering  you can drop itYou can disband itThe more alert the more mindful you are the more quickly you can do this until you get to the point where theres just a brief stirring of a thought  even before it becomes a coherent thought  and you can zap itYou recognize that its going to go off in an unskillful direction and you stop it in its tracks by breathing right through the little knot or bundle of energy around which the thought was about to coalesceThese are some of the skills you develop as you meditateThis is one of the reasons why we start with the breathWe start by thinking about the breath because if you keep your thoughts concerned with something right here in the present moment you can start to see the processes of thinking whats called fabrication in actionThe breath is called bodily fabricationIts what helps to create your sense of the body the way you feel the body from withinAnd then you combine that with directed thought and evaluation which are called verbal fabricationIn other words you keep directing your thoughts to the breath and then you evaluate it How does this breath feelIs it comfortableIf its not comfortable how can you make it betterThis brings in the other level of fabrication which is mental fabrication feelings and perceptionsYour perceptions are the labels you apply to thingsIn the case of the breathing process this has to do with how you perceive whats going on when you breatheWhen you visualize the breathing process to yourself what is that visualization likeIs it helpful or does it actually cause harmIf you think of the body as a bellows  pulling the breath in pushing it out  its going to make the breathing process tedious tiresomeIf you learn how to perceive the breathing process more as an energy flow not just the air in and out of the lungs but the quality of the energy in the body as a whole  from the top of the head down to the face down to the torso and down to the legs and down the shoulders and out the arms  then the breathing is more pleasurableThe whole body is involved in this quality of breath breathing energy flowThe body is wired in such a way that it can actually pick up energy from within itself one part feeding anotherThe energy doesnt have to come in with the airIn fact the air coming in and out is simply a byproduct of the energy flow in the bodyTry holding that perception in mind and see what it does for the breathingSee which parts of the bodys energy can feed the parts that feel starvedIf that gets too complicated just get back to directing your thoughts to the inandout breath evaluating the inandout breath and leave it at thatBut as you get more sensitive to the full process of fabrication you begin to realize what youre doing is creating a thought world here that includes all forms of fabrication breath which is bodily fabrication directed thought and evaluation  verbal fabrication and your feelings and perceptions  mental fabricationTheyre all right hereWhen theyre all right here youre in a better position to see how thoughts and emotions form how they disintegrate where they leadBecause its inevitable as youre trying to focus on the breath that other things will come upIn the beginning you realize this only after theyve taken you far awayYou find yourself on the coast of Norway How did I get here But in the beginning dont try to trace it back just yetJust say Okay Ive got to go back to the breath And fortunately you dont have to travel every inch of the way from Norway back hereJust drop Norway and youre here back with the breathWith the next thought youre in AfricaOkay drop that and come back to the breathWith the next thought youre thinking about tomorrows meal Drop that come back to the breathAn unskillful reaction to all this is to get frustratedThe skillful reaction is to realize that this is what the minds been doing all along so its going to take time to change its habitsThe important lesson to draw is not to be surprised when the mind wanders off like thatLearn to anticipate itYou realize Okay its going to wander off again so watch for the warning signs How does that happenA sudden curtain falls over the mind and when the curtain is raised youre off someplace else as in a playThe curtain drops on Act One and when it rises again youre in Act Two off someplace elseHow and why does the mind hide these things from itselfAnd how do you know that its about to happenWhen you can anticipate that its about to happen youll notice its because of a sense of irritation or boredom or antsiness in the mindEven though youre standing with the breath the mind is beginning to look someplace elseWhen you can catch that happening remind yourself that its a sign the breath isnt interesting and comfortable enoughStart asking yourself more questions about the breathHow could it be more comfortableWhat kind of breathing would feel really really good gratifying refreshing right nowYou can ask the different parts of the bodyHand what kind of breathing would feel good for youLeft hand right hand stomach legs chest abdomen What kind of breath would you like And then let them breathe in whatever way they likeThe more interesting the breathing process  the more you can see the good impact its having on the body  then the less likely that the mind will wander offAnd the more easily itll come backAt the same time youre learning some important lessons about how the mind creates thought worlds and how it creates suffering in the processThis way you can learn how not to engage in those processes developing the skills that will protect the mind from its own worst habitsSo as youre practicing breath meditation like this youre doing something concrete about all your realistic fears If death comes aging comes illness comes if somebody drops you off in the middle of nowhere in the dark how can you keep your mind under control so you dont sufferBy doing what youre practicing right nowYoure giving yourself some concrete skills that can underlie a realistic sense of confidence that you can manage your mind that you can learn how to train the mind regardless of the situationThis combination of fear and confidence constitutes the heedfulness that underlies the whole pathYou become heedful to try to develop skillful qualities ie qualities of mind that will lead to good results leading you away from suffering and to abandon and avoid unskillful qualities the ones that cause sufferingIf you develop your mindfulness your alertness your concentration you can do thisSo fear isnt necessarily a bad thingIts an important part of wisdom recognizing that there are dangers in lifeIts a necessary function of the mind anticipating that dangers are going to happenThe important thing is not to let the fear get tied up in greed aversion or delusionYou want to bring more mindfulness more clarity to the issues you fear and to gain more skill in the qualities that will help you avoid those dangersThats the important message of the Buddhas teachingAfter he saw the forest mendicant he became a forest mendicant himself to test and see if the confidence he had placed in that way of living was really well placedAnd his awakening proved that it was It is possible to find a happiness thats not touched by aging illness death or separationAnd as the Buddha said this realization came not through any special qualities on his partIt came through developing qualities of mind that we all have that we all can develop such as ardency alertness and resolution but especially heedfulness the skillful sort of fear that can get you on the path and see you through to the endSo dont hate your fears or fear your fearsLearn how to educate themWhen theyre educated and trained theyre part of the path to the end of sufferingThis is part of the Buddhas genius He took things that many of us dont like about the mind things that actually cause trouble in the mind and learned how to tame them to train them so that they actually become part of the path to the end of sufferingIn this way you can reach a place in the mind where there really is no more reason to fearAs VenAnanda said you use desire to come to the end of desireIn the same way you can use fear treating it wisely to bring yourself to the end of fearAnd as it turns out thats the only way you can get thereThe Buddha often compared himself to a doctorAnd the Dhamma was his medicineWhen we think about this analogy its important to remind ourselves that the Buddha was not a doctor in a modern hospitalYou didnt go to him for a shotHe was a traditional doctor and traditional medicine is a lot more strategic than modern medicine isThe Canon gives us a picture of Jivaka the Buddhas own personal physician telling how he became an expert doctor and it gives us a good idea of the kind of doctor the Buddha had in mindEven though part of Jivakas knowledge covered the medicinal uses of every plant he encountered that wasnt the entirety of his skillA lot of his expertise lay in his strategies how to deal with difficult patients how to treat difficult diseasesSo when the Buddha was saying he was a doctor he was saying that he was very strategicWhen he spoke it wasnt just a question of saying whats trueThat was just the first question hed ask before deciding to say something Is it trueHe also made sure that what hed say was beneficial and that it was timelyIn other words his words were designed to have a specific effect taking the circumstances into consideration to see if this was the right time and the right place to say that particular truth to get the desired effectThis is why when Anathapindika  who was a streamenterer and would seem to be qualified to know  was asked what kind of views the Buddha had said I dont know entirely what views the Buddha has This was because he realized that when the Buddha taught he taught strategicallyHis words didnt necessarily encompass the entirety of his viewsSo when you read that the Buddha saw the world in this way or he thought this he thought that you have to ask yourself To whom was he saying that in what situation under what conditions Because as a doctor he had to be strategicIf youve ever had traditional medicinal treatments you know that theyre a lot more varied and strategic than what youd get in most modern medicineIve known a couple of cases where a traditional doctor would treat one disease by actually inducing another diseaseOnce the first disease had been turned into the second disease then he could knock off the second diseaseWhat this means is that sometimes you take a particular medicine to induce new symptoms and then at a certain point in the treatment you have to drop that medicine and take up something else to treat the new symptomsSome medicines you might take all the way through the treatmentBut with others once the medicine has to be changed you cant touch the first medicineOr in the course of taking the first medicine you cant yet touch the second oneSo when you look at the Buddhas teachings you have to ask yourself Which of the teachings apply across the board and which are designed for a particular stage in the practiceFor example the Buddha makes heavy use of perceptionsHe says that we suffer because of our misperceptions of things seeing constancy in whats inconstant pleasure in whats painful self in whats notself and attractiveness in whats really unattractiveBut he doesnt then just go and say Simply turn your perceptions around and thats thatThe problem is solved Thats not how it worksThe solution is more indirectBefore you take up the three perceptions of inconstancy stress and notself he has you develop other perceptions first  in particular the perceptions that lead the mind to concentrationWhile youre here practicing concentration focus in on your breathWhat keeps you with the breathA perception a mental label that says breath And a lot of the concentration practice is learning how to gain a perception of breath that you can hold in mind for long periods of time with a sense of ease a sense of wellbeingYou test different perceptions of the breath to see which ones hold  in other words which ones you can stick withThis would seem to go against the perception of inconstancy and it doesYoure actually looking for a perception you can hold onto as constantYou want to see the breath as something consistent and pleasant you can stay withFor example if you see the inbreath and the outbreath as two radically different things its going to be hard to stay with them comfortably because you have to keep switching back and forth between the two perceptionsBut if you see the breath energy as something present in the body all the time try to hold that perception in mindYoull come to sense the breathing process in a different wayThe breath is always there its just a matter of letting the inbreath meld with whats already thereThen you check to see whether whats there is getting pumped in too full or squeezed out too muchWhen you see breath energy in a constant way its a lot easier to adjust the breath in a way that feels right feels healthy feels nourishingYou can gain a sense of fullness without feeling stuffedWhen you breathe out you can begin to sense the point where youve breathed out too much Youre squeezing the breath energy depleting yourself of breath energy in ways you dont need toFor the time being you simply want to hold onto that perception of the breath as constant and pleasant something you can gain some control overUse the three perceptions only when you find the mind being pulled away from the breath to other thingsYou look at the happiness the pleasure that comes from chasing after those other things and you learn to see it as less constant than the pleasure that comes in staying with the breath more stressful less under your controlSo at this stage in treating your illness your primary focus is on constancy on seeing the breath as always thereAjaan Lee says that you want to see whats constant in whats inconstantIf you see everything as inconstant he says youre missing some important aspects of the trainingThe example he gives is symbolic Your lower lip has never turned into your upper lipThats something constant about your lower lipYour eye has never turned into an earThats something constant about your eyeIn the same way there are some aspects of the breath energy in the body that really are constantAs long as youre alive there will be breath energy in the bodyAnd you can learn to use that fact to your advantageJust stick with that perception of breath and see how the underlying breath energy in the body goes through small fluctuationsYou hold onto the idea that breath is constantly there simply that its sometimes stuffed in too full sometimes squeezed out until its too depletedBut you can learn to adjust the rate of your inbreath and outbreath to see the inness and the outness as secondary and the presence of breath energy in the body as primary the given you hold ontoThats how you use perception at this stage in the gameWhen your concentration is solid enough then you can start using the three perceptions to take the concentration itself apartBut until youve reached that stage you dont want to think in those termsIf you start out with three perceptions and try to use them as your medicine to treat everything that comes along its very hard to get the mind into concentrationSo realize that there are stages in this treatmentYour mind is sickWhats it sick withGreed anger and delusionAnd this is the treatmentIt has its different stagesYou try to get as constant and easeful and controlled a state of mind as you canYoure actually fighting against those three perceptionsBut its only when you fight against a truth that you know how true it is how far its true and where its limitations areSo remind yourself that youre engaged in a strategy hereDont try to jump the gun wanting to go straight to the three perceptions to get everything done with so you can get on with your lifeThe practice has its rhythms just as the treatment of a disease has its rhythmsSometimes you might want to ask the doctor ahead of time How many months do I have to stay in this stage of the treatment before I switch it around Hell probably say Well it really depends on how long the body takes to respond And its the same with concentration practiceHow many years does it takeAjaan Fuang would often say Dont askJust do what needs to be done When the mind gets ripe whether its fast or slow the important thing is that its ripe  ripe for insight ripe for other stages of using perceptionIn the meantime dont try to secondguess the BuddhaIf this is your stage of treatment stick with itTrust that the Buddha was an expert doctorThere are a lot of paradoxes in his strategies but the strategies have worked for more than yearsThey deal with elements that are universal in all peoples minds regardless of where you come from what age you live inThats why the Buddha said the Dhamma is timelessIts not something that was true only in the time of the BuddhaIts true across timeThe timesensitive part is simply which stage youre in in the treatment of your diseaseSo try to apply the Buddhas teachings in a timely wayThats how youll finally get to the ultimate timelessness that the whole training is aimed at total freedom from diseaseTheres a famous passage in the Canon where a young monk VenRatthapala is visited by King KoravyaThe king asks him Why did you ordainAfter all youve had a lot of wealth you had no loss in your family no health problemsYouve got everything a young man looking forward to the pleasures of sensuality can hope forSo why did you ordain Ratthapala replies that he had reflected on four Dhamma summaries from the BuddhaThese four summaries are mentioned nowhere else in the Canon but they were lessons Ratthapala claimed he learned from the BuddhaOne the world is swept awayIt does not endureTwo the world offers no shelterThere is no one in chargeThree the world has nothing of its ownOne has to pass on leaving everything behindAnd four the world is insufficient insatiable a slave to cravingThen Ratthapala explains them to the kingThe first three he explains with reference to issues of aging illness and deathThe world is swept awayThe king says What does that mean In response Ratthapala asks him When you were young were you strong The king says Yes I was strong in arm strong in legIn fact sometimes I think I had the strength of two men How about now The king replies Im now eightyAll my strength is goneIn fact sometimes I think of putting my foot one place and it goes someplace else So the first summary has to do with agingIt also has to do with anicca inconstancyImpermanenceThe world is swept awayThings keep changing changing changing all the timeAnd as for a body it develops for a while and then starts to age and just falls apartThe second summary The world has no shelterThere is no one in chargeRatthapala illustrates this with the truth of illness and its a truth about suffering as wellHe asks the king Do you have a recurring illness The king says Yes I have a wind illness  back in those days they believed that if you had shooting pains and cramps in the body it was caused by a disturbance of the wind elementSometimes Im in so much pain that people gather around me in anticipation of my death So Ratthapala asks him Can you order the people whove gathered around you to share out the pain so that you feel less pain The king replies No of course notEven though Im king Im not in charge of the painI have to put up with whatever pain there is There is no one in chargeSo that puts together the teachings on illness and dukkha stress and sufferingThe third summary The world has nothing of its ownOne has to pass on leaving everything behindThe king says What do you meanI have stores of gold and silverSo how can you say the world has nothing of its own Ratthapala says Can you take those stores of gold and silver with you when you die or do you have to leave them behind Oh of course I have to leave them So the third summary has to do with anatta  notself  and deathSo you see in these first three summaries a parallel between on the one side the three characteristics or three perceptions of inconstancy stress and notself and on the other side the three deva messengers aging illness and deathDeath is the big notself teachingThere are so many things we hold onto in life that as death comes we have to let goThis is one of the reasons why meditation involves so much practice in letting go letting go letting go because most of us tend to hold on hold on hold onAnd yet no matter how tightly we hold onto things theyre going to be ripped from our grasp as we dieSo its best to learn how to let go skillfully beforehandOtherwise well be stuck with that fourth Dhamma summary Being insatiable finding things insufficient were a slave to cravingCraving is what makes us pass on to another life where we try to latch on againThe Buddha compared the process of dying to a flame leaping from a house afire to another house next doorIn order to make the leap it has to depend on the wind element in the air  nowadays wed call it oxygen  as its support as it goes from one house to the nextIn the case of dying craving is the support that leads from one lifetime to the nextThe Buddha doesnt talk about what makes the leap from lifetime to lifetime because were not responsible for the whatInstead he talks in great detail about the act of leaping itself  how the process happens  because that is our responsibilityIts something we can see happening in the present moment something we can understand to the point where we know how to choose not to participate in itWe can choose not to fall for it again and again craving for things that are not really oursThis is why we have to see the world is empty for otherwise we fall under the power of the King of Death the desire to keep on getting reborn againThink about that The desire to be reborn is the King of Death lording over our heartsTo gain our freedom to get out of our slavery weve got to learn how to let goAnd the letting go has to be very thoroughTheres a passage where Anathapindika is dyingVenSariputta comes to see him and starts telling him how to let goFirst you let go of the objects of your sensesThen you let go of the senses themselvesThen you let go of your consciousness of the senses your consciousness of whats going on in your mind your consciousness of consciousness itself You let go of that tooAnd Anathapindika starts to cryHes never heard this teaching beforeAll those years he spent with the Buddha yet the Buddha never mentioned it to himTheres a lot of controversy in the tradition as to why this was soBut the important point is that thats the teaching at the moment of deathYouve got to learn how to let go even of your consciousness of consciousnessWhat is there leftWell thats something you find out in the practiceThis is why so many of the ajaans in Thailand refer to meditation as practice in dying We gain practice in letting go and seeing for ourselves whats left when everything gets let goBut to gain practice in letting go we need to do more than just let goWe also have to develop skillful qualities of mindThis is why the Buddha has four noble truthsIf there were just one duty in the practice  whatever arises just let go let go  youd only need one noble truthBut there are some things you have to comprehend some things you have to let go of some things you have to realize some things you have to develop before you can finally let go of them allIn terms of the developing you work on the preceptsIn one sense this is a form of letting goYou let go of your desire to do and say unskillful thingsBut its also a form of developingYou have to develop a strong conviction that the sacrifices you might have to make in observing the precepts are really worth making that there are some things of greater value to be gained by letting go of the pleasure derived from those unskillful activitiesWithout that conviction you cant change your unskillful habitsSo youve got to develop that conviction keep it strongThen theres concentration which also involves both letting go and developingThe developing involves finding a good solid center inside and maintaining it looking after itYou work with the breath to make the breath comfortable so that its easier to stay here and you work with your perception of the breath so you can calm things down and make things more and more quiet inside both in terms of whats called the physical fabrication of the breathing and the mental fabrications that are the feelings and perceptionsSometimes theres a perception of light sometimes there are perceptions of beings coming to visit you all the nimittas or signs or visions we hear about Youve got to let those go calm them down because they can be disturbancesBack when I was studying with Ajaan Fuang there were times when his lay students would sit meditating with him and some of them would start having visionsHe had this uncanny ability as many of them said that within a second or two after a vision had appeared hed ask Whats going on in your meditation over there Theyd say Wow theres a vision Then hed tell them what to do with the visionOf course a lot of people listening in were wondering When am I going to have my vision But as he explained it wasnt because the vision was something special that he gave it so much attention it was because it was an obstacle you had to get pastIts one kind of perception you have to let go of to calm things down insideBut there are also perceptions you have to develop about how the breathing process actually works in the body  especially if you find breathing laboriousIf it takes a lot of effort to breathe in much of that has to do with the perception of what youre doing as you breatheIf your perception is that all you have to breathe through is the nose it can be very restrictiveThink instead of all the pores in your skin opening up so that the breath can come in and out of the poresAnd there are channels of breath in the body through which things can be connectedThink of every little cell in the body being connected every little cellAnd the breath energy is just waiting outside the body to come inYou dont have to pull it inJust open up the pores and itll come in on its ownIf you hold these perceptions in mind they change the way you breatheThe breathing gets a lot calmerThe mind gets a lot calmerYoure calming down what are called mental fabricationsYou can also calm down the feeling side of mental fabrication as wellSometimes there are strong feelings of rapture or thrill going up and down the spineYou get goose bumps intense feelings of fullness as if youre going to drownSometimes its very pleasant and other times very unpleasant as if youre losing controlYou start to pulsate or throb and when that happens youre certainly not calming the mind downSo remind yourself that there are many levels of breath energy in the bodyTheres the gross level which is what youre focused on but there are more subtle levels you can tunein to like tuning from a radio station playing rock music to one thats playing something very quiet peaceful and soothingSo even though the waves of the rock station are still here in the air youre not focusing on themYoure focusing on the radio waves coming from the station playing Arvo Prt quiet calm soothing musicIts the same with the breath the same with the feelings that can come from the breathTry to tune in to the more subtle feelings of stillness and ease of neither pleasure nor painTune in to that sense of equanimityThat way you calm down the mental fabricationIts by holding onto these more subtle perceptions cultivating and developing them that youre able to let go of grosser thingsWhich means that the path begins by combining developing and letting goEven though eventually we try to let go of all states of becoming we do that first by developing a skillful state of becoming  right concentration of the mind  which gives a standpoint from which we can gain practice in letting go of grosser pleasures grosser attachmentsThe main attachments you let go when youre developing concentration are the hindrances beginning with sensual desireThats a big oneAs the Buddha said the reason were afraid of death is because were afraid were going to have to let go of our sensual pleasuresAnd we will have to let go of our sensual pleasuresThe problem is if we havent had any practice in letting go of sensual pleasures our craving will go straight to where we hope to find more sensual pleasures after deathAnd who knows where that may beAjaan Mun comments that during one stage in his many past lifetimes he got fixated on the sensual pleasures of being a dogFor lifetimes he was a dog because he was stuck on that level of sensualityAjaan Fuang was once visited by some people whod been studying AbhidhammaThey had heard he was a good teacher but they didnt know what he taughtHe was there in Bangkok so they went to see him and asked what he taughtHe said Well sit down close your eyes focus on your breath They said Oh no noWe cant do thatIf you focus on the breath youll get stuck in jhana and be reborn as Brahmas Ajaan Fuang replied Whats wrong being reborn as a BrahmaNonreturners are reborn as BrahmasAnd at any rate being reborn as a Brahma is better than being born as a dogThe point he was getting at is that nonreturners have gone beyond sensual attachment sensual passionDogs are still attached to sensualityAnd even though these people had learned Abhidhamma had done all sorts of vipassana they still were coming back to their sensual passionsThey could be headed back to dogdomThe only way to avoid that fate is to let go of sensual passion and the only way to do that is to develop another alternative to pain aside from sensual pleasurePracticing right concentration is precisely what gives you that alternative another place to goAs the Buddha once said if you havent found another source of pleasure better than sensual pleasure then even though you know the drawbacks of sensuality youre just going to keep going back to it back to it back to itSo youve got two duties here to provide an alternative to sensual pleasure and to see the drawbacks of sensuality to see why you go there to see that the allure of sensuality is really false and deceptiveIt pulls you into doing things and getting obsessed with things that have no real value and can actually harm youThey dull the mind make it intoxicatedAs the Buddha said this kind of pleasure is blameworthy causes harm to yourself harm to other people and in addition to the bad kamma that often comes with getting involved in that kind of stuff the mind gets dull dull dulledYour vision gets restricted  because when youre attracted to something of that sort its usually to certain detailsYou focus on some things and willfully ignore all the things right next to themYou focus on the skin and forget that just a millimeter under the skin is some pretty disgusting stuffAs you go deeper and deeper in it gets even worse right there in that very same bodyThen you turn around and focus on what the sensual passion does to your mind Everything gets very dulled and narrowed downBut if you dont know anything better than the pleasure you get from that thats the pleasure you keep going back toTheres a story they tell in Thailand of a dog who was changed into a princeA princess met him fell in love with him and prevailed on her parents to let her marry him even though they didnt know himHe looked like a prince acted like a prince but they didnt know what kingdom he came fromBut she was really in love with him so she convinced her parents that he was a good prince worthy of being her husbandYet this prince even though he looked like a prince on the outside still had the passions of a dogOne day the princess found him in the bathroom eating shit out of the toilet as dogs do in ThailandSo of course he was thrown out of the palaceWent back to his life as a dogThats a lot like what our mind is likeWe go for the refined bliss of concentration for a while then we turn around and go looking for the shit in the toiletSo youve got to see the drawbacks of those passionsThey do have their allure but youve got to weigh their allure against their drawbacks and try to develop this alternative source of pleasure so that you can have someplace to stand and can let go of that passionAs the Buddha said when you reach nonreturning youve mastered concentration at the same time that youve been able to get beyond sensual passionThat guarantees that youre not going to go for dogdom or any of the other sensualpassion realmsBut still theres more to let go ofEven though the Brahma realm is a very refined state refined states dont last as long as the Brahmas think they doThere are many instances in the suttas where Brahmas are totally deluded on this pointThey think theyve gone beyond anything the Buddha knows so the Buddha has to go up to their Brahma heavens and subdue their pride to show them that they still have more to let go of that there is something the Buddha himself has gone beyond but they haventIn one of the suttas the Buddha challenges a Brahma Baka Brahma to disappear from him but Baka Brahma cant do itThe Buddha sees him wherever he tries to hideThe Buddha then succeeds in disappearing from Baka Brahma and states in a loud voice that he has found a level of consciousness that Baka Brahma hasnt known thats not known through the senses thats not experienced through sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations or ideas sensed through the eye ear nose tongue body or mindIts beyond the six senses entirelyIts only when you hit that that youre really safeWhich means you have to learn how to let go of all the sensesSo you try to let go first of sensuality and then of the senses entirely the contact based on the senses the feelings based on that contact and then the consciousness of all these thingsIts a very radical letting goBut before you can do that youve got to develop mindfulness concentration alertness all the qualities of the pathThen when the path is done it gets let go of tooLike having a set of tools that you use to work on the mind When the mind has been fully shaped fully developed you put the tools downThis is how we prepare for death so we can learn how to do it wellAs Ajaan Lee said most people die without any rhyme or reason flailing around and latching onto whatever the mind happens to think of in those last momentsAnd its capable of latching onto all kinds of stuff if you havent trained itIf you have trained it you have more control over itIts the same as when youre meditatingAs you see the mind flickering off to yet another thought  which develops into a little thought world a little becoming  you learn how to catch it and stop the process more and more quicklyThen you realize that this skill is not just a matter of mindfulness and alertness but also of your sense of values You have to undo the desire to go into those thought worlds to see them as interesting or worthwhileYouve got to train the mind so that it doesnt get pulled in doesnt get hoodwinked by flashy lights and sensuous curves and all the allure of these different worldsThis is why the skill of discernment is also a matter both of developing and letting goYou have to develop the right sense of values so that you can really let go of unskillful thingsAs you develop this skill in your meditation youre closer and closer to having a skill thats capable of facing death and handling it well so that you have your protectionDeath is going to happen regardless but you can protect your mind from dying in an unskillful wayYou do that by learning to live in a skillful way in all your actions in all your words and in the way you handle your mindSo fortunately learning how to die skillfully is no different from learning how to live skillfullyYou cover both issues while youre here as you practiceSo try to be heedfulHeedful doesnt mean simply being diligent and busy with the practiceIt also means having a strong sense that our actions make all the difference and that we dont have any time to wasteWe have to focus our energies on the areas that really will help us in the event say that a little blood clot starts getting the wanderlust roaming through your bloodstream wandering here wandering there and finally  whoops gets lodged in your heart and thats itOr that huge earthquake they keep warning us about These things can happen at any timeSo youve got to be preparedHeedfulness means seeing that there are dangers here in the mind and it really behooves you to work on them as quickly as you can to maintain your focus and not let it get distracted off into ways of wasting what little time youve gotYouve got this breath this breath this breathAs the Buddha said if youre on top of each breath realizing Im fortunate that Ive got this one more breath to practice the Buddhas teachings Thats when youre counted as heedfulSo dont let this breath be wastedAs we sit here meditating were engaged in a type of kammaIts called the kamma that puts an end to kammaBut this doesnt mean that it burns away old kammaOld kamma doesnt burnOne of the great ironies in the history of Buddhism is that some of the teachings the Buddha explicitly attacked are nowadays attributed to the Buddha himselfOne of these is the idea that simply by learning how not to react to anything in the present moment youre not just refraining from creating any new sankharas youre also burning away old sankharas old kammaBut theres a passage where the Buddha actually attacks the idea that you can burn off old kammaIn fact he gets quite satirical about itHe goes to see some Jains who believed that they could burn off old kamma by submitting themselves to different kinds of austerities that the pain in the austerity was the burning of old kammaHe said Can you measure how much kamma you burned todayHow much kamma you burned yesterdayDo you actually see the kamma burning Of course the answer is NoAnd what about the pain caused by your austeritiesWhats that They replied This is just the old kamma burning up He said Have you noticed that when you dont do your austerities theres no painHere hes making the point that when you experience the results of kamma its not just the results of past kammaIts also the results of your present decisionsIf the Jains didnt practice austerities here and now they wouldnt be experiencing those pains here and nowIn fact your present actions are the most important part of the kammic mixThis is the lesson of the kamma of meditationOur present decisions what were going to do with the mind what were going to focus on how we develop it Thats the kamma we witness as we meditateSo you want to focus on doing things that help you understand whats going on in the mind right nowWhat is this process of intentionHow does the mind create an experience of pleasure how does it create an experience of pain out of the raw material of old kammaThis is why right view is at the beginning of the path because right view itself begins with the understanding that our actions are important and that the intention in the action is what makes all the differenceThis means that issues of kamma are issues of the mindYou look into the mind to see its doing to see where youre adding any unnecessary element of stressThe Buddha located that unnecessary element in craving and specifically in three types of cravingThe first is craving for sensuality and here sensuality doesnt necessarily mean sensual pleasuresThe Buddha makes the point that our intentions for sensuality are what were really attached toThe idea of sensual pleasure the activity of thinking about sensuality is a lot more attractive than the actual pleasure itselfYou can obsess about the idea over and over and over again whereas the actual pleasure once youve experienced it quickly grows stale and is goneThen you have to find another one to replace itBut ordinarily we dont get so upset about replacing it because then the new pleasure provides more fodder for our sensual obsessions and as long as we can keep on obsessing we feel were okaySo our craving for sensuality this tendency of the mind to keep obsessing about planning about how its going to experience different sensual pleasures Thats what were really attached toWe really cling to that feed on thatIts our fodderSo thats the first kind of cravingSecond is the craving to become something  in other words to take on an identity in a specific world of experienceThe identity often plays into the world the world plays into the identityWhatever identity you build around a desire will then determine the parts of the world you pay attention to in terms of whether they help or hinder you from attaining that desireAt the same time whichever world youre thinking about right now  whether its the world of sports politics or your family  will then determine the kind of identity you want to take on in that worldAnd we crave these thingsWe feel diminished if were unable to assume an identity in a particular world that we think is important interesting or attractiveAnd then theres craving for nonbecoming  in other words the desire to destroy whatever identity youve had whatever world you may be experiencing when you tire of itThese three types of craving are the activities that add the unnecessary sufferingPeople sometimes assume that you can go beyond these three types of craving simply by learning to be nonreactiveBut Ive never seen the texts list right nonreactivity as a factor of the pathInstead the path is largely about doing developing and letting goYou want to develop skillful qualities and abandon unskillful onesLike right now Were developing right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThese are sankharas things we do things we fabricateSometimes nonreactivity gets inserted into the path under the factor of right mindfulnessBut the Buddha never defined mindfulness as nonreactivityMindfulness in his lexicon means the ability to keep something in mindAnd there is such a thing as right mindfulness and wrong mindfulnessWrong mindfulness is when you keep in mind desires that get you worked up about the worldRight mindfulness is when you take any of four frames of reference and keep them in mind as a basis for right concentrationNow when the Buddha teaches concentration he does start out with nonreactivity or equanimity as a prerequisiteBefore he teaches Rahula breath meditation he tells him first to make his mind like earthWhen disgusting things are thrown on the earth the earth doesnt reactThen he adds Make your mind like waterWater doesnt get disgusted when it has to wash away disgusting thingsMake your mind like fireFire doesnt get disgusted when it burns disgusting thingsMake your mind like windWind doesnt get disgusted when it blows disgusting things around You try to make your mind imperturbable like the elementsSo here there would be an element of nonreactivityBut this nonreactivity is for the purpose of putting your mind in a position where it can observe things clearly and in particular to observe your actions and their results in a patient reliable wayBecause when you start working with the breath youre not just looking at the breath in a nonreactive wayYoure working with it playing with it mastering it through experimenting with itAnd you want to be able to judge the results of your experiments in a fair and accurate mannerThe Buddha once recommended to the monks that they practice breath meditation and one of the monks said I already do that The Buddha asked him What kind of breath meditation do you practice The monk said I learn how not to hanker after the past not to hanker after the future and to be equanimous toward the present as I breathe in as I breathe out And the Buddha said Well there is that kind of breath meditation I dont deny itBut thats not how you get the most out of breath meditation Then he went into the sixteen steps as the way you do get the most out of breath meditationNow if you look carefully at those steps youll see that they involve a lot of willing a lot of training of the mind to develop certain qualitiesYou dont just sit here and watch whatever breath comes up willynilly or pretend that youre not playing any intentional role in shaping the breathInstead youre explicitly told to explore that intentional role first by being aware of the whole body as you breathe in and breathe out then by calming the breath calming the effect that the breathing has on the body calming the intentional element that goes into the breath making it more and more refined so that you can give rise to a sense of ease and raptureThen you notice how these feelings of ease and rapture play a role in shaping the mind and how your perception of the breath plays a role in shaping the mindYou try to calm the impact of that role make it more refinedThen you see what the mind needsDoes it need to be gladdenedDoes it need to be steadiedDoes it need to be released from anything its holding on toHow do you breathe in a way that helps accomplish thatHow do you play with your perception of the breath your perception of your feelings in order to accomplish thatWhat other topics  like the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha or recollection of death  can you bring to mind to accomplish thatIn other words what kinds of physical verbal and mental fabrications can you master to bring the mind into balanceThese are all things you do with the breath things you do with directed thought and evaluation with feeling and perceptionAnd the equanimity here is simply allowing you to observe clearly whats happening so you can do these things more effectivelyIn the process you see more clearly what youre actually doingYoure using the breath to feed the mindThis is one of the underlying images throughout the Buddhas teachings that the mind is hungryThis is why we sufferWere hungry for form feeling perceptions thought fabrications and consciousnessWe suffer because we cling to these thingsThe word for clinging  upadana  also means to take sustenance from somethingYou feed on things and its because you feed that you sufferThe Buddhas solution is not simply to say Well just stop feeding because theres no really good food out there That would be a very defeatist kind of teachingAnd it wouldnt be very effectiveIt would be as if he were saying Okay youre hungry but you learn how not to be hungry by realizing theres no such thing as good food That doesnt work with the body and certainly doesnt work with the mindThe way to stop the mind from being hungry is to feed it so well that its never hungry againThis is where the analogy between the body and the mind breaks downTheres no way you could ever put the body in a position where its totally free from hunger but you can do that with the mindAnd you do that not simply by learning how to accept things as unsatisfactoryYou feed the mind with the good qualities youre developingYou work on your conviction your persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment as healthy food for the mindThese are qualities developed on the path that strengthen the mindAnd especially discernment understanding what youre doing the results of what youre doing seeing where the unnecessary stress is in all of this so that you let go of whatever activities are causing that unnecessary stressWhen you dont put unnecessary stress on the mind you lessen its need to feedIn the course of doing that you run across something unexpectedAs you let go of your attachments you find that the mind really can touch something thats deathlessThe Buddha calls it seeing the deathless with the body or touching it with the bodyIts a total experienceIts not just an ideaIt totally replaces your experience of the bodyAnd it totally satisfies your hungerWith your first experience of it at streamentry you realize that this would satisfy hungerHowever only the arahants are totally satisfiedThey have totally ended their hunger and from that point on can be truly equanimous about whatever arises at the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body or the mindNot because they have become defeatist saying Well there is really no happiness to be found so I might as well give up and just accept the fact Its because their hunger has truly been satisfiedThe mind no longer feels any need to feed on anything at allThats why they can be equanimous toward the other things that in the past they looked to for foodNow theyve found a much better happiness that doesnt need to feedBut to get there requires feeding the mind with a lot of mindfulness and concentration that can strengthen your discernment to see these thingsThe deathless is available at any time but our discernment isnt refined enough isnt precise enough to detect itThis is why discernment has to be trainedThis is why the path is a gradual oneBut it does have its turning points or its sudden dropsThe Buddhas image is of the continental shelf off of India a gradual slope and then a sudden dropThe sudden drop is when you detect the deathlessIts a sudden total experienceAnd a lot of comprehension comes along with thatYou know immediately This is deathless this is something that time cant touch because its outside of timeSo the comprehension is instantaneousWe work toward it by gradually refining our discernmentWhen the path reaches that point the comprehension goes very deep very suddenlyIt gives a lot of satisfactionThats why the arahants no longer hungerNow the arahants havent burned off any past kamma but beginning with the point of their awakening they do relate to past kamma in a very different wayAll kinds of things can come up from the past and there can still be a lot of negative stuff in an arahants experienceVenMoggallana for instance was beaten again and again and again before he finally diedHe realized it was the result of an action in a past lifetime when he had killed his parentsBut his mind wasnt harmed by this his mind wasnt hurt by it because he didnt create any suffering out of itAs the Buddha once said its through making the mind expansive that you can greatly minimize the impact of any past bad kamma  expansive in terms of the brahmaviharas limitless goodwill limitless compassion limitless empathetic joy limitless equanimityAnd also expansive through whats called developing the body and developing the mind in other words learning how to make the mind so large that it isnt overcome by pleasure or overcome by painThe arahant is totally able to do this with no effort but we work on developing these skills in a gradual way by providing alternative places for the mind to stayIn other words when theres pain in one part of the body you can stay with the comfortable sensations you develop through concentration in another part of the bodyYou can will yourself to some extent not to be overcome by these things to be equanimous to these things but that willing is impermanent and doesnt totally solve the problemOnly when youve reached the deathless do you have another source of pleasure that totally overwhelms the experience of pleasure and painIt keeps you from being overwhelmed by ordinary pleasure or painThis sort of equanimity comes from a much deeper sourceIt doesnt have to be willed and so its totally reliableThis is why from the outside nibbana looks a lot like equanimityTheres a great deal of misunderstanding around this pointIt looks like equanimity but its notIn fact you have to go beyond all the various levels of equanimity  equanimity around the senses the equanimity of all the highest levels of concentration  to a state of nonfashioning if youre even going to get to nibbanaOne of the results of attaining nibbana is that you can be totally detached and equanimous toward the six senses but as the Buddha said nibbana itself is the ultimate happinessHe doesnt say its the ultimate equanimityIts the ultimate happinessThe arahant no longer hungers because he or she is totally satisfied with a happiness that doesnt need to feedAnd at that point kamma is endedThey say that the arahant continues to formulate intentions but each intention is like a seed thats been burnt as soon as its createdThis is the only place where the Buddha talks about burning the intentionHe says its like taking a seed and then immediately burning it so that it doesnt sprout into anything elseHow that happens youd have to be an arahant to knowBut the only way you can get started in understanding the arahants answer and developing the arahants skill is by really understanding what youre doing right now understanding your present kammaYou cant learn how to have intentions that dont sprout until youve learned how your current intentions do sproutThis is what were doing as we practice meditationWere trying to plant good intentions and then watch how they sproutFrom that we learn how to give rise to more and more refined intentions so that they give more and more refined sproutsAt the same time we gain a greater refinement in understanding how kamma actually happensWhen you finally see through it youll know how to do it but without having it sproutSo you cant simply will yourself to be nonreactive and hope that that will take care of everything  or even think that its somehow burning off kamma  because the willing to be nonreactive is a kind of kamma itselfThe correct willing here is in trying to develop right mindfulness right concentration all the right factors of the path as skillfully as possibleAnd in developing these skills you gain a lot of discernmentThe things you know the most clearly are the things you do yourselfThis means that you should learn how to do this really really skillfully so you understand it through and throughYou comprehend it to the point where you develop dispassion for it and in developing dispassion thats when you stopYou know how to stop because you know what youve been doingThis is how the kamma of the path leads to the end of kammaIt teaches you to understand kamma so thoroughly that you can plant seeds that dont sproutYou dont have to suffer from your past kamma and youre not suffering from present kammaThe mind is no longer hungrySo it doesnt feed on its kamma past or present because its found the happiness that eliminates any further need to feedWhen you come across a situation where a friend is in pain or suffering in mental distress and you can help the friend overcome the pain get over the distress it gives rise to a very good feeling in the heartThe problem is that there are other times when were with other people who are in pain and we cant reach themThis is especially true around issues of birth illness and deathSometimes you have a newborn child and the child is crying and crying and cryingNo matter what you do the child wont stopIt seems hard to believe that there can be so much pain and anguish in such a little tiny bodyBut there it isAnd you cant reach the childOr when someone is very ill and demented you often cant reach that personTheyre in their own private world suffering their own private pains and tormentsAnd especially at death there comes a point where even before the actual moment of death you realize that the person is beyond youYou cant reach in and help no matter how much you might want toThats when you realize the extent to which pain is a very private matter the extent to which anguish and suffering are private mattersWed like to think that we can help one another through these things but theres a lot that each person can do only for him or herselfEven the Buddha couldnt save other people there were many people he couldnt even teachHe taught only those who could be taught  in other words those who were willing to take responsibility for their own sufferingsThe pain of aging illness and death is one of the first topics the Buddha brings up in his first sermon which we chanted just nowAnd he says that our suffering doesnt come from a lack of help from other people it comes from our own lack of skill insideOur knowledge isnt skillful our desires arent skillfulAnd this is something that only we can take care of ourselves because no one can teach another person to be skillfulYou can teach people how they might try to train themselves to be skillful but you cant take your skill and put it in somebody elses head or handsThey have to learn how to observe from within what kind of thinking is skillful what kind of acting what kind of speaking is skillful and what kind is notIf they find themselves engaged in unskillful habits theyve got to learn how to overcome those habits and replace them with more skillful habitsWe cant do this for one anotherIts a personal individual matterThis is why the Buddha taught the way he didHe had developed the skill and he explained to other people how they could develop the skill as wellHe acted as an example he showed the way but that was as far as he could goFrom that point on it was up to the people he taught to develop the skill on their ownSomeone once asked the Buddha why some people when he taught them got the results and gained awakening while other people didntWas there something wrong with his teachingWas he playing favorites giving the right teaching to some and not to othersThe Buddha responded Have you ever given directions to someone on how to follow the road to Rajagaha from NalandaThe man said YesAnd did everybody get thereWell some people didnt follow my instructions the man saidThey went astrayWas it your fault that they went astrayThe man said NoI gave the same instructions to everybodyAnd the Buddha said it was the same in his caseHe gave the right instructions to everyoneSome people followed them some people didnt but it was beyond his power to force them toIn this way the Buddha keeps throwing the practice back at usIts up to us to deal with our own lack of skill to figure out where our thoughts are unskillful where our attitudes are unskillful where the way we look at things is unskillful and then make a changeHe wants us to make ourselves skillfulHe wants us to make ourselves strongThe most common image at the front of every Buddhist meditation hall is of the Buddha sitting there meditatingHes not nailed to a crossHe doesnt offer himself as foodBasically hes showing us This is how you learn how to feed yourselves so that you eventually reach the point where you dont need to feed anymoreYou develop internal strengths conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentThese are qualities we all have to some extent but weve got to learn how to strengthen them and they in turn make the mind strongerSo our food here isnt bread and wineOur food is concentrationThe Buddha compared the different levels of concentration to different types of foodThe first jhana he said is like grass and waterAs you work up through the other jhanas you get rice beans and finally honey sugar and gheeThese are our foods on the pathTheyre foods we have to learn how to fix within ourselvesWe have to become our own cooksThe ingredients are all hereIts simply a matter of putting them together and learning how to nourish ourselves with themSo instead of promising us an unending source of food from outside hes teaching us how to feed from within strengthening the mind ultimately to a point where it doesnt need to feed anymoreWhen youre in that position youre not the only one who benefitsThe people around you benefit as wellYoure no longer forcing them to provide you with the food you wantI remember once hearing a Dhamma teacher saying he didnt want to live in a world where there was no suffering because he wouldnt be able to exercise his compassionHe apparently didnt stop to think of what a selfish attitude that isYou want the gratification that comes from exercising your compassion so you need other people who sufferWhat kind of compassion is thatIdeally you should want a world where no one is suffering  where as we chant every night they can look after themselves with ease And the only way to do that is to teach people how to fix their own food and learn to be more skillful insideSome people will want to comply and some people wontThats where you have to develop equanimityYou dont grasp onto them saying Please stay here and suffer so I can feel good about being compassionate Thats just another way of saying Even though it hurts you to stay please be here for me when I need youThe Buddhas final nibbana was the opposite of that and it was an amazing act of kindnessHe showed us that the best thing a person can do is to find true happiness within and then get out of the food chainThats the example he left for usIn effect he was showing that your pursuit of true happiness is not something to be ashamed ofIts not a lowly or a childish or a hedonistic pursuitIts something noble  because the pursuit of true happiness is not a grasping kind of pursuitIt involves developing qualities of wisdom purity compassion the wisdom to realize that youre going to have to depend on yourself for your happiness and that the happiness thats worth working toward is a longterm happiness not a shorttermFrom that realization grows compassion the understanding that other people want happiness too and if your happiness depends on their suffering theyre not going to let your happiness be longtermTheyre going to try to cut it shortSo if you want a longterm happiness you cant harm other peopleAnd then purity comes from actually looking at your actions  your thoughts your words and your deeds  to see where your action cause harm either for yourself or for others and then learning how to avoid that harmSo the pursuit of happiness if you conduct it properly leads to noble qualities in the mindThat way you become a refuge both for yourself and for othersYou join the noble Sangha and become a refuge to other people in the sense that you become an example to them as well so they can learn how to feed and strengthen themselvesThis is how the Dhamma is passed onSo even though our pursuit may be for something very private and individual  the way we pursue this happiness this skill that enables us not to suffer even through illness or death  we take care of a part of ourselves that no one else can reachIf we dont take care of this what do we doWe thrash around placing burdens on other people and leaving them miserable because they see ultimately that they cant help our suffering either deep down insideBut if you learn how to take care of that part inside you youve taken care of your responsibilityAnd then whatever gifts you have for other people you can offer them freelyTheyre not offered in exchange for You take care of me and Ill take care of you The attitude is Here look take thisI dont need it anymoreThats a very different kind of relationshipIt doesnt come with a quid pro quo of Okay Ill be nice to you and youll be nice to me Its simply Here take But the Buddha goes beyond even the Here take this is my body offered to you He says Come and lookThis is how you can learn how to feed yourself from within how you can learn how to grow strong so that ultimately you dont need to feed anymoreIts probably the greatest gift there isI shall give a short exposition of the essence of the genuine teaching of the Buddha such as we still find it in the Buddhist scriptures handed down to us in the Pali languageThere are many among the listeners who are not Buddhists and to whom therefore in many cases the original teaching of the Buddha is a thing almost unknownIt goes without saying that it will not be possible for these within the limits of the time allowed to my talk to gain a thorough and full understanding of such a profound and wide subjectYet some of you may pick up and take hold of certain ideas that appear important and these may prove an inducement to further inquiry into this immensely profound world of thoughtEven should these words have no other effect than to remove at least some of the many prejudices and false ideas about the Buddhas doctrine it would be ample rewardDoes it not for instance appear ironical that this most sober of all the religious doctrines is still considered by many Westerners as some sort of idolatry or mysticismDid not the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche already long years ago understand and lay stress upon this absolute soberness and clearness of Buddhism when he saidBuddhism is a hundred times more realistic than ChristianityIt has entered upon the inheritance of objectively and coolly putting problemsIt came to life after several hundred years of philosophical developmentThe notion of God is done away with as soon as it appearsPrayer is out of the questionSo is asceticismNo categorical imperativeNo coercion at all not even within the monastic communityHence it also does not challenge to fight against those of a different faithIts teaching turns against nothing so impressively as against the feeling of revengefulness animosity and resentmentNow before beginning with the exposition of the Buddhas teaching we should get acquainted in a few words with the personality of the BuddhaThe term Buddha literally means the Enlightened One It is a name won by the Indian sage Gotama on his enlightenment under the Bodhitree at Buddhagaya in IndiaHe was born as the son of an Indian king on the borders of modern Nepal about years before ChristIn his th year he renounced the worldly life and exchanged his princely career for that of a homeless mendicantAfter six years of hard striving he at last attained his goal deliverance from the round of rebirths or SamsaraThe Buddha describes this time in his own words as followsBhikkhus before I had attained to full enlightenment myself being still subject to birth decay disease death sorrow and impurity I too was seeking after that which is subject to birth decay disease death sorrow and impurityAnd so bhikkhus after a time while still young a blackhaired lad in my youthful prime just come to budding manhoods years against the wishes of father and mother weeping and lamenting I cut off hair and beard and clad in the yellow robe went forth from home to homelessnessThus vowed to homelessness I was striving after the highest good the incomparable path to supreme peaceAt first the future Buddha learned under two great yogis who had attained to a high state of supernormal psychical powers and facultiesBut neither of them could satisfy him as their teachings did not lead to real everlasting peace and deliverance of mindSo he left them again after having fully realized their teachingThereafter he met five ascetics who were practicing the severest forms of selftorture and mortification of the flesh with the hope of gaining deliverance in this wayThe future Buddha became one of their partyHe subjected himself with utmost perseverance to extreme fasting and selftorture till at last he looked like a mere skeletonAnd utterly exhausted he broke down and collapsedHe now came to understand that bodily mortification is vain and useless and will never lead to peace of heart and to deliveranceHe henceforth gave up fasting and bodily mortification and sought refuge in moral and mental developmentAnd with calm and serene mind he began to look into the true nature of existenceWherever he turned his eyes he found only one great reality the law of suffering the unsatisfactoriness of all forms of existenceHe understood that the destiny of beings is not the outcome of mere blind chance nor does it depend upon the arbitrary action of an imaginary creator but that our destiny is to be traced back to our own former actions or kammaHe beheld the sick and the leper and he saw in their misery and suffering only the result of actions or kamma done in former livesHe beheld the blind and the lame and he saw in their debility and helplessness only the painful harvest of seeds sown by themselves in former livesHe beheld the rich and the poor the happy and the unhappy and wherever he turned his eyes there he saw this law of retribution the moral law of cause and effect the DhammaThis Dhamma or universal moral law discovered by the Buddha is summed up in the Four Noble Truths the truths about the universal sway of suffering about its origin its extinction and the path leading to its extinctionThe first truth about the universality of suffering teaches in short that all forms of existence are of necessity subject to sufferingThe second truth about the origin of suffering teaches that all suffering is rooted in selfish craving and ignorance in tanha and avijjaIt further explains the cause of this seeming injustice in nature by teaching that nothing in the world can come into existence without reason or cause and that not only all our latent tendencies but our whole destiny all weal and woe results from causes which we have to seek partly in this life partly in former states of existenceThe second truth further teaches us that the future life with all its weal and woe must result from the seeds sown in this and former livesThe third truth or the truth about the extinction of suffering shows how through the extinction of craving and ignorance all suffering will vanish and liberation from this Samsara be attainedThe fourth truth shows the way or the means by which this goal is reachedIt is the Noble Eightfold Path of right understanding right thought right speech right bodily action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration of mindFrom these Four Noble Truths we shall pick out and clear up such points as are essential for a general knowledge of the DhammaIn doing so we shall at the same time refute a number of widespread prejudices concerning the Buddhas teachingLet us however first outline the Noble Eightfold Path for it is this path of righteousness and wisdom that really constitutes the essence of Buddhist practice  the mode of living and thinking to be followed by any true follower of the BuddhaThe first stage of the Eightfold Path is as already stated right understanding ieunderstanding the true nature of existence and the moral laws governing the sameIn other words it is the right understanding of the Dhamma ieof the Four Noble TruthsThe second stage of the Eightfold Path is right thought iea pure state of mind free from sensual lust from illwill and from cruelty in other words thoughts of selfrenunciation of goodness and of mercyThe third stage is right speechIt consists of words which are not false not harsh not scandalous not frivolous ietruthful words mild words pacifying words and wise wordsThe fourth stage is right bodily action ieabstaining from intentional killing or harming of any living creature abstaining from dishonest taking of others property abstaining from adulteryThe fifth stage is right livelihood iesuch a livelihood as does not bring harm and suffering to other beingsThe sixth stage is right effortIt is the fourfold effort which we make in overcoming old and avoiding fresh bad actions by body speech and mind and the effort which we make in developing fresh actions of righteousness inner peace and wisdom and in cultivating them to perfectionThe seventh stage is right mindfulness or alertness of mindIt is the everready mental clarity whatever we are doing speaking or thinking and in keeping before our mind the realities of existence iethe impermanence unsatisfactoriness and phenomenality of all forms of existenceThe eighth stage is right concentration of mindSuch a kind of mental concentration is meant as is directed towards a morally wholesome object and always bound up with right thought right effort and right mindfulnessThus the Eightfold Path is a path of morality of mental training and of wisdomMorality therein is indicated by right speech right bodily action and right livelihoodMental training is indicated by right effort right mindfulness and right concentration of mindAnd wisdom is indicated by right understanding and right thoughtThus this liberating Eightfold Path is a path of inner culture of inner progressBy merely external worship mere ceremonies and selfish prayers one can never make any real progress in righteousness and insightThe Buddha says Be your own isle of refuge be your own shelter seek not for any other protectionLet the truth be your isle of refuge let the truth be your shelter seek not after any other protection To be of real effect to ensure an absolute inner progress all our efforts must be based upon our own understanding and insightAll absolute inward progress is rooted in right understanding and without right understanding there is no attainment of perfection and of the unshakable peace of NibbanaBelief in the moral efficacy of mere external rite and ritual constitutes according to the Buddhas teaching a mighty obstacle to inner progressOne who takes refuge in mere external practices is on the wrong pathFor in order to gain real inner progress all our efforts must necessarily be based on our own understanding and insightAny real progress is rooted in right understanding and without right understanding there will be no attainment of unshakable peace and holinessMoreover this blind belief in mere external practices is the cause of much misery and wretchedness in the worldIt leads to mental stagnation to fanaticism and intolerance to selfexaltation and contempt for others to contention discord war strife and bloodshed as the history of the Middle Ages quite sufficiently testifiesThis belief in mere externals dulls and deadens ones power of thought stifles every higher emotion in manIt makes him a mental slave and favors the growth of all kinds of hypocrisyThe Buddha has clearly and positively expressed himself on this pointHe says The man enmeshed in delusion will never be purified through the mere study of holy books or sacrifices to gods or through fasts or sleeping on the ground or difficult and strenuous vigils or the repetition of prayersNeither gifts to priests nor selfcastigation nor performance of rites and ceremonies can work purification in him who is filled with cravingIt is not through the partaking of meat or fish that man becomes impure but through drunkenness obstinacy bigotry deceit envy selfexaltation disparagement of others and evil intentions  through these things man becomes impureThere are two extremes addiction to sensual enjoyment and addiction to bodily mortificationThese two extremes the Perfect One has rejected and discovered the Middle Path which makes one both to see and to know which leads to peace to penetration enlightenment and liberationIt is that Noble Eightfold Path leading to the end of suffering namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration of mindInasmuch as the Buddha teaches that all genuine progress on the path of virtue is necessarily dependent upon ones own understanding and insight all dogmatism is excluded from the Buddhas teachingBlind faith in authority is rejected by the Buddha and is entirely opposed to the spirit of his teachingIn the Kalama Sutta the Buddha saysDo not go merely by hearsay or tradition by what has been handed down from olden time by rumours by mere reasoning and logical deductions by outward appearances by cherished opinions and speculations by mere possibilities and do not believe merely because I am your masterBut when you yourselves have seen that a thing is evil and leads to harm and suffering then you should reject itAnd when you see that a thing is good and blameless and leads to blessing and welfare then you should do such a thingOne who merely believes or repeats what others have found out such a one the Buddha compares with a blind manOne who desires to make progress upon the path of deliverance must experience and understand the truth for himselfLacking ones own understanding no absolute progress is possibleThe teaching of the Buddha is perhaps the only religious teaching that requires no belief in traditions or in certain historical eventsIt appeals solely to the understanding of each individualFor wherever there are beings capable of thinking there the truths proclaimed by the Buddha may be understood and realized without regard to race country nationality or station in lifeThese truths are universal not bound up with any particular country or any particular epochAnd in everyone even in the lowest there lies latent the capacity for seeing and realizing these truths and attaining to the Highest PerfectionAnd whosoever lives a noble life such a one has already tasted of the truth and in greater or lesser degree travels on the Eightfold Path of Peace which all noble and holy ones have trod are treading now and shall in future treadThe universal laws of morality hold good without variation everywhere and at all times whether one may call oneself a Buddhist Hindu Christian or Muslim or by any other nameIt is the inward condition of a person and his deeds that count not a mere nameThe true disciple of the Buddha is far removed from all dogmatismHe is a free thinker in the noblest sense of the wordHe falls neither into positive nor negative dogmas for he knows both are mere opinions mere views rooted in blindness and selfdeceptionTherefore the Buddha has said of himselfThe Perfect One is free from any theory for the Perfect One has seen Thus is corporeality thus it arises thus it passes away thus is feeling thus it arises thus it passes away thus is perception thus it arises thus it passes away thus are the mental formations thus they arise thus they pass away thus is consciousness thus it arises thus it passes awayThis important truth of the phenomenality and emptiness of all existence can be and ought to be understood by everyone for oneselfAccording to the Buddhas teaching our socalled individual existence is in reality nothing but a mere process of physical and mental phenomena a process which since time immemorial was already going on before ones apparent birth and which also after death will continue for immemorial periods of timeIn the following we shall see that the above five khandhas or groups of existence in no way constitute any real egoentity or atta and that no egoentity exists apart from them and hence that the belief in an egoentity is merely an illusionThat which we call our physical body is merely a name for a combination of manifold component parts and in reality constitutes no entity no personalityThis is clear to everyone without further argumentEverybody knows that the body is changing from moment to moment that old cells are continually breaking down and new ones arising in brief that the body will be quite another body after a few years that nothing will have remained of the former flesh bones blood etcConsequently the body of the baby is not the body of the school boy and the body of the young man is not the body of the grayhaired old manHence the body is not a persisting something but rather a continually changing process of arising and passing away consisting of a perpetual dying out and arising anew of cellsThat however which we call our mental life is a continually changing process of feeling perceptions mental formations and states of consciousnessAt this moment a pleasant feeling arises the next moment a painful feeling this moment one state of consciousness the next moment anotherThat which we call a being an individual a person does not in itself as such possess any independent abiding realityIn the absolute sense no individual no person is there to be found but merely perpetually changing combinations of physical states of feelings volitions and states of consciousnessWhat we call chariot has no existence apart from and independent of axle wheels shaft etcWhat we call house is merely a convenient name for stone wood iron etc put together after a certain fashion so as to enclose a portion of space but there is no separate houseentity as such in existenceIn exactly the same way that which we call a being or an individual or person or by the name I or he etc is nothing but a changing combination of physical and mental phenomena and has no real existence in itselfThe words I you he etc are merely terms found useful in conventional or current speech but do not designate realitiesFor neither do these physical and mental phenomena constitute an absolute egoentity nor yet does there exist outside these phenomena any egoentity self or soul who is the possessor or owner of the sameThus when the Buddhist scriptures speak of persons or even of the rebirth of persons this is done only for the sake of easier understanding and is not to be taken in the sense of ultimate truthThis socalled being or I is in the absolute sense nothing but a perpetually changing processTherefore also to speak of the suffering of a person or being is in the absolute sense incorrectFor it is not a person but a physicomental process that is subject to transiency and sufferingIn the absolute sense there are only numberless processes countless lifewaves in this vast eversurging ocean of bodily states of feelings perceptions volitions and states of consciousnessWithin these phenomena there exists nothing that is persistent not even for the brief span of two consecutive momentsThese phenomena have merely momentary durationThey die every moment and every moment new phenomena are born a perpetual dying and coming to birth a ceaseless heaving of waves up and downAll is in a state of perpetual flux panta rhei  all things are flowing  says the Greek philosopher HeraclitusThe old forms fall to pieces and new ones are bornOne feeling disappears another appears in its placeOne state of consciousness exists this moment another the following momentEverywhere is found a perpetual change of material and mental phenomenaIn this way moment follows upon moment day upon day year upon year life upon lifeAnd so this ceaselessly changing process goes on for thousands even aeons of yearsAn eternally surging sea of feelings perceptions volitions and states of consciousness such is existence such is Samsara the world of arising and passing away of growing and decaying a world of sorrow misery lamentation and despairWithout a real insight into this phenomenality or egolessness or impersonality of all existence it will be impossible to understand the Four Noble Truths rightlyIn this connection let us come back to the second noble truth the origin of suffering rooted in selfish craving and ignoranceIn order to understand this truth better it will be necessary to speak of a doctrine which so often is wrongly interpreted and misunderstoodIt is the Buddhist doctrine of rebirthWith regard to this teaching Buddhism is often accused of selfcontradictionThus it is said that Buddhism on the one hand denies the existence of the soul while on the other hand it teaches the transmigration of the soulNothing could be more mistaken than thisFor Buddhism teaches no transmigration at allThe Buddhist doctrine of rebirth  which is really the same as the law of causality extended to the mental and moral domain  has nothing whatever to do with the brahman doctrine of reincarnation or transmigrationThere exists a fundamental difference between these two doctrinesAccording to the brahmanical teaching there exists a soul independently of the body which after death leaves its physical envelope and passes over into a new body exactly as one might throw off an old garment and put on a new oneQuite otherwise however is it with the Buddhist doctrine of rebirthBuddhism does not recognize in this world any existence of mind apart from matterAll mental phenomena are conditioned through the six organs of sense and without these they cannot existAccording to Buddhism mind without matter is an impossibilityAnd as we have seen the mental phenomena just as all bodily phenomena are subject to change and no persisting element no egoentity no soul is there to be foundBut where there is no real unchanging entity no soul there one cannot speak of the transmigration of such a thingHow then is rebirth possible without something to be reborn without an ego or soulHere I have to point out that even the word rebirth in this connection is really not quite correct but used as a mere makeshiftWhat the Buddha teaches is correctly speaking the law of cause and effect working in the moral domainFor just as everything in the physical world happens in accordance with law as the arising of any physical state is dependent on some preceding state as its cause in just the same way must this law have universal application in the mental and moral domain tooIf every physical state is preceded by another state as its cause so also must this present physicomental life be dependent upon causes anterior to its birthThus according to Buddhism the present lifeprocess is the result of the craving for life in a former birth and the craving for life in this birth is the cause of the lifeprocess that continues after deathBut as there is nothing that persists from one moment of consciousness to the next so also no abiding element exists in this ever changing lifeprocess that can pass over from one life to anotherNothing transmigrates from this moment to the next nothing from one life to another lifeThis process of continually producing and being produced may best be compared with a wave on the oceanIn the case of a wave there is not the smallest quantity of water that actually travels over the surface of the seaThe wavestructure that seems to hasten over the surface of the water though creating the appearance of one and the same mass of water is in reality nothing but a continued rising and falling of ever new masses of waterAnd the rising and falling is produced by the transmission of force originally generated by windJust so the Buddha did not teach that it is an egoentity or a soul that hastens through the ocean of rebirth but that it is in reality merely a lifewave which according to its nature and activities appears here as man there as animal and elsewhere as invisible beingThere is another teaching of the Buddha which often gives rise to serious misunderstandingIt is the teaching of Nibbana or the extinction of sufferingThis third noble truth points out that through the cessation of all selfish craving and all ignorance of necessity all suffering comes to an end to extinction and no new rebirth will take placeFor if the seed is destroyed it can never sprout againIf the selfish craving that clutches convulsively at life is destroyed then after death there can never again take place a fresh shooting up a continuation of this process of existence a socalled rebirthWhere however there is no birth there can be no deathWhere there is no arising there can be no passing awayWhere no life exists no suffering can existNow because with the extinction of all selfish craving all its concurrent phenomena such as conceit selfseeking greed hate anger and cruelty come to extinction this freedom from selfish craving signifies the highest state of selflessness wisdom and holinessNow this fact  that after the death of the Holy One the Arahant this physicomental lifeprocess no longer continues  is erroneously believed by many to be identical with annihilation of self annihilation of a real being and it is therefore maintained that the goal of Buddhism is simply annihilationAgainst such a misleading statement one must enter an emphatic protestHow is it ever possible to speak of the annihilation of a self or soul or ego where no such thing is to be foundWe have seen that in reality there does not exist any egoentity or soul and therefore also no transmigration of such a thing into a new mothers wombThat bodily process starting anew in the mothers womb is in no way a continuation of a former bodily process but merely a result or effect caused by selfish craving and clinging to life of the socalled dying individualThus one who says that the nonproducing of any new lifeprocess is identical with annihilation of a self should also say that abstention from sexual intercourse is identical with annihilation of a child  which of course is absurdHere once more we may expressly emphasize that without a clear perception of the phenomenality or egolessness of all existence it will be impossible to obtain a real understanding of the Buddhas teaching especially that of rebirth and NibbanaThis teaching of anatta is in fact the only characteristic Buddhist doctrine with which the entire teaching stands or fallsA further reproach so often heard against Buddhism that it is a gloomy and pessimistic teaching proves entirely unfounded by the statements already madeFor as we have seen the Buddha not only discloses and explains the fact of misery but he also shows the way to find total release from itIn view of this fact one is rather entitled to call the Buddhas teaching the boldest optimism ever proclaimed to the worldTruly Buddhism is a teaching that assures hope comfort and happiness even to the most unfortunateIt is a teaching that offers even to the most wretched of criminals prospects of final perfection and peace and this not through blind belief or prayers or asceticism or outward ceremonies rites and rituals but through walking and earnestly persevering on that Noble Eightfold Path of inward perfection purity and emancipation of heart consisting in right understanding right thought right speech right bodily action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration and peace of mindWhen beholding this world and thinking about the destinies of beings it will appear to most people as if everything in nature was unjustWhy they will say is one person rich and powerful but another person poor and distressedWhy is one person all his life well and healthy but another person from his very birth sickly or infirmWhy is one person endowed with attractive appearance intelligence and perfect senses while another person is repulsive and ugly an idiot blind or deaf and dumbWhy is one child born amid utter misery and among wretched people and brought up as a criminal while another child is born in the midst of plenty and comfort of nobleminded parents and enjoys all the advantages of kindly treatment and the best mental and moral education and sees nothing but good things all aroundWhy does one person often without the slightest effort succeed in all his enterprises while to another person all his plans failWhy do some live in luxury while others have to live in poverty and distressWhy is one person happy but another person unhappyWhy does one person enjoy long life while another person in the prime of life is carried away by deathWhy is this soWhy do such differences exist in natureOf all those circumstances and conditions constituting the destiny of a being none according to the Buddhas Teaching can come into existence without a previous cause and the presence of a number of necessary conditionsJust as for example from a rotten mango seed a healthy mango tree with healthy and sweet fruits never will come just so the evil volitional actions or evil kamma produced in former births are the seeds or rootcauses of an evil destiny in a later birthIt is a necessary postulate of thinking that the good and bad destiny of a being as well as its latent character cannot be the product of mere chance but must of necessity have its causes in a previous birthAccording to Buddhism no organic entity physical or psychical can come into existence without a previous cause iewithout a preceding congenial state out of which it has developedAlso no living organic entity can ever be produced by something altogether outside of it
