gather togetherAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture PeakAt that time on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth the wanderers of other religions gathered and gave teachingsPeople went to listen to those teachingsand they acquired affection for and confidence in those wanderers And the wanderers gained a followingWhile King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was alone he reflected on thisand he thought Why dont the venerables too gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonthHe then went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told him what he had thoughtadding It would be good Venerable Sir if the venerables too gathered on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonthThe Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teachingWhen the Buddha was finished the King got up from his seat bowed circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonthWhen the monks knewwhat the Buddha had saidthey started gathering on those daysPeople came to hear a teaching but the monks sat in silenceThe people complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth but then sit in silence like dumb pigsShouldnt they give a teaching when they gather togetherThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksWhen you gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth you should give a teachingThe instruction to recite the Monastic CodeWhile the Buddha was in seclusion he thoughtLet me instruct the monks to recite a monastic code consisting of those training rules that I have laid down for themThat will be their procedure for the observance dayIn the evening when the Buddha had come out from seclusion he gave a teaching and addressed the monkstelling them what he had thought and addingYou should recite the Monastic CodeAnd it should be done like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the

CodeEveryone present should listen and attend carefullyAnyone who has committed an offense should reveal itIf you havent committed any offense you should remain silentIf you are silent I will regard you as pureJust as one who is asked individually responds so too the announcement is made up to three times in this kind of gatheringIf a monk remembers an offense but doesnt reveal it when an announcement is made up to the third time he is lying in full awarenessLying in full awareness is called an obstacle by the BuddhaA monk who remembers an offense and is seeking purification should

had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Codesome monks recited it dailyThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should not recite the Monastic Code every dayIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYou should recite the Monastic Code on the observance dayWhen they knewthat the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code on the observance daysome monks recited it three times per halfmonth on the fourteenth on the fifteenth and on the eighth dayYou should not recite the Monastic Code three times per halfmonthIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYou should recite the Monastic Code once every halfmonth on the fourteenth day or on the fifteenth dayOn one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code separately each to his own followersYou should not recite the Monastic Code separately each to your own followersIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYou should do the observanceday procedure in a complete assemblyWhen they knewthat the Buddha had laid down a rulethat the observanceday procedure should be done in a complete assemblythe monks thought How far does a complete assembly extend As far as one monastery or as far as the entire earthA complete assembly extends as far as one monasteryMahākappinaAt that time Venerable Mahākappina was staying at Rājagaha in the deer park at MaddakucchiOn one occasion while he was in seclusion he thoughtShould I or shouldnt I go to the observanceday procedure Should I or should I not go to the legal procedures of the Sangha Regardless Ive reached the highest purityThe Buddha read his mindThen just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and reappeared in front of Mahākappinawhere he sat down on a prepared seatMahākappina bowed and sat downand the Buddha said to himIsnt it the case Kappinathat you were wondering whether or not you should go to the observanceday procedure and the legal procedures of the SanghaYes Venerable SirIf you brahmins dont honor and revere the observance day then who willGo to the observanceday procedure brahminand go to the legal procedures of the SanghaThe Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teachingThen just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Mahākappina and reappeared on the Vulture PeakThe allowance for monastic boundariesWhen they knewthat the Buddha had laid down a rulethat a complete assembly extends as far as one monastery the monks thought How far does a single monastery extendThey told the Buddha and he saidI allow you to establish a monastic boundaryAnd it should be established like thisFirst the boundary markers should be announceda hill a rock a forest grove a tree a path an anthill a river a lakeThen a competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha then based on the boundary markers that have been announcedthe Sangha should establish a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure togetherPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenBased on the boundary markers that have been announcedthe Sangha establishes a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure togetherAny monk who approves of establishing based on these boundary markers a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has established based on these boundary markers a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure togetherThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusWhen they knewthat the Buddha had given the allowance to establish a boundarythe monks from the group of six established boundaries that were too extensive   and even  kilometersMonks going to the observanceday procedure arrived while the Monastic Code was being recited or just after it had been recited and they had to stay overnight on the wayYou should not establish a boundary that is too extensive either   or  kilometersIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYou should establish a boundary that is  kilometers at the mostAt one time the monks from the group of six had established a boundary that crossed a riverMonks who were coming to the observanceday procedure were swept away by the current as were their bowls and robesYou should not establish a boundary that crosses a riverIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductI allow you to establish a boundary that crosses a river only if there is a permanent bridge or a ferry connectionDiscussion of the observanceday hallAt that time the monks recited the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointmentNewly arrived monks did not knowwhere the observanceday procedure was to be heldThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should not recite the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointmentIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductI allow you to designate an observance day hallwhether a dwelling a stilt house or a cavefor the observanceday procedureAnd it should be designated like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should designate suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hallPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha designates suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hallAny monk who approves of designating suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hall should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has designated suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hallThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusSoon afterwards in a certain monastery they designated two different observanceday hallsMonks gathered in both placeseach group thinking The observanceday procedure will be done hereThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should not designate two different observanceday halls within the same monasteryIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYou should abolish one of them and do the observanceday procedure in one placeAnd it should be abolished like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should abolish suchandsuch an observanceday hallPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha abolishes suchandsuch an observanceday hallAny monk who approves of abolishing suchandsuch an observanceday hall should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has abolished suchandsuch an observanceday hallThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThe allowance for an observanceday forecourtAt one time in a certain monastery they had designated an observanceday hall that was too small On the observance day a large sangha of monks gathered thereSome monks listened to the recitation of the Monastic Code while sitting on the ground outside the designated areathat the Buddha had laid down a rulethat the observanceday procedure should be done after designating an observanceday hall and they wondered Have we done the observanceday procedure or have we notThey told the Buddha and he saidWhether you listen to the recitation of the Monastic Code while seated within or outside the ground that has been designated in either case you have done the observanceday procedureNevertheless the Sangha may designate an observanceday forecourt that is as large as you likeAnd it should be designated like thisFirst the boundary markers should be announcedThen a competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sanghathen based on the boundary markers that have been announced the Sangha should designate an observanceday forecourtPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenBased on the boundary markers that have been announcedthe Sangha designates an observanceday forecourtAny monk who approves of designating based on these boundary markers an observanceday forecourt should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has designated based on these boundary markers an observanceday forecourtThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusAt that time on the observance day in a certain monastery the junior monks had gathered first They thoughtTheres no need to be here until the senior monks arriveand they leftAs a consequence the observanceday procedure was done at the wrong timeOn the observance day the senior monks should arrive firstAt that time at Rājagaha there were a number of monasteries within the same monastic boundaryThe monks arguedabout in which monastery the observanceday procedure should be doneWhen there are a number of monasteries within the same boundaryand the monks are arguingabout where the observanceday procedure should be donethose monks should all gather in one place and do the observanceday procedure thereOr they should gather wherever the most senior monk is stayingYou should not do the observanceday procedure with an incomplete SanghaIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductThe allowance for a maystayapart boundaryOn one occasion Venerable Mahākassapa was coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the observanceday procedure As he was crossing a river on the way he briefly got carried away by the current and his robes got wetThe monks asked himwhy his robes were wetand he told them what had happenedThey told the Buddha and he saidWhen the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes areaAnd it should be designated like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure

upThe Sangha has designated this boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes areaThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusWhen they knew that the Buddha had allowed the designation of a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area monks stored their robes in inhabited areasThe robes were lost burnt or eaten by ratsAs a consequence their robes became shabbyOther monks asked themwhy they were so poorly dressedand they told them what had happenedThey then told the Buddha and he saidWhen the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areasAnd it should be designated like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha has established a

togetherThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusBoundaries for inhabited areas etcThere are monks who live supported by inhabited areas where no boundary has been established In these cases the boundary of the inhabited area defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure togetherIf it is an uninhabited area in the wilderness a distance of  meters on all sides defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure togetheror a lake cannot form a complete boundary on its ownIn a river in the ocean and in a lake the area that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together is the distance an average man can splash water in all directionsAt one time the monks from the group of six created a boundary that crossed an existing boundaryThe establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure that is irreversible and fit to standThe establishment of the subsequent boundary is an illegitimate legal procedure that is reversible and unfit to standYou should not create boundaries that cross existing boundariesIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductAt one time the monks from the group of six enclosed one boundary within anotherThe establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure

legitimate and have a complete assemblyThe recitation of the Monastic Code in brief etcThe monks thoughtHow many ways of reciting the Monastic Code are thereThey told the Buddha and he saidThere are

day the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offenseThose monks thoughtThe Buddha has laid down a rulethat one shouldnt confess or receive the confession of shared offensesBut here the whole sangha has committed the same offenseSo what should we doOn the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery has committed the same offenseThose monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monasteryGo and make amends for this offenseWhen you return well make amends for it in your presenceIf hes able to do so its goodIf not then a competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThis whole sangha has committed the same offenseWhen the Sangha sees another monk who is pure and free from offenses it should make amends for this offense in his presenceOnce this has been said they can do the observanceday procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic CodeYou shouldnt allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observanceday procedureOn the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery is unsure if it has committed the same offenseA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThis whole Sangha is unsure if it has committed the same offenseWhen the Sangha is sure it should make amends for this offenseOnce this has been said they can do the observanceday procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic CodeYou shouldnt allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observanceday procedureWhen a sangha has entered the rainyseason residence in a certain monastery it may happen that the whole sangha has committed the same offenseThose monks should

monk using the sevenday allowanceGo and make amends for this offenseWhen you return well make amends for it in your presenceSoon afterwards the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offenseThey did not know the name or the class of that offenseThen a monk arrived who was learned and a master of the tradition who was an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries who was knowledgeable and competent had a sense of conscience and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingOne monk approached him and askedWhen someone does suchandsuch whats the name of the offense hes committedThe learned monk repliedWhen someone does suchandsuch hes committed an offense with this nameIf you have committed this offenseyou should make amends for itThe other monk then saidIts not just I alone who have committed this offensebut this whole sangha has committed itThe learned monk saidWhat does it matter to you whether others have or havent committed an offensePlease clear yourself of your own offenseThen because of what the learned monk had said the other monk made amends for that offense He then approached the other monks and saidWhen someone does suchandsuch hes committed an offense with this nameThis is the offense that you have committedand you should make amends for itBut in spite of what he had said those monks did not want to make amends for that offenseThey told the Buddha and he saidIn a case such as thisif those monks do make amends for that offense because of what that monk has said then this is goodIf they dont then that monk

Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time Vesālī was prosperous and crowded with people and there was plenty of foodThere were seven thousand seven hundred and seven stilt housesand the same number of halls with peaked roofsand lotus pondsAnd there was the courtesan Ambapālī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion She was skilled at dancing singing and instrumental

saw all these marvelous qualities of the cityincluding AmbapālīWhen they had concluded their business they returned to RājagahaThey then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadhaand told him about

from both sidesYou should fasten it at the cornersThe corners became wornI allow you thread for the cornersThe dye dripped from one sideYou should dye it by repeatedly turning it over and you should not go away while its still drippingThe robes were stiffYou should rinse it in waterThe robes were roughYou should beat it with your handsAt that time the monks wore robes consisting of a single piece of cloth the color of ivoryPeople complained and criticized themThey are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasuresThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should not wear robes made consisting of a single piece of clothIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductThe instruction on robes made of piecesAfter staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward the southern hillsHe saw the fields of Magadha laid out in rectangles defined by long and short boundaries and their intersections He said to Venerable nandananda have a look at these fieldsYes SirAre you able to make this kind of robe for the monksAfter staying in the southern hills for as long as he liked the Buddha returned to Rājagahananda then made robes for a number of monks He approached the Buddha and saidVenerable Sir please have a look at the robes Ive madeSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksnanda is clever He understands the detailed meaning of what I have spoken in briefHe can make long interpanel strips short interpanel strips large panels mediumsized panels middle sections intermediate sections a strengthening piece for the neck a strengthening piece for the calves and outer sections In this way the robe will be made of pieces making it worthless making it appropriate for ascetics making it undesirable for ones enemiesYour outer robe should be made of pieces and so should your upper robe and sarongThe instruction on three robesAfter staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward VesālīOn the road between Rājagaha and Vesālī the Buddha saw a number of monks walking along loaded up with robes on their heads shoulders and hips He thoughtThese foolish men have turned to an abundance in robes too readilyLet me set a limit on robes for the monksWandering on the Buddha eventually arrived at Vesālī where he stayed at the Gotamaka ShrineAt that time it was midwinter when the days are cold and the snow is fallingThe Buddha sat outside at night without being cold wearing only one robe He was fineBecoming cold at the end of the first part of the night he put on a second robeBecoming cold once again at the end of the middle part of the night he put on a third robeAt the end of the last part of the night when the sky was flaring up at dawn he became cold once morePutting on a fourth robe he was fineHe thought Even those on this spiritual path who come from good families who are sensitive to the cold and fear the cold are able to get by with three robesLet me set a limit on robes for the monks let me allow them three robesSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksHe told them what had happenedand what he had thought addingI allow you three robes a doublelayered outer robe a singlelayered upper robe and a singlelayered sarongDiscussion on extra robesWhen they knew that the Buddha had allowed three robesthe monks from the group of six entered the village in one set of three stayed in the monastery in another set and went bathing in yet another setThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks from the group of six keep extra robesAnd they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not keep extra robesIf you do you should be dealt with according to the ruleSoon afterwards Venerable nanda was given an extra robeHe wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputtawho was staying at SāketaKnowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having an extra robe he thoughtWhat should I do in this situationHe told the Buddha who saidHow long is it nanda before Sāriputta returnsNine or ten daysSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should keep an extra robe for ten days at the mostSoon afterwards the monks were given an extra robeNot knowing what to do with itthey told the Buddha and he saidI allow you to transfer extra robes to anotherAfter staying at Vesālī for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward BenaresWhen he eventually arrivedhe stayed in the deer park at IsipattanaOn that occasion the sarong of a certain monk had a tearHe thoughtThe Buddha has allowed three robesa doublelayered outer robe a singlelayered upper robe and a singlelayered sarongSince my sarong has a tearlet me add a patch It will have a double layer of cloth on all sides but only a single layer in the middleAnd he did soJust then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings and he saw that monk patching his robe He approached that monk and saidWhat are you doing monkIm patching my robe SirWell doneIts good that you are patching your robeSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksWhen the cloth is new or nearly new I allow a doublelayered outer robe a singlelayered upper robe and a singlelayered sarongWhen the cloth is worn I allow an outer robe of four layers a doublelayered upper robe and a doublelayered sarongWith rags you may have as much as you likeWith scraps of cloth from a shop you should search for themAnd I allow patches mending hems strips of cloth for marking and strengtheningThe account of VisākhāAfter staying at Benares for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward SāvatthīWhen he eventually arrivedhe stayed in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasterySoon afterwards Visākhā Migāramātā went to the Buddha bowed and sat downWhen the Buddha had instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teachingVisākhā saidPlease accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that the Buddha had consented Visākhā got up from her seat bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and leftThe following morning it was pouring down from a great storm extending over the four continentsThe Buddha said to the monksIt rains on the four continents just as it rains here in the Jeta GroveBathe in the rain monksthis is the last great storm of this kindSaying Yes Sir they took off their robes and bathed in the rainWhen Visākhā had had various kinds of fine food prepared she told a slaveGo to the monastery and tell the Buddha that the meal is readySaying Yes Lady she went to the monastery When she got there she saw the monks bathing naked in the rain She thoughtThere are no monks in the monastery just jīvaka ascetics bathing in the rainShe then returned to Visākhā and told her what had happenedBut being wise and discerning Visākhā thought No doubt the venerables are bathing naked in the rainIts only because of her ignorance that she thinks as she doesSo she sent the slave back to the monastery with the same instructionsWhen the monks had cooled their bodies and felt invigorated they took their robes and entered their dwellingsWhen the slave arrived she didnt see any monks She thoughtThere are no monks in the monastery its emptyand she returned to Visākhā and told her what had happenedOnce again Visākhā realized what was going onand she told the slave to return to the monastery one more timeWhen the message had been delivered the Buddha said to the monksGet your bowls and robes its time for the mealYes SirThe Buddha robed up and took his bowl and robeThen just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the Jeta Grove and appeared at Visākhās gatewayAnd he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monksVisākhā thought The power and might of the Buddha are truly amazingThe water is flowing kneedeep even waistdeep yet not single monk has wet feet or wet robesDelighted and joyful she personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha When the Buddha had finished his meal she sat down to one sideVenerable Sir I wish to ask for eight favorsBuddhas dont grant favors VisākhāIts allowable and blamelessWell then please say what it isFor as long as I live I wish to give rainyseason robes to the Sangha and I wish to give meals to the newly arrived and departing monastics as well as to those who are sick and those nursing the sick I also wish to give medicines to the sick a regular supply of rice porridge as well as bathing robes to the nunsBut Visākhā what reason do you have for asking me for these eight favorsVisākhā then told the Buddha what had happened to her slaveadding Nakedness is gross disgusting and repulsiveThis is the reason I wish to give rainyseason robes to the Sangha for as long as I liveAlso not knowing the streets or where to go for almsfood newly arrived monks will get exhausted while walking for almsAfter eating a meal for newly arrived monks from me they will get to know the streets and where to go for almsfood and they wont get exhausted while walking for almsThis is the reason I wish to give meals to the newly arrived monks for as long as I liveAlso in trying to get a meal departing monks may bother the Teacher or they may arrive late at their destination Or if they go without eating they will be weak while travelingAfter eating a meal for departing monks from me they wont bother the Teacher they will arrive at their destination at an appropriate time and they wont be weak while travelingThis is the reason I wish to give meals to the departing monks for as long as I liveAlso if sick monks dont get suitable food their illness may get worse or they may dieBut when they have eaten a meal for the sick from me their illness wont get worse and they wont dieThis is the reason I wish to give meals to the sick monks for as long as I liveAlso if the monks who nurse the sick have to get their own meals they will only be able to bring back meals for the sick after midday and the sick wont be able to eatBut when they have eaten a meal for those nursing the sick from me they will be able to bring back meals for the sick in good time and the sick will be able to eatThis is the reason I wish to give meals to those monks who nurse the sick for as long as I liveAlso if the sick monks dont get suitable medicines their illness may get worse or they may dieBut when they have taken medicine from me their illness wont get worse and they wont dieThis is the reason I wish to give medicine to the Sangha for as long as I liveAlso while staying at Andhakavinda the Buddha allowed rice porridge seeing ten benefits in itThis is the reason I wish to give a regular supply of rice porridge to the Sangha for as long as I liveOn one occasion Sir nuns were bathing naked at a ford in the river Aciravatī together with prostitutesThe prostitutes made fun of themVenerables why practice the spiritual life while youre young Why not enjoy worldly pleasuresWhen youre old then you can practice the spiritual lifeIn this way youll obtain the benefits of bothBeing poked fun at by the prostitutes the nuns were humiliatedNakedness in women is gross disgusting and repulsiveThis is the reason I wish to give bathing robes to the Sangha of nuns for as long as I liveBut Visākhā what benefit do you see that you ask me for these eight favorsMonks who have completed the rainyseason residence in the various districts will come to Sāvatthī to visit the BuddhaIf a monk has diedthey will ask you about his destinationand you will tell them whether hes reached the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning or perfectionIll then ask those monkswhether that dead monk had previously visited SāvatthīIf they say he hadI may concludeNo doubt that Venerable will have enjoyed a rainyseason robe supplied by me or he will have enjoyed a meal for newly arrived monks a meal for departing monks a meal for sick monks a meal for those nursing the sick medicines or a regular supply of rice porridgeall given by meWhen I recall that I will feel glad The gladness will give rise to joy and the mental joy will make my body tranquil When my body is tranquil I will feel bliss And when I feel bliss my mind will be stilledIn this way I will develop the spiritual faculties the spiritual powers and the factors of awakeningIts because of this benefit that I ask for these eight favorsWell said VisākhāIts good that you ask me for these eight favors for the sake of this benefitI grant you these eight favorsAnd the Buddha expressed his appreciation to Visākhā with these versesRejoicing in giving food and drinkA virtuous disciple of the Accomplished OneOvercoming stinginess gives a giftThat leads to heaven eliminates sadness and brings blissBy means of the stainless pathShe obtains heaven and long lifeDesiring merit happy and healthyShe rejoices in heaven for a long timeWhen the Buddha had expressed his appreciation he got up from his seat and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksI allow a rainyseason robe meals for newly arrived monastics meals for departing monastics meals for the sick meals for those nursing the sick medicine for the sick a regular supply of rice porridge and bathing robes for the Sangha of nunsThe section for recitation on Visākhā is finishedThe allowance for a sitting matAt one time after the monks had eaten fine food they went to sleep absentminded and heedlessThey emitted semen while dreaming and the furniture was soiledSoon afterwards the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable nanda as his attendant Seeing that soiled furniture he asked nanda what had happenednanda told himand the Buddha said Thats how it is nandaFor one who goes to sleep absentminded and heedless semen is emitted while dreamingBut for those monks who fall asleep mindful and heedful this doesnt happenNor does it for ordinary people without sensual desireAnd nanda its impossible for a perfected one to emit semenSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monkstelling them what had happenedHe then saidThere are these five disadvantages in going to sleep absentminded and heedlessyou dont sleep well you wake up feeling miserable you have nightmares the gods dont guard you and you emit semenAnd there are these five benefits in going to sleep mindful and heedfulyou sleep well you wake up feeling good you dont have nightmares the gods guard you and you dont emit semenAnd monks I allow a sitting mat to protect the body to protect the robes and to protect the furnitureBut the sitting mat was too small It did not provide a full protectionI allow you to make a sheet as large as you likeOn one occasion Venerable nandas preceptor Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa had carbunclesand the pus caused his robes to stick to his bodyTo detach them the monks kept on moistening his robes with waterAs the Buddha was walking about the dwellings he saw the monks doing this He approached them and saidWhat illness does this monk haveHe has carbuncles SirThats why were doing thisSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksFor anyone who has an itch a boil a running sore or a carbuncle I allow a itchcovering clothOn one occasion Visākhā took a handkerchief and went to the Buddha She bowed sat downVenerable Sir please accept this handkerchief for my longlasting benefit and happinessThe Buddha accepted itand then instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teachingShe got up from her seat bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksI allow handkerchiefsAt that time Venerable nanda had a friend called Roja the MallianRoja had an old linen cloth that ended up in nandas handsand it so happened that nanda needed such a clothThey told the Buddha and he saidI allow you to take things on trust from one who has five qualitiesthey are a friend they are a close companion they have spoken about it they are alive and you know they will be pleased if you take itAt that time the monks had enough robesbut they needed water filters and bagsI allow cloth for requisitesDiscussion of the smallest robecloth that can be transferred to another etcSoon afterwards the monks thoughtThese things that have been allowed by the Buddhathe three robes the rainyseason robe the sitting mat the sheet the itchcovering cloth the handkerchief and the cloth for requisitesare they all to be determined or to be transferred to anotherThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should determine the three robes not transfer themyou should determine the rainyseason robe for the four months of the rainy season and then transfer ityou should determine the sitting mat not transfer ityou should determine the sheet not transfer ityou should determine the itchcovering cloth for as long as youre ill and then transfer ityou should determine the handkerchief not transfer

allow you to give to your mother and fatherBut monks a gift of faith should not be ruinedIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductOn one occasion a monk left one of his robes in the Blind Mens Grove and then went for alms in the village in just his sarong and upper robeThieves stole that robeand he became poorly dressedWhen other monks asked him whyhe told them what had happenedYou should not enter a village in just your sarong and upper robeIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductSoon afterwards Venerable nanda being absentminded entered a village in just his sarong and upper robeThe monks asked him whysince the Buddha had laid down a rule against itand nanda told them what had happenedThey told the Buddha and he saidThere are five reasons for leaving behind the outer robeyoure sick its the rainy season youre going to cross a river the dwelling is protected by a door you have participated in the robemaking procedureThere are five reasons for leaving behind the

downthat a sangha consists of a group of at least fourbut Im here by myselfNow these people have given robecloth intending it for the SanghaLet me take this robecloth to SāvatthīHe then took that robecloth to Sāvatthī and told the Buddha what had happenedThe Buddha said This robecloth is yours until the end of the robemaking seasonIt may be that a monk spends the rainy season by himselfyet

the SanghaLet me take this robecloth to SāvatthīHe then took that robecloth to Sāvatthī and told the monkswho in turn told the BuddhaHe said It should be shared out in the presence of the SanghaIt may be that a monk is living by himself outside the rainy season yet people give him robecloth intending it for the SanghaI allow that monk to determine that robecloth as hisBut if another monk arrives before he has determined that robecloth then he should be given an equal shareIf yet another monk arrives before they have shared out that robecloth by drawing lots he too should be given an equal shareIf still another monk arrives but after they have shared out that robecloth by drawing lots they dont need give him a share if they are unwillingOn one occasion after completing the rainyseason residence at Sāvatthī two senior monks who were brothers Venerable Isidāsa and Venerable Isibhaṭa went to a certain village monasteryBecause it was long since they had been there people gave meals together with robeclothThe resident monks asked them Venerables this robecloth belonging to the Sangha was given because of you Will you accept a shareThey replied As we understand the teaching of the Buddha this robecloth is just for you until the end of the robemaking seasonAt that time three monks were spending the rains residence at RājagahaPeople gave them robecloth intending it for the

residence in one place and accepted a share of the robecloth from somewhere elseThe monks of few desires complained and criticized UpanandaHow can Venerable Upananda spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robecloth from somewhere elseThey told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned UpanandaIs it true Upananda that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robecloth from somewhere elseThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it  and after rebuking him

conductAt one time Venerable Upananda spent the rains residence in two separate monasteries thinking In this way Ill get much robeclothThe monks considered What share of the robecloth should be given to Venerable UpanandaThey told the Buddha and he saidGive the foolish man one persons shareIt may be that a monk spends the rains residence in two monasteries with the intention of getting much robeclothIf he spends half the time in each monastery he should be given half a share of the robecloth in eachOtherwise he should be given his share of the robecloth in the monastery where he spends

account of Mahāpajāpati GotamīAt one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Tree MonasteryAt this time Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went to the Buddha bowed down to himIt would be good Venerable Sir if women were allowed to go forth from home to homelessness on the spiritual path made known by the BuddhaLet it be Gotami dont pursue thisA second timeand a third time she askedthe same questionand got the same replyShe thoughtThe Buddha doesnt allow women to go forthand sad and tearful she bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and leftWhen the Buddha had stayed at Kapilavatthu for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward VesālīWhen he eventually arrivedhe stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodIn the meantime Mahāpajāpati had her hair cut off put on ocher robes and set out for Vesālī together with a number of Sakyan womenWhen she eventually arrived she went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodAnd she stood outside the gateway sad and tearful covered in dust and her feet swollenVenerable nanda saw her thereand said to herWhy are you standing outside the gateway like thisBecause Venerable nanda the Buddha doesnt allow women to go forthWell then Gotamī please wait here for a moment while I ask the Buddha to allow women to go forthVenerable nanda went to the Buddha bowed sat downSir Mahāpajāpati Gotamī is standing outside the gateway sad and tearful covered in dust and her feet swollenShe says you wont allow women to go forthIt would be good if women were allowed to go forthLet it be nanda dont pursue thisA second timeand a third time he askedthe same questionand got the same replynanda thoughtThe Buddha doesnt allow women to go forthLet me ask him in another wayHe then saidIf women were allowed to go forth would they be capable of realizing the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning and the fruit of perfectionYes they wouldIf thats so Sirand considering that Mahāpajāpati has been very helpful to youshe is your aunt who nurtured you brought you up and breastfed you when your own mother diedit would be good if women were allowed to go forthThe eight important principlesnanda if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principlesthat will be her full ordinationA nun who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should bow down to a monk who was given the full ordination on that very day and she should stand up for him raise her joined palms to him and do acts of respect toward himThis rule is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachedA nun should not spend the rainy season in a monastery without monksThis rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachedEvery halfmonth a nun should ask the Sangha of monks for two thingsabout the date of the observance day and about going for the instructionThis rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachedA nun who has completed the rains residence should invite correction from both Sanghas in regard to three thingswhat has been seen what has been heard and what has been suspectedThis rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachedA nun who has committed a heavy offense must undertake the trial period for a halfmonth toward both SanghasThis rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachedA trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years may seek for full ordination in both SanghasThis rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachedA nun may not in any way abuse or revile a monkThis rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachedFrom today onwards nuns may not correct monks but monks may correct nunsThis rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breachednanda if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principles that will be her full ordinationAfter learning these eight important principles from the Buddha nanda went to Mahāpajāpati and saidIf you accept eight important principles Gotami that will be your full ordinationAnd he told her the rulesShe replied Just as a young woman or mansomeone fond of adornments who had just washed her hairwould receive a garland of lotuses a garland of sandan flowers or a garland of jasmine with both hands and place it on her headso too do I receive these eight important principles not to be breached for lifenanda then went to the Buddha bowed sat downSir Mahāpajāpati has accepted the eight important principles Your aunt has been ordainednanda if women had not been allowed to go forth on this spiritual path made known by the Buddha the spiritual life would have lasted a long timethe true Teaching would have lasted a thousand yearsBut since women have been allowed to go forth the spiritual life wont last longnow the true Teaching will only last five hundred yearsJust as families with many women and few men are easily robbed by thievesso too the spiritual life doesnt last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forthJust as a ripe ricefield affected by whiteheads wont last longso too the spiritual life doesnt last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forthJust as a ripe field of sugarcane attacked by red rot wont last longso too the spiritual life doesnt last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forthJust as a man might as a safeguard surround a large pool with an embankment so that the water wont overflowso too have I as a safeguard laid down the eight important principles not to be breached for lifeThe eight important principles for nuns are finishedThe allowance for the full ordination of nunsMahāpajāpati went to the Buddha bowed downVenerable Sir what should I do with these Sakyan womenThe Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teachingafter which she bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a Teaching and addressed the monksI allow you to give the full ordination to nunsSoon afterwards those nuns said to MahāpajāpatiWere ordained but youre notfor the Buddha has laid down that the monks should give the full ordination to nunsMahāpajāpati then went to Venerable nanda bowed downand told himwhat the Sakyan women had saidnanda went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told himwhat Mahāpajāpati had saidThe Buddha replied Mahāpajāpati was ordained from the time she accepted the eight important principlesOn another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to Venerable nanda bowed downVenerable nanda I wish to ask the Buddha for a favorIt would be good if the Buddha allowed the monks and nuns to bow down to one another according to seniority and likewise to rise up for one another raise their joined palms to one another and do acts of respect toward one another according to seniorityVenerable nanda went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told the Buddhawhat Mahāpajāpati had saidThe Buddha replied It is impossible nanda that I would allow bowing down to a woman and likewise rising up for raising ones joined palms to and doing acts of respect toward a womanEven the ascetics of other religions with their flawed teachings dont bow down to women or rise up for them raise their joined palms to them or do acts of respect toward themSo how then could I allow these thingsThe Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not bow down to a woman or rise up for raise your joined palms to or do acts of respect toward a womanIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductOn another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha bowed downVenerable Sir how should we practice those training rules that the nuns have in common with the monksYou should practice them in the same way as the monks doAnd how should we practice those training rules that the nuns dont have in common with the monksYou should practice them as they have been laid downOn another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha bowed downIt would be good Venerable Sir if you would give me a teaching in brief I could then stay by myself secluded heedful energetic and diligentThose things Gotami that you knowlead to passion not to dispassion to bondage not to freedom from bondage to an increase in things not to a reduction in things to great desires not to fewness of wishes to discontent not to contentment to socializing not to seclusion to laziness not to being energetic to

Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on skinsThe account of Soṇa KoḷivisaAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture PeakAt that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ruled over eighty thousand villagesAnd at Campā there was a prominent merchant who had a son called Soṇa Koḷivisa He had been raised in great comfortand even had hairs growing on the soles of his feetOn one occasion because of some business King Bimbisāra had the chiefs of those eighty thousand villages gathered He then sent a message to Soṇaasking him to comeSoṇas parents saidSoṇa the king wishes to see your feetbut dont point your feet at the KingIf you just sit down crosslegged in front of the Kinghell be able to see themAnd they sent him away on a palanquinSoṇa then approached King Bimbisāra bowed and sat down crosslegged in front of himAnd the King saw the hairs growing on the soles of his feetThen after instructing those eighty thousand chiefs in worldly matters the King dismissed them sayingIve instructed you in worldly mattersNow go and visit the BuddhaHe will instruct us about the afterlifeThose eighty thousand chiefs then went to the Vulture PeakThere they approached Venerable Sāgata who at that time was the Buddhas attendantAnd they said to himVenerable these eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit the BuddhaMay we please see himWell then please wait here for a moment while I announce you to the BuddhaThen while those eighty thousand chiefs were watching he sunk into the stone slab he was standing on and emerged in front of the Buddha And he said to the BuddhaVenerable Sir eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit youPlease do whatever is convenientWell then Sāgata please prepare a seat in the shade of the dwellingHe took a stool sunk down in front of the Buddha and as those eighty thousand chiefs were watching he once more emerged from that stone slab He then prepared a seat in the shade of the dwellingand the Buddha came out and sat downThose eighty thousand chiefs approached the Buddha bowed and sat downBut they were preoccupied with Sāgata not with the BuddhaAfter reading the minds of those eighty thousand chiefs the Buddha said to SāgataWell then Sāgata show us more superhuman abilities more wonders of supernormal powerSaying Yes Sir he rose up into the air walked back and forth in space and he stood sat down and lay down there He emitted smoke and fire and then disappearedAfter this display of supernormal powers he bowed down at the feet of the Buddha and saidVenerable Sir youre my teacherIm your discipleThose eighty thousand chiefs thought Its astonishing and amazingthat even a disciple should be so powerful and mighty Imagine what the teacher must be like And now they paid attention to the Buddha not to SāgataHaving read their minds the Buddha gave those eighty thousand chiefs a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciationWhen the Buddha knew that their minds were ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhassuffering its origin its end and the pathAnd just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properlyso too while they were sitting right there those eighty thousand chiefs experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endThey had seen the Truth had reached understood and penetrated it they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty had attained to confidence and had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction They then said to the BuddhaWonderful Venerable Sir wonderfulJust as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what was hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darkness so thatthose with eyes might see whats therejust so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many waysWe go for refuge to the Buddhato the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeThe going forth of Soṇa KoḷivisaBut Soṇa thoughtThe way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shellWhy dont I cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessnessWhen those eightyfour thousand chiefs had rejoiced and expressed their appreciation for the Buddhas teaching they got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him and leftSoon after they had left Soṇa approached the Buddha bowed sat downSir the way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shellI want to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessnessPlease give me the going forthAnd Soṇa received the going forth and the full ordination in the Buddhas presenceSoon after his ordination while staying in Cool GroveVenerable Soṇa walked up and down with so much energy that his feet crackedHis walkingpath was soaked in blood as if a slaughterhouseThen while he was in seclusion he thoughtIm one of the Buddhas energetic disciplesyet my mind isnt freed from the corruptions without graspingBut my family is wealthyPerhaps I should return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make meritJust then the Buddha read Soṇas mindAnd as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and appeared in Cool GroveSoon afterwards as the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings they came to Soṇas walkingpathThe Buddha looked at it and asked the monksWhose walkingpath is this Its soaked in blood as if a slaughterhouseAnd they told him what had happenedThe Buddha then approached Soṇas dwelling and sat down on a prepared seatSoṇa bowed and sat downand the Buddha said to himSoṇa when you were in seclusion didnt you thinkIm one of the Buddhas energetic disciplesyet my mind isnt freed from the corruptions without graspingBut my family is wealthyPerhaps I should return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make meritYes SirThink about it Soṇa When you were previously a householder werent you a skilled lute playerWhen the strings were too tight was the lute melodious and easy to playWhen the strings were too loose was the lute melodious and easy to playBut when the strings were neither too tight nor too loose but set to a balanced tension was the lute then melodious and easy to playJust so Soṇa too much energy leads to restlessness and too little to lazinessSo exert a balanced energy and discover an evenness of the spiritual faculties And that is where you should take up the meditation objectYes SirThen as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Soṇa in Cool Grove and appeared on the Vulture PeakAfter some time Soṇa exerted a balanced energy discovered an evenness of the spiritual faculties and that is where he took up his meditation objectHe then stayed by himself secluded heedful energetic and diligent And in this very life he soon realized with his own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessnessHe understood that birth had come to an end that the spiritual life had been lived that the job had been done that there was no further state of existenceAnd Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected onesAfter attaining perfection Soṇa thoughtLet me declare perfect insight in the presence of the BuddhaHe then went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir a monk who is a perfected onewho has ended the corruptions lived the spiritual life done the job put down the burden realized the true goal cut the bond to existence gained release by right insighthe is committed to six thingsto renunciation seclusion harmlessness the end of grasping the end of craving and nonconfusionSome venerable here might thinkNo doubt this venerable is committed to renunciation because of confidence But this is the wrong way to look at itThe monk who has ended the corruptions who has lived the spiritual life and done the job doesnt see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desire He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill will He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusionSome venerable here might thinkNo doubt this venerable is committed to seclusion because he desires gain honor and fameBut this is the wrong way to look at itThe monk who has ended the corruptions who has lived the spiritual life and done the job doesnt see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desire He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill will He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusionSome venerable here might thinkNo doubt this venerable is committed to nonharming because he has fallen back on adhering to conduct and vows as the essence of the spiritual lifeBut this is the wrong way to look at itThe monk who has ended the corruptions who has lived the spiritual life and done the job doesnt see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desire He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill will He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusionHe is committed to the end of grasping to the end of craving and to nonconfusion because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desireHe is committed to the end of grasping to the end of craving and to nonconfusion because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill willHe is committed to the end of grasping to the end of craving and to nonconfusion because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusionSir for a monk who is fully freed in this way even if he sees compelling visual objects his mind is not overpowered by themIt remains unaffected steady and imperturbable and he observes its disappearanceEven if he hears compelling soundssmells compelling odorstastes compelling flavorstouches compelling material objectsor experiences compelling mental phenomena his mind is not overpowered by themIt remains unaffected steady and imperturbable and he observes its disappearanceIts just like a granite mountain a single solid mass without cracks It doesnt shake or tremble when powerful rainstorms arrive from any directionThe mind of the monk who is fully freed in this way is just like thatFor the one committed to renunciationAnd to seclusion of the mindFor the one committed to harmlessnessAnd to the end of graspingFor the one committed to the end of cravingAnd to nonconfusion of the mindHaving seen the arising of the sensesTheir mind is fully freedFor the one who is fully freedThe monastic with a peaceful mindThere is nothing more to addAnd nothing that needs to be doneJust as a single solid rockIs unshaken by the windSo too all visual objects and soundsSmells tastes and material objectsAnd mental objects good and badCannot move that kind of personTheir mind is free and steadyAnd they observe it as it disappearsThe prohibition against sandals

Kuṭikaṇṇa was his supporterOn one occasion Soṇa approached Mahākaccāna bowed sat downVenerable the way I understand your teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shellI wish to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessnessPlease give me the going forthIts difficult Soṇa to live the spiritual life all ones life eating one meal a day and sleeping by oneselfSo follow the instruction of the Buddhas while remaining as a householder and at suitable times you may eat one meal a day sleep by yourself and practice celibacyAs a result Soṇas intention to go forth died downA second time Soṇa asked Mahākaccāna for the going forth but got the same responseA third time he asked for the going forthand Mahākaccāna finally relentedAt that time in the southern region of Avantī there were few monksOnly after three years with much trouble and difficulty was Mahākaccāna able to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give the full ordination to Venerable SoṇaThe making known of the five favors for MahākaccānaWhile he was in seclusion after completing the rainyseason residence Soṇa thoughtIve heard that the Buddha is like this and like that but I havent seen this for myself If my preceptor allows me I shall go and visit the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened OneWhen he had come out from seclusion Soṇa approached Mahākaccāna bowed sat downand told himwhat he had been thinkingMahākaccāna said Well considered SoṇaPlease go and visit the Buddha

in his sense faculties a great beingThen Soṇa in my name pay respect with your head at the Buddhas feet and say Venerable Sir my preceptor Venerable Mahākaccāna pays respect with his head at the Buddhas feetAnd then say thisIn the southern region of Avantī Sir there are few monks Only after three years with much trouble and difficulty was it possible to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give me the full ordinationPerhaps the Buddha will allow a smaller group of monks to give the full ordination in AvantīIn Avantī the ground is dark and hard made rough by the hooves of cattlePerhaps the Buddha will allow sandals with multilayered soles in AvantīIn Avantī people value bathing and cleanlinessPerhaps the Buddha will allow unrestricted bathing in AvantīIn Avantī sheepskins goatskins and deerskins are used as rugsjust as are eragugrass chaffflower grass majjārugrass and jantugrass in the central Ganges plainPerhaps the Buddha will allow sheepskins goatskins

toldSuchandsuch people have given you a robe But being afraid of wrongdoing they dont accept thinkingWe might commit an offense entailing relinquishmentPerhaps the Buddha will point out a way to deal with robesSoṇa replied Yes SirHe got up from his seat bowed down and circumambulated Mahākāccāna with his right side toward him He then put his dwelling in order took his bowl and robe and set out for SāvatthīWhen he eventually arrived he went to the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery where he approach the Buddha bowed and sat downThe Buddha said to Venerable nandananda please prepare a resting place for this newly arrived monknanda thoughtWhen the Buddha says this it means he wishes to stay in the same dwelling as Venerable SoṇaAnd he prepared a resting place for Soṇa in the Buddhas dwellingThen after spending much of the night outside the Buddha entered the dwellingas did SoṇaRising early in the morning the Buddha said to SoṇaRecite a teaching monkSaying Yes Sir he chanted the entire Chapter of EightsWhen he was finished the Buddha saidWell done Soṇa well doneYou have learned the Chapter Eights well you have remembered it wellAnd you have a good voiceits clear articulate and gets the meaning acrossHow long have you been a monkOne yearWhy did it take you so long to go forthI have long seen the danger in worldly pleasures Still because household life is crowded and very busy I was not able to leaveSeeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utteranceHaving seen the danger in the worldKnowing the Truth beyond ownershipThe noble one doesnt delight in whats badIn the bad the pure one doesnt delightSoṇa thoughtThe Buddha approves of me This is the time to bring up what my preceptor saidHe got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder bowed down at the Buddhas feet and saidSir my preceptor Venerable Mahākaccāna pays respect with his head at the Buddhas feet He then repeated everything Mahākaccāna had asked him to saySoon

processes for the clearing of offenses entailing suspension is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on legal proceduresThe legal procedure of condemnationHomage to the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened OneAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka were quarrelsome argumentative and creators of legal issues in the Sangha They approached other monks who were also quarrelsome argumentative and creators of legal issues in the Sangha and said to themDont let him beat youArgue back forcefullyYoure wiser more competent more learned and more capable than heDont be afraid of himWell take your sideBecause of that new quarrels started and existing quarrels became worseThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka act like thisThey told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true that the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are acting like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized themIts not suitable for those foolish men its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can they act like thisso that new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worseThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsThe Buddha then spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain in dispraise of great desires discontent socializing and laziness but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain of fewness of wishes contentment selfelimination ascetic practices serenity reduction in things and of being energetic After giving a teaching on what is right and proper he addressed the monksWell then monks the Sangha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and LohitakaAnd this is how it should be doneFirst you should accuse the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka They should then be reminded of what they have done before they are charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThese monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome argumentative

will remember it thusThe second section on the legal procedure of demotion is finishedThe legal procedure of banishmentAt one time Assaji and Punabbasuka were the resident monks at Kīṭāgiri They were bad and shamelessThey were misbehaving in this wayThey planted flowering trees watered and plucked them and then tied the flowers together They made the flowers into garlands garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides They made flower arrangements wreaths ornaments for the head ornaments for the ears and ornaments for the chest And they had others do the sameThey then took these things or sent them to the women the daughters the girls the daughtersinlaw and the female slaves of good familiesThey ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels They sat on the same seats as them and they lay down on the same beds on the same sheets under the same covers both on the same sheets and under the same covers They ate at the wrong time drank alcohol and wore garlands perfumes and cosmetics They danced sang played instruments and performedWhile the women were dancing singing playing instruments and performing so would theyThey played various games board games with eight and ten rows imaginary board games hopscotch spillikins dice games tipcat paintingwiththehand games ball games toypipe games toyplow games turning somersaults toywindmill games toymeasure games toycarriage games toybow games letterguessing games thoughtguessing games games of mimicking deformitiesThey trained in elephant riding in horsemanship in carriage riding in archery in swordsmanshipAnd they ran in front of elephants in front of horses and in front of carriages and they ran backwards and forwardsThey whistled clapped their hands wrestled and boxedThey spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girlsDance here Sisterand they made gestures of approvalAnd they misbehaved in a variety of waysJust then a certain monk who had completed the rains residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at KīṭāgiriIn the morning he robed up took his bowl and robe and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfood He was pleasing in the way he entered and returned in looking at and in looking away in bending and stretching out his arms his eyes were lowered and he was perfect in deportmentWhen people saw him they saidWho is this acting like a fool like a dullard continuously frowningWho will give almsfood to himAlmsfood should instead be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka for they are gentle congenial pleasant to speak with greeting one with a smile welcoming friendly open the first to speakA certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in KīṭāgiriHe approached him bowed and saidVenerable have you received any almsfoodNo I haventCome lets go to my houseHe took that monk to his house and gave him a mealWhere are you going VenerableIm going to Sāvatthī to visit the BuddhaWell then would you please pay respect at the feet of the Buddha in my name and sayVenerable Sir the monastery in Kīṭāgiri has been corruptedThe bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are staying thereThey are misbehaving like thisThey plant flowering trees water them And they misbehave in a variety of waysThose people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost itand there is no longer any support for the SanghaThe good monks have left and the bad monks are staying onPlease send monks to stay at the monastery in KīṭāgiriThe monk consented got up and left for SāvatthīWhen he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī he went to the Buddha in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery He bowed to the Buddha and sat downSince it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monksthe Buddha said to himI hope you are keeping well monk I hope youre comfortableI hope youre not tired from travelingAnd where have you come fromIm keeping well Venerable Sir Im comfortableIm not tired from travelingHe then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiriand finished by saying Thats where Ive come fromSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are misbehaving like this at KīṭāgiriAnd is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost itthat there is no longer any support for the Sanghaand that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying onIts true SirThe Buddha criticized themIts not suitable How can those foolish men misbehave like thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it  after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable MoggallānaSāriputta the two of you should go and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from Kīṭāgiri They are your studentsSir how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from Kīṭāgiri They are temperamental and harshWell then take many monksAnd this is how it should be doneFirst you should accuse the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka They should then be reminded of what they have done before they are charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThese monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behavedTheir bad behavior is seen and heard aboutand the families corrupted by them are seen and heard aboutIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should do

of the building work and received a regular supply of foodWhen Citta wanted to invite the Sangha a group of monks or an individual monk he would not do so without getting permission from SudhammaOn

Revata Venerable Upāli Venerable nanda Venerable Rāhulawere wandering in Kāsī when they arrived at MacchikāsaṇḍaWhen Citta heard that they had arrivedhe went to them bowed and sat downAfter Sāriputta had instructed inspired and gladdened Citta with a teachingCitta saidVenerables please accept a meal for new arrivals from me tomorrowAnd they accepted by remaining silentWhen he knew that they had accepted Citta got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated them with his right side toward them and went to Sudhamma He bowed to himVenerable please accept tomorrows meal from me together with the senior monksSudhamma thoughtPreviously when Citta wanted to invite the Sangha a group of monks or an individual monk he would not do so without getting permission from meBut now he has invited the senior monks without my permissionHes been corrupted this Citta Hes uninterested and has no affection for me He said to Cittatheres no need I wont acceptCitta asked him a secondand a third timebut got the same replyHe thoughtWhat difference does it make to me whether Sudhamma accepts or not He then bowed down circumambulated Sudhamma with his right side toward him and leftThe following morning Citta prepared various kinds of fine food for the senior monksSudhamma thoughtLet me go and see what Citta has prepared for the senior monks He then robed up took his bowl and robe and went to Cittas house where he sat down on a prepared seatCitta approached Sudhamma bowed and sat downAnd Sudhamma said to himYou have prepared many kinds of fine foodBut theres one thats missing sesame cookiesWhen there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha Sir you speak of sesame cookiesFormerly there were some traders from the south who went to an eastern country to tradeFrom there they brought back a henThat hen mated with a crowand because of that she had a chickWhen that chick wanted to caw like a crow it cried cawcadoodledooAnd when that chick wanted to crow like a rooster it cried cockadoodlecawIn the same way when there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha you speak of sesame cookiesHouseholder youre abusing and insulting meI will leave your monasteryIm not abusing and insulting youPlease stay at MacchikāsaṇḍaThe mango grove is delightfulIll do my best to supply you with robes almsfood a dwelling and medicinesSudhamma repeated what he had said a second time and Citta responded as beforeWhen Sudhamma repeated it a third timeCitta said Where will you goIll go to Sāvatthī to visit the BuddhaWell then please tell the Buddha of our entire conversationAnd I would not be surprised if you returned to MacchikāsaṇḍaSudhamma put his dwelling in order took his bowl and robe and left for SāvatthīWhen he eventually arrived he went to the Buddha in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery He bowed to the Buddha sat downand told him about the conversation he had had with CittaThe Buddha rebuked himIts not suitable foolish man its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not

for not making amends for an offense is finishedThe legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad viewAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time the monk Ariṭṭha the exvulturekiller had the following bad and erroneous viewAs I understand the Teaching of the Buddha the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in themA number of monks heard that Ariṭṭha had that viewThey went to himand askedIs it true Ariṭṭha that you have such a viewYes indeed As I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in themNo Ariṭṭhadont misrepresent the Buddhafor its not good to misrepresent himThe Buddha would never say such a thingThe Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructiveand how they obstruct one who indulges in themThe Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greaterThe Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeletonsimilar to a piece of meatsimilar to a grass torchsimilar to a pit of coalssimilar to a dreamsimilar to borrowed goodssimilar to fruits on a treesimilar to a knife and chopping blocksimilar to swords and stakesand similar to a snakes head they are much suffering and much trouble and the danger in them is greaterBut even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha in this way he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view and continued to insist on itAnd since they were not able to make him give up that view they approached the Buddha and told him what had happenedSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned AriṭṭhaIs it true Ariṭṭha that you have a bad and erroneous view such as thisAs I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in themYes indeed SirFoolish man whom do you think I have taught like thisHavent I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructiveand how they obstruct one who indulges in themI have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greaterI have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton similar to a piece of meat similar to a grass torch similar to a pit of coals similar to a dream similar to borrowed goods similar to fruits on a tree similar to a knife and chopping block similar to swords and stakes similar to a snakes head they are much suffering and much trouble and the danger in them is greaterAnd yet by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me hurt yourself and made much demeritThis will be for your longlasting harm and sufferingThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it  and after rebuking him he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad viewprohibiting him from living with the SanghaAnd this is how it should be doneFirst you should accuse the monk Ariṭṭha He should then be reminded of what
