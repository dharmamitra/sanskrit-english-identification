Illegitimate agreements
At one time the Sangha at Sāvatthī had made an agreement
that they would not give the going forth during the rains residence
On one occasion one of Visākhās grandsons went to the monks and asked for the going forth
The monks told him
about their agreement
adding Wait while the monks are observing the rains residence
Once weve completed the rains residence well give you the going forth
When they had completed the rains residence the monks told Visākhās grandson
that they would give him the going forth
He replied
If I had been given the going forth Venerables I would have enjoyed it
But now I wont not go forth
Visākhā complained and criticized those monks
How can the venerables make an agreement
that they wont give the going forth during the rains residence
Is there a time when the Teaching should not be practiced

and they told the Buddha He said
You should not make an agreement

Offense of wrong conduct for assenting
On one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had assented to spend the first rains residence at the invitation of King Pasenadi of Kosala
As he was walking to the monastery provided by the King he saw two monasteries with much robecloth
He thought
Perhaps I should spend the rains residence in these two monasteries
In that way Ill get much robecloth
And he spent the rains residence in those two monasteries
King Pasenadi complained and criticized him
How could Upananda agree to spend the rains residence in my monastery but then break his word
Hasnt the Buddha in many ways criticized lying and praised the abstention from lying
The monks heard the Kings complaints
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Upananda act like this
And they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda
Is it true that you acted like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you agree to spend the rains residence at the invitation of King Pasenadi but then break your word
Havent I criticized lying in many ways and praised the abstention from lying
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
and after rebuking him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
It may happen that a monk assents to spend the first rains residence in a particular monastery

Perhaps I should spend the rains residence in these two monasteries

The third chapter on entering the rainyseason residence is finished
In this chapter there are fiftytwo topics
The chapter on entering the rainyseason residence is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the observance day
The instruction to gather together
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak
At that time on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth the wanderers of other religions gathered and gave teachings
People went to listen to those teachings
and they acquired affection for and confidence in those wanderers And the wanderers gained a following
While King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was alone he reflected on this
and he thought Why dont the venerables too gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth
He then went to the Buddha bowed sat down
and told him what he had thought
adding It would be good Venerable Sir if the venerables too gathered on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth
The Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teaching
When the Buddha was finished the King got up from his seat bowed circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth
When the monks knew
what the Buddha had said
they started gathering on those days
People came to hear a teaching but the monks sat in silence
The people complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth but then sit in silence like dumb pigs
Shouldnt they give a teaching when they gather together
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
When you gather on the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth day of the lunar halfmonth you should give a teaching
The instruction to recite the Monastic Code
While the Buddha was in seclusion he thought
Let me instruct the monks to recite a monastic code consisting of those training rules that I have laid down for them
That will be their procedure for the observance day
In the evening when the Buddha had come out from seclusion he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
telling them what he had thought and adding
You should recite the Monastic Code
And it should be done like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should do the observanceday procedure it should recite the Monastic Code
What is the preliminary duty of the Sangha
The venerables should declare their purity
and I will recite the Monastic Code
Everyone present should listen and attend carefully
Anyone who has committed an offense should reveal it
If you havent committed any offense you should remain silent
If you are silent I will regard you as pure
Just as one who is asked individually responds so too the announcement is made up to three times in this kind of gathering
If a monk remembers an offense but doesnt reveal it when an announcement is made up to the third time he is lying in full awareness
Lying in full awareness is called an obstacle by the Buddha
A monk who remembers an offense and is seeking purification should therefore reveal it
When its revealed he will be at ease
Monastic code
this is at the beginning this is at the front this is at the head in wholesome qualitiestherefore it is called Monastic Code
Venerables
this is term of affection a term of respect this is an expression of respect and deference that is Venerables
I will recite
I will make known I will teach I will declare I will set forth I will reveal I will analyze I will make plain I will manifest
Everyone present
to whatever extent there are senior monks junior monks and monks of middle standing in that gatheringthese are called everyone present
Should listen carefully
should be attentive should pay attention should apply their whole mind
Should attend
should listen with a onepointed mind with an undistracted mind with a nonwandering mind
Anyone who has committed an offense
a senior monk a monk of middle standing or a junior monk who has committed a particular offense among the five classes of offenses or a particular offense among the seven classes of offenses
Should reveal it
should confess it should disclose it should make it plain should make it knowneither in the midst of the Sangha in the midst of a group or to an individual
If you havent committed any offense
if you have not committed any offense or you have cleared yourself after committing one
You should remain silent
you should be patient you should not say anything
I will regard you as pure
I will know I will remember
Just as one who is asked individually responds
just as one who is asked by an individual would respond so too one should know of that gathering that Its asking me
This kind of gathering
an gathering of monks is what is meant
When the announcement is made up to three times
when the announcement is made once when the announcement is made for the second time and also when the announcement is made for the third time
who knows who perceives
An offense
one that has been committed or one that has not been cleared after being committed
But doesnt reveal it
does not confess it does not disclose it does not make it plain does not make it knowneither in the midst of the Sangha in the midst of a group or to an individual
Hes lying in full awareness
what is there for lying in full awareness
There is an act of wrong conduct
Is called an obstacle by the Buddha
an obstacle for what
It is an obstacle for reaching the first absorption the second absorption the third absorption the fourth absorption an obstacle for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption release stillness attainment renunciation escape seclusion
Who remembers
who knows who perceives
Is seeking purification
Is seeking to be cleared is seeking purity
An offense
one that has been committed or one that has not been cleared after being committed
Should reveal it
should reveal it either in the midst of the Sangha in the midst of a group or to an individual
When its revealed he will be at ease
at ease for what
He will be at ease for reaching the first absorption the second absorption the third absorption the forth absorption at ease for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption release stillness attainment renunciation escape seclusion
When they knew
that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code
some monks recited it daily
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not recite the Monastic Code every day
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
You should recite the Monastic Code on the observance day
When they knew
that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code on the observance day
some monks recited it three times per halfmonth on the fourteenth on the fifteenth and on the eighth day
You should not recite the Monastic Code three times per halfmonth
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
You should recite the Monastic Code once every halfmonth on the fourteenth day or on the fifteenth day
On one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code separately each to his own followers
You should not recite the Monastic Code separately each to your own followers
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
You should do the observanceday procedure in a complete assembly
When they knew
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the observanceday procedure should be done in a complete assembly
the monks thought How far does a complete assembly extend As far as one monastery or as far as the entire earth
A complete assembly extends as far as one monastery
Mahākappina
At that time Venerable Mahākappina was staying at Rājagaha in the deer park at Maddakucchi
On one occasion while he was in seclusion he thought
Should I or shouldnt I go to the observanceday procedure Should I or should I not go to the legal procedures of the Sangha Regardless Ive reached the highest purity
The Buddha read his mind
Then just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and reappeared in front of Mahākappina
where he sat down on a prepared seat
Mahākappina bowed and sat down
and the Buddha said to him
Isnt it the case Kappina
that you were wondering whether or not you should go to the observanceday procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha
Yes Venerable Sir
If you brahmins dont honor and revere the observance day then who will
Go to the observanceday procedure brahmin
and go to the legal procedures of the Sangha
The Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teaching
Then just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Mahākappina and reappeared on the Vulture Peak
The allowance for monastic boundaries
When they knew
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that a complete assembly extends as far as one monastery the monks thought How far does a single monastery extend
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you to establish a monastic boundary
And it should be established like this
First the boundary markers should be announced
a hill a rock a forest grove a tree a path an anthill a river a lake
Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha then based on the boundary markers that have been announced
the Sangha should establish a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Based on the boundary markers that have been announced
the Sangha establishes a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together
Any monk who approves of establishing based on these boundary markers a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has established based on these boundary markers a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
When they knew
that the Buddha had given the allowance to establish a boundary
the monks from the group of six established boundaries that were too extensive   and even  kilometers
Monks going to the observanceday procedure arrived while the Monastic Code was being recited or just after it had been recited and they had to stay overnight on the way
You should not establish a boundary that is too extensive either   or  kilometers
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
You should establish a boundary that is  kilometers at the most
At one time the monks from the group of six had established a boundary that crossed a river
Monks who were coming to the observanceday procedure were swept away by the current as were their bowls and robes
You should not establish a boundary that crosses a river
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow you to establish a boundary that crosses a river only if there is a permanent bridge or a ferry connection
Discussion of the observanceday hall
At that time the monks recited the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointment
Newly arrived monks did not know
where the observanceday procedure was to be held
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not recite the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointment
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow you to designate an observance day hallwhether a dwelling a stilt house or a cavefor the observanceday procedure
And it should be designated like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should designate suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hall
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha designates suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hall
Any monk who approves of designating suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hall should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has designated suchandsuch a dwelling as the observanceday hall
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
Soon afterwards in a certain monastery they designated two different observanceday halls
Monks gathered in both places
each group thinking The observanceday procedure will be done here
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not designate two different observanceday halls within the same monastery
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
You should abolish one of them and do the observanceday procedure in one place
And it should be abolished like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should abolish suchandsuch an observanceday hall
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha abolishes suchandsuch an observanceday hall
Any monk who approves of abolishing suchandsuch an observanceday hall should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has abolished suchandsuch an observanceday hall
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
The allowance for an observanceday forecourt
At one time in a certain monastery they had designated an observanceday hall that was too small On the observance day a large sangha of monks gathered there
Some monks listened to the recitation of the Monastic Code while sitting on the ground outside the designated area
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the observanceday procedure should be done after designating an observanceday hall and they wondered Have we done the observanceday procedure or have we not
They told the Buddha and he said
Whether you listen to the recitation of the Monastic Code while seated within or outside the ground that has been designated in either case you have done the observanceday procedure
Nevertheless the Sangha may designate an observanceday forecourt that is as large as you like
And it should be designated like this
First the boundary markers should be announced
Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha
then based on the boundary markers that have been announced the Sangha should designate an observanceday forecourt
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Based on the boundary markers that have been announced
the Sangha designates an observanceday forecourt
Any monk who approves of designating based on these boundary markers an observanceday forecourt should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has designated based on these boundary markers an observanceday forecourt
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
At that time on the observance day in a certain monastery the junior monks had gathered first They thought
Theres no need to be here until the senior monks arrive
and they left
As a consequence the observanceday procedure was done at the wrong time
On the observance day the senior monks should arrive first
At that time at Rājagaha there were a number of monasteries within the same monastic boundary
The monks argued
about in which monastery the observanceday procedure should be done
When there are a number of monasteries within the same boundary
and the monks are arguing
about where the observanceday procedure should be done
those monks should all gather in one place and do the observanceday procedure there
Or they should gather wherever the most senior monk is staying
You should not do the observanceday procedure with an incomplete Sangha
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The allowance for a maystayapart boundary
On one occasion Venerable Mahākassapa was coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the observanceday procedure As he was crossing a river on the way he briefly got carried away by the current and his robes got wet
The monks asked him
why his robes were wet
and he told them what had happened
They told the Buddha and he said
When the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
And it should be designated like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together The Sangha designates that same boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
Any monk who approves of designating this boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has designated this boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
When they knew that the Buddha had allowed the designation of a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area monks stored their robes in inhabited areas
The robes were lost burnt or eaten by rats
As a consequence their robes became shabby
Other monks asked them
why they were so poorly dressed
and they told them what had happened
They then told the Buddha and he said
When the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas
And it should be designated like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas

The Sangha has designated this boundary as delimiting a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
The abolishing of boundaries
Monks when youre establishing a boundary the boundary that defines who belongs to the same community should be established first Afterwards you may designate the maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
And when youre abolishing a boundary the maystayapartfromthethreerobes area should be abolished first Afterwards you may abolish the boundary that defines who belongs to the same community
And the maystayapartfromthethreerobes area should be abolished like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should abolish the existing designation of a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha abolishes the existing designation of a maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
Any monk who approves of abolishing this area should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has abolished the maystayapartfromthethreerobes area
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
And a boundary should be abolished like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should abolish the established monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen

Any monk who approves of abolishing this boundary should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has abolished the monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
Boundaries for inhabited areas etc
There are monks who live supported by inhabited areas where no boundary has been established In these cases the boundary of the inhabited area defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together
If it is an uninhabited area in the wilderness a distance of  meters on all sides defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together
or a lake cannot form a complete boundary on its own
In a river in the ocean and in a lake the area that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observanceday procedure together is the distance an average man can splash water in all directions
At one time the monks from the group of six created a boundary that crossed an existing boundary
The establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure that is irreversible and fit to stand
The establishment of the subsequent boundary is an illegitimate legal procedure that is reversible and unfit to stand
You should not create boundaries that cross existing boundaries
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At one time the monks from the group of six enclosed one boundary within another
The establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure that is irreversible and fit to stand
The establishment of the subsequent boundary is an illegitimate legal procedure that is reversible and unfit to stand
You should not create boundaries that enclose existing boundaries
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
When you establish a boundary you should leave a gap to any existing boundary
Breach of the observanceday procedure etc
The monks thought
How many observance days are there
They told the Buddha and he said
There are two observance days the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month
The monks thought
How many observanceday procedures are there
There are these four observanceday procedures
The observanceday procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assembly
The observanceday procedure that is illegitimate but has a complete assembly
The observanceday procedure that is legitimate but has an incomplete assembly
The observanceday procedure that is legitimate and has a complete assembly
The first
and third of these should not be done
I havent allowed such procedures
The fourth should be done I have allowed such procedures
Therefore monks you should train like this
We will do observanceday ceremonies that are legitimate and have a complete assembly
The recitation of the Monastic Code in brief etc
The monks thought
How many ways of reciting the Monastic Code are there
They told the Buddha and he said
There are these five ways of reciting the Monastic Code
After reciting the introduction the rest is announced as if heard
This is the first way of reciting the Monastic Code
After reciting the introduction and the four rules entailing expulsion the rest is announced as if heard
This is the second way of reciting the Monastic Code
After reciting the introduction the four rules entailing expulsion and the thirteen rules entailing suspension the rest is announced as if heard
This is the third way of reciting the Monastic Code
After reciting the introduction the four rules entailing expulsion the thirteen rules entailing suspension and the two undetermined rules the rest is announced as if heard
This is the fourth way of reciting the Monastic Code
In full is the fifth
When they knew
that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code in brief
some monks recited it in brief all the time
You should not recite the Monastic Code in brief
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At that time on the observance day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country there was danger from savages
The monks were not able to recite the Monastic Code in full
I allow you to recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are dangers
But the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code in brief even when there were no dangers
You should not recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are no dangers
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow you to recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are any of these dangers
danger from kings danger from bandits danger from fire danger from floods danger from people danger from spirits danger from predatory animals danger from snakes a lifethreatening danger a danger to living the spiritual life
On one occasion the monks from the group of six gave teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested
You should not give teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow the most senior monk either to give a teaching himself or to request another
Discussion of questioning on the Monastic Law
On one occasion the monks from the group of six questioned others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved
You should not question others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow you to question others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved
And you should be approved like this
either you should be approved through yourself or you should be approved through another
And how are you approved through yourself
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha I will question soandso on the Monastic Law
In this way you are approved through yourself
And how are you approved through another
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha soandso will question soandso on the Monastic Law
In this way you are approved through another
Soon good monks asked questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter and they made threats of violence
The monk who has been approved should first survey the gathering and evaluate the individuals and then ask questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha
Discussion of replying to questions on the Monastic Law
On one occasion the monks from the group of six replied to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved
You should not reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow you to reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved
And one should be approved like this
either you should be approved through yourself or you should be approved through another
And how are you approved through yourself
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha I will reply when asked by soandso on the Monastic Law
In this way you are approved through yourself
And how are you approved through another
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha soandso will reply when asked by soandso on the Monastic Law
In this way you are approved through another
Soon good monks replied to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter and they made threats of violence
The monk who has been approved should first survey the gathering and evaluate the individuals and then reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha
Discussion of accusing
At one time the monks from the group of six accused a monk of an offense without first getting his permission to do so
You should not accuse a monk of an offense without first getting his permission to do so
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
You should only accuse someone of an offense after getting their permission
Venerable I wish to speak to you please give me permission
Soon after getting their permission good monks accused the monks from the group of six of an offense
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter and they made threats of violence
Even when you have their permission you should first evaluate the individual and then accuse them of an offense
At this time the monks from the group of sixthinking to act before the good monks asked them for permission but having no grounds or reasonsgot permission from pure monks who had not committed any offenses
When you have no grounds or reasons you should not get permission from pure monks who havent committed any offenses
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
And you should give permission only after evaluating the individual
Objecting to an illegitimate legal procedure etc
On one occasion the monks from the group of six did an illegitimate legal procedure in the midst of the Sangha
You should not do illegitimate legal procedures
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
They still did illegitimate procedures
You should object when an illegitimate legal procedure is being done
Soon afterwards good monks objected when the monks from the group of six did an illegitimate procedure
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter and they made threats of violence
I allow you to just state your view
They did so
Once again the monks from the group of six became angry and bitter and they made threats of violence
A group of four or five should object a group of two or three may state their view and a single person may make a silent determination
I dont approve of this
On one occasion when the monks from the group of six were reciting the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha they deliberately made themselves inaudible
When reciting the Monastic Code you should not deliberately make yourselves inaudible
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At one time Venerable Udāyī was the Sanghas reciter of the Monastic Code but he had a hoarse voice
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the reciter of the Monastic Code should make themselves heard and he thought I have a hoarse voice so what should I do
The reciter of the Monastic Code should make an effort
to be heard
If you make an effort theres no offense
On one occasion Devadatta recited the Monastic Code in a gathering that included lay people
You should not recite the Monastic Code in a gathering that includes lay people
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha without being requested
You should not recite the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha without first being requested to do so
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The most senior monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code
The first section for recitation on ascetics of other religions is finished
Requesting the recitation of the Monastic Code etc
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Codanāvatthu
When he eventually arrived he stayed there
On that occasion a number of monks were staying in a certain monastery
where the most senior monk was ignorant and incompetent
He did not know about the observanceday or the observanceday procedure nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation
The other monks knew
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the most senior monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code
and so they wondered what to do
They told the Buddha and he said
In such a case a competent and capable monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code
On one occasion on the observance day a number of ignorant and incompetent monks were staying in a certain monastery
They did not know about the observanceday or the observanceday procedure nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation
They requested the most senior monk
to recite the Monastic Code
but he replied
that he could not
They asked the same question of the secondmost
and thirdmost senior monks
and on both occasions
received the same reply
In the same way they then requested
each monk in turn until they reached the most junior monk
And they all gave the same reply
When all the monks in a monastery are ignorant and incompetent
and none of them is able to recite the Monastic Code
they should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
to learn the Monastic Code either in brief or in full
The monks thought
Who is responsible for sending someone
I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk to go
When told by the most senior monk the junior monks did not go
If a monk isnt sick and hes told by the most senior monk to go he should go
If he doesnt he commits an offense of wrong conduct
The instruction to learn the number of the lunar halfmonth etc
When he had stayed at Codanāvatthu for as long as he liked the Buddha returned to Rājagaha
Then while the monks were walking for almsfood people asked them
Venerables which halfmonth is it
The monks replied
that they did not know
People complained and criticized them
These Sakyan ascetics dont even know the number of the lunar halfmonth How then could they know anything truly useful
They told the Buddha and he said
You should learn the counting of the lunar halfmonths
The monks thought
Who should learn the counting of the lunar halfmonths
You should all learn the counting of the lunar halfmonths
On another occasion while the monks were walking for almsfood people asked them
Venerables how many monks are there
The monks replied
that they did not know
People complained and criticized them
These Sakyan ascetics dont even know about one another How then could they know anything truly useful
You should count the monks
The monks thought
When should we count the monks
You should count the monks on the observance day either by name or by distributing tickets
On one occasion not knowing that it was the observance day monks walked for almsfood in a faraway village
They arrived back while the Monastic Code was being recited or even just after it had been recited
You should announce Today is the observance day
The monks thought
Who should make the announcement
The most senior monk should make the announcement early in the morning
Soon afterwards the senior monk forgot to make the announcement early in the morning
I allow him to make the announcement at the mealtime too
He forgot to make the announcement at the mealtime too
I allow him to make the announcement whenever he remembers
The instruction to do the prior duties
At one time in a certain monastery the observanceday hall was dirty
Newly arrived monks complained and criticized them
How can the resident monks not sweep the hall
They told the Buddha and he said
You should sweep the observanceday hall
The monks thought
Who should sweep the hall
I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk
When told by the senior monk the junior monks did not sweep
If a monk isnt sick and hes told by the senior monk to sweep he should sweep
If he doesnt he commits an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion seats were not prepared in the observanceday hall
The monks sat on the ground They became dirty as did their robes
You should prepare seats in the observanceday hall
The monks thought
Who should prepare the seats in the hall
I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk
When told by the senior monk the junior monks did not prepare them
If a monk isnt sick and hes told by the senior monk to prepare the seats he should do so
If he doesnt he commits an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion there was no lamp in the observanceday hall
Because it was dark the monks stepped on one another and on one anothers robes
You should light a lamp in the observanceday hall
The monks thought
Who should light the lamp in the hall
I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk
When told by the senior monk the junior monks did not light a lamp
If a monk isnt sick and hes told by the senior monk to light a lamp he should do so
If he doesnt he commits an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion in a certain monastery the resident monks neither set out water for drinking nor water for washing
Newly arrived monks complained and criticized them
How can the resident monks neither set out water for drinking nor water for washing
You should set out water for drinking and water for washing
The monks thought
Who should set them out
I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk
When told by the senior monk the junior monks did not set them out
If a monk isnt sick and hes told by the senior monk to set them out he should do so
If he doesnt he commits an offense of wrong conduct
Those going to the districts etc
On one occasion a number of ignorant and incompetent monks asked permission of their teachers and preceptors to go to the districts
They told the Buddha and he said
It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks ask permission of their teachers and preceptors to go to the districts
The teachers and preceptors should then ask them
where theyre going and whom theyre going with
If theyre going with others who are ignorant and incompetent the teachers and preceptors shouldnt give them permission
If they do they commit an offense of wrong conduct
And if the students go without the permission of their teachers and preceptors they commit an offense of wrong conduct
It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are staying in a certain monastery
They dont know about the observanceday or the observanceday procedure nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation
Then a monk arrives who is learned and a master of the tradition who is an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries who is knowledgeable and competent has a sense of conscience and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training
Those monks should treat that learned monk with kindness they should assist him and support him and they should attend on him with bath powder soap toothbrush and water for rinsing the mouth
If they dont look after him in this way they commit an offense of wrong conduct
On the observance day it may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are staying in a certain monastery
They dont know about the observanceday or the observanceday procedure nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation
They should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
to learn the Monastic Code either in brief or in full
If hes able to do so its good
If not then those monks should all go to a monastery where the monks know about the observanceday and the observanceday procedure about the Monastic Code and its recitation
If they dont go they commit an offense of wrong conduct
It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are spending the rainyseason residence in a certain monastery
They dont know about the observanceday or the observanceday procedure nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation
They should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
to learn the Monastic Code either in brief or in full
If hes able to do so its good
If not then one monk should be sent under the sevenday allowance
to learn the Monastic Code either in brief or in full
If hes able to do so its good
If not then those monks should not spend the rainyseason residence in that monastery
If they do they commit an offense of wrong conduct
Discussion of the passing on of purity
Then the Buddha addressed the monks
Gather monks for the Sangha to do the observanceday procedure
A monk said to the Buddha
Venerable Sir theres a sick monk He hasnt come
I allow a sick monk to pass on his purity
And it should be passed on like this
The sick monk should approach a monk put his upper robe over one shoulder and squat on his heels He should then raise his joined palms and say
I pass on my purity please convey my purity please announce my purity
If he makes this understood by body by speech or by body and speech then the purity has been passed on
If he doesnt make this understood by body by speech or by body and speech then the purity hasnt been passed on
If hes able to do this its good
If not then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench They can then do the observanceday procedure
But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says
If we move him his illness will get worse or hell die then the sick monk shouldnt be moved
The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the observanceday procedure there
But you should not do the observanceday procedure with an incomplete Sangha
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
If after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity departs right there then the purity should be passed on to another
If after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes right there
dies right there
admits right there that hes a novice monk
admits right there that hes renounced the training
admits right there that hes committed the worst kind of offense
admits right there that hes insane
admits right there that hes deranged
admits right there that hes overwhelmed by pain
admits right there that hes been ejected for not recognizing an offense
admits right there that hes been ejected for not making amends for an offense
admits right there that hes been ejected for not giving up a bad view
admits right there that hes a paṇḍaka
admits right there that hes living in the community by theft
admits right there that he has previously left to join the ascetics of another religion
admits right there that hes an animal
admits right there that hes a matricide
admits right there that hes a patricide
admits right there that hes a murderer of a perfected one
admits right there that he has raped a nun
admits right there that he has caused a schism in the Sangha
admits right there that he has caused the Buddha to bleed
or admits right there that hes a hermaphrodite then the purity should be passed on to another
If after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity departs while on his way to the observanceday procedure then the purity hasnt been brought
If after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes while on his way to the observanceday procedure 
admits that hes a hermaphrodite while on his way to the observanceday procedure then the purity hasnt been brought
But even if after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity departs after reaching the Sangha then the purity has been brought
And even if after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes after reaching the Sangha 
admits that hes a hermaphrodite after reaching the Sangha then the purity has been brought
And even if after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity reaches the Sangha but doesnt announce the purity because he falls asleep or is heedless or gains a meditation attainment then the purity has been brought
And theres no offense for the one who is conveying the purity
And even if after the purity has been passed on to him the monk who is conveying the purity reaches the Sangha but deliberately doesnt announce the purity then the purity has been brought
But theres an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the purity
Discussion on giving consent
Then the Buddha addressed the monks
Gather monks for the Sangha to do a legal procedure
A monk said to the Buddha
Sir theres a sick monk He hasnt come
I allow a sick monk to give his consent
And it should be given like this
The sick monk should approach a monk put his upper robe over one shoulder and squat on his heels He should then raise his joined palms and say
I give my consent please convey my consent please announce my consent
If he makes this understood by body by speech or by body and speech then the consent has been given
If he doesnt make this understood by body by speech or by body and speech then the consent hasnt been given
If hes able to do this its good
If not then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench and the procedure can then be done
But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says
If we move him his illness will get worse or hell die then the sick monk shouldnt be moved
The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the procedure there
But you should not do a legal procedure with an incomplete Sangha
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
If after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent departs right there then the consent should be given to another
If after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes right there

or admits right there that hes a hermaphrodite then the consent should be given to another
If after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent departs while on his way to the legal procedure then the consent hasnt been brought
If after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes while on his way to the legal procedure 
or admits that hes a hermaphrodite while on his way to the legal procedure then the consent hasnt been brought
And even if after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent departs after reaching the Sangha then the consent has been brought
And even if after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes after reaching the Sangha 
admits that hes a hermaphrodite after reaching the Sangha then the consent has been brought
And even if after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent reaches the Sangha but doesnt announce the consent because he falls asleep or is heedless or gains a meditation attainment then the consent has been brought
And theres no offense for the one who is conveying the consent
And even if after the consent has been given to him the monk who is conveying the consent reaches the Sangha but deliberately doesnt announce the consent then the consent has been brought
But there is an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the consent
On the observance day if the Sangha has business to be done then anyone passing on his purity should also give his consent
Discussion of being seized by relatives etc
On one occasion on the observance day a certain monk was seized by his relatives
If on the observance day a monk is seized by his relatives
other monks should say to those relatives
Please release this monk for a short time so that he can take part in the observanceday procedure
If theyre able to do this its good
If not they should say to those relatives
Please step to one side for a moment while this monk passes on his purity
If theyre able to do this its good
If not they should say to those relatives
Please take this monk outside the monastic boundary for a short time while the Sangha does the observanceday procedure
If theyre able to do this its good
If not you should not do the observanceday procedure with an incomplete Sangha
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
If on the observance day a monk is seized by kings
by bandits
by scoundrels
or by enemies of monks other monks should say to those enemies
Please release this monk for a short time so that he can take part in the observanceday procedure
If theyre able to do this its good

If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Approval in regard to insanity
Then the Buddha addressed the monks
Gather monks theres business for the Sangha
A monk said to the Buddha
Venerable Sir theres a monk called Gagga who is insane He hasnt come
Monks there are two kinds of insane monks
there is the insane monk who sometimes remembers the observanceday and sometimes doesnt who sometimes remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes doesnt
who sometimes goes to the observanceday procedure and sometimes doesnt who sometimes goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes doesnt and theres the insane monk who never remembers any of this
For the first one of these two I allow you to give approval in regard to insanity
And it should be given like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Gagga is insane
Sometimes he remembers the observanceday and sometimes he does not sometimes he remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not sometimes he goes to the observanceday procedure and sometimes he does not sometimes he goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should agree on the following in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga
whether or not Gagga remembers either the observanceday or the legal procedures of the Sangha whether or not he comes to either the Sangha should do the observanceday procedure it should do the legal procedures of the Sangha with or without Gagga
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Gagga is insane
Sometimes he remembers the observanceday procedure and sometimes he does not sometimes he remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not sometimes he goes to the observanceday procedure and sometimes he does not sometimes he goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not
The Sangha agrees on the following in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga
whether or not Gagga remembers either the observanceday procedure or the legal procedures of the Sangha whether or not he comes to either the Sangha should do the observanceday procedure it should do the legal procedures of the Sangha with or without Gagga
Any monk who approves of this agreement
should remain silent
Any monk who doesnt approves should speak up
The Sangha has agreed in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
Various kinds of observance days for the Sangha etc
At one time on the observance day there were four monks staying in a certain monastery
They thought
The Buddha has laid down a rule
that the observanceday procedure should be done But theres only four of us How should we do the observanceday procedure
They told the Buddha and he said
When there are four of you you should recite the Monastic Code
At one time on the observance day there were three monks staying in a certain monastery
They thought
The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four But theres only three of us How should we do the observanceday procedure
When there are three of you you should do the observanceday procedure by declaring your purity
And it should be done like this
A competent and capable monk should inform those monks
Please Venerables I ask you to listen
Today is the observance day the fifteenth
If it seems appropriate to the venerables we should do the observanceday procedure by declaring purity to one another
The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say to the other monks
Im pure
please remember me as pure
And he should repeat this two more times
A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say to the other monks
Im pure Venerable
please remember me as pure
And he should repeat this two more times
At one time on the observance day there were two monks staying in a certain monastery
They thought
The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four and that the observanceday procedure should be done by declaring purity when there are three
But theres only two of us
How should we do the observanceday procedure
When there are two of you you should do the observanceday procedure by declaring your purity
And it should be done like this
The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say to the junior monk
Im pure
please remember me as pure
And he should repeat this two more times
The junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say to the senior monk
Im pure Venerable
please remember me as pure
And he should repeat this two more times
At one time on the observance day a monk was staying in a certain monastery by himself
He thought
The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four and that the observanceday procedure should be done by declaring purity when there are two or three
But Im here by myself
How should I do the observanceday procedure
On the observance day it may happen that a monk is staying by himself in a certain monastery
That monk should sweep whatever place the monks normally go to whether the assembly hall under a roofcover or at the foot of a tree He should set out water for drinking and water for washing should prepare a seat light a lamp and sit down
If other monks come he should do the observanceday procedure with them
If not he should determine Today is my observance day
If he doesnt make a determination he commits an offense of wrong conduct
Wherever four monks are staying together three shouldnt recite the Monastic Code while one sends his purity
If you do recite it in this way you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Wherever three monks are staying together two shouldnt do the observanceday procedure by declaring purity while one sends his purity
If you do it in this way you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Wherever two monks are staying together one shouldnt makes a determination while one sends his purity
If you do make determination in this way you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The process for making amends for an offense
At one time on the observance day a certain monk had committed an offense
He thought
The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldnt do the observanceday procedure if one has an offense
But Ive committed an offense
So what should I do
They told the Buddha and he said
On the observance day it may happen that a monk has committed an offense
He should approach a single monk put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
I have committed suchandsuch an offense I confess it
The other should say
Do you recognize the offense 
Yes I recognize it 
You should restrain yourself in the future
On the observance day it may happen that a monk is unsure if hes committed an offense
He should approach a single monk put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
Im unsure if Ive committed suchandsuch an offense
Ill make amends for it when Im sure He can then take part in the observanceday procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code You shouldnt allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observanceday procedure
On one occasion the monks from the group of six confessed shared offenses to one another
You should not confess shared offenses to one another
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion the monks from the group of six received the confession of shared offenses from one another
You should not receive the confession of shared offenses from one another
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The process for revealing an offense
At one time a certain monk remembered an offense while the Monastic Code was being recited
He thought
The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldnt do the observanceday procedure if one has an offense
But Ive committed an offense
So what should I do
It may happen that a monk remembers an offense while the Monastic Code is being recited
He should say to a monk sitting next to him
Ive committed suchandsuch an offense
Once this meeting is finished Ill make amends for it They can then continue the observanceday procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code You shouldnt allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observanceday procedure
It may happen while the Monastic Code is being recited that a monk becomes unsure if hes committed an offense
He should say to a monk sitting next to him
Im unsure if Ive committed suchandsuch an offense
Ill make amends for it when Im sure They can then continue the observanceday procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code
You shouldnt allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observanceday procedure
The process for making amends for a shared offense
At one time on the observance day the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense
Those monks thought
The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldnt confess or receive the confession of shared offenses
But here the whole sangha has committed the same offense
So what should we do
On the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery has committed the same offense
Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
Go and make amends for this offense
When you return well make amends for it in your presence
If hes able to do so its good
If not then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
This whole sangha has committed the same offense
When the Sangha sees another monk who is pure and free from offenses it should make amends for this offense in his presence
Once this has been said they can do the observanceday procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code
You shouldnt allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observanceday procedure
On the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery is unsure if it has committed the same offense
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
This whole Sangha is unsure if it has committed the same offense
When the Sangha is sure it should make amends for this offense
Once this has been said they can do the observanceday procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code
You shouldnt allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observanceday procedure
When a sangha has entered the rainyseason residence in a certain monastery it may happen that the whole sangha has committed the same offense
Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
Go and make amends for this offense
When you return well make amends for it in your presence
If hes able to do so its good
If not they should send one monk using the sevenday allowance
Go and make amends for this offense
When you return well make amends for it in your presence
Soon afterwards the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense
They did not know the name or the class of that offense
Then a monk arrived who was learned and a master of the tradition who was an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries who was knowledgeable and competent had a sense of conscience and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training
One monk approached him and asked
When someone does suchandsuch whats the name of the offense hes committed
The learned monk replied
When someone does suchandsuch hes committed an offense with this name
If you have committed this offense
you should make amends for it
The other monk then said
Its not just I alone who have committed this offense
but this whole sangha has committed it
The learned monk said
What does it matter to you whether others have or havent committed an offense
Please clear yourself of your own offense
Then because of what the learned monk had said the other monk made amends for that offense He then approached the other monks and said
When someone does suchandsuch hes committed an offense with this name
This is the offense that you have committed
and you should make amends for it
But in spite of what he had said those monks did not want to make amends for that offense
They told the Buddha and he said
In a case such as this
if those monks do make amends for that offense because of what that monk has said then this is good
If they dont then that monk doesnt need not correct them if he doesnt want to

The account of Jīvaka
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuary
At that time Vesālī was prosperous and crowded with people and there was plenty of food
There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven stilt houses
and the same number of halls with peaked roofs
and lotus ponds
And there was the courtesan Ambapālī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion She was skilled at dancing singing and instrumental music She was highly desired charging fifty coins for a night
Because of her Vesālī was even more splendid
On one occasion the householder association of Rājagaha traveled to Vesālī on business
and they saw all these marvelous qualities of the city
including Ambapālī
When they had concluded their business they returned to Rājagaha
They then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
and told him about everything they had seen
adding It would be good sir if we were to appoint a courtesan
Well then find a suitable girl
At that time in Rājagaha there was a girl called Sālavatī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion
and the householder association appointed her as courtesan
Soon afterwards she became skilled in dancing singing and instrumental music She was highly desired charging a hundred coins for a night
Soon enough Sālavatī became pregnant
She thought
Men dont like pregnant women
If anyone finds out about this
it will ruin my career
Let me announce that Im sick
She told her doorman
Dont allow entry to any man
If anyone asks for me tell them Im sick
Yes madam
Her pregnancy developed and eventually she gave birth to a son
She told her slave
Listen put this boy in a winnowing basket take him away and throw him on a trash heap
Saying Yes madam she did just that
On the same morning as Prince Abhaya was walking to an audience with the King he saw that boy surrounded by crows He asked his companions
Whats that surrounded by crows
Its a boy sir
Is he alive
Yes hes alive
Well then take him to our compound and give him to the wetnurses to feed
Saying Yes thats what they did
When they knew that he would live they gave him the name Jīvaka Survivor
And because a prince brought him up they also gave him the name Komārabhacca Princereared
When Jīvaka reached the age of discernment
he went to Prince Abhaya and asked him
Who sir are my mother and father
I dont know who your mother is
but Im your father
because I brought you up
On a later occasion Jīvaka thought
Its not easy to make a living in a royal family without a profession
I should learn a profession
At that time the preeminent physician in the world was staying at Takkasilā
Then without asking permission of Prince Abhaya Jīvaka left for Takkasilā
When he eventually arrived he went to that physician and said
Teacher I wish to learn the profession
Well then Jīvaka please do so
Jīvaka learned much and he learned quickly he remembered well and did not forget
After seven years Jīvaka thought
Im a good learner and Ive been studying for seven years
And yet theres no end in sight of learning this profession
He went to that physician and told him what he had thought
adding When will I complete the training for this profession
Listen Jīvaka Take a spade and walk as far as  kilometers all around Takkasilā and bring back whatever plant you see thats not medicinal
Saying Yes teacher he did just that But he did not see any plant that was not medicinal
He then went back to the physician and told him what had happened
The physician said You are welltrained Jīvaka
This is enough for you to live on And he gave Jīvaka a small amount of provisions for the journey
Jīvaka left for Rājagaha
but the provisions were exhausted by the time he got to Sāketa
Jīvaka thought
These roads go through the wilderness where theres little water and little food Its not easy to travel there without provisions
Let me search for provisions
The account of the prominent merchants wife
At that time in Sāketa there was a prominent merchant whose wife had had a headache for seven years
Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see her but none were able to cure her
And they were very expensive
When Jīvaka arrived at Sāketa he asked people
Is there anyone who is sick whom I might cure
Theres a prominent merchant whose wife has had a headache for seven years
Go doctor and cure her
Jīvaka went to that merchants house and told the doorman
Go and say this to the merchants wife
Madam a doctor has arrived He wishes to see you
Saying Yes doctor he did as asked
When she had been told she asked What sort of doctor is it
A young one
Forget it I dont need a young doctor
Many of the most famous physicians in the world have been here but none were able to cure me
And they were very expensive too
The doorman then returned to Jīvaka and told him what the merchants wife had said
Jīvaka replied
Go and tell her
that she doesnt have to pay anything in advance
When she is cured she can pay whatever she likes
Saying Yes doctor he told the merchants wife
She replied Well then let him come in
Saying Yes madam he went to Jīvaka and told him
Jīvaka then approached the merchants wife After examining her he said to her
Lady I need a handful of ghee
She got him a handful of ghee
Jīvaka cooked that ghee with a number of medicines He then got her to lie down on her back on a bed and he gave her the medicine through the nose
The medicine emerged in her mouth
She then spat it out into a receptacle and told a slave
Listen take this ghee in a cotton wadding
Jīvaka thought
Its astonishing how mean this housewife is in that she takes this ghee which should be discarded in a cotton wadding
Many of my valuable medicines went into it
but she might not give me anything for my services
Seeing his body language the merchants wife asked him
what he was concerned about
He told her
and she said We householders know the benefit of such frugality
This ghee is good for the slaves and workers for ointment for the feet or for using in lamps
Dont be concerned doctor
your fee will be abundant
Jīvaka cured the headache of the merchants wife with a single treatment through the nose
When she was well she gave him four thousand coins
found out that she was well they too gave him four thousand coins each
as did her husband
The merchant also gave him a male and a female slave and a carriage with horses
Jīvaka took those sixteen thousand coins as well as the male and female slaves and the carriage with horses and he left for Rājagaha
When he eventually arrived he went to Prince Abhaya and said
For my first job sir I earned sixteen thousand coins a male and a female slave and a carriage with horses
Please accept it for bringing me up
Theres no need Jīvaka
You should keep it all
But please build a house in our compound
Yes And thats what he did
The account of King Bimbisāra
At that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had hemorrhoids
His wrap garments were soiled with blood
and the queens made fun of him
Sir youre menstruating your fertile period has arrived Soon youll give birth
And the King felt humiliated
Soon afterwards he told Prince Abhaya what had happened
adding Abhaya please find a doctor who can cure me
Sir our young doctor Jīvaka is excellent
He will cure you
Well then Abhaya send for Jīvaka
Prince Abhaya then sent for Jīvaka
Saying Yes sir Jīvaka took some medicine on his nail and went to King Bimbisāra He said
Sir let me see your affliction
Jīvaka then cured King Bimbisāras hemorrhoids with one application of ointment
When the King was well he had five hundred women adorned with every kind of ornament He then had the ornaments removed and made into a pile And he said to Jīvaka
Jīvaka these ornaments from five hundred women are all yours
Theres no need Please just remember my act of service
Well then Jīvaka please attend on me the harem and the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha
Yes sir
The account of the prominent merchant of Rājagaha
At that time a prominent merchant of Rājagaha had had a headache for seven years
Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see him but none were able to cure him
They were very expensive
yet they gave up on him
Some of them said
The merchant will die in five days
Others said
The merchant will die in seven days
The householder association of Rājagaha considered
This merchant has done much for the King and for this association
and now the doctors have given up on him
But theres Jīvaka the Kings excellent young doctor
Lets ask the King for Jīvaka to cure the merchant
They then went to the King and told him about the merchant
adding It would be good sir if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure the merchant
And thats what the King did
Saying Yes sir Jīvaka went to that merchant examined him and said
If I were to cure you what fee would you pay me
I would give you all my wealth doctor and I would become your slave
Are you able to lie on one side for seven months
Are you able to lie on the other side for seven months
Are you able to lie on your back for seven months
Jīvaka then had the merchant lie down on a bed He bound him to the bed removed some skin from his head opened a suture in the skull and removed two insects He showed them to the crowd saying
Sirs look at these two insects one small and one large
The doctors who said
he would live for five days
had seen the large insect
In five days it would have destroyed the merchants brain
Because of that he would have died
Those doctors were right
And those doctors who said
he would live for seven days
had seen the small insect
In seven days it would have destroyed the merchants brain
Because of that he would have died
Those doctors were right too
He then closed the suture in the skull sewed the skin back together and applied an ointment
After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka
Doctor Im unable to lie on one side for seven months
But didnt you say you were
I did but Ill die Im unable to do it
Well then lie on the other side for seven months
After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka
Doctor Im unable to lie on the other side for seven months
But didnt you say you were
I did but Ill die Im unable to do it
Well then lie on your back for seven months
After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka
Doctor Im unable to lie on my back for seven months
But didnt you say you were
I did but Ill die Im unable to do it
If I hadnt said this to you you wouldnt have been able to lie down for so long
I already knew that you would be well in three times seven days
Get up youre cured
But do you remember my fee
All my wealth is yours doctor and Im your slave
Theres no need for that
Just give one hundred thousand coins to the King and another one hundred thousand to me
And being well he did just that
The account of the prominent merchants son
On one occasion the son of a prominent merchant in Benares twisted his gut while turning somersaults Because of that he was not able to digest rice porridge or food and he was not able to urinate or defecate
He became thin haggard and pale his veins protruding all over his limbs
The merchant considered this
and thought Let me go to Rājagaha and ask the King for doctor Jīvaka to cure my son
He then traveled to Rājagaha approached King Bimbisāra and told him about his son
adding It would be good sir if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure my son
And thats what the King did
Jīvaka consented and then went to Benares where he approached that merchant He examined his son dismissed the people there put up a curtain all around and tied him to a pillar He then got his wife to stand in front of him cut open his stomach and pulled out his twisted gut He showed it to his wife saying
See this is your husbands affliction
Its because of this that hes in such a bad state
He then untwisted the gut put it back sewed the stomach back together and applied ointment
Soon the merchants son was healthy again
His father gave sixteen thousand coins to Jīvaka
and Jīvaka returned to Rājagaha
The account of King Pajjota
At that time King Pajjota had jaundice
Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see him but none were able to cure him
And they were very expensive
King Pajjota then sent a message to King Bimbisāra
I have suchandsuch a disease It would be good sir if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure me
And King Bimbisāra told Jīvaka
Go to Ujjenī Jīvaka
and cure King Pajjota
Jīvaka consented and traveled to Ujjenī where he approached King Pajjota He then examined him and said
Give me some ghee sir
Ill make a medicine from it for you to drink
Forget it Jīvaka Make whatever will cure me that doesnt contain ghee
I hate ghee its disgusting
Jīvaka thought
I wont be able to cure this sickness without ghee
Let me prepare medicine from ghee but with the color smell and taste of a bitter substance
Jīvaka then cooked ghee with a number of medicines but he made sure it had the color smell and taste of a bitter substance
And he thought
When the King is digesting the ghee after drinking it it will make him vomit
And because hes harsh he might have me executed
Let me take leave in advance
He then went to the King and said
Sir we doctors need to pull up roots and collect medicines at short notice
It would be good if you would give notice in the stables and at the gates
Jīvaka may ride on whatever animal he wishes depart by whatever gate he desires and he may come and go as he pleases
And the King did as Jīvaka had asked
At that time King Pajjota had a sheelephant called Bhaddavatikā which could travel  kilometers in a day
After bringing the ghee to the King
and getting him to drink it Jīvaka went to the elephant stables and fled the city on Bhaddavatikā
Soon afterwards while King Pajjota was digesting that ghee he vomited
He said to his men
That scoundrel Jīvaka made me drink ghee
Find out where he is
Sir hes fled the city on Bhaddavatikā
At that time King Pajjota had a slave called Kāka whose mother was a spirit and who could travel  kilometers in a day
The King told Kāka
Go Kāka and make Jīvaka come back
Tell him that the King is asking him to return
These doctors Kāka are full of tricks
Dont receive anything from him
Kāka caught up with Jīvaka at Kosambī while he was still on his way and having breakfast
Kāka said
Doctor the King is having you return
Wait Kāka until Ive finished eating
Why dont you have something to eat
Theres no need
The King told me that doctors are full of tricks and that I shouldnt receive anything from you
Jīvaka then removed the medicinal part of an emblic myrobalan fruit with his nail before eating it and drinking water
And he said to Kāka
Here Kāka have some emblic myrobalan and water to drink
Kāka thought
The doctor is eating and drinking it Its unlikely to be anything bad
So he ate half a fruit and drank water
When he had eaten it he vomited right there
He asked Jīvaka
Will I live
Dont be afraid Kāka Both you and the King will be well
But the King is harsh and might have me executed Because of that I wont return
After handing back the sheelephant Bhaddavatikā to Kāka he continued on to Rājagaha
When he eventually arrived he went to King Bimbisāra and told him what had happened
The King said Its good Jīvaka that you didnt return That King is harsh and might even have had you executed
When King Pajjota was cured he sent a message to Jīvaka
Come Jīvaka I wish to give you a gift
He replied Theres no need sir please just remember my act of service
The account of the two valuable cloths
Soon afterwards King Pajjota obtained two valuable cloths
extremely exquisite and finethey were one in a million
The King sent them to Jīvaka
Jīvaka considered this and thought
Noone is worthy of these except the Buddha the Perfected and fully Awakened One or King Bimbisāra
The account of the thirty purgings
On one occasion the Buddhas body became full of impurities
He said to Venerable nanda
nanda my body is full of impurities
I wish to take a purgative
nanda went to Jīvaka and told him what the Buddha had said
And Jīvaka replied Well then Venerable nanda oil the Buddhas body for a few days
After doing as instructed nanda returned to Jīvaka to let him know adding
Please continue the treatment
Jīvaka thought
It would not be appropriate for me to give the Buddha a powerful purgative
He then prepared three handfuls of lotus flowers with a variety of medicines approached the Buddha and gave him one handful saying
Venerable Sir please smell the first handful
This will purge you ten times
He then brought him the second
and the third handful repeating his instruction
adding In this way youll have thirty purgings
After giving the Buddha thirty purgings he bowed down circumambulated him with his right side toward him and left
When he was outside the gateway Jīvaka thought
I have given thirty purgings to the Buddha
for the his body is full of impurities
But he will only be purged twentynine times
After being purged he will take a bath
and when he has bathed he will be purged once
In this way there will be exactly thirty purgings for the Buddha
The Buddha read Jīvakas mind He told nanda about it
adding Well then nanda prepare hot water
nanda consented and did so
Jīvaka then went back to the Buddha bowed sat down
and asked
Sir are you purged
I am Jīvaka
Jīvaka then told him what he had thought outside the gateway
adding Please bathe
The Buddha had a hot bath
When he had bathed the Buddha was purged once
in total adding up to thirty purgings
And Jīvaka said to the Buddha
Sir until your body is back to normal please dont take any mungbean broth
The account of asking for a favor
Soon the Buddhas body was back to normal
Jīvaka then took those two valuable cloths and went to the Buddha He bowed sat down
Venerable Sir I wish to ask for a favor
Buddhas dont grant favors Jīvaka
Its allowable and blameless
Well then please say what it is
The Buddha and the Sangha of monks are ragrobe wearers
But Ive received these two valuable cloths from King Pajjota
that are extremely exquisite and finethey are one in a million
Please accept them from me
and please allow the Sangha of monks to use robecloth given by householders
The Buddha received the two valuable cloths
He then instructed inspired and gladdened Jīvaka with a teaching
after which Jīvaka got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to use robecloth given by householders
Anyone who wishes may wear ragrobes
and anyone who wishes may accept robecloth from householders
But I praise contentment with whatever sort you use
The people of Rājagaha heard
that the Buddha had allowed the monks to use robecloth given by householders
They were excited and joyful thinking
Now well give gifts and make merit
In just a single day many thousands of robes were given at Rājagaha
And the same thing happened in the countryside
A fleecy robe was given to the Sangha
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow fleecy robes
And a silken fleecy robe was given
I allow silken fleecy robes
And a woolen fleecy robe was given
I allow woolen fleecy robes
The first section for recitation is finished
Discussion on the allowance for wool
On one occasion the King of Kāsī sent a valuable woolen Kāsīcloth to Jīvaka
Jīvaka took the cloth and went to the Buddha He bowed sat down
and told him what had happened
adding Sir please accept the woolen cloth for my longlasting benefit and happiness
The Buddha received the woolen cloth
He then instructed inspired and gladdened Jīvaka with a teaching
after which Jīvaka got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
I allow wool
At that time various kinds of robecloth were given to the Sangha
The monks thought
What kinds of robecloth has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow six kinds of robecloth
linen cotton silk wool sunn hemp and hemp
Soon afterwards the monks thought The Buddha has only allowed one kind of robe not two
and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not accept rags after receiving robecloth from householders
I allow you to accept rags after receiving robecloth from a householder
But I praise contentment with both of them
Discussion on searching for rags
On one occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country
Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags while the others walked on
The former monks obtained rags
and the others said
Please give us a share
But why didnt you wait then
We wont give you a share
They told the Buddha and he said
If youre unwilling I allow you not to give a share to those who dont wait
On another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country
Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags while the others waited
The former monks obtained rags
and the others said
Please give us a share
But why didnt you come with us then
We wont give you a share
Even if youre unwilling you should give a share to those who wait
On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country
Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags first while the other monks entered afterwards
Those who entered first obtained rags
but not those who entered afterwards
The latter monks said
Please give us a share
But why then did you come in afterwards
We wont give you a share
If youre unwilling I allow you not to give a share to those who enter afterwards
On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country
They all entered a charnel ground together to look for rags
Some of them obtained rags while others did not
The latter monks said
Please give us a share
But why didnt you obtain any
We wont give you a share
Even if youre unwilling you should give a share to those who enter together with you
On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country
They entered a charnel ground together to look for rags after making an agreement to share
Some of them obtained rags while others did not
The latter monks said
Please give us a share
But why didnt you obtain any
We wont give you a share
Even if youre unwilling if you have made an agreement about it you should give a share to those who enter
Discussion on the appointment of a receiver of robecloth
At that time people brought robecloth to the monastery
but not finding anyone to receive it they took it back
As a result only a little robecloth was given at that monastery
They told the Buddha and he said
You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the receiver of robecloth
he is not swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and he knows what has and has not been received
And this is how he should be appointed
First a monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint monk soandso as the receiver of robecloth
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha appoints monk soandso as the receiver of robecloth
Any monk who approves of appointing monk soandso as the receiver of robecloth should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has appointed monk soandso as the receiver of robecloth
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
Soon afterwards after receiving cloth the receivers of robecloth left it right there and went away
The robecloth was lost
You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the storer of robecloth
he is not swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and he knows what is and is not stored
And this is how he should be appointed
First a monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint monk soandso as the storer of robecloth
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha appoints monk soandso as the storer of robecloth
Any monk who approves of appointing monk soandso as the storer of robecloth should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has appointed monk soandso as the storer of robecloth
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
Discussion on the designation of a storeroom etc
Soon afterwards the monk who was the storer of robecloth stored it under a roofcover at the foot of a tree and under the eaves of a building Rats and termites ate it
I allow you to designate a dwelling a stilt house or a cave as a storeroom
And this is how it should be designated
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should designate suchandsuch a dwelling as a storeroom
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha designates suchandsuch a dwelling as a storeroom
Any monk who approves of designating suchandsuch a dwelling as a storeroom should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has designated suchandsuch a dwelling as a storeroom
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
At that time the robecloth in the Sanghas storeroom was not looked after
You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the storeman he is not swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and he knows what is and is not protected
And this is how he should be appointed
First a monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint monk soandso as the storeman
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha appoints monk soandso as the storeman
Any monk who approves of appointing monk soandso as the storeman should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has appointed monk soandso as the storeman
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six dismissed the storeman
You should not dismiss the storeman
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At one time there was much robecloth in the Sanghas storeroom
You should share it out in the presence of the Sangha
Soon afterwards there was a racket as the Sangha was sharing out the robecloth
You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of robecloth
he is not swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and he knows what has and has not been distributed
And this is how he should be appointed
First a monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint monk soandso as the distributor of robecloth
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha appoints monk soandso as the distributor of robecloth
Any monk who approves of appointing monk soandso as the distributor of robecloth should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has appointed monk soandso as the distributor of robecloth
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
The monks who were distributors of robecloth thought
How should we distribute the robecloth
You should first sort the cloth then estimate its value followed by making portions of equal value counting the monks gathering the monks into groups and finally fixing the shares of robecloth
And the monks who were distributors of robecloth thought
What share of the robecloth should we give to the novices
I allow you to give half a share to the novices
On one occasion a monk wanted to take his own share and depart
You should give a share to one who is departing
On another occasion a monk wanted to take an extra share and depart
I allow you to give an extra share to anyone who gives something in return
And the distributors of robecloth thought
How should we give out the shares of robecloth According to the order in which the monks have arrived or according to seniority
You should share out the remainder and then give it out by drawing lots
Discussion on the dyeing of robes
At that time the monks dyed the robes even with dung and beige clay
The robes were discolored
I allow you to use six kinds of dye
dye from roots dye from wood dye from bark dye from leaves dye from flowers and dye from fruit
At that time the monks dyed the robes in cold water
The robes became smelly
I allow a dyepot to boil the dye
The dye overflowed
I allow you to fix a collar
The monks did not know whether the dye was ready or not
You should put a drop in water or on the back of your nail
To remove the dye the monks turned the pot
The pot broke
I allow a dyeladle with or without handle
The monks did not have a vessel for the dye
I allow a basin for dye a waterpot for dye
The monks were kneading the robes in basins and bowls
The robes split
I allow a dyeing trough
At that time the monks spread the robes on the ground
The robes became dirty
I allow a straw mat
The straw mat was eaten by termites
I allow a bamboo roberack and a clothesline
They hung up the robes by the middle
The dye dripped from both sides
You should fasten it at the corners
The corners became worn
I allow you thread for the corners
The dye dripped from one side
You should dye it by repeatedly turning it over and you should not go away while its still dripping
The robes were stiff
You should rinse it in water
The robes were rough
You should beat it with your hands
At that time the monks wore robes consisting of a single piece of cloth the color of ivory
People complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not wear robes made consisting of a single piece of cloth
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The instruction on robes made of pieces
After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward the southern hills
He saw the fields of Magadha laid out in rectangles defined by long and short boundaries and their intersections He said to Venerable nanda
nanda have a look at these fields
Yes Sir
Are you able to make this kind of robe for the monks
After staying in the southern hills for as long as he liked the Buddha returned to Rājagaha
nanda then made robes for a number of monks He approached the Buddha and said
Venerable Sir please have a look at the robes Ive made
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
nanda is clever He understands the detailed meaning of what I have spoken in brief
He can make long interpanel strips short interpanel strips large panels mediumsized panels middle sections intermediate sections a strengthening piece for the neck a strengthening piece for the calves and outer sections In this way the robe will be made of pieces making it worthless making it appropriate for ascetics making it undesirable for ones enemies
Your outer robe should be made of pieces and so should your upper robe and sarong
The instruction on three robes
After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward Vesālī
On the road between Rājagaha and Vesālī the Buddha saw a number of monks walking along loaded up with robes on their heads shoulders and hips He thought
These foolish men have turned to an abundance in robes too readily
Let me set a limit on robes for the monks
Wandering on the Buddha eventually arrived at Vesālī where he stayed at the Gotamaka Shrine
At that time it was midwinter when the days are cold and the snow is falling
The Buddha sat outside at night without being cold wearing only one robe He was fine
Becoming cold at the end of the first part of the night he put on a second robe
Becoming cold once again at the end of the middle part of the night he put on a third robe
At the end of the last part of the night when the sky was flaring up at dawn he became cold once more
Putting on a fourth robe he was fine
He thought Even those on this spiritual path who come from good families who are sensitive to the cold and fear the cold are able to get by with three robes
Let me set a limit on robes for the monks let me allow them three robes
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
He told them what had happened
and what he had thought adding
I allow you three robes a doublelayered outer robe a singlelayered upper robe and a singlelayered sarong
Discussion on extra robes
When they knew that the Buddha had allowed three robes
the monks from the group of six entered the village in one set of three stayed in the monastery in another set and went bathing in yet another set
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six keep extra robes
And they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not keep extra robes
If you do you should be dealt with according to the rule
Soon afterwards Venerable nanda was given an extra robe
He wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputta
who was staying at Sāketa
Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having an extra robe he thought
What should I do in this situation
He told the Buddha who said
How long is it nanda before Sāriputta returns
Nine or ten days
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most
Soon afterwards the monks were given an extra robe
Not knowing what to do with it
they told the Buddha and he said
I allow you to transfer extra robes to another
After staying at Vesālī for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward Benares
When he eventually arrived
he stayed in the deer park at Isipattana
On that occasion the sarong of a certain monk had a tear
He thought
The Buddha has allowed three robes
a doublelayered outer robe a singlelayered upper robe and a singlelayered sarong
Since my sarong has a tear
let me add a patch It will have a double layer of cloth on all sides but only a single layer in the middle
And he did so
Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings and he saw that monk patching his robe He approached that monk and said
What are you doing monk
Im patching my robe Sir
Well done
Its good that you are patching your robe
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
When the cloth is new or nearly new I allow a doublelayered outer robe a singlelayered upper robe and a singlelayered sarong
When the cloth is worn I allow an outer robe of four layers a doublelayered upper robe and a doublelayered sarong
With rags you may have as much as you like
With scraps of cloth from a shop you should search for them
And I allow patches mending hems strips of cloth for marking and strengthening
The account of Visākhā
After staying at Benares for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward Sāvatthī
When he eventually arrived
he stayed in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
Soon afterwards Visākhā Migāramātā went to the Buddha bowed and sat down
When the Buddha had instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teaching
Visākhā said
Please accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Sangha of monks
The Buddha consented by remaining silent
Knowing that the Buddha had consented Visākhā got up from her seat bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and left
The following morning it was pouring down from a great storm extending over the four continents
The Buddha said to the monks
It rains on the four continents just as it rains here in the Jeta Grove
Bathe in the rain monks
this is the last great storm of this kind
Saying Yes Sir they took off their robes and bathed in the rain
When Visākhā had had various kinds of fine food prepared she told a slave
Go to the monastery and tell the Buddha that the meal is ready
Saying Yes Lady she went to the monastery When she got there she saw the monks bathing naked in the rain She thought
There are no monks in the monastery just jīvaka ascetics bathing in the rain
She then returned to Visākhā and told her what had happened
But being wise and discerning Visākhā thought No doubt the venerables are bathing naked in the rain
Its only because of her ignorance that she thinks as she does
So she sent the slave back to the monastery with the same instructions
When the monks had cooled their bodies and felt invigorated they took their robes and entered their dwellings
When the slave arrived she didnt see any monks She thought
There are no monks in the monastery its empty
and she returned to Visākhā and told her what had happened
Once again Visākhā realized what was going on
and she told the slave to return to the monastery one more time
When the message had been delivered the Buddha said to the monks
Get your bowls and robes its time for the meal
Yes Sir
The Buddha robed up and took his bowl and robe
Then just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the Jeta Grove and appeared at Visākhās gateway
And he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks
Visākhā thought The power and might of the Buddha are truly amazing
The water is flowing kneedeep even waistdeep yet not single monk has wet feet or wet robes
Delighted and joyful she personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha When the Buddha had finished his meal she sat down to one side
Venerable Sir I wish to ask for eight favors
Buddhas dont grant favors Visākhā
Its allowable and blameless
Well then please say what it is
For as long as I live I wish to give rainyseason robes to the Sangha and I wish to give meals to the newly arrived and departing monastics as well as to those who are sick and those nursing the sick I also wish to give medicines to the sick a regular supply of rice porridge as well as bathing robes to the nuns
But Visākhā what reason do you have for asking me for these eight favors
Visākhā then told the Buddha what had happened to her slave
adding Nakedness is gross disgusting and repulsive
This is the reason I wish to give rainyseason robes to the Sangha for as long as I live
Also not knowing the streets or where to go for almsfood newly arrived monks will get exhausted while walking for alms
After eating a meal for newly arrived monks from me they will get to know the streets and where to go for almsfood and they wont get exhausted while walking for alms
This is the reason I wish to give meals to the newly arrived monks for as long as I live
Also in trying to get a meal departing monks may bother the Teacher or they may arrive late at their destination Or if they go without eating they will be weak while traveling
After eating a meal for departing monks from me they wont bother the Teacher they will arrive at their destination at an appropriate time and they wont be weak while traveling
This is the reason I wish to give meals to the departing monks for as long as I live
Also if sick monks dont get suitable food their illness may get worse or they may die
But when they have eaten a meal for the sick from me their illness wont get worse and they wont die
This is the reason I wish to give meals to the sick monks for as long as I live
Also if the monks who nurse the sick have to get their own meals they will only be able to bring back meals for the sick after midday and the sick wont be able to eat
But when they have eaten a meal for those nursing the sick from me they will be able to bring back meals for the sick in good time and the sick will be able to eat
This is the reason I wish to give meals to those monks who nurse the sick for as long as I live
Also if the sick monks dont get suitable medicines their illness may get worse or they may die
But when they have taken medicine from me their illness wont get worse and they wont die
This is the reason I wish to give medicine to the Sangha for as long as I live
Also while staying at Andhakavinda the Buddha allowed rice porridge seeing ten benefits in it
This is the reason I wish to give a regular supply of rice porridge to the Sangha for as long as I live
On one occasion Sir nuns were bathing naked at a ford in the river Aciravatī together with prostitutes
The prostitutes made fun of them
Venerables why practice the spiritual life while youre young Why not enjoy worldly pleasures
When youre old then you can practice the spiritual life
In this way youll obtain the benefits of both
Being poked fun at by the prostitutes the nuns were humiliated
Nakedness in women is gross disgusting and repulsive
This is the reason I wish to give bathing robes to the Sangha of nuns for as long as I live
But Visākhā what benefit do you see that you ask me for these eight favors
Monks who have completed the rainyseason residence in the various districts will come to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha
If a monk has died
they will ask you about his destination
and you will tell them whether hes reached the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning or perfection
Ill then ask those monks
whether that dead monk had previously visited Sāvatthī
If they say he had
I may conclude
No doubt that Venerable will have enjoyed a rainyseason robe supplied by me or he will have enjoyed a meal for newly arrived monks a meal for departing monks a meal for sick monks a meal for those nursing the sick medicines or a regular supply of rice porridgeall given by me
When I recall that I will feel glad The gladness will give rise to joy and the mental joy will make my body tranquil When my body is tranquil I will feel bliss And when I feel bliss my mind will be stilled
In this way I will develop the spiritual faculties the spiritual powers and the factors of awakening
Its because of this benefit that I ask for these eight favors
Well said Visākhā
Its good that you ask me for these eight favors for the sake of this benefit
I grant you these eight favors
And the Buddha expressed his appreciation to Visākhā with these verses
Rejoicing in giving food and drink
A virtuous disciple of the Accomplished One
Overcoming stinginess gives a gift
That leads to heaven eliminates sadness and brings bliss
By means of the stainless path
She obtains heaven and long life
Desiring merit happy and healthy
She rejoices in heaven for a long time
When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation he got up from his seat and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
I allow a rainyseason robe meals for newly arrived monastics meals for departing monastics meals for the sick meals for those nursing the sick medicine for the sick a regular supply of rice porridge and bathing robes for the Sangha of nuns
The section for recitation on Visākhā is finished
The allowance for a sitting mat
At one time after the monks had eaten fine food they went to sleep absentminded and heedless
They emitted semen while dreaming and the furniture was soiled
Soon afterwards the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable nanda as his attendant Seeing that soiled furniture he asked nanda what had happened
nanda told him
and the Buddha said Thats how it is nanda
For one who goes to sleep absentminded and heedless semen is emitted while dreaming
But for those monks who fall asleep mindful and heedful this doesnt happen
Nor does it for ordinary people without sensual desire
And nanda its impossible for a perfected one to emit semen
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
telling them what had happened
He then said
There are these five disadvantages in going to sleep absentminded and heedless
you dont sleep well you wake up feeling miserable you have nightmares the gods dont guard you and you emit semen
And there are these five benefits in going to sleep mindful and heedful
you sleep well you wake up feeling good you dont have nightmares the gods guard you and you dont emit semen
And monks I allow a sitting mat to protect the body to protect the robes and to protect the furniture
But the sitting mat was too small It did not provide a full protection
I allow you to make a sheet as large as you like
On one occasion Venerable nandas preceptor Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa had carbuncles
and the pus caused his robes to stick to his body
To detach them the monks kept on moistening his robes with water
As the Buddha was walking about the dwellings he saw the monks doing this He approached them and said
What illness does this monk have
He has carbuncles Sir
Thats why were doing this
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
For anyone who has an itch a boil a running sore or a carbuncle I allow a itchcovering cloth
On one occasion Visākhā took a handkerchief and went to the Buddha She bowed sat down
Venerable Sir please accept this handkerchief for my longlasting benefit and happiness
The Buddha accepted it
and then instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teaching
She got up from her seat bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
I allow handkerchiefs
At that time Venerable nanda had a friend called Roja the Mallian
Roja had an old linen cloth that ended up in nandas hands
and it so happened that nanda needed such a cloth
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you to take things on trust from one who has five qualities
they are a friend they are a close companion they have spoken about it they are alive and you know they will be pleased if you take it
At that time the monks had enough robes
but they needed water filters and bags
I allow cloth for requisites
Discussion of the smallest robecloth that can be transferred to another etc
Soon afterwards the monks thought
These things that have been allowed by the Buddhathe three robes the rainyseason robe the sitting mat the sheet the itchcovering cloth the handkerchief and the cloth for requisitesare they all to be determined or to be transferred to another
They told the Buddha and he said
You should determine the three robes not transfer them
you should determine the rainyseason robe for the four months of the rainy season and then transfer it
you should determine the sitting mat not transfer it
you should determine the sheet not transfer it
you should determine the itchcovering cloth for as long as youre ill and then transfer it
you should determine the handkerchief not transfer it
you should determine the cloth for requisites not transfer it
The monks thought
Whats the size of the smallest robecloth that can be transferred to another
The smallest robecloth you should transfer is one that is eight standard fingerbreadths long and four wide
At that time Venerable Mahākassapas rag robes were heavy
I allow you to mend roughly with thread
The corners became deformed
You should fix up the deformity
The cloth frayed
I allow you to add a lengthwise border and a crosswise border
On one occasion the panels of the upper robes were breaking up
I allow you to darn
At one time while making a set of three robes for a monk there was not enough cloth to make all three out of pieces
I allow two robes made of pieces and one that is not
There was not enough cloth to make two out of pieces
I allow one robe made of pieces and two that are not
There was not enough cloth to make one out of pieces
I allow you to add a further supply
But you should not wear robes none of which are cut into pieces
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion a monk who had been given much robecloth
wanted to give it to his mother and father
When its given to ones mother and father what can I say
I allow you to give to your mother and father
But monks a gift of faith should not be ruined
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion a monk left one of his robes in the Blind Mens Grove and then went for alms in the village in just his sarong and upper robe
Thieves stole that robe
and he became poorly dressed
When other monks asked him why
he told them what had happened
You should not enter a village in just your sarong and upper robe
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Soon afterwards Venerable nanda being absentminded entered a village in just his sarong and upper robe
The monks asked him why
since the Buddha had laid down a rule against it
and nanda told them what had happened
They told the Buddha and he said
There are five reasons for leaving behind the outer robe
youre sick its the rainy season youre going to cross a river the dwelling is protected by a door you have participated in the robemaking procedure
There are five reasons for leaving behind the upper robe
or the sarong
youre sick its the rainy season youre going to cross a river the dwelling is protected by a door you have participated in the robemaking procedure
There are five reasons for leaving behind the rainyseason robe
youre sick youre going outside the monastic boundary youre going to cross a river the dwelling is protected by a door the rainyseason robe hasnt been sewn or is unfinished
Discussion of robecloth given to the Sangha
At that time a certain monk had spent the rainy season by himself
People gave him robecloth intending it for the Sangha
He thought
The Buddha has laid down
that a sangha consists of a group of at least four
but Im here by myself
Now these people have given robecloth intending it for the Sangha
Let me take this robecloth to Sāvatthī
He then took that robecloth to Sāvatthī and told the Buddha what had happened
The Buddha said This robecloth is yours until the end of the robemaking season
It may be that a monk spends the rainy season by himself
yet people give him robecloth
intending it for the Sangha
That robecloth is his until the end of the robemaking season
At that time a certain monk was living by himself outside the rainy season
People gave him robecloth intending it for the Sangha
He thought
The Buddha has laid down
that a sangha consists of a group of at least four
but Im here by myself
Now these people have given robecloth
intending it for the Sangha
Let me take this robecloth to Sāvatthī
He then took that robecloth to Sāvatthī and told the monks
who in turn told the Buddha
He said It should be shared out in the presence of the Sangha
It may be that a monk is living by himself outside the rainy season yet people give him robecloth intending it for the Sangha
I allow that monk to determine that robecloth as his
But if another monk arrives before he has determined that robecloth then he should be given an equal share
If yet another monk arrives before they have shared out that robecloth by drawing lots he too should be given an equal share
If still another monk arrives but after they have shared out that robecloth by drawing lots they dont need give him a share if they are unwilling
On one occasion after completing the rainyseason residence at Sāvatthī two senior monks who were brothers Venerable Isidāsa and Venerable Isibhaṭa went to a certain village monastery
Because it was long since they had been there people gave meals together with robecloth
The resident monks asked them Venerables this robecloth belonging to the Sangha was given because of you Will you accept a share
They replied As we understand the teaching of the Buddha this robecloth is just for you until the end of the robemaking season
At that time three monks were spending the rains residence at Rājagaha
People gave them robecloth intending it for the Sangha
The monks considered The Buddha has laid down that a sangha consists of a group of at least four but were just three
Now these people have given robecloth intending it for the Sangha
What should we do
At that time a number of senior monksVenerable Nilavāsī Venerable Sāṇavāsī Venerable Gotaka Venerable Bhagu and Venerable Phaḷikasantānawere staying at Pāṭaliputta in the Kukkuṭa Monastery
The monks from Rājagaha went to Pāṭaliputta to ask these monks
They replied
As we understand the teaching of the Buddha that robecloth is just for you until the end of the robemaking season
Upananda the Sakyan
At one time after completing the rainyseason residence at Sāvatthī Venerable Upananda the Sakyan went to a certain village monastery
Just then the monks there had gathered to share out the robecloth
They said to Upananda Were sharing out the Sanghas robecloth Will you accept a share
He then took that share of robecloth and went to another monastery
There too the monks had gathered to share out the robecloth
They said to Upananda Were sharing out the Sanghas robecloth Will you accept a share
He then took that share too and went to yet another monastery
There too the monks had gathered to share out the robecloth
They said to Upananda Were sharing out the Sanghas robecloth Will you accept a share
He then took that share too made a large bundle of robecloth and returned to Sāvatthī
The monks said to him You have much merit Upananda since you have been given so much robecloth
This has nothing to do with merit
And he told them how he had obtained so much robecloth
So you spent the rains residence in one place and accepted a share of the robecloth from somewhere else
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robecloth from somewhere else
They told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda
Is it true Upananda that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robecloth from somewhere else
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
and after rebuking him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not spend the rainyseason residence in one place and accept a share of the robecloth from somewhere else
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At one time Venerable Upananda spent the rains residence in two separate monasteries thinking In this way Ill get much robecloth
The monks considered What share of the robecloth should be given to Venerable Upananda
They told the Buddha and he said
Give the foolish man one persons share
It may be that a monk spends the rains residence in two monasteries with the intention of getting much robecloth
If he spends half the time in each monastery he should be given half a share of the robecloth in each
Otherwise he should be given his share of the robecloth in the monastery where he spends the most time
The account of the one who was sick
At one time a monk who had dysentery
was lying in his own feces and urine
Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable nanda as his attendant and he came to this monk
When he saw his condition he approached him and said
Whats your illness monk
I have dysentery Sir
But dont you have a nurse
Why dont the monks nurse you
Because I dont do anything for them
The Buddha said to nanda
Go and get some water nanda lets wash this monk
Saying Yes Sir he did so
Then the Buddha poured the water
while nanda cleaned him up
Afterwards the Buddha lifted him by the head
and nanda by the feet and they lay him on a bed
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is there a sick monk in that dwelling
Yes Sir
Whats his illness
He has dysentery
Does he have a nurse
But why dont you nurse him
Because he doesnt do anything for us
Monks you have no mother or father to nurse you
If you dont nurse one another who will
Whoever would nurse me should nurse those who are sick
If you have a preceptor he should nurse you for life
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered
If you have a teacher he should nurse you for life
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered
If you have a student he should nurse you for life
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered
If you have a pupil he should nurse you for life
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered
If you have a costudent he should nurse you for life
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered
If you have a copupil he should nurse you for life
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered
If you have none of these the Sangha should nurse you
If you dont nurse one who is sick you commit an offense of wrong conduct
When a sick person has five qualities they are hard to nurse
they do what is detrimental for curing the sickness they do not know the right amount in what is beneficial they do not take their medicine they do not accurately report the state of their illnesswhether its getting worse getting better or remaining the sameto the one who is nursing and trying to help them they are unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful severe sharp and lifethreatening

When an attendant has five qualities they are unsuited to nurse the sick
they are incapable of preparing medicine not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful they bring what is harmful and remove what is beneficial they nurse the sick for the sake of worldly gain not with a mind of kindness they are disgusted at having to clean up feces urine spit or vomit they are incapable of instructing inspiring and gladdening the sick person with a Dhamma talk from time to time

Discussion of inheritance
On one occasion two monk were traveling in the Kosalan country
They arrived at a monastery
with a sick monk
They thought
The Buddha has praised nursing the sick
so lets nurse this sick monk
But while they were nursing him he died
They then took his bowl and robes and went to Sāvatthī where they told the Buddha what had happened He said
When a monk dies the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes
Still the nurses have been very helpful
I allow the Sangha to give the three robes and bowl to the nurses
And they should be given like this
The monk nurse should approach the Sangha and say
Venerables monk soandso has died
Here are his three robes and bowl
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Monk soandso has died
Here are his three robes and bowl
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give the three robes and the bowl to the nurses
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Monk soandso has died
Here are his three robes and bowl
The Sangha gives the three robes and the bowl to the nurses
Any monk who approves of giving the three robes and the bowl to the nurses should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has given the three robes and the bowl to the nurses
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
On one occasion a novice monk had died
When a novice monk dies the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes
Still the nurses have been very helpful
I allow the Sangha to give the robes and the bowl to the nurses
And they should be given like this
The monk nurse should approach the Sangha and say
Venerables the novice monk soandso has died Here are his robes and bowl
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The novice monk soandso has died
Here are his robes and bowl
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give the robes and the bowl to the nurses
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The novice monk soandso has died
Here are his robes and bowl
The Sangha gives the robes and the bowl to the nurses
Any monk who approves of giving the robes and the bowl to the nurses should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has given the robes and the bowl to the nurses
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
On one occasion a monk and a novice monk were nursing someone together
While they were doing so the patient died
The monk nurse thought
What share of the robes should be given to the novicemonk nurse
I allow you to give an equal share to the novicemonk nurse
On one occasion a monk with many possessions had died
When a monk dies the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes
Still the nurses have been very helpful
I allow the Sangha to give the three robes and the bowl to the nurses
His ordinary possessions should be distributed in the presence of the Sangha
His valuable possessions are for the Sangha everywhere present and future They are not to be given out not to be distributed
Discussion of the prohibition against nakedness
On one occasion a naked monk went to the Buddha and said
In many ways Sir you praise fewness of wishes contentment erasing of defilements ascetic practices being inspiring reduction in things and being energetic
Being naked leads to all those things
It would be good if you allowed nakedness for the monks
The Buddha rebuked him
Foolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How can you undertake the practice of nakedness as do the ascetics of other religions
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
and after rebuking him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not undertake the practice of nakedness as do the ascetics of other religions
If you do you commit a serious offense

A robe of antelope hide leads to all those things
It would be good if you allowed robes of antelope hide for the monks

If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct

whether he had received that robe

The account of Mahāpajāpati Gotamī
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Tree Monastery
At this time Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went to the Buddha bowed down to him
It would be good Venerable Sir if women were allowed to go forth from home to homelessness on the spiritual path made known by the Buddha
Let it be Gotami dont pursue this
A second time
and a third time she asked
the same question
and got the same reply
She thought
The Buddha doesnt allow women to go forth
and sad and tearful she bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and left
When the Buddha had stayed at Kapilavatthu for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Vesālī
When he eventually arrived
he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
In the meantime Mahāpajāpati had her hair cut off put on ocher robes and set out for Vesālī together with a number of Sakyan women
When she eventually arrived she went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
And she stood outside the gateway sad and tearful covered in dust and her feet swollen
Venerable nanda saw her there
and said to her
Why are you standing outside the gateway like this
Because Venerable nanda the Buddha doesnt allow women to go forth
Well then Gotamī please wait here for a moment while I ask the Buddha to allow women to go forth
Venerable nanda went to the Buddha bowed sat down
Sir Mahāpajāpati Gotamī is standing outside the gateway sad and tearful covered in dust and her feet swollen
She says you wont allow women to go forth
It would be good if women were allowed to go forth
Let it be nanda dont pursue this
A second time
and a third time he asked
the same question
and got the same reply
nanda thought
The Buddha doesnt allow women to go forth
Let me ask him in another way
He then said
If women were allowed to go forth would they be capable of realizing the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning and the fruit of perfection
Yes they would
If thats so Sir
and considering that Mahāpajāpati has been very helpful to youshe is your aunt who nurtured you brought you up and breastfed you when your own mother died
it would be good if women were allowed to go forth
The eight important principles
nanda if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principles
that will be her full ordination
A nun who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should bow down to a monk who was given the full ordination on that very day and she should stand up for him raise her joined palms to him and do acts of respect toward him
This rule is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
A nun should not spend the rainy season in a monastery without monks
This rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
Every halfmonth a nun should ask the Sangha of monks for two things
about the date of the observance day and about going for the instruction
This rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
A nun who has completed the rains residence should invite correction from both Sanghas in regard to three things
what has been seen what has been heard and what has been suspected
This rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
A nun who has committed a heavy offense must undertake the trial period for a halfmonth toward both Sanghas
This rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years may seek for full ordination in both Sanghas
This rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
A nun may not in any way abuse or revile a monk
This rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
From today onwards nuns may not correct monks but monks may correct nuns
This rule too is to be honored and respected all ones life and is not to be breached
nanda if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principles that will be her full ordination
After learning these eight important principles from the Buddha nanda went to Mahāpajāpati and said
If you accept eight important principles Gotami that will be your full ordination
And he told her the rules
She replied Just as a young woman or mansomeone fond of adornments who had just washed her hairwould receive a garland of lotuses a garland of sandan flowers or a garland of jasmine with both hands and place it on her head
so too do I receive these eight important principles not to be breached for life
nanda then went to the Buddha bowed sat down
Sir Mahāpajāpati has accepted the eight important principles Your aunt has been ordained
nanda if women had not been allowed to go forth on this spiritual path made known by the Buddha the spiritual life would have lasted a long timethe true Teaching would have lasted a thousand years
But since women have been allowed to go forth the spiritual life wont last long
now the true Teaching will only last five hundred years
Just as families with many women and few men are easily robbed by thieves
so too the spiritual life doesnt last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth
Just as a ripe ricefield affected by whiteheads wont last long
so too the spiritual life doesnt last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth
Just as a ripe field of sugarcane attacked by red rot wont last long
so too the spiritual life doesnt last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth
Just as a man might as a safeguard surround a large pool with an embankment so that the water wont overflow
so too have I as a safeguard laid down the eight important principles not to be breached for life
The eight important principles for nuns are finished
The allowance for the full ordination of nuns
Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha bowed down
Venerable Sir what should I do with these Sakyan women
The Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teaching
after which she bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a Teaching and addressed the monks
I allow you to give the full ordination to nuns
Soon afterwards those nuns said to Mahāpajāpati
Were ordained but youre not
for the Buddha has laid down that the monks should give the full ordination to nuns
Mahāpajāpati then went to Venerable nanda bowed down
and told him
what the Sakyan women had said
nanda went to the Buddha bowed sat down
and told him
what Mahāpajāpati had said
The Buddha replied Mahāpajāpati was ordained from the time she accepted the eight important principles
On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to Venerable nanda bowed down
Venerable nanda I wish to ask the Buddha for a favor
It would be good if the Buddha allowed the monks and nuns to bow down to one another according to seniority and likewise to rise up for one another raise their joined palms to one another and do acts of respect toward one another according to seniority
Venerable nanda went to the Buddha bowed sat down
and told the Buddha
what Mahāpajāpati had said
The Buddha replied It is impossible nanda that I would allow bowing down to a woman and likewise rising up for raising ones joined palms to and doing acts of respect toward a woman
Even the ascetics of other religions with their flawed teachings dont bow down to women or rise up for them raise their joined palms to them or do acts of respect toward them
So how then could I allow these things
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not bow down to a woman or rise up for raise your joined palms to or do acts of respect toward a woman
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha bowed down
Venerable Sir how should we practice those training rules that the nuns have in common with the monks
You should practice them in the same way as the monks do
And how should we practice those training rules that the nuns dont have in common with the monks
You should practice them as they have been laid down
On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha bowed down
It would be good Venerable Sir if you would give me a teaching in brief I could then stay by myself secluded heedful energetic and diligent
Those things Gotami that you know
lead to passion not to dispassion to bondage not to freedom from bondage to an increase in things not to a reduction in things to great desires not to fewness of wishes to discontent not to contentment to socializing not to seclusion to laziness not to being energetic to being difficult to support not to being easy to support
you should definitely regard them
as not the Teaching not the training not the Teachers instruction
But those things that you know
lead to dispassion not to passion to freedom from bondage not to bondage to a reduction in things not to an increase in things to fewness of wishes not to great desires to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to socializing to being energetic not to laziness to being easy to support not to being difficult to support
you should definitely regard them
as the Teaching the training the Teachers instruction
At that time the Monastic Code was not being recited to the nuns
They told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said
The Monastic Code should be recited to the nuns
The nuns thought
Who should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns
They told the Buddha and he said
The monks should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns
Soon afterwards the monks went to the nuns dwelling place to recite the Monastic Code
People complained and criticized them
They are their wives They are their mistresses Now they are going to enjoy themselves together
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks you should not recite the Monastic Code to the nuns
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The nuns should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns
The nuns did not know
how to recite it
They told the Buddha and he said
The monks should tell the nuns
how to recite the Monastic Code
At that time the nuns did not make amends for their offenses
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should make amends for her offenses
If she doesnt she commits an offense of wrong conduct
The nuns did not know
how to make amends
They told the Buddha and he said
The monks should tell the nuns
how to make amends for an offense
The monks thought
Who should receive confessions from the nuns
They told the Buddha and he said
The monks should receive the confession of offenses from the nuns
Soon afterwards when the nuns saw a monk on a street in a culdesac or at an intersection they would put down their bowl put their upper robe over one shoulder squat on their heels raise their joined palms and make amends for their offenses
People complained and criticized them
They are their wives They are their mistresses Having offended them at night they now ask for forgiveness
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks you should not receive confessions from the nuns
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The nuns should receive the confession of offenses from the nuns
The nuns did not know
how to receive confessions
They told the Buddha and he said
The monks should tell the nuns
how to receive offenses
At that time the nuns legal procedures were not being done
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks I allow the doing of legal procedures for the nuns
The monks thought
Who should do the nuns procedures
They told the Buddha and he said
The monks should do the nuns procedures
Soon afterwards when nuns who had had a legal procedure done against them saw a monk on a street in a culdesac or at an intersection they would put down their bowl put their upper robe over one shoulder squat on their heels raise their joined palms and ask for forgiveness thinking This is the way to do it
People complained and criticized them
They are their wives They are their mistresses Having offended them at night they now ask for forgiveness
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks you should not do the nuns legal procedures
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The nuns should do the nuns legal procedures
The nuns did not know
how to do procedures
They told the Buddha and he said
The monks should tell the nuns
how to do legal procedures
On one occasion the nuns were arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha attacking one another verbally
and they were not able to resolve that legal issue
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow the monks to resolve the nuns legal issues
Soon afterwards the monks were resolving a legal issue for the nuns
While they were deliberating on the issue there were nuns who needed a legal procedure to be done and who were guilty of an offense
The nuns said
It would be good Venerables if you would do the procedure for the nuns and receive their confession of offenses
for the Buddha has laid down that the nuns legal issues should be resolved by the monks
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks I allow you to determine the nature of the nuns legal procedure before handing over to the nuns for them to do it
And I allow you to charge a nun with an offense before handing over to the nuns for them to receive the confession
At that time a nun who was a pupil of the nun Uppalavaṇṇā had followed the Buddha around for seven years to learn the Monastic Law
But because of her absentmindedness she repeatedly forgot what she had learned
When she heard
that the Buddha wanted to go to Sāvatthī
she reflected
on her absentmindedness and thought
Its hard for a woman to follow the Teacher around all her life
So what should I do
She told the nuns what she had thought
who in turn told the monks
who then told the Buddha The Buddha said
I allow the monks to teach the Monastic Law to the nuns
The first section for recitation is finished
When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī
When he eventually arrived
he stayed in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the monks from the group of six tried to attract the nuns by splashing them with muddy water
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks you should not splash the nuns with muddy water
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow the nuns to penalize a monk who acts like this
The monks thought
What sort of penalty should they impose
They told the Buddha and he said
The Sangha of nuns should not pay respect to such a monk
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six tried to attract the nuns by exposing their bodies to them
by exposing their thighs to them and by exposing their genitals to them And they spoke indecently to the nuns and associated inappropriately with them
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks you should not expose your body to the nuns you should not expose your thighs to the nuns you should not expose your genitals to the nuns you should not speak indecently to the nuns and you should not associate inappropriately with the nuns
If you associate inappropriately with the nuns you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow the nuns to penalize a monk who acts like this
The monks thought
What sort of penalty can they impose
They told the Buddha and he said
The Sangha of nuns should not pay respect to such a monk
Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six tried to attract a monk by splashing him with muddy water
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not splash a monk with muddy water
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct
I allow you to penalize such a nun
The monks thought
What sort of penalty can we impose
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you to place restrictions on her
She did not adhere to the restrictions
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you cancel the halfmonthly instruction
At that time the nuns from the group of six tried to attract the monks by exposing their bodies to them by exposing their breasts to them by exposing their thighs to them and by exposing their genitals to them And they spoke indecently to the monks and associated inappropriately with them
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not expose her body to the monks
she should not expose her breasts to the monks she should not expose her thighs to the monks she should not expose her genitals to the monks she should not speak indecently to the monks and she should not associate inappropriately with the monks
If she associates inappropriately with the monks she commits an offense of wrong conduct
I allow the monks to penalize such a nun
The monks thought
What sort of penalty can we impose
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you to place restrictions on her
She did not adhere to the restrictions
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you cancel the halfmonthly instruction
The monks thought
Is it allowable or not to do the observanceday procedure with a nun whose halfmonthly instruction has been canceled
They told the Buddha and he said
Until that legal issue has been settled its not allowable to do the observanceday procedure with a nun whose halfmonthly instruction has been canceled
On one occasion Venerable Udāyī canceled the halfmonthly instruction and then set out wandering
The nuns complained and criticized him
How could Venerable Udāyī do this
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks you should not cancel the halfmonthly instruction and then set out wandering
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At that time even the monks who were ignorant and incompetent canceled the halfmonthly instruction
They told the Buddha and he said
A monk who is ignorant and incompetent should not cancel the halfmonthly instruction
If he does he commits an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the monks canceled the halfmonthly instruction without reason
They told the Buddha and he said
A monk should not cancel the halfmonthly instruction without reason
If he does he commits an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the monks did not deliberate after canceling the halfmonthly instruction
They told the Buddha and he said
You should deliberate after canceling the halfmonthly instruction
If you dont you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the nuns did not go to the halfmonthly instruction
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should go to the halfmonthly instruction
If she doesnt she should be dealt with according to the rule
At that time the entire Sangha of nuns went to the halfmonthly instruction
People complained and criticized them
They are their wives They are their mistresses Now they are going to enjoy themselves together
They told the Buddha and he said
The whole sangha of nuns should not go to the halfmonthly instruction
If it does there is an offense of wrong conduct
Four or five nuns should go to the instruction
Soon afterwards four or five nuns went to the halfmonthly instruction
People complained and criticized them
They are their wives They are their mistresses Now they are going to enjoy themselves together
They told the Buddha and he said
Four or five nuns should not go to the halfmonthly instruction
If they do there is an offense of wrong conduct
Two or three nuns should go to the instruction
They should go to a monk put their upper robe over one shoulder bow down at his feet squat on their heels raise their joined palms and say
Venerable the Sangha of nuns bows down at the feet of the Sangha of monks and asks to come for the halfmonthly instruction
Please allow the Sangha of nuns to come for the instruction
That monk should approach the reciter of the Monastic Code and tell him
of the nuns request
The reciter should say
Is there anyone who has been appointed as instructor of the nuns
If there is the reciter should say
Monk soandso has been appointed The Sangha of nuns should approach him
If there isnt the reciter should say
Who is able to instruct the nuns
If there is someone who is able and who has the eight required qualities he should be appointed The reciter should then say
Monk soandso has been appointed The Sangha of nuns should approach him
If there is noone who is able to instruct the nuns the reciter of the Monastic Code should say
No monk has been appointed as instructor of the nuns The Sangha of nuns should carry on with serenity
On one occasion the monks did not agree to give the halfmonthly instruction
They told the Buddha and he said

On one occasion the nuns approached a monk who was ignorant

At that time the monks agreed to give the halfmonthly instruction without telling the reciter of the Monastic Code
They told the Buddha and he said

If you dont you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the monks who had agreed to give the halfmonthly instruction did not return to give it

On one occasion a nun who was dying said
When Im dead give my requisites to the Sangha
The monks and the nuns argued with one another saying

They told the Buddha and he said

When a nun sees a monk coming she should make way for him by stepping off the path
At one time a certain woman became pregnant by a lover while her husband was away
After having an abortion she said to the nun who was associating with her family
Venerable please take this fetus away in your almsbowl
The nun did as asked hid her bowl under her upper robe and left
At that time a certain almscollecting monk had resolved
not to eat without giving the first almsfood he obtained to another monk or nun
He saw that nun and said
Sister please accept some almsfood
There is no need Venerable
He repeated his request a second
and a third time
Sister please accept some almsfood
but received the same reply
He then told her about
his resolution
and again requested her to accept some almsfood
Being pressured by that monk the nun brought out her bowl and showed it to him saying
See there is a fetus in my bowl
Please dont tell anyone
But he complained and criticized her
How can a nun take a fetus away in her bowl
And he told the monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized her
How can a nun take a fetus away in her bowl
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not take a fetus away in her bowl
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct
When a nun sees a monk she should bring out her almsbowl and show it to him
Soon afterwards when they saw a monk the nuns from the group of six turned their bowls upside down and showed him the bottom
The monks complained and criticized them
How can the nuns from the group of six do this

They told the monks
who in turn told the Buddha He said
A nun should not stare at a penis
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion people gave requisites to the monks
and the monks gave them to the nuns
People complained and criticized them

Do we not know how to give
They told the Buddha and he said
Monks you should not give away to others what has been given to you for your own use
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion the monks had an abundance of requisites
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you to give to a sangha
The abundance became even greater
They told the Buddha and he said

On one occasion the monks had an abundance of dwellings but the nuns were lacking
The nuns sent a message to the monks saying
It would be good Venerables if you would lend us some dwellings
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow you to lend dwellings to the nuns
Menstruating nuns sat down and lay down on upholstered beds and benches
The furniture was stained with blood
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not sit down or lay down on upholstered beds or benches
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct
I allow a monastery robe
The monastery robe became stained with blood
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow a menstruation pad 
The pad fell off
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow the nuns to attach a string and then bind it to the thigh
The string snapped
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow a loin cloth and a girdle
Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six wore girdles all the time
People complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not wear a girdle all the time
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct
I allow a nun to wear a girdle while she is menstruating
The second section for recitation is finished
At that time the full ordination had been given to
women who lacked genitals who had incomplete genitals who did not menstruate who menstruated continuously who always wore menstruation pads who were incontinent who had genital prolapse who lacked sexual organs who were manlike who had fistula who were hermaphrodites
They told the Buddha and he said
The nun who is giving the full ordination should ask about the twentyfour impediments
And it should be done like this
Do you lack genitals Are your genitals incomplete Are you without menstruation Do you menstruate continuously Do you always wear a menstruation pad Are you incontinent Do you have genital prolapse Do you lack sexual organs Are you manlike Do you have fistula Are you a hermaphrodite
Do you have any of these diseases
leprosy abscesses mild leprosy tuberculosis or epilepsy
Are you human Are you a woman Are you a free woman Are you free from debt Are you employed by the King
Do you have permission from your parents and husband
Are you twenty years old Do you have a full set of bowl and robes What is your name What is the name of your mentor
Soon afterwards the monks asked the nuns about the impediments
Those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed humiliated and unable to respond
They told the Buddha and he said
Only when a woman who is free from impediments has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns should you give her the full ordination in the Sangha of monks
The nuns asked those seeking the full ordination about the impediments without first instructing them
They were embarrassed humiliated and unable to respond
They told the Buddha and he said
The nuns should instruct first and then ask about the impediments
They instructed them right there in the midst of the Sangha
Once again those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed humiliated and unable to respond
They told the Buddha and he said
The nuns should instruct them to one side and then ask about the impediments in the midst of the Sangha
And it should be done like this
First the candidate should be told to choose a preceptor
Her bowl and robes should then be pointed out to her
This is your bowl this your outer robe this your upper robe this your sarong this is your chest wrap and this is your bathing robe
Now please go and stand over there
They were instructed by nuns who were ignorant and incompetent
And because they were badly instructed they were once again embarrassed humiliated and unable to respond
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun who is ignorant and incompetent should not instruct
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct
A nun who is competent and capable should instruct
They instructed without having been appointed
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not instruct if she hasnt been appointed to do so
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct
I allow a nun to instruct if she has been appointed to do so
And it should be done like this
either one should be appointed through oneself or one should be appointed through another
And how is one appointed through oneself
A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Soandso is seeking the full ordination with Venerable soandso
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha I will instruct soandso
In this way one is appointed through oneself
And how is one appointed through another
A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Soandso is seeking the full ordination with Venerable soandso
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha soandso will instruct soandso
In this way one is appointed through another
The appointed nun should approach the one seeking the full ordination and say this
Listen soandso
Now is the time for you to tell the truth
When asked in the midst of the Sangha about various matters you should say Yes if its true and No if its not
Dont be embarrassed or humiliated
This is what they will ask you
Do you lack genitals Are your genitals incomplete Are you without menstruation Do you menstruate continuously Do you always wear a menstruation pad Are you incontinent Do you have genital prolapse Do you lack sexual organs Are you manlike Do you have fistula Are you a hermaphrodite

Do you have permission from your parents and husband
Are you twenty years old Do you have a full set of bowl and robes What is your name What is the name of your mentor
They then returned to the Sangha together The Buddha said
They should not return together
The instructor should return first and inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Soandso is seeking the full ordination with Venerable soandso
She has been instructed by me
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha soandso should come
And she should be told to come
She should then put her upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the nuns squat on her heels and raise her joined palms She should then ask for the full ordination
Venerables I ask the Sangha for the full ordination
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion
For the second time Venerables I ask the Sangha for the full ordination

Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out These should be declared jointly to everyone
The nuns should be told to point out the three supports and the eight things not to be done to the newly ordained nun
On one occasion the right time for eating passed while the nuns were trying to find the right seats in the dining hall
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow eight nuns to be seated according to seniority but the rest according to their time of arrival
When they knew about
the Buddhas allowance
eight nuns reserved places everywhere according to seniority the rest getting places according to their time of arrival
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow eight nuns to be seated in the dining hall according to seniority and the rest according to their time of arrival
but not anywhere else
If a nun makes a reservation anywhere apart from the dining hall she commits an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the nuns did not do the invitation procedure
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should do the invitation procedure
If she doesnt she should be dealt with according to the rule
At that time the nuns did the invitation procedure among themselves but not with the Sangha of monks
They told the Buddha and he said
After doing the invitation procedure among the nuns a nun should do the invitation procedure with the monks
If she doesnt she should be dealt with according to the rule
All the nuns together did the invitation procedure with monks They made a racket
They told the Buddha and he said
The nuns should not do the invitation procedure all together
Any nun who does commits an offense of wrong conduct
On one occasion when the nuns did the invitation procedure before the meal they did not finish until after the time for eating
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow the nuns to do the invitation procedure after the meal
Doing the invitation procedure after the meal they did not finish until it was too late to eat
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow the nuns to do the invitation procedure among themselves on one day and with the monks on the following day
At that time the whole Sangha of nuns did the invitation procedure They made a racket
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow the nuns to appoint one capable and competent nun
to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns
She should be appointed like this
First a nun should be asked and then a competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen

At that time the nuns from the group of six traveled in vehicles
sometimes pulled by women with men inside at other times pulled by men with women inside
People complained and criticized them
Its as if theyre at the Ganges festival
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not travel in a vehicle
If she does she should be dealt with according to the rule
Soon afterwards there was a sick nun who was not able to go on foot
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow a vehicle for one who is sick
The nuns thought
A vehicle pulled by women or by men
They told the Buddha and he said
I allow a rickshaw pulled either by men or by women
Soon afterwards a certain nun was even more uncomfortable when jolted around in a vehicle
They told the Buddha and he said

At that time the courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī had gone forth with the nuns
She wanted to go to Sāvatthī
to get the full ordination in the presence of the Buddha
Some scoundrels heard
about this
and they infested the road
When Aḍḍhakāsī heard
that scoundrels had infested the road
she sent a message to the Buddha saying
I want the full ordination
What should I do
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
I allow you to give the full ordination also by messenger
They ordained with a monk as messenger
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not give the full ordination with a monk as messenger
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct

Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out These should be declared jointly to everyone
The nuns should be told to point out the three supports and the eight things not to be done to the newly ordained nun
At that time the nuns were living in the wilderness
Scoundrels raped them
They told the Buddha and he said
A nun should not live in the wilderness
If she does she commits an offense of wrong conduct

And she should be appointed like this
First a nun should be asked and then a capable and competent nun should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen

At that time the nuns being afraid of wrongdoing did not consent to men bowing down to them or to men shaving their heads cutting their nails or treating their sores

The account of Soṇa Koḷivisa
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak
At that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ruled over eighty thousand villages
And at Campā there was a prominent merchant who had a son called Soṇa Koḷivisa He had been raised in great comfort
and even had hairs growing on the soles of his feet
On one occasion because of some business King Bimbisāra had the chiefs of those eighty thousand villages gathered He then sent a message to Soṇa
asking him to come
Soṇas parents said
Soṇa the king wishes to see your feet
but dont point your feet at the King
If you just sit down crosslegged in front of the King
hell be able to see them
And they sent him away on a palanquin
Soṇa then approached King Bimbisāra bowed and sat down crosslegged in front of him
And the King saw the hairs growing on the soles of his feet
Then after instructing those eighty thousand chiefs in worldly matters the King dismissed them saying
Ive instructed you in worldly matters
Now go and visit the Buddha
He will instruct us about the afterlife
Those eighty thousand chiefs then went to the Vulture Peak
There they approached Venerable Sāgata who at that time was the Buddhas attendant
And they said to him
Venerable these eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit the Buddha
May we please see him
Well then please wait here for a moment while I announce you to the Buddha
Then while those eighty thousand chiefs were watching he sunk into the stone slab he was standing on and emerged in front of the Buddha And he said to the Buddha
Venerable Sir eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit you
Please do whatever is convenient
Well then Sāgata please prepare a seat in the shade of the dwelling
He took a stool sunk down in front of the Buddha and as those eighty thousand chiefs were watching he once more emerged from that stone slab He then prepared a seat in the shade of the dwelling
and the Buddha came out and sat down
Those eighty thousand chiefs approached the Buddha bowed and sat down
But they were preoccupied with Sāgata not with the Buddha
After reading the minds of those eighty thousand chiefs the Buddha said to Sāgata
Well then Sāgata show us more superhuman abilities more wonders of supernormal power
Saying Yes Sir he rose up into the air walked back and forth in space and he stood sat down and lay down there He emitted smoke and fire and then disappeared
After this display of supernormal powers he bowed down at the feet of the Buddha and said
Venerable Sir youre my teacher
Im your disciple
Those eighty thousand chiefs thought Its astonishing and amazing
that even a disciple should be so powerful and mighty Imagine what the teacher must be like And now they paid attention to the Buddha not to Sāgata
Having read their minds the Buddha gave those eighty thousand chiefs a progressive teaching
talk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciation
When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas
suffering its origin its end and the path
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly
so too while they were sitting right there those eighty thousand chiefs experienced the stainless vision of the Truth
Anything that has a beginning has an end
They had seen the Truth had reached understood and penetrated it they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty had attained to confidence and had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction They then said to the Buddha
Wonderful Venerable Sir wonderful
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what was hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darkness so that
those with eyes might see whats there
just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways
We go for refuge to the Buddha
to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks
Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life
The going forth of Soṇa Koḷivisa
But Soṇa thought
The way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell
Why dont I cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessness
When those eightyfour thousand chiefs had rejoiced and expressed their appreciation for the Buddhas teaching they got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him and left
Soon after they had left Soṇa approached the Buddha bowed sat down
Sir the way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell
I want to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessness
Please give me the going forth
And Soṇa received the going forth and the full ordination in the Buddhas presence
Soon after his ordination while staying in Cool Grove
Venerable Soṇa walked up and down with so much energy that his feet cracked
His walkingpath was soaked in blood as if a slaughterhouse
Then while he was in seclusion he thought
Im one of the Buddhas energetic disciples
yet my mind isnt freed from the corruptions without grasping
But my family is wealthy
Perhaps I should return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit
Just then the Buddha read Soṇas mind
And as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and appeared in Cool Grove
Soon afterwards as the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings they came to Soṇas walkingpath
The Buddha looked at it and asked the monks
Whose walkingpath is this Its soaked in blood as if a slaughterhouse
And they told him what had happened
The Buddha then approached Soṇas dwelling and sat down on a prepared seat
Soṇa bowed and sat down
and the Buddha said to him
Soṇa when you were in seclusion didnt you think
Im one of the Buddhas energetic disciples
yet my mind isnt freed from the corruptions without grasping
But my family is wealthy
Perhaps I should return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit
Yes Sir
Think about it Soṇa When you were previously a householder werent you a skilled lute player
When the strings were too tight was the lute melodious and easy to play
When the strings were too loose was the lute melodious and easy to play
But when the strings were neither too tight nor too loose but set to a balanced tension was the lute then melodious and easy to play
Just so Soṇa too much energy leads to restlessness and too little to laziness
So exert a balanced energy and discover an evenness of the spiritual faculties And that is where you should take up the meditation object
Yes Sir
Then as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Soṇa in Cool Grove and appeared on the Vulture Peak
After some time Soṇa exerted a balanced energy discovered an evenness of the spiritual faculties and that is where he took up his meditation object
He then stayed by himself secluded heedful energetic and diligent And in this very life he soon realized with his own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness
He understood that birth had come to an end that the spiritual life had been lived that the job had been done that there was no further state of existence
And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected ones
After attaining perfection Soṇa thought
Let me declare perfect insight in the presence of the Buddha
He then went to the Buddha bowed sat down
Venerable Sir a monk who is a perfected onewho has ended the corruptions lived the spiritual life done the job put down the burden realized the true goal cut the bond to existence gained release by right insighthe is committed to six things
to renunciation seclusion harmlessness the end of grasping the end of craving and nonconfusion
Some venerable here might think
No doubt this venerable is committed to renunciation because of confidence But this is the wrong way to look at it
The monk who has ended the corruptions who has lived the spiritual life and done the job doesnt see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desire He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill will He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusion
Some venerable here might think
No doubt this venerable is committed to seclusion because he desires gain honor and fame
But this is the wrong way to look at it
The monk who has ended the corruptions who has lived the spiritual life and done the job doesnt see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desire He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill will He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusion
Some venerable here might think
No doubt this venerable is committed to nonharming because he has fallen back on adhering to conduct and vows as the essence of the spiritual life
But this is the wrong way to look at it
The monk who has ended the corruptions who has lived the spiritual life and done the job doesnt see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desire He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill will He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusion
He is committed to the end of grasping to the end of craving and to nonconfusion because of the ending of sensual desire because he is without sensual desire
He is committed to the end of grasping to the end of craving and to nonconfusion because of the ending of ill will because he is without ill will
He is committed to the end of grasping to the end of craving and to nonconfusion because of the ending of confusion because he is without confusion
Sir for a monk who is fully freed in this way even if he sees compelling visual objects his mind is not overpowered by them
It remains unaffected steady and imperturbable and he observes its disappearance
Even if he hears compelling sounds
smells compelling odors
tastes compelling flavors
touches compelling material objects
or experiences compelling mental phenomena his mind is not overpowered by them
It remains unaffected steady and imperturbable and he observes its disappearance
Its just like a granite mountain a single solid mass without cracks It doesnt shake or tremble when powerful rainstorms arrive from any direction
The mind of the monk who is fully freed in this way is just like that
For the one committed to renunciation
And to seclusion of the mind
For the one committed to harmlessness
And to the end of grasping
For the one committed to the end of craving
And to nonconfusion of the mind
Having seen the arising of the senses
Their mind is fully freed
For the one who is fully freed
The monastic with a peaceful mind
There is nothing more to add
And nothing that needs to be done
Just as a single solid rock
Is unshaken by the wind
So too all visual objects and sounds
Smells tastes and material objects
And mental objects good and bad
Cannot move that kind of person
Their mind is free and steady
And they observe it as it disappears
The prohibition against sandals with doublelayered soles etc
Then the Buddha addressed the monks
Its in this way that someone from a good family declares perfect insight The matter is spoken of but the person isnt mentioned
And still some foolish men here seem to declare perfect insight just for fun Afterward they experience distress because of that
The Buddha then said to Soṇa
Soṇa you were brought up in great comfort
I allow you to use sandals with singlelayered soles
When I went forth into homelessness Sir I left behind eighty cartloads of gold coins and a group of seven elephants
If I were to walk around in sandals with singlelayered soles some people would say Soṇa left all this behind when he went forth
and now hes attached to sandals with singlelayered soles
If you allow them to the Sangha of monks I too will use them
If not I wont use them either
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks
I allow sandals with singlelayered soles
But you should not wear sandals with doublelayered soles
with triplelayered soles
or with multilayered soles
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The prohibition against what is entirely blue etc
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six wore entirely blue sandals
entirely yellow sandals
entirely red sandals
entirely magenta sandals
entirely black sandals
entirely orange sandals
and entirely beige sandals
People complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not wear sandals that are entirely blue
entirely yellow entirely red entirely magenta entirely black entirely orange or entirely beige
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals with blue straps
yellow straps red straps magenta straps black straps orange straps and beige straps
People complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
You should not wear sandals with blue straps yellow straps red straps magenta straps black straps orange straps or beige straps
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals containing leather enclosing the shin and the foot enclosing the foot stuffed with cotton looking like partridge feathers having strap fasteners made of ramhorn having strap fasteners made of goathorn decorated with scorpion claws decorated with a peacocks tailfeather and decorated in various ways
People complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
You should not wear sandals containing leather
enclosing the shin and the foot enclosing the foot stuffed with cotton looking like partridge feathers having straps fastened with ramhorn having straps fastened with goathorn having straps like scorpion claws sewn with thread like a peacocks tailfeather or decorated in various ways
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals decorated with lionskin tigerskin leopardskin deerskin otterskin catskin squirrelskin and batskin
People complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
You should not wear sandals decorated with lionskin
tigerskin leopardskin deerskin otterskin catskin squirrelskin or batskin
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The allowance for secondhand sandals with multilayered soles
After robing up one morning the Buddha took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for almsfood together with an attendant monk
As he was following behind the Buddha that monk was limping
A certain lay follower wearing sandals with multilayered soles saw the Buddha coming
He removed his sandals approached the Buddha and bowed
He then bowed to the attendant monk and asked him
Venerable why are you limping
My feet are cracked
Well then take these sandals
Thanks but the Buddha has prohibited sandals with multilayered soles
But the Buddha said Please take the sandals
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks
I allow secondhand sandals with multilayered soles
But you should not wear new sandals with multilayered soles
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The prohibition against sandals inside a monastery
On one occasion the Buddha walked up and down outside without sandals
The senior monks followed his example
but not the monks from the group of six
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six walk up and down with sandals when the Teacher and the senior monks do it without
They told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that the monks from the group of six are acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
 How can those foolish men walk up and down with sandals when the Teacher and the senior monks do it without
Even the householders who wear white are respectful and deferential toward their teachers for teaching them the profession by which they make a living
But you who have gone forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path will become notorious if you are not respectful and deferential toward your teachers your preceptors or those of an equivalent standing
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
after criticizing them 
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not walk up and down with sandals when your teachers your preceptors or those of equivalent standing do it without
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
And you should not wear sandals within a monastery
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Soon afterwards a certain monk was afflicted with corns on his feet
The monks had to hold him while he urinated and defecated
Just then as the Buddha was walking about the dwellings he saw this He approached those monks and said to them
What illness does this monk have
He has corns on his feet Sir
Thats why we do this for him
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
I allow you to wear sandals if your feet are painful or cracked or you have corns on your feet
The monks used beds and benches with dirty feet
Their robes and the furniture became dirty
When you know that you are about to use a bed or bench I allow you to wear sandals
When monks were going to the observance hall or a meeting in the dark of night they stepped on stumps and thorns hurting their feet
I allow you to wear sandals within a monastery and also to use a torch a lamp and a walking stick
The prohibition against wooden shoes etc
At one time the monks from the group of six got up early in the morning put on wooden shoes and walked up and down outside They made a loud clacking noise And they talked about all sorts of pointless things
about kings gangsters and officials about armies dangers and battles about food drink clothes and beds about garlands and perfumes about relatives vehicles villages towns and countries about women and heroes gossip about the departed about various trivialities about the world and the sea about being this or that
They stepped on and killed insects and they roused the monks from the stillness of meditation
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six act like this
They told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that the monks from the group of six are acting like this
Its true Sir 
after criticizing them 
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not wear wooden shoes
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Benares
When he eventually arrived
he stayed in the deer park at Isipatana
When the monks from the group of six knew that
the Buddha had prohibited wooden shoes
they had cuttings made from young palm trees and wore shoes made of palm leaves
Those young palm trees withered
People complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this
They are harming life with one sense faculty
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that the monks from the group of six are acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
 How can those foolish men have cuttings made from young palm trees and wear shoes made of palm leaves
when those young palm trees wither as a consequence
People regard trees as conscious
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
after criticizing them 
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not wear shoes made of palm leaves
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
When they knew that
the Buddha had prohibited shoes made of palm leaves
the monks from the group of six had cuttings made from young bamboo plants and wore shoes made of bamboo leaves
Those young bamboo plants withered
People complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this
They are harming life with one sense faculty
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
 People regard trees as conscious 
You should not wear shoes made of bamboo leaves
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Bhaddiya
When he eventually arrived
he stayed in the Jātiyā Grove
At that time the monks in Bhaddiya were fond of various kinds of nice shoes They made shoes of grass fishtailpalm leaves and wool and they had them made As a consequence they neglected recitation questioning the higher morality the higher mind and the higher wisdom
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks in Bhaddiya do this
They told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that the monks in Bhaddiya do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
 How can those foolish men be fond of various kinds of nice shoes 
and neglect recitation questioning the higher morality the higher mind and the higher wisdom
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
after criticizing them 
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not wear shoes made of grass reed fishtailpalm leaves or wool or shoes made with gold silver gems beryl crystal bronze glass tin lead or copper
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
And you should not use shoes for walking

At this time when cattle were crossing the Aciravatī river the monks from the group of six would grab them by the horns the ears the neck and the tail and they mounted their backs and motivated by lust they touched their genitals They even killed a calf by submerging it
People complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks 
Its true Sir 
after criticizing them 
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not grab cattle by the horns the ears the neck or the tail and you should not mount their backs
If you do mount their backs you commit an offense of wrong conduct
And you should not touch their genitals motivated by lust
If you do you commit a serious offense
And you should not kill a calf
If you do you should be dealt with according to the rule
The prohibition against vehicles etc
At that time the monks from the group of six traveled in vehicles sometimes pulled by women with men inside at other times pulled by men with women inside
People complained and criticized them
Its as if theyre at the Ganges festival
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not travel in a vehicle
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Soon afterwards a monk who was traveling through the Kosalan country on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī became sick
He stepped off the path and sat down at the foot of a tree
People saw him and said to him
Venerable where are you going
Im going to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha
Please come with us
I cant Im sick
Then please mount the vehicle
Thanks but the Buddha has prohibited us from traveling in vehicles And being afraid of wrongdoing he did not accept
When he arrived at Sāvatthī he told the monks what had happened
who in turn told the Buddha He said
I allow a vehicle when youre sick
The monks thought
A vehicle pulled by women or by men
I allow a rickshaw pulled by men
Soon afterwards a certain monk was even more uncomfortable when jolted around in a vehicle
I allow a palanquin and a litter
The prohibition against high and luxurious resting places
At that time the monks from the group of six used high and luxurious resting places such as
a high couch a luxurious couch a longfleeced woolen rug a multicolored woolen rug a white woolen rug a red woolen rug a quilt filled with cotton down a woolen rug decorated with the images of wild animals a woolen rug with long fleece on one side a woolen rug with long fleece on both side a sheet of silk embroidered with gems a silken sheet a woolen rug like a dancers rug an elephantback rug a horseback rug a carriageseat rug a rug made of black antelope hide an excellent rug made of kadalīdeer hide a bed with a canopy a bed with red cushions at each end
When people walking about the dwellings saw this they complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not use high and luxurious resting places such as
a high couch a luxurious couch a longfleeced woolen rug a multicolored woolen rug a white woolen rug a red woolen rug a quilt filled with cotton down a woolen rug decorated with the images of wild animals a woolen rug with long fleece on one side a woolen rug with long fleece on both side a sheet of silk embroidered with gems a silken sheet a woolen rug like a dancers rug an elephantback rug a horseback rug a carriageseat rug a rug made of black antelope hide an excellent sheet made of kadalīdeer hide a bed with a canopy or a bed with red cushions at each end
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The prohibition against all skins
Soon afterwards when the monks from the group of six knew that
the Buddha had prohibited high and luxurious resting places
they used luxurious skins lion skins tiger skins and leopard skins
They cut them to fit their beds and benches and used them both there and elsewhere
When people walking about the dwellings saw this they complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not use luxurious skins lion skins tiger skins or leopard skins
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Soon afterwards when the monks from the group of six knew that
the Buddha had prohibited luxurious skins
they used cattle hides
They cut them to fit their beds and benches and used them both there and elsewhere
At this time a certain bad monk was associating with the family of a bad lay follower
One morning that monk robed up took his bowl and robe and went to that lay followers house where he sat down on a prepared seat
That lay follower approached the monk bowed and sat down
At that time that lay follower had a beautiful young calf with variegated hide just like a young leopard
The bad monk stared at that calf
and the lay follower asked him why
He replied I want the skin of that calf
The bad lay follower then slaughtered the calf skinned it and gave the skin to the bad monk
The monk hid the skin under his upper robe and left
The mothercow longing for her calf followed behind him
When the monks asked him
why the cow was following him
he replied he did not know
But his upper robe was smeared with blood
and so the monks said
What happened to your upper robe
When he had told them what had happened
they said So did you encourage someone to kill
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can a monk encourage someone to kill Hasnt the Buddha in many ways criticized killing and praised the abstention from killing
And they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned that bad monk
Is it true monk that you encouraged someone to kill
Its true Sir 
Foolish man how can you encourage someone to kill Havent I in many ways criticized killing and praised the abstention from killing
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
after rebuking him the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
You should not make others killing
If you do you should be dealt with according to the rule
And you should not use cattle hide
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
And you should not use any kind of skin
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The allowance regarding the belongings of a householder etc
At that time peoples beds and benches were upholstered and covered with skin
Being afraid of wrongdoing the monks did not sit on them
I allow you to sit down on what belongs to a householder but not to lie down on it
But then the dwellings were held together by straps of leather
Being afraid of wrongdoing the monks did not sit down
I allow you to sit down against a mere binding made of skin
At that time the monks from the group of six entered the village wearing sandals
People complained and criticized them
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
They told the Buddha and he said
You should not enter the village wearing sandals
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Soon afterwards a certain sick monk was not able to enter the village without his sandals
I allow sick monks to enter the village while wearing sandals
The account of Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in Avantī on Papataka Hill at Kuraraghara
At that time the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa was his supporter
On one occasion Soṇa approached Mahākaccāna bowed sat down
Venerable the way I understand your teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell
I wish to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessness
Please give me the going forth
Its difficult Soṇa to live the spiritual life all ones life eating one meal a day and sleeping by oneself
So follow the instruction of the Buddhas while remaining as a householder and at suitable times you may eat one meal a day sleep by yourself and practice celibacy
As a result Soṇas intention to go forth died down
A second time Soṇa asked Mahākaccāna for the going forth but got the same response
A third time he asked for the going forth
and Mahākaccāna finally relented
At that time in the southern region of Avantī there were few monks
Only after three years with much trouble and difficulty was Mahākaccāna able to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give the full ordination to Venerable Soṇa
The making known of the five favors for Mahākaccāna
While he was in seclusion after completing the rainyseason residence Soṇa thought
Ive heard that the Buddha is like this and like that but I havent seen this for myself If my preceptor allows me I shall go and visit the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened One
When he had come out from seclusion Soṇa approached Mahākaccāna bowed sat down
and told him
what he had been thinking
Mahākaccāna said Well considered Soṇa
Please go and visit the Buddha the perfected and fully awakened one
You will see himpleasing to the eye and inspiring confidence peaceful in mind and faculties attained to the supreme subduing and calm tamed guarded and restrained in his sense faculties a great being
Then Soṇa in my name pay respect with your head at the Buddhas feet and say 
Venerable Sir my preceptor Venerable Mahākaccāna pays respect with his head at the Buddhas feet
And then say this
In the southern region of Avantī Sir there are few monks Only after three years with much trouble and difficulty was it possible to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give me the full ordination
Perhaps the Buddha will allow a smaller group of monks to give the full ordination in Avantī
In Avantī the ground is dark and hard made rough by the hooves of cattle
Perhaps the Buddha will allow sandals with multilayered soles in Avantī
In Avantī people value bathing and cleanliness
Perhaps the Buddha will allow unrestricted bathing in Avantī
In Avantī sheepskins goatskins and deerskins are used as rugs
just as are eragugrass chaffflower grass majjārugrass and jantugrass in the central Ganges plain
Perhaps the Buddha will allow sheepskins goatskins and deerskins as rugs in Avantī
At present people give robes to monks who are outside the monastic boundary saying
We give this robe to soandso
When those monks return to the monastery they are told
Suchandsuch people have given you a robe But being afraid of wrongdoing they dont accept thinking
We might commit an offense entailing relinquishment
Perhaps the Buddha will point out a way to deal with robes
Soṇa replied Yes Sir
He got up from his seat bowed down and circumambulated Mahākāccāna with his right side toward him He then put his dwelling in order took his bowl and robe and set out for Sāvatthī
When he eventually arrived he went to the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery where he approach the Buddha bowed and sat down
The Buddha said to Venerable nanda
nanda please prepare a resting place for this newly arrived monk
nanda thought
When the Buddha says this it means he wishes to stay in the same dwelling as Venerable Soṇa
And he prepared a resting place for Soṇa in the Buddhas dwelling
Then after spending much of the night outside the Buddha entered the dwelling
as did Soṇa
Rising early in the morning the Buddha said to Soṇa
Recite a teaching monk
Saying Yes Sir he chanted the entire Chapter of Eights
When he was finished the Buddha said
Well done Soṇa well done
You have learned the Chapter Eights well you have remembered it well
And you have a good voiceits clear articulate and gets the meaning across
How long have you been a monk
One year
Why did it take you so long to go forth
I have long seen the danger in worldly pleasures Still because household life is crowded and very busy I was not able to leave
Seeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utterance
Having seen the danger in the world
Knowing the Truth beyond ownership
The noble one doesnt delight in whats bad
In the bad the pure one doesnt delight
Soṇa thought
The Buddha approves of me This is the time to bring up what my preceptor said
He got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder bowed down at the Buddhas feet and said
Sir my preceptor Venerable Mahākaccāna pays respect with his head at the Buddhas feet He then repeated everything Mahākaccāna had asked him to say
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
In the southern region of Avantī there are few monks
In all outlying countries I allow the full ordination to be given by a group of five including one expert on the Monastic Law
In this regard the following are the outlying countries
In the eastern direction there is a town called Gajaṅgala with another town called Mahāsālā on the other side of it Beyond that are the outlying countries On the near side are the middle countries
In the southeastern direction there is a river called Sallavatī Beyond that are the outlying countries On the near side are the middle countries
In the southern direction there is a town called Setakaṇṇika Beyond that are the outlying countries On the near side are the middle countries
In the western direction there is a brahmin village called Thūṇa Beyond that are the outlying countries On the near side are the middle countries
In the northern direction there is a mountain called Usīraddhaja Beyond that are the outlying countries On the near side are the middle countries
In Avantī the ground is dark and hard made rough by the hooves of cattle
In all outlying countries I allow sandals with multilayered soles
In Avantī people value bathing and cleanliness
In all outlying countries I allow unrestricted bathing
In Avantī sheepskins goatskins and deerskins are used as rugs
just as are eragugrass chaffflower grass majjārugrass and jantugrass in the central Ganges plain
In all outlying countries I allow rugs of sheepskin goatskin and deerskin
And it may happen that people give robes to monks who are outside the monastic boundary saying 
We give this robe to soandso
I allow you to accept it and not start counting the days until you have the robe in your hand

In this chapter there are sixtythree topics

The eighth chapter on proper conduct is finished
In this chapter there are nineteen topics and fourteen kinds of proper conduct
If you do not fulfill the proper conduct
Then you do not fulfill your virtue
If your virtue is impure you are weak in wisdom
And you do not know the unity of mind
A mind distracted not unified
Does not see the truth of nature
Not seeing the truth of nature
You are not released from suffering
But if you do fulfill the proper conduct
Then you also fulfills your virtue
If your virtue is pure you are possessed of wisdom
And you know the unity of mind
A nondistracted mind unified
Sees the truth of nature
Seeing the truth of nature
You are released from suffering
So fulfill the proper conduct
you the Son of the Conqueror possessed of insight
The instruction of the Buddha the best
Go from that to extinguishment in this way

The legal procedure of condemnation
Homage to the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened One
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka were quarrelsome argumentative and creators of legal issues in the Sangha They approached other monks who were also quarrelsome argumentative and creators of legal issues in the Sangha and said to them
Dont let him beat you
Argue back forcefully
Youre wiser more competent more learned and more capable than he
Dont be afraid of him
Well take your side
Because of that new quarrels started and existing quarrels became worse
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka act like this
They told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true that the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
Its not suitable for those foolish men its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How can they act like this
so that new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it
but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds
The Buddha then spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain in dispraise of great desires discontent socializing and laziness but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain of fewness of wishes contentment selfelimination ascetic practices serenity reduction in things and of being energetic After giving a teaching on what is right and proper he addressed the monks
Well then monks the Sangha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka
And this is how it should be done
First you should accuse the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka They should then be reminded of what they have done before they are charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome argumentative and creators of legal issues in the Sangha They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome argumentative and creators of legal issues in the Sangha and they say to them
Dont let him beat you
Argue back forcefully
Youre wiser more competent more learned and more capable than he
Dont be afraid of him
Well take your side
Because of this new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome argumentative
and creators of legal issues in the Sangha
They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome argumentative and creators of legal issues in the Sangha and they say to them
Dont let him beat you
Argue back forcefully
Youre wiser more competent more learned and more capable than he
Dont be afraid of him
Well take your side
Because of this new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse
The Sangha does a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
For the second time I speak on this matter
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome argumentative

And this is how it should be lifted
After approaching the Sangha the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should put their upper robes over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the senior monks squat on their heels raise their joined palms and say
Venerables the Sangha has done a legal procedure of condemnation against us but we have conducted ourselves properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released We ask for the legal procedure of condemnation to be lifted
And they should ask a second
and a third time

The first section on the legal procedure of condemnation is finished
The legal procedure of demotion
At that time Venerable Seyyasaka was ignorant and incompetent often committing offenses and incapable of determining whether he had committed an offense
And he was constantly and improperly socializing with householders
Moreover the monks regularly gave him probation sent him back to the beginning gave him trial periods and rehabilitated him
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Seyyasaka go on like this
And they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks

How can he constantly and improperly socialize with householders
Moreover how can it be that the monks regularly give him probation send him back to the beginning gave him trial periods and rehabilitate him
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
after criticizing him 
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then the Sangha should do a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka
instructing him to live with formal support
And this is how it should be done
First you should accuse the monk Seyyasaka He should then be reminded of what he has done before he is charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha

Soon the Sangha did a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka
instructing him to live with formal support
Then by associating with good friends by having them recite and by questioning them he became learned and a master of the tradition he became an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries he became knowledgeable and competent had a sense of conscience and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training
And he conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released He then went to the monks
and told them about this
adding What should I do now
The monks told the Buddha
Well then lift that legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka

And this is how it should be lifted
After approaching the Sangha the monk Seyyasaka should put his upper robes over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the senior monks squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
Venerables the Sangha has done a legal procedure of demotion against me but I have conducted myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released I ask for the legal procedure of demotion to be lifted
And he should ask a second
and a third time
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha

The second section on the legal procedure of demotion is finished
The legal procedure of banishment
At one time Assaji and Punabbasuka were the resident monks at Kīṭāgiri They were bad and shameless
They were misbehaving in this way
They planted flowering trees watered and plucked them and then tied the flowers together They made the flowers into garlands garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides They made flower arrangements wreaths ornaments for the head ornaments for the ears and ornaments for the chest And they had others do the same
They then took these things or sent them to the women the daughters the girls the daughtersinlaw and the female slaves of good families
They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels They sat on the same seats as them and they lay down on the same beds on the same sheets under the same covers both on the same sheets and under the same covers They ate at the wrong time drank alcohol and wore garlands perfumes and cosmetics They danced sang played instruments and performed
While the women were dancing singing playing instruments and performing so would they
They played various games board games with eight and ten rows imaginary board games hopscotch spillikins dice games tipcat paintingwiththehand games ball games toypipe games toyplow games turning somersaults toywindmill games toymeasure games toycarriage games toybow games letterguessing games thoughtguessing games games of mimicking deformities
They trained in elephant riding in horsemanship in carriage riding in archery in swordsmanship
And they ran in front of elephants in front of horses and in front of carriages and they ran backwards and forwards
They whistled clapped their hands wrestled and boxed
They spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girls
Dance here Sister
and they made gestures of approval
And they misbehaved in a variety of ways
Just then a certain monk who had completed the rains residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at Kīṭāgiri
In the morning he robed up took his bowl and robe and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfood He was pleasing in the way he entered and returned in looking at and in looking away in bending and stretching out his arms his eyes were lowered and he was perfect in deportment
When people saw him they said
Who is this acting like a fool like a dullard continuously frowning
Who will give almsfood to him
Almsfood should instead be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka for they are gentle congenial pleasant to speak with greeting one with a smile welcoming friendly open the first to speak
A certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in Kīṭāgiri
He approached him bowed and said
Venerable have you received any almsfood
No I havent
Come lets go to my house
He took that monk to his house and gave him a meal
Where are you going Venerable
Im going to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha
Well then would you please pay respect at the feet of the Buddha in my name and say
Venerable Sir the monastery in Kīṭāgiri has been corrupted
The bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are staying there
They are misbehaving like this
They plant flowering trees water them 
And they misbehave in a variety of ways
Those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it
and there is no longer any support for the Sangha
The good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on
Please send monks to stay at the monastery in Kīṭāgiri
The monk consented got up and left for Sāvatthī
When he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī he went to the Buddha in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery He bowed to the Buddha and sat down
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks
the Buddha said to him
I hope you are keeping well monk I hope youre comfortable
I hope youre not tired from traveling
And where have you come from
Im keeping well Venerable Sir Im comfortable
Im not tired from traveling
He then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiri
and finished by saying Thats where Ive come from
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are misbehaving like this at Kīṭāgiri
And is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it
that there is no longer any support for the Sangha
and that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
Its not suitable 
How can those foolish men misbehave like this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
after criticizing them 
he gave a teaching and addressed Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Moggallāna
Sāriputta the two of you should go and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from Kīṭāgiri They are your students
Sir how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from Kīṭāgiri They are temperamental and harsh
Well then take many monks
And this is how it should be done
First you should accuse the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka They should then be reminded of what they have done before they are charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
These monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behaved
Their bad behavior is seen and heard about
and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard about
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should do a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri
prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
These monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behaved
Their bad behavior is seen and heard about
and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard about
The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of banishing them
prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
For the second time I speak on this matter 
For the third time I speak on this matter
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
These monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behaved
Their bad behavior is seen and heard about
and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard about
The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of banishing them
prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has done the legal procedure of banishing Assaji and Punabbasuka
prohibiting them from staying at Kīṭāgiri
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus

Soon afterwards a sangha of monks headed by Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Moggallāna went to Kīṭāgiri and did the legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka
prohibiting them from staying at Kīṭāgiri
After the Sangha had done the procedure those monks did not conduct themselves properly or suitably so as to deserve to be released
nor did they ask the monks for forgiveness Instead they abused and reviled them
and they slandered them as acting from desire ill will confusion and fear
And they left and they disrobed
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
When the Sangha has done a legal procedure of banishing them how can these monks act like this
They told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that when the Sangha had done a procedure of banishing them the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka acted like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them 
Its not suitable

The legal procedure of reconciliation
At one time Venerable Sudhamma was the resident monk at the householder Cittas monastery at Macchikāsaṇḍa He was in charge of the building work and received a regular supply of food
When Citta wanted to invite the Sangha a group of monks or an individual monk he would not do so without getting permission from Sudhamma
On one occasion a number of senior monksVenerable Sāriputta Venerable Mahāmoggallāna Venerable Mahākaccāna Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika Venerable Mahākappina Venerable Mahācunda Venerable Anuruddha Venerable Revata Venerable Upāli Venerable nanda Venerable Rāhulawere wandering in Kāsī when they arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa
When Citta heard that they had arrived
he went to them bowed and sat down
After Sāriputta had instructed inspired and gladdened Citta with a teaching
Citta said
Venerables please accept a meal for new arrivals from me tomorrow
And they accepted by remaining silent
When he knew that they had accepted Citta got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated them with his right side toward them and went to Sudhamma He bowed to him
Venerable please accept tomorrows meal from me together with the senior monks
Sudhamma thought
Previously when Citta wanted to invite the Sangha a group of monks or an individual monk he would not do so without getting permission from me
But now he has invited the senior monks without my permission
Hes been corrupted this Citta Hes uninterested and has no affection for me He said to Citta
theres no need I wont accept
Citta asked him a second
and a third time
but got the same reply
He thought
What difference does it make to me whether Sudhamma accepts or not He then bowed down circumambulated Sudhamma with his right side toward him and left
The following morning Citta prepared various kinds of fine food for the senior monks
Sudhamma thought
Let me go and see what Citta has prepared for the senior monks He then robed up took his bowl and robe and went to Cittas house where he sat down on a prepared seat
Citta approached Sudhamma bowed and sat down
And Sudhamma said to him
You have prepared many kinds of fine food
But theres one thats missing sesame cookies
When there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha Sir you speak of sesame cookies
Formerly there were some traders from the south who went to an eastern country to trade
From there they brought back a hen
That hen mated with a crow
and because of that she had a chick
When that chick wanted to caw like a crow it cried cawcadoodledoo
And when that chick wanted to crow like a rooster it cried cockadoodlecaw
In the same way when there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha you speak of sesame cookies
Householder youre abusing and insulting me
I will leave your monastery
Im not abusing and insulting you
Please stay at Macchikāsaṇḍa
The mango grove is delightful
Ill do my best to supply you with robes almsfood a dwelling and medicines
Sudhamma repeated what he had said a second time and Citta responded as before
When Sudhamma repeated it a third time
Citta said Where will you go
Ill go to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha
Well then please tell the Buddha of our entire conversation
And I would not be surprised if you returned to Macchikāsaṇḍa
Sudhamma put his dwelling in order took his bowl and robe and left for Sāvatthī
When he eventually arrived he went to the Buddha in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery He bowed to the Buddha sat down
and told him about the conversation he had had with Citta
The Buddha rebuked him
Its not suitable foolish man its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How can you demean and insult Citta who has faith and confidence who is a donor and benefactor and a supporter of the Sangha
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
after rebuking him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then do a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma
instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness
And it should be done like this
First you should accuse the monk Sudhamma He should then be reminded of what he has done before he is charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Sudhamma has demeaned and insulted the householder Citta who has faith and confidence who is a donor and benefactor and a supporter of the Sangha
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should do a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma
instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen

Soon afterwards the Sangha did a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma
instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness
He went to Macchikāsaṇḍa but feeling humiliated he was unable to ask Citta for forgiveness
He returned to Sāvatthī
The monks asked him
if he had asked Citta for forgiveness
and he told them what had happened
The monks told the Buddha He had the monks gathered and said
Well then the Sangha should give a companion messenger to Sudhamma
to ask Citta for forgiveness
And this is how the messenger should be given
First you should ask a monk and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give monk soandso to Sudhamma as a companion messenger to ask Citta for forgiveness
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen

Any monk who approves of giving monk soandso to Sudhamma as a companion messenger to ask Citta for forgiveness should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has given monk soandso to Sudhamma as a companion messenger to ask Citta for forgiveness
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
Sudhamma should now go to Macchikāsaṇḍa with that monk as a companion messenger to ask Citta for forgiveness saying
Please forgive me householder I wish to reconcile with you
If he forgives all is well
If not the companion messenger should say
Please forgive this monk householder he wishes to reconcile with you
If he forgives all is well
If not the companion messenger should say
Please forgive this monk householder I wish to reconcile with you
If he forgives all is well
If not the companion messenger should say
Please forgive this monk householder I ask in the name of the Sangha
If he forgives all is well
If not then within sight and hearing of Citta the monk Sudhamma should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and confess that offense
Soon afterwards Sudhamma went to Macchikāsaṇḍa with a monk as a companion messenger and he asked Citta for forgiveness
And he conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released He then went to the monks
and told them about this
adding What should I do now

The legal procedure of ejection for not recognizing an offense
At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghositas Monastery
At that time Venerable Channa had committed an offense but refused to recognize it
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Channa commit an offense but then refuse to recognize it
They told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that Channa is acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized him
Its not suitable 
How can Channa commit an offense but then refuse to recognize it
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
and after criticizing him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting the monk Channa for not recognizing an offense
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha
And this is how it should be done
First you should accuse the monk Channa He should then be reminded of what he has done before he is charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha

The legal procedure of ejection for not making amends for an offense
At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghositas Monastery
At this time Venerable Channa had committed an offense but refused to make amends for it
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Channa commit an offense but then refuse to make amends for it
They told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that Channa is acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized him
Its not suitable 
How can Channa commit an offense but then refuse to make amends for it
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
and after criticizing him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting the monk Channa for not making amends for an offense
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha
And this is how it should be done
First you should accuse the monk Channa He should then be reminded of what he has done before he is charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen

The sixth section on the legal procedure of ejection for not making amends for an offense is finished
The legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the monk Ariṭṭha the exvulturekiller had the following bad and erroneous view
As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them
A number of monks heard that Ariṭṭha had that view
They went to him
and asked
Is it true Ariṭṭha that you have such a view
Yes indeed As I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them
No Ariṭṭha
dont misrepresent the Buddha
for its not good to misrepresent him
The Buddha would never say such a thing
The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive
and how they obstruct one who indulges in them
The Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greater
The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton
similar to a piece of meat
similar to a grass torch
similar to a pit of coals
similar to a dream
similar to borrowed goods
similar to fruits on a tree
similar to a knife and chopping block
similar to swords and stakes
and similar to a snakes head they are much suffering and much trouble and the danger in them is greater
But even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha in this way he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view and continued to insist on it
And since they were not able to make him give up that view they approached the Buddha and told him what had happened
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Ariṭṭha
Is it true Ariṭṭha that you have a bad and erroneous view such as this
As I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them
Yes indeed Sir
Foolish man whom do you think I have taught like this
Havent I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive
and how they obstruct one who indulges in them
I have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greater
I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton 
similar to a piece of meat 
similar to a grass torch 
similar to a pit of coals 
similar to a dream 
similar to borrowed goods 
similar to fruits on a tree 
similar to a knife and chopping block 
similar to swords and stakes 
similar to a snakes head they are much suffering and much trouble and the danger in them is greater
And yet by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me hurt yourself and made much demerit
This will be for your longlasting harm and suffering
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
and after rebuking him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha
And this is how it should be done
First you should accuse the monk Ariṭṭha He should then be reminded of what he has done before he is charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Ariṭṭha the exvulturekiller has the following bad and erroneous view
As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them
He is not giving up that view
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Ariṭṭha the exvulturekiller has the following bad and erroneous view

The fortythree kinds of conduct
A monk who has had a legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view done against himself should conduct himself properly
This is the proper conduct
He should not give the full ordination
He should not give formal support
He should not have a novice monk attend on him
He should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nuns
Even if appointed he should not instruct the nuns
He should not commit the same offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view

Soon afterwards the Sangha did a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha
He then disrobed
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How could the monk Ariṭṭha disrobe after the Sangha had done a legal procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view
The monks told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that the monk Ariṭṭha disrobed after the Sangha had done a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized him 
Its not suitable 
How can that fool disrobe after the Sangha has done a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
after criticizing him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then the Sangha should lift that legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view
The group of fortythree on not to be lifted

And monks this is how it should be lifted

The seventh section on the legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view is finished
The first chapter on legal procedures is finished
In this chapter there are seven topics
The chapter on legal procedures is finished
This I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near rāvastī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍadas  monastery
together with a great Community of monks with twelvehundred and fifty monks
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
I will teach you monks about conditional origination from the beginning and its analysis
listen to it apply your minds thoroughly and well and I will speak
What is conditional origination from the beginning
This being so that is beginning with the arising of this that arises
thus with ignorance as condition there are volitional processes
with volitional processes as condition consciousness
with consciousness as condition mind and body
with mind as condition and body the six sensespheres
with the six sense spheres as condition contact
with contact as condition feeling
with feeling as condition craving
with craving as condition attachment
with attachment as condition continuation
with continuation as condition birth
with birth as condition old age death grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all arise
and so there is an origination of this whole great mass of suffering
This is called conditional origination from the beginning
What is its analysis
With ignorance as condition there are volitional processes what is ignorance
Not knowing the past not knowing the future not knowing the past and the future
not knowing the internal not knowing the external not knowing the internal and the external
not knowing what are volitional actions not knowing results not knowing volitional actions and their results
not knowing the Buddha not knowing the Teaching not knowing the Community
not knowing suffering not knowing origination not knowing cessation not knowing the path
not knowing causes not knowing the origination of causes in things
not knowing what is wholesome and unwholesome blameworthy and blameless what should be practiced and what should not be practiced
not knowing the despicable and the excellent the black and the white those things that are a part of conditional origination
again not knowing the comprehending of the six spheres of contact as they really are
not knowing here and now things as they really are
not seeing not penetrating darkness complete delusion blind ignorance
This is called ignorance
What are volitional processes
There are these three volitional processes bodily volitional processes verbal volitional processes mental volitional processes
With volitional processes as condition consciousness what is consciousness
There is a group of six consciousnesses eyeconsciousness ear nose tongue body and mindconsciousness
With consciousness as condition mind and bodily form what is mind
The four formless constituent groups
Which four
The feelings constituent group the perceptions constituent group the volitional processes constituent group the consciousness constituent group
What is bodily form
Whatever bodily form there is all of that is made of the four great elements
Attachment to the four great elements this is bodily form
This simply and in short is what is called mind and bodily form
With mind as condition and body the six sensespheres what are the six sensespheres
The six internal sensespheres the internal eyesensesphere
the internal ear nose tongue body and mindsensespheres
With the six sense spheres as condition contact what is contact
There is a group of six contacts eyecontact
ear nose tongue body and mindcontact
With contact as condition feeling what is feeling
There are three feelings pleasant unpleasant and neitherpleasantnorunpleasant
With feeling as condition craving what is craving
There are three cravings craving for the senserealm craving for the formrealm and craving for the formlessrealm
With craving as condition attachment what is attachment
There are four attachments attachment to sense pleasures attachment to views
attachment to virtue and practice attachment to selftheories
With attachment as condition continuation what is continuation
There are three continuations continuation in the senserealm continuation in the formrealm continuation in the formlessrealm
With continuation as condition birth what is birth
For the various beings in the various classes of beings
there is birth being born appearing turning up manifestation
the acquisition of the constituent parts of mind and body the acquisition of the elements
the acquisition of the sensespheres the turning up of the constituents of mind and body the manifestation of the life faculty
With birth as condition old age and death what is old age
Whatever baldness greying hair wrinkled skin agedness bentness
crooked warped twisted aging hangingbodiliness
rheumatic pains in the body forward bending of the body
propping up on crutches indisposition slowness
dwindling away complete dwindling away decay of the sense faculties
breaking up of the processes elderliness decrepitude
This is called oldage
What is death
For the various beings in the various classes of beings
there is a fall a falling away an internal dwindling away a dwindling away of the lifespan
a dwindling away of the vital heat a cessation of the lifefaculty
a throwing off of the constituent parts a death a making of time
This is called death
This death together with the former oldage
these two together are in short what is called oldage and death
This is what is called the analysis of conditional origination
I will teach you monks about conditional origination from the beginning and its analysis is what was said to you
and this is what was said in reply
The Fortunate One said this
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in the Fortunate Ones words
The lord of great compassion for the benefit of all living creatures
having fulfilled all the perfections has attained supreme and Complete Awakening
By this declaration of the truth may you have the blessing of success

Warding off all unlucky stars yakkhas bhūtas and evil planets
by the power of this safeguard may all their adversities end
The Sun who was seized by Rāhu was released by that safeguards power
the destruction of fear of all foes we will recite that safeguard
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then at that time the Sun god
was seized by the asura lord Rāhu
Then the Sun god recollecting the Fortunate One
on that occasion recited this verse
Reverence to you Buddhahero you who are free in every way
I am being obstructed therefore please be a refuge to me
Then with reference to the Sun god the Fortunate One
addressed the asura lord Rāhu with a verse
To the Realised One the Worthy One the Sun has gone for refuge
you must release the Sun Rāhu For the Buddhas pity the world
He who in complete darkness is a lightmaker
who is brilliant a great circle of fire
do not devour he who roams the sky Rāhu
Release the Sun who is my kinsman Rāhu
Then the asura lord Rāhu having released the Sun god
hurriedly approached the asura lord Vepacitti
and after approaching anxious and horrified he stood on one side
While he was standing on one side the asura lord Vepacitti recited this verse to the asura lord Rāhu
Why did you so hurriedly release the Sun god Rāhu
After coming here why do you stand there like someone anxious and frightened
My head will split into seven while living I will have no happiness
 I am one to whom the Buddha has chanted a verse  if I do not release the Sun
Thus I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then at that time in the brahmin Aggikabhāradvājas
residence the sacrificial fire was burning and the offering had been taken up
Then as the Fortunate One was going from house to house for alms in Sāvatthī
he approached the brahmin Aggikabhāradvājas residence
The brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja saw
the Fortunate One coming from afar
and having seen him he said this to the Fortunate One
Right there shaveling Right there little ascetic
Right there outcaste Halt
After this was said the Fortunate One said this to the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja
But do you know brahmin
what an outcaste is or what things make one an outcaste
I certainly do not know reverend Gotama
what an outcaste is or what things make one an outcaste
It would be good for me if the reverend Gotama would preach the Dhamma
so that I may know what an outcaste is and what things make one an outcaste
Then listen brahmin apply your mind well and I will speak
Yes reverend the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja
replied to the Fortunate One and the Fortunate One said this
That man who is angry who has enmity is bad and insolent
who has wrong views and is deceitful he one should know as an outcaste
Whether once born or twice born he who is violent to creatures here
who has no sympathy with creatures he one should know as an outcaste
He who beseiges and destroys villages and market towns
who is well known as an oppressor he one should know as an outcaste
He who whether in the village or the wilderness takes by theft what is not given
those things loved by others he one should know as an outcaste
He who has taken on a debt and when pressed to pay it runs away
saying There is no debt due to you he one should know as an outcaste
He who desiring a trifle after slaying a person going
along the path takes that trifle he one should know as an outcaste
That man who for his own sake for the sake of others or for wealth
when asked to bear witness speaks falsely he one should know as an outcaste
He who is seen misbehaving with the wives of friends or relatives
whether forcibly or with consent he one should know as an outcaste
He who when his mother or father has grown old with their youth gone
though having much does not support them he one should know as an outcaste
He who strikes or annoys with words his mother or father
brother or sister or motherinlaw he one should know as an outcaste
He who when he is asked what is good teaches that which is not good
who conceals things when he gives advice he one should know as an outcaste
He who having done a bad deed longs thus May they not know about me
he who conceals what he is doing he one should know as an outcaste
He who having gone to anothers family and eaten good food
does not return the honour when his benefactor comes he one should know as an outcaste
He who deceives a brahmin or an ascetic or another mendicant
with words that are false he one should know as an outcaste
He who annoys with words a brahmin or an ascetic when mealtime is at hand
and does not give him food he one should know as an outcaste
He who speaks to those who are bad here being entangled by delusion
because of coveting a trifle he one should know as an outcaste
He who speaks and extols himself and yet despises another
who is debased through his own conceit he one should know as an outcaste
He who is annoying stingy who has bad longings is selfish crafty
unconscientious and shameless he one should know as an outcaste
He who abuses a Buddha or else one of his disciples
a wanderer or a householder he one should know as an outcaste
He who not being a Worthy One claims that he is a Worthy One
is a thief in the world with its brahmās he is the worst of the outcastes
These indeed are said to be outcastes those whom I have explained to you
One is not an outcaste by birth by birth one is not a brahmin
by deeds one becomes an outcaste one becomes a brahmin by deeds
You can know it also by this as I give you this example
Sopaka an untouchables son was renowned as Mātaṅga
This Mātaṅga attained the highest repute which was very hard to obtain
and many nobles and brahmins came to attend on him
He ascended the way going to the gods that dustfree great path
and having put away sensual desire he went to the brahma worlds
Birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the brahma worlds
Brahmins though born in a family of scholars and acquainted with the lore
are continuously to be seen doing deeds that are bad
Reproachable in this life in the next life they have an unhappy destiny
Birth does not prevent reproach or an unhappy destiny
One is not an outcaste by birth by birth one is not a brahmin
by deeds one becomes an outcaste one becomes a brahmin by deeds
After this was said the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent reverend Gotama Excellent reverend Gotama
Just as reverend Gotama one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness
so that one who has eyes can see forms
just so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one way
I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
Please bear it in mind reverend Gotama that I am a lay disciple
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life
What a blessing is was thought about by gods and men for twelve years
but they did not attain true safety the thirtyeight blessings
which were preached by the god of gods make all that is bad perish
For the whole worlds benefit and welfare we will recite that safeguard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then a certain god towards the end of the night
whose surpassing beauty lit up the whole of Jetas Wood
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood on one side
While standing on one side that god addressed the Fortunate One with a verse
Many are the gods and the men who have thought about the blessings
hoping for safety now please say what is the supreme blessing
Not associating with fools but associating with the wise
honouring those worthy of honour this is the supreme blessing
Living in a suitable place formerly having done good deeds
aspiring in a right way oneself this is the supreme blessing
Having great learning and craft and being disciplined and well trained
and whatever words are well spoken this is the supreme blessing
Attendance on ones mother and father looking after ones wife and children
with works that are not agitating this is the supreme blessing
